1,"Ok, so. I used to be in a school district with a friend I had for years. He had gotten depressed and told me some serious stuff about it too. But I just couldn't really deal with him anymore. We didn't connect, I drifted towards other things in my life, sports or newer friends. Meanwhile he stayed the exact same. He either was really annoying or just always bringing the mood down.  We would be having fun, then he would bring the mood down so hard. We weren't that similar anymore, it felt like a bad match. It's been a long time since I talked to him, I switched school districts. At first I used the excuse that i couldn't contact him online. I know he's fine because my old friends still talk to me. Should I leave what's done done or try to at least apologize to him. I feel so bad that everytime I think of it I get a pit in my stomach. Just need some advice from someone online.",15Apr2019,1
2,"Ok so, I need some advice on how to end or move away from this person.  

So I’m currently (kinda) friends with a person. They are very negative and I does bring down my mood. They are just overall not a great person to be around. However we met when we were young before this person became this way.  They do have mental illnesses and I worry that If I confront this person they will do something I may never forgive myself for. I’ve already taken some steps like not talking to them as much and not hanging around them as much. However, I go to a small school and it is difficult to get away from them. Along with this, we are in the same friend group and it’s difficult to hang out with other people. (Like I said it’s a small school and everyone knows everyone.) 

I’m just not sure how to cut ties with them... any suggestions?",15Apr2019,1

4,"Hey all. I am currently house-sitting/pet-watching for the owners of the place I work at. They have left the country and will be gone for the next week and a half.

They have told me to make myself at home and invite over friends. They trust me and know I am responsible so they have giving me free reign on a lot of things.

Well, I invited my boyfriend over. (We both arrived in different cars.) As he was parking into the driveway, he went to stop, but then didn’t? (I guess he thought he put it in neutral?) And at like less than 4MPH ran into their garage door. I watched and yelled at him to stop, very confused on what he was doing. He did very quickly after slowly pushing into the door. It seems like a genuine accident, but to say the least, I’m livid with him.

Nothing inside the garage is damaged (there were two cars behind the door). The door itself is bent, but not terribly. He hit the door at the very left, so there is a weird fold in that section, but that section only. I noticed two bearings/bolts that popped out that I assume help the door climb up when it’s being opened.

Anyway, I’m no garage expert, so I don’t know if the damage is severe. From a visual aspect, it doesn’t look terrible. Nonetheless, I feel terrible, and I’ve been crying trying to figure out what I need to do. 

Since they are out of the country, should I try to call them ASAP so that the claim be filed ASAP? Or is something like this okay to wait until they come back? I don’t think they will be upset, they are very easy going people, but I am very upset with myself for allowing the possibility to happen by asking my dumbass SO to come over. I feel miserable that they trusted me to not allow something so stupid to happen. I told my SO he would be completely responsible for any and all financial repairs if need be, and he of course is okay with that.

TLDR; boyfriend backed into the garage door of the people I’m house sitting for and they are out of the country.",15Apr2019,6

I get stomach pains


Here comes the horrible hurricane.

7,"Since I was a kid I’ve always been a bad loser. Whenever I lost in sports or other outside games, I’d quit on the spot or find a way to quit playing. Whenever I lose on video games or get stuck in a match where winning isn’t possible, I leave the match immediately. If I don’t think I’m likely to succeed or something goes wrong in an endeavour, I usually back out. 

In short I’ve always found losing to be boring &amp; extremely distressing. 

It’s becoming more of a problem because it’s only got worse as I’ve got older. Whenever I lose in a video game, let’s say I die &amp; lose all experience points in Minecraft, which locks me out of using enchantments, I’m suddenly plagued with a spontaneous &amp; extreme amount of boredom &amp; lose all motivation to keep playing. Rather than getting angry &amp; slowly building up to a rage quit like I did in my teens &amp; early twenties, I just stop on the spot &amp; turn the console off or set the controller down. A lot of times I never return to those games/servers either because that feeling of crushing boredom starts to resurface when I recall losing.

It’s killing my interests &amp; I’m not sure how to proceed with it. How does one stop being a bad loser, if that’s even possible?",15Apr2019,1
8,"So this is more of a vent/asking for advice/idk what to do.
Backstory my son is 19 months old and I am still dealing with PPD horribly. I had to go back to work 1 month post partum and it’s just been a really hard time for me. 
Two months ago I think my husband had finally had it with me (after convincing from his mother) to leave me and our son. He left the country and hasn’t even attempted to see how I or my son is doing (he’ll message one of my friends once every two weeks to ask if he’s seen my son around). 
It’s putting so much stress on me. I honestly feel like since he’s left the PPD has gotten worse. 
I look at his social media accounts and he’s already moved on, talking to different girls, not a single mention of me or my son. He posts how his mom is telling him to find a girlfriend and just really immature things that I know are jabs to hurt me. I’m tired, I’m stressed, and I’m not being the best mom I can be right now to my son.",15Apr2019,1
9,Over the last two days I’ve been having heart palpitations and it’s currently they’re pretty strong. I’m getting them about 3 every 15 seconds. I’m a little concerned because it doesn’t feel good and I feel a little short of breath sometimes when it happens. For reference I’m 18 with no history of heart problems except one time where my blood pressure dropped a lot and I almost passed out but that was almost a year ago. I’ve also been going to the gym for the last few weeks.,15Apr2019,4
10,"So last year April I met a girl and absolutely fell in love with her. She was married and I was married but we instantly felt something between us that we both never get before. It was undeniable. We started talking and hit it off like it was a movie! After talking for a while I found out that she used to be a stripper, not fully nude, only topless. She said she like the atmosphere, knowing the people she worked with had her back and obviously the money. About two month to three months she moved in with me and asked if I would be okay with her becoming a stripper, I told her no because I don’t think that its appropriate for her to make money that way. It’s wrong to me, she understood and moved on. She asked me about 2 more moths later and I told her the same thing. Couple more months in I started my divorce (it should be stated that both our marriages were already dead we just hadn’t filed the paperwork yet). I got my divorce and she started hers as well. We found out she was pregnant early this year and now she asked me again and said she wants to become a stripper after she has the baby because she wants to get back in shape and the money would be nice and help out. Mind you, we are not struggling as it is, we pay all of our bills on time and eat out often and still save $700 a month easily. What do I do or say. Am I wrong for feeling the way I do.",15Apr2019,1
11,"This summer during May I’m going to Paris and London for the first time ( first in the family). This is going to be around Mother’s Day, and I wanted to get something from there. I want to get her something extra special because of how good of a mother she has been to me. The problem lies in that I’m a college student and I don’t have a lot of money.

I’m not sure as to what to do because I’m quite freaked out but feel as though I should wait a week or so to see if it goes? My family is asleep so I have no one to talk to about my little discovery.

13,"I know it sounds silly, but whenever someone expresses their extreme opinion i get agitated.  

For instance, when someone says that they do not like black people, or when someone says that all ""n-words"" should die, or when someone says that people who watch cartoons are trash. These are the kind of opinions that get to me, and i know that most people aren't ironic about these.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'll admit i'm a cynical person, so its hard for me to not get offended over this, but i don't want to cause for me its unnecessary, and whoever says these opinions (most of the time) want to get a rise out of others.

14,"I’m currently in year 12 and recently have not been motivated to continue with school. The thought of finishing school later this year unsure of what I want to do at University is bothering me, especially considering that I will have to continue my education for a further 3-4 years studying at University whilst also incurring debt that I will be paying back well into my 30’s. I’m not a bad student, my grades are actually pretty good, it’s just that I don’t want to continue with high school for the next 7 months and would rather leave now and chase a different career path. 

If I were to leave school, I’d start training to become either a plumber/electrician.
I haven’t spoke to my parents about my thoughts as I’m not sure how they would respond. I imagine them being supportive of my decision however telling me to finish year 12 and then pursue whatever career path I feel is best. I have considered finishing school however as mentioned above, I’m just simply not motivated to continue on with year 12. 

I’m also concerned with disappointing my grandparents as they never had a proper education growing up and have always told me how privileged I am and how they wish they could have had the same opportunity. They have always supported me with school and think that I am really smart (as most grandparents do with their grandchildren) and I feel that by deciding to leave school they will think that I am wasting my ‘talents’ and will be a failure in life. They would never admit this as my grandparents would never want to put me down,  but I know they would be thinking this.

I need some advice from different people as I am in a really tricky position as to what I should do next. I appreciate anyone’s input on my situation as it can only help, thanks.",15Apr2019,3
15,"Greetings Reddit!

Intro:

It’s my first time actually writing out a post. I’ve lurked on reddit for a long time, and it seems like for the majority, most people are pretty nice on this website. I’m coming to you today for an opportunity to help clear my head, as well as receive some input.

Backstory:

Growing up I always had issues with girls. I wasn’t in the best physical condition, and I was such a nice guy during the angsty teenage years, that I was emotionally abused and manipulated by others quite often. This definitely evolved into trust issues. These trust issues made me a little insecure when it came to women, as I had this sense of needing to be in control, as well as know where we stand at all times. 

Since then I’ve grown up a little bit (21M) become more focused on myself, and truly only do things that make me happy. I’m now attending a four-year university, and plan to graduate by next year. It’s my first semester at this University, and I’ve already had a few different encounters with women. (Genuine, not hookups) - and most of them fell through simply because I found myself incompatible, and also found them unreliable. I really was just having a lot of trouble opening myself up again, due to my past. (That’s bullshit, I know.. but it’s real.) 

Anyway, I met this girl in my class. Let’s call her Julie.(24F) From the first day in my class, there was something about Julie’s mannerisms and clarity that I found extremely attractive.. so I shot my shot. She came over to my place and we did homework together.. we then somehow moved to the topic of marijuana and how we both enjoy smoking.. I just so happen to have a bong in my closet and some weed. So we ended up smoking together and just watching some movies for a while. 

That was about a month ago.
Currently we’ve made it clear to each other that we want to be exclusive. And a few days ago we spent the entire day together. It’s honestly been so great. But I’m really started to grow some serious feelings for this girl. And to be honest… I’m scared shitless. We’ve come so far so fast.. but it just feels right. It’s also the first time I’ve ever been with a woman that much older than me. 

When I re-read this post.. it just sounds too good to be true. Am I just getting caught up in my past reddit? I feel like maybe I’m being a bit too hard on myself.. I’m really not sure. I would sincerely appreciate some thought. 

Thank you all for reading.",15Apr2019,1
17,"I am a high school student, for context.

My older sister lives with her fiancee in the northern part of my state, I in the south. She has offered me and my little brother the opportunity to go stay with them for junior and senior year, then college as it would be more convenient (me and my brother live with our grandma, our guardian, and we somewhat disadvantaged). 

I agreed, as it would be a change of scenery, a chance to make new friends, and the school I would be changing to offered more scholarships that I could go for. And, to be frank, I'm not liking the people at my school.

When I went to my grandma about this, she became offended because she thought I thought that she couldn't take care of us. That wasn't the reason, and I told her, but she told me no.

Basically, I argued it would be easier on her, stress-wise and financially-wise, and she argued I'd just stress them out.

She's already said no, but I need closure. Who's right here?",15Apr2019,1
18,"For example Does anyone avoid watching TV series/movies or YouTube videos  because you think you will enjoy them too much?


I think this is the reason why I don't watch many television shows or movies.Part of it is thinking about the amount of time I have to put aside but it isn't really. Because I had lots of free time for a while now and I've started only noticed this habit of mine and when I've been thinking back about it, I've been doing it for a long time.

Like even for this YouTube series.I am watching about a guy restoring his own boat for cheap and sailing it around the world , some videos are good enough  some are great. And I've just noticed I started putting off his videos to watch them later kind of because then I think I can really enjoy them/I enjoy them a bit to much. Because the idea of doing that myself. I know I do this when watching TV series aswell I will start think of where the plot will go next.( This kind of ruins them though because I am too good at it lol) 

Anyone have any idea why I'm doing this?What's wrong with me lol, am I cursed? Maybe this is more common than I think.

Am I procrastinating my enjoyment?. Now that I think of it I do this in all of the activities I enjoy and I waste a lot of time thinking about it.I have big problems procrastinating already getting work done but I have some methods to deal with that. 

How the hell do I fix me.Is there such a method, to fix myself, to enjoy myself?. It doesn't make sense!",15Apr2019,2
19,"For some background, I am a junior at a state university in the United States. I’m a Resident Assistant so I get housing and a meal plan for free. I also have misophonia, a neurological sound sensitivity disorder. Things like chewing and crunching and mouth sounds and pen clicking etc trigger me into extreme anger and panic attacks that I have to leave class for. Im under disability services but there’s not much they can do for me besides individual testing settings. 

I’m hitting a wall where I don’t know what to do. This semester has been super hard for me. I haven’t been to my classes in WEEKS, and it’s way too late for me to get anything done to even redeem myself. At this point, I know I added an extra year onto my education. My problem is though, I don’t know if I want to or can continue. 

I have depression and it got very bad this semester. I don’t eat, I barely sleep, I don’t do anything. I go to counseling services on campus but there’s not much they can do for me. I’d need to see someone off campus in order to obtain an evaluation for antidepressants. I have no motivation towards anything other than my job as an RA, which I love. I love programming and making boards and helping people. But that’s it. 

My misophonia has also been at its worst this semester. When I was going to classes, i could only stay for about 20 minutes without having to walk out due to one of my triggers. I have white noise machine hearing aid things, but they don’t help. I can’t ask an entire class to not eat or not use click pens. Disability services and professors have said (and i agree) that’s it’s unreasonable to even ask. I just can’t stay in class when anything is happening. I get panic attacks daily (if not, then anxiety attacks) and it’s exhausting. I try to keep up but if i’m not in the class I’m missing out. I just don’t have the same access to an education, and i can’t control it. No universities around me offer online programs for my major (BioAnthro). 

I feel so discouraged. Not only have I made it this far, but I’d only have 2 years left. I don’t know if i can do it, though. A semester off would lose me my job, and i can’t afford school without this position and the free housing. I don’t have a car so commuting isn’t an option either. I’ve been thinking about dropping out, but I feel guilty for wasting so much time and money and opportunity if I do. My parents didn’t go to college. My uncle was kicked out. The last person to graduate was my grandmother from a 2 year all girls college. I feel pressure (although i know my family will support me no matter what) as well as anxiety for my future without a agree. I don’t encounter my triggers and have to face them in the real world as much as I do in the classroom. I can avoid them easier.  I feel so defeated and done and that i’m worsening through time. 

On one hand, I can attempt to get by for the next 2 years. I can keep my job and free housing that I love. But ultimately I will suffer from my disability. I can’t guarantee that I’ll be able to stay in my classes. I don’t want to waste more time and money. 

On the other hand, I can drop out. I can get a jump start on work experience. I can work on my mental health and won’t have to face my disability as much. Taking a break isn’t an option for me. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for. Im struggling as decisions have to be made in the next few weeks. Any words or thoughts are appreciated. 

TL;DR: Should I suffer through the rest of my degree with my disability without knowing if I’ll be successful, or should I drop out and work on myself?",15Apr2019,1
20,"This little town I have to pass through on my way home from work has a speed trap in which the limit changes from 55 to 25 with no warning. A cop at a stoplight caught me at 45 in the 25 as I was decelerating past the sign and issued me on a $150 ticket.

21,"So, my roommate has a terrible habit of stomping around, moving furniture and slamming doors at all hours of the day. I’ve told her that it wakes me up/keeps me from sleeping and she’s apologized but kept doing it. The other night I got woken up by her moving furniture at 2am, and when I told her I got woken up by a loud noise she just said “oh sorry, I was moving some things in my room.”

For the past few months her boyfriend has also been here 24/7, including when she’s at work. He doesn’t clean or do anything to contribute to the apartment. Aaaand in addition to all of this it seems that he’s been peeing right outside our front door every time he goes out for a cigarette, and it smells disgusting in front of our building now. 

They’re both pretty hardcore alcoholics so it’s kind of difficult to get anything across to them. (I have a bit of a problem with alcohol as well so I’m not judging them for that.)
But almost every single night between 2-4am I get woken up by them slamming doors and going to the bathroom. 

I’ve tried staying level headed and just talking to her about it, but at this point I don’t know what to do. It’s taking a toll on my mental health and I’ve had to miss work because of sleepless nights. 

Our living situation is a pretty complicated so unfortunately I don’t have a legitimate “landlord” or someone else to complain to. They just want to be paid at the start of the month. 

It’s getting to the point where I just want to be a petty asshole also and slam my door and bang on her wall every time she wakes me up, but that’s morally difficult for me and I worry that it would just make her double down and be even louder.

25,"Context:

I’ve liked this girl for around 6 months, I started out just being friends but eventually we hung out a lot more and got really close, and we became best friends. Then I started to really like her like almost love her but I can’t be sure cause I’m too young to know what true love is. I confessed my love for her and enough said things didn’t go as planned but contrary to what I thought we became even closer friends which sucked for me cause I liked her even more. Then I started getting depressed because I liked her and liked her more and more, it made me lazy, lethargic, and living life aimlessly. Things got worse when all my friends in our friend group told me to ask her to prom but I asked her 30 mins too late and she got asked by one of her childhood friends. Well it was okay I was pretty sure it couldn’t get worse then it had been. Nothing could get worse, and surely it did we then went to a concert the next week and we’ll she got drunk and she got really touchy with me and hugged me for a long as time. I know I can’t blame her because she’s drunk but it fucked with my mind a bit.  Then came prom, and I knew this week was gonna be sad, I had already started smoking this week a lot and well enough said I was depressed to be going with a girl I didn’t like in a group with the girl I loved. Anyway prom was okay, the dinner was fine, photos were normal, it was when the after party started that things got horrible. She gets really drunk and then dosent talk to me the whole party except for like twice, she’s hugging other guys and hanging with other people which I know I can’t do anything abt so I just sat around and sucked it up. Then she goes to one of my friends and says let’s go upstairs, this friend of mine is known for sexual taking advantage of girls when there drunk, but I didn’t think it was actually true. Then the guy locks the upstairs room and I can’t do anything about it. I asked what one of my other friends at the party I thought and he said “I don’t think anything is happening at all”. So I sat downstairs contemplating what I should do next and visualizing all the shit that could happen in that room. And then an hour of me feeling sucicidal and sad I hear from the upstair walls “HELP! HELP! PLEASE SOMEONE GRT ME OUT! HELP”. I don’t know if this meant what happened was rape, but now at the moment I’m pretty sure it was consensual after everything I heard. My guy best friend won’t tel me anything that she told him other than it was head, and she deeply regrets it. 

What now:

Well today and last night I’ve just been traumatized I really don’t know why I had to experience that and it really fucked with my brain. I really think I’m at a sad spot in life right now, thanks if you can give me some meaningful advice.

26,"Not even strangers, just if I go socializing they will  friendly banter about my height. I'm a short guy (5""2) and it just hurts. I don't know how to say this but basically I'm more scared of my reaction to it when my classmates do it.

When I react with anger it shows it hurts me.
When I keep silent I tend to think about it later and that it's true and it shows I can't take a joke.
When I pretend to fake laugh (like I do) it just continues and I'm being hurt.
When it's small stuff like ""shorty"" and I don't like that but pointing it out would be dumb because it's just a silly name calling. (So the name calling continues).
When I try to roast them back I just hate myself for things I say to other people, I know it's just a joke but things my classmates say is so heavy.

I love when it's just light-hearted, not too much and too often and not about the things I'm self conscious about.

I got a few friends like these and I love them.
Also  love the very polite and kind friends too that don't friendly banter.

29,"I got into the University of California Santa Barbara for Economics and University of Michigan Ann Arbor for LSA and Economics at University of California San Diego(ERC).

UCSB will be much cheaper because I live in California so I'll get in-state which is much less than UMich since I got nothing there. I also have honors so I get priority class registration which is really nice especially at the UC's. Lastly, the weather is unbeatable there...

I'm leaning towards Michigan for sure. I plan to probably do Econ with a minor in Computer science at Michigan and might even consider applying to Ross. Michigan academically has way more opportunities regarding majors. Neither UC's can minor in CS. It also has the big school spirit sport vibe that I really enjoy. Regarding cost, I'm fortunate enough to be able to afford it, but it's just whether it will be worth it comparatively.

UCSD is known as the third best UC I think. It also is in a great location and weather. One major turn off is that I got Eleanor Roosevelt College which means my GE will be insanely hard and long. Also, there is a stigma at SD that it is socially dead. The cost will be the same as UCSB.

How far apart reputation wise would you guys say these three schools are? Which is better for econ and cs. Is Michigan going to be worth the price tag? Opinions on social scenes and academic experiences too. Thanks!

TLDR: UCSB(instate) vs UMich vs UCSD(instate obviously...)",15Apr2019,1

32,"So I’m a 16 y/o girl, I have a 17 y/o boyfriend with anxiety and depression. We’ve been together 5 months and we’re very serious about each other. He’s witnessed my borderline abusive home life and I’ve witnessed some shit on his end. I used to self harm when I was younger as I was very down and lonely. I sent nudes to boys because I had no respect for myself. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve found myself to be very panicky, shaking, and breaking down when I’m scared or overthinking. My home life is very explosive and aggressive so this doesn’t help with my nerves but I don’t know what’s going on in my head. I am very depressed all the time, I don’t see the point in life, I’m constantly saying sorry for everything, doing bad things online for money so I can leave my home ASAP (even though I have a boyfriend) and I’m self harming still. I am ashamed of who I am and what I’ve become. I don’t know whether I have anxiety or depression or what but I’m scared I’m a bad person.",15Apr2019,2
33,"My neighbors have a history of being loud and obnoxious. We live in a small apartment building. 6 units, 3 floors, myself, my boyfriend, and said neighbors all live on the second floor.  The first week they were here, the girl (let’s call her Amy), started pounding and screaming at the front door to let her in. She was screaming bloody murder outside, at the top of her lungs to let her in, at 6 am.  A neighbor let her in, and she started body slamming her door down. She broke the lock and all to it.  Mind you, the walls are pretty thin, so we can hear this girl slamming her body against a hard door.  Her boyfriend (Roach) finally heard the commotion and found her in the apartment.  From my understanding, she just forgot her keys.  The weather was fine, a late summer morning.  That was the only time she ever reacted like that.  They forget their keys all the time now, and they always ask us to open the door for them.  (They both are 19/20)

Multiple times we hear her have a blood curling scream. Extremely loud, not just yelling. Like a baby that got dropping screaming.  
She screams stuff like get away from me, I’m leaving, get the hell out, where are you going, don’t leave, etc.  she goes back and forth within like 5 minutes.  Sometimes, they would come and knock on our door.  And just start fighting in the hall.  Arguing their side of the case to my boyfriend and I. Every time this happened, we essentially asked was is anyone being physically abused, and both would answer no.  I usually just said okay then stop yelling so loud and get some space. One time, she claimed to be upset about being pregnant.  

——this is the grill pissy part, aka last night——

I work weekends for 12 hours both days.  I have to be to work at 5:30 in the morning, and awake around 4ish.  My ideal bed time is around 8:30 ish on these nights. Last night, around 11:30, I was awoken by Amy and Roach screaming at each other.  Usually, I hear more of Amy and her bloody murder scream. Last night, Roach was the one yelling at her.  Of course, she was still screaming, but this time you could actually hear him screaming back.  (Usually you would hear him trying to calm her down) At one point, Amy comes over to our apartment, and knocks on the door.  Then I assume runs/stumbles back into her apartment. And you just hear more screaming. So my boyfriend (Din), goes and knocks on their door. They both come out into the hall way, and explaining their end of the story. (From what I gathered, she claimed she lost the baby because of him, and he claimed she cheated) While he was trying to explain, she  said stuff like “yeah I sucked his dick after you made me miscarriage” “I’m going to kill myself” Amy throws up the the hall way somewhere around here because she was screaming so loud. Roach then asked to come into our place (which is a studio aka a closet with a kitchen).  He comes in, turns on the light to basically my bedroom and starts explaining it again. At this point, I’m fuming.  I was ready to call the cops when they knocked on my door, let alone came into my place. Roach was asking to like sleep in our bathroom. Din took him to the fire escape, and they started talking. Now the fire escape has my brand new grill I bought not even a month ago.  It also has some plants, and a set of stairs to the third floor.  Amy puts her bra up to the window next the stairs to get roachs attention.  They start arguing again. All the while, I’m laying in bed with pillows folded in half on either side of my head trying to ignore the baboons right outside my kitchen door. After 20 ish minutes of the arguing, Roach went up the stairs and started peeing all over our fire escape. Including the new grill, my plants, and the first floor neighbors stuff below.  At this point, it’s like 1:30 in the morning, and din freaked out.  He just told him to go through his back door and to get off our fire escape (they have a different one). They continued arguing until about 3 am. 

Once I was up for work I sent 
“Listen. Don’t bother us anymore.  Don’t knock on our door, or ring the door bell to be let in. Din was trying to be nice last night, and you pissed all over our shit, including the grill I just bought.  You kept me up for 3 fucking hours with your yelling and screaming.  I have to be to work at 5:30 and I work for 12 hours. I get you guys have relationship problems.  And that’s where they need to stay, in your relationship.  You don’t need to wake the whole god damn building up.  If I hear any screaming, yelling, I’m calling the fucking cops.  Right away. I’m done being nice.”

I haven’t had any reply.  All I’d like is an apology at the least.  If I don’t hear anything by tomorrow morning, I’m going to call the renters office when it opens.

35,"Last night I was out with my wife and friends for a 30th birthday party. We were all drinking heavily and our friend, “Max” came out to me. Well more dropped a bomb shell that’s he’s been married for a year to one of his “house mates”. For context, Max was my wife’s house mate in college and they have been best friends for 10 years. He and I have always been very close for the past 7 years and he was the best man at our wedding this past July. 

He is not out to anyone even though we have a very supportive friend group - many of us in the lgbt community.  Even his brother is out. 

He was very excited to open up and told both me and my wife. Unfortunately, my wife was blacked out and when he asked her about it in the morning she didn’t recall the conversation.  He was kind of relieved and said he didn’t want to tell her. he and I talked about for about 5 hours - she was involved for the final 2 hours. 

Here’s the thing - I can’t/couldn’t keep that secret from my wife.  

We are both in shock. Not bc he’s gay, bc honestly we have thought about it but that he’s married. And has been in all these long-term relationship. We hang out with him at least one day a week and speak with him on a daily basis. We go on vacations together. He comes over for family holidays. 

I tried to tell him my wife is remembering our conversations from last night and now he is insisting I tell her it was dream or she’s misunderstanding.  My wife is very upset and just wants to get to know him and his husband together and to be open.  She wants to call him and express her support but he thinks she doesn’t know. Now that’s he’s sobered up it sounds like he wants to take two steps back and hide everything again. I know he deserves to come out on his own terms but he *did* tell my wife everything last night. Should we or should we not push a little to get to know his husband and him together?

It’s a pretty fucked up situation. He married his now husband technically to help him get his papers and he seems very, very unstable. He tells Max that if he left him or anything he would jump in front of a train. But it sounds like him being a hidden from all of Max’s friends is really hard for him. We just want to help them both bc it sounds like they just want to have a normal relationship and reaching out might help.",15Apr2019,1

37,"Okay, here's the situation. Saturday, I noticed my debit card was missing and immediately cancelled it. There weren't any weird transactions on it, thankfully. But the replacement card will take five to seven business days to get here. Problem: I have a car in the shop that's supposed to be completed tomorrow, and a rental I'm using in the meantime. The repair place only takes cash or card as payment and I have neither until my new debit card gets here. The rental place has my original debit card on file; if the card is lost or stolen they require me to show my replacement card, which I can't do until it gets here. Not to mention I also have to return the car with gas in it and I can't do that without my card either.

So like...I'm not really sure what to do? I don't have anyone I can borrow money from; I can't go to my bank in person because it's out of state. I'm planning on calling the repair shop and the rental place and seeing if they'll work with me. But does anyone else less stressed than I am have any ideas on how I can swing this?

I stood by that lie for two months until today.... my sister began looking everywhere for it(idk why she seemed to be very determined to find it).

I don't understand how she does it all, she's just involved in so many things its crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I was visiting my parents house since I was pet sitting for a neighbor 3 doors down. My little sister came home around 9:30ish. She was talking to us about her day but mostly to my mom. She said that she was going upstairs to get ready for bed. I went up with her to talk to her and see how everything was going but she said she needed to FaceTime her ex boyfriend before he goes to bed. I asked if we could just talk for 10 minutes and she replied with the same excuse and said she was tired and wanted to go to bed. So I left, and as I was leaving I started to get really depressed. I struggle with Major Depressive Disorder btw. I sent my sister this txt: ""Do you realize that whenever I try to spend time with you or even just talk, you always have an excuse for not being able too? This happens every time. I understand you’re busy but how hard is it to set aside 10 min to spend time with me?Like I really need to go to bed so that I can get up tomorrow at 6:30 am and work a 9hr shift, but I was willing to stay up late and risk being late tomorrow to do so.""

And she replied with: ""I’m so sorry I didn’t think it was that big of a deal ""

This morning While I was at work my mom sent me three txt messages.

Mom: ""We can not have you moving home and your not even home yet and blasting your sister with texts. Your going to have to go slow and not force a relationship

Or she will go other way. She is extremely busy as we all are and you just have to take small moments when they come and don’t let yourself get out of control over things and people you can not control

Or this isn’t going to work. Your going to be depressed, hateful tone, miserable for all in this household. You need to think about that.. ""

""It isn’t just her your on my back about dog shots I get it I will do it when I can but you can’t control me either and getting more and more forceful with me when I don’t do what you want.  ""

Me: Ok I'll just leave you all alone

Mom: That is not what we are asking we are asking for softer approach and go with flow instead of I don’t get my way I am mad. So your going to pay. We love fun light roll with punches and not rigid, harsh tone and demanding. This isn’t going to work either if you don’t figure out how to engage with family because there will be no locking self in room. That isn’t a solution and doesn’t benefit anyone you can engage and help cook and walk dogs and just have fun and set your expections of your sister and I Lower 

few minutes later

Mom: After you read all this delete So it doesnt ttake you a negative place this is good we all love you and just trying to help you adjust to us and make this work for all of us. Yes she does want a relationship with you but your current way to communicate this to her is not effective so try something else or wait on the moment when we are in kitchen and go walk dogs together we know working out together didn’t work well😂.

46,"Let me preface this by saying that I (18, transgender FtM) don't have ADHD. I have depression and BPD (but the BPD isn't on my record because I was underaged at the time and the psychiatrist I saw said he didn't diagnose personality disorders in minors). I was forced to see a psychiatrist because I couldn't succeed in school and the stress of failing all my classes (and consequently setting my whole life up for failure) was making me suicidal; I attempted suicide halfway through my freshman year of high school but was involuntarily hospitalized several times beforehand for snapping a rubber band on my wrist in an attempt to focus during class and then again for non-fatal self harm. I was given a series of antidepressants (Prozac first, then Luxapro) to treat it and made to attend group DBT sessions, both of which just made things worse. I stopped taking the meds and going to therapy right around the time I finally dropped out of high school, and I definitely do a lot better off the meds and out of therapy than I was with them.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I still can't pay attention to anything. It's been a problem since at least middle school; I've always been lazy and unintelligent and from the year they started grading us (fifth grade where I'm from) I failed all my classes. I don't have the discipline to make myself do work; any time I try my mind just kind of goes blank and I would sit at my desk from the time I got home until I got called away for dinner just staring at my homework or daydreaming about other things. Actually trying to do the work just stressed me out. I'd have to read and re-read the same exact shit for an ungodly amount of time just to understand what it was the questions were asking me, and trying to *answer* the questions was a whole different matter. Now that I've officially dropped out and basically destroyed my future, I don't have to worry about homework anymore, but I can't get basic things done like laundry or job applications (had a retail job, just quit because we're getting ready to move, now I need to look for a new one when we get where we're going). I'm a writer and an author but I haven't been able to force myself to write anything substantial in well over a year; every time I try I get distracted by other things (mostly internet things like music, social media, or skimming news articles and opinion pieces) and only write a few sentences, and if I turn the distractions (internet) off, then I just can't think and I don't get anything written at all. I'm an absolute slob and I haven't cleaned my room in months (which I need to be doing right now in preparation for the move, but I can't fucking do it and instead I'm dicking around on Reddit I guess). The only thing that's ever helped was when my drug addict friend gave me some Adderall (bought illegally from someone who knew someone else who had a script at one point) and I was finally able to get some writing done and clean my room damn near spotless (which it's only ever been when my parents got fed up with my messy room and threw things away when I was little), but I really can't risk going to jail to do that on a regular basis and like I said I don't have ADHD. I don't know if I'd be comfortable trying to fake it (and possibly risking a psychiatrist's licence if they got caught giving me a medication I'm not supposed to be on?) either.

Is there anything I can possibly do that might help? They shoved mindfulness down our throats in DBT but it really didn't help me at all when my problem is that I *can't* focus on just what I'm doing, not that I'm *choosing* not to.

Aside from being overweight, I'm perfectly healthy so it's not that either.

48,"I’ll preface this with a disclaimer: this is a really long post, and a lot of it is just me typing into the void on this throwaway account to try to make sense of things.

I’ve struggled with being lonely for most of my life. I’m not the most charismatic of people, although I’m able to make friends fairly easily. A lot of the people I know have commented that I’m a bit of a social chameleon (or “social tofu”) in that I’m able to make myself at home in most social situations and I’m able to get along with pretty much anyone. Despite this, it seems that I’m not really very good at forming “meaningful” relationships, the kinds of friendships that last, and I don’t know why. I feel very much alone most of the time, and I feel like my attempts to connect with people on a deeper than superficial level repulse them.

I do have a very deep well of past trauma that I think affects that, as I typically don’t express it. I’m a fairly young person, in my mid-20s, but I have had my share of issues. I’ve struggled with depression since I was a teenager. I lost the love of my life in my early 20s. I fought and killed people in combat and I still struggle with those acts. And I’ve lost the only close friend I ever had - the kind I could talk to anything about, and who could talk to me about anything - to suicide. And I don’t really know who I am anymore. I was a warrior once, and now I’m not really sure what I am. That’s not to say that I believe my life is exceptionally hard or that I have a lot of baggage, because I recognize that my life is still better than a lot of people’s and I have a lot to be grateful about. I have a roof over my head, I have plenty of people who I’m on good terms with, and I have food in my kitchen and money in my bank account. But I think that some of my past does spill out as I grow closer to people, and perhaps it frightens them off.

I should comment that I’m not trying to lean on people or have them support me emotionally as I grow closer to them, at least not intentionally. I tend to be naturally melancholic, though, and as I grow closer to a person, I let the mask I usually present at first - a confident, cheerful, competent person - slip a bit more and I tend to be “myself” more. And as I grow closer to a person I try to share more of my life and who I am with them while I try to learn more about their pasts and who they are. I think maybe that’s too much, but then I question: how do you become close to someone if not by sharing who you are with them and then sharing who they are with you?

I think maybe another stress that’s put on my friendships is my tendency to dissociate from people occasionally. Sometimes I get paranoid, and I don’t know why, that the people around me don’t actually like me and are only interacting with me because they’re forced to or they feel sorry for me. And that’s difficult for me to try to move past, but I recognize that it can be a significant burden on a friendship too dealing with a person who has that tendency. I know I’m not alone in it, as I know multiple people who’ve had the same experience, but I’m trying to figure out a way to stop that dissociation and to be more secure in my relationships.

Certainly it’s taking its toll, and I don’t like the effect it seems to be having on me. Lately, I’ve come to feel a lot of hate for everything. For myself, most of all. It terrifies me, because I occasionally see self-pitying posts or comments about self-loathing from people who seem to have grown to hate everything, and everyone, and the idea of that happening to me is terrifying. I’ve had periods of my life where the only thing that kept me going and the only reason I’m still alive today was hate, and spite for life, but there was never so much self-hate in the mixture as well. I don’t think I could survive that particular mixture. I’m not sure I could grow to hate everyone around me, but seeing it have happened to others scares me quite a bit. It’s difficult not to feel that there’s just something wrong with me though, in that my many efforts to connect with people and form meaningful friendships beyond having drinks and talking, or relationships beyond casual sex have universally failed. The only common link in all these failed attempts is just - me.

I don’t mean to sound self-pitying or make this seem like “woe is me”. At the moment I’m not feeling much of anything at all, I feel like I’m just being objective. But in any case, I think I need to puzzle through why and what has left me with such an inability to form actual close friendships. Perhaps I need to start talking to a therapist, though I have in the past and they never helped at all.

Typing this through now, I wonder if maybe what’s happening is that I keep trying to build meaningful friendships, and then I subconsciously test if it’s a “meaningful relationship” by throwing stressors at it until it’s torn down. I think maybe it’s like I’m trying to build a sturdy bridge, and testing it it’s sturdy by seeing how much weight and stress it can take by piling more and more on until it collapses. I’m not sure that is what I am doing, but I question - it has to be something. I’m terrified I did it again this weekend with two of my friends who I love deeply, and I’m trying to think of a way to pull out of this death spiral.

Anyway, if you’ve read this far, thanks for caring enough about some random stranger to read such a convoluted and disorganized ramble. Perhaps you have some insight or thoughts or experiences that you could share. Thank you for your time.

This sucks but currently, I've been talking to this friend about my problems and personal shit and probably relying on them a lot more lately because they're more available than anyone else and want to help.

Recently, I was at their house and their SO (their SO and them are in a confirmed 'open relationship' where they can hook up w/other people as long as they let the other know) that my friend seems very intent on breaking up with in a few weeks, walked in on us having sex and flipped out.

My friend kept saying, ""How is this any different than anyone else I've hooked up with?""

and their SO kept saying, ""You two have a history together!"" and even referred to me as an ex at one point to which my friend and I corrected them that we'd never dated before.

My friend apologized over the situation and said not to worry about their SO and that they're just mad that they weren't informed we'd be doing anything beforehand and that he saw us and told me that apparently, their SO was fine and over the whole thing the next day.

Idk I suppose the two of them are fine, but I did start to overthink about what their SO had said. I really don't think my friend has ever felt that way about me, but damn I like that they're a close friend that I can trust and also have good sex with every few months (we don't live in the same town). 

I'll be honest, I don't want to give up the sex, but I want to maintain the friendship and not have any weird feelings. Past few days, I've felt lonely or something like that.

My friend thinks that things are fine and that we'll talk again in a week or so like usual, but a part of me feels like I shouldn't talk to them until I've cleared my head and can think of them as just a friend once again.",15Apr2019,1
51,"About a year or so my parents had a divorce and I didn't see or talk to my dad for about six months, then after that it was very little contact for about another six months until about a month ago when he rented a house and I got to stay there once on a weekend. Throughout the time since the beginning of the current school year (I'm in grade 10) my mental state started gradually decreasing and I wasn't sure how to handle it, because I've never really had too much problems like this and if I did I would just keep it to myself, however this time it was a lot worse.

It got really bad once my dad was more in the picture because he started pushing me to work for him, after school and on weekends. I didn't want to do it because I have lots of tough classes but since the start of the new semester I gave up and really stopped caring about my grades, or anything else for that matter.

About two months ago I also told them that I don't believe in the church they force me to go to with them. They tell me I shouldn't go for the religion but for the values they teach, which still doesn't make sense because it's not like somebody cant have values or morals if they go to church, but they don't see it like that and tell me I need to be doing some kind of ""enlightening"" on Sundays.

After that they started being really hard on me about everything and I went in to a rebellious phase where I started doing things that they would lynch me for. Thankfully they didn't find out about that stuff but grounded me for things like being home 5 minutes past curfew or teasing my siblings or having ""attitude"". And so for about that two months I've basically had all contact cut off between my friends and I and haven't been able to do nearly anything.

Throughout all the isolation I started emailing my cousin who is the same age as me. He is dealing with a lot of the same things and I found it really easy for us both to talk about it. They found out I was talking to him and read our emails, and found out that I ""think"" I'm depressed and have cut myself a few times. After this, which was about two weeks ago, they told me I'm grounded until I'm not like this anymore and until my grades get up.

After they indefinitely grounded me I got in contact with a girl who I have a thing going on with and we decided to sneak out together that night and hangout. I hadn't seen any of my friends outside of school for a long long time so I decided it wasn't a big deal. Sadly I got caught when I came home and now they're saying I'm grounded for sneaking out, which makes sense but they can't understand why I did it. I did it because they're ignorant and can't see the real problem and blame my depression on things like social media (which I haven't had for months) and my cousin and me sneaking out. I've tried talking to them about it but they just scold and lecture me when all I want is just a dad and a mom not two parents who are just going to tell me I'm wrong and disappointing to them. I just want parents I can spend time but that can't see that even after I blatantly tell them so.

Anyways, I don't know what to do other than suck it up till I'm 18 and can move out, but that seems like way too much time to just ""suck it up"" for. So if anybody has some similar situation they dealt with or just advice it would be much appreciated. Also would like to mention that when I told them I'm depressed and they saw my cuts my dad said they were going to take me to the psych ward and wait till the doctor tells them I'm full of BS so they can go home, and they've said it's just a phase. Anyways, please give me some kind of advice, thank you.",15Apr2019,4

We have an agreement where we send 'smileys' of each other each day, usually it's my day or his. 
At some points I don't take pictures on mine and it makes it to where I'll have to take two the next day or more if it continues. 

It was my turn on Friday and I didn't take a picture, same thing on Saturday; I finally sent him two today.

He explained it makes him upset and worried that I don't like seeing myself even in the mirror and believes it's unhealthy. As well as me being actually pretty.

59,"Hi all, I’m sorry the subject matter of this post is so sad, or if it brings anyone’s mood down at all. But, I’m really really scared right now am I don’t know what I should do. 

So basically, my friend and I, who I’ll call N, have known each other for over a year now, and are very very close. Just recently though, we dated for about 3 months. Immediately after we broke up, (about 2 weeks ago,) he said some very very hurtful things to me, and I let him know how I felt about what he had said. We are now on relatively good terms but just yesterday he told me he was going to kill himself this Friday. N has several guns in his house in easy access to him, and he could easily do it.

His main reasoning for doing so were because he felt terrible about fucking things up with our relationship, and causing me so much pain, and that he couldn’t keep on living knowing he could’ve had me but fucked it up.

His other reason was a bunch of personal stuff like Mental illness, past, etc.

I really don’t know what to do right now. I’ve tried everything, begging, reasoning, apologizing, etc. But, he hasn’t responded to anything positively. He is dead set on doing it. So, I have two questions for all of you. Does anyone have anything I can tell him that would help him to feel better, and reconsider his decision, or, if things get to the worst point, if it would be a good idea to tell his family or the authorities about it before he kills himself.",15Apr2019,1

61,"In a nutshell, I developed a pretty solid friendship with a coworker. I grew feelings for her but I didn't want to pursue anything past a friendship for the sake of keeping a professional business environment. My last day in the office was last Friday, and I'm moving on to a new business. We might make some small-talk over texting, but nothing too notable. We've only hung out outside of work once; it was a Friday evening a couple of weeks ago - she brought me over to introduce me to her dogs and we went out for dinner (nothing too fancy). Now that I'll no longer see her, I have NO idea how to keep the ball rolling. I highly doubt she knows how I feel about her, and I haven't caught any significant vibes that she has any feelings toward me.

You might be thinking, ""But she invited you over and you ate dinner together - surely that means something!"" Maybe, maybe not. I feel like if she really wanted to get to know me more, than she would make me a priority. Example #1) She's relatively introverted - she when she's not hanging out with *other* friends over the weekend, she insists that she says inside, alone. Example #2) I took a week off of work last month and told her that if she wanted a lunch buddy then I'll be free every day! She never reached out.

What do you think I should do, if anything? Should I ""Hail Mary"" and just text her my thoughts toward her since she's so hard to reserve a spot to hang out with instead of telling her in person? Should I even try anymore and wait to see if she reaches out first? Or should I just drop it?",15Apr2019,1
62,"A friend and I had a falling out and we decided to leave each other alone. I have done my part to avoid him; I fully understood that I would have to ignore him whenever he's around and that I have decided to remove him from contacts list. However, we are in the same social group so we still see each other from time to time whenever the group has a get-together. The problem is that he starts butting in my conversations with my other friends and tries to talk to me. I don't understand what his motive is, but it was clear that we both have agreed to leave each other alone. In truth, whenever he tries to get in conversations with me in it, it makes me feel uneasy and very uncomfortable. The feeling is very toxic to me, and I'm afraid that one day my resolve will break and I would have to confront him in front of my other friends. I don't want to have another petty fight with this person, so as much as possible I want that to be prevented.

67,"So this happened just a few hours ago, and I'm still a little shaken by it.

I was making my way out of a parking lot, made a left turn onto the road, when a motorcyclist pulled up on my right side and was looking at me, while revving his engine. I had no idea what he was doing, so I just ignored it and pulled into the next lot that I was going to. He followed me to where I parked, so I locked my doors and just stayed in the car. He came up to my car, knocked on my window, and pretty aggressively told me to roll down my window. I hesitated because he seemed pretty angry and I didn't know if he was planning to rob me or punch me or what. So I shook my head and said no, but he asked me again to roll down my window. I asked him if something was wrong, and he said that I almost hit him. I apologized profusely, and said I had no idea. He told me to look carefully next time, and I nodded and said I will and that I was sorry again. Thankfully he just left after that.

I'm usually a careful driver, but I could've just been careless, so I will accept the blame for it if that's what really happened. Thankfully it all ended without any altercation, but I had no idea what I should have done.. should I have rolled down my window? Stepped out of the car? I had a passenger with me, and I just didn't want her to get hurt. I was also scared because we recently had a kidnapping in our area where a college student was confronted in her car and was robbed and kidnapped. If I had known that I almost hit him, I would have at least rolled down the window to apologize or see if he was injured, but I wasn't sure, so I was more worried about myself and my passenger. It was during the day in a public area, so maybe I shouldn't have assumed that I was being robbed or kidnapped...

 Now he was annoying, sweet. But annoying and we always sit together at lunch and one day I decide to sit with another friend, who he hates but I wanted to sit their since we always sit together. Did I regret this? Kinda but not really.
 And he got pissed off the next day I sat with him, he said I’m not his best friend anymore because I sat with “the devil” (who he calls his enemy;no that is not shelly)
 Sure I’m sure he meant it as a joke to not sit with her, but I take stuff to a lot of offense and he was an ass to say that to me when we’ve been friends since ELEMENTARY to high school.
 And I stopped being his friend.

Andy: “YOO ADD MAYA TO THE GROUP CHAT”

I can be extremely private with people I dont trust but very open with people I do. I have  forgiven too easily and too quickly. I subconsciously seek out validation though I am trying to correct these habits everyday and getting more successful by the day, instead validating myself.

We seem to get on pretty well and have been talking nearly every day and he seems to like me sending kissing gifs and compliments and wanting to cuddle and kiss me every time I go over. We went and saw ""Us"" and after finishing our popcorn wedged between us, he moved it onto the seat next to him and put his hand on the top of my thigh stroking his thumb occasionally so I put my hand on top to reciprocate. We had burger and I stayed over at his. I had two big assignments due (I'm second year laws) and became a bit depressed so went basically mia for two days but apologised afterwards.

Last week I had lunch with a uni friend between classes and mentioned I'd been talking to this guy and that he was a photographer at the bar she goes to.

She instantly knew who I meant and said that she said not to talk to him and that she thought he was creepy and just doing the job to hook up with girls as three months ago he mailboxed her friend in the beer garden at a student night.

This took me aback and I didn't know what to think... Could the guy that seemed funny, sweet and like a genuine person- that I was slowly falling for, really be like this? I cried when I got home and felt uncomfortable talking to him so I was a bit standoffish, oppositional and not my usual self. I was conflicted and unsure.

Anyway, last night my cousin got married at a beautiful ceremony in a boutique vineyard and I had a bit to much champagne (I had to do a lot of toasting to speeches haha!).

I arrived back at the motel and saw a message from the guy saying he wanted to see me this week and asking how my trip was going. Against better judgement and fueled by alcohol I told him what my friend had said and it's made me conflicted and I don't know who to believe as I find him amazing. I kept apologising and said I didn't want him to hate me but I was drunk. He said he was frustrated a few times that I wouldn't tell him who it was as he cared what people thought about him but not to beat myself up over telling him as he knew I was probably processing and to stop apologising. He also said he would have liked yo have known why I seemed weird and went mia. He ended saying he wanted to move on and stop talking about it.

I said that in the future I would be honest and upfront instead of hiding things away. He hasn't messaged me since but has been online.

I feel more guilty than you can ever imagine and feel terrible for telling him. I don't know how to proceed and know he probably hates me and is over me now. But I desperately want to patch things up and be good again and show him I care deeply for him. I'm so stupid and insightless.

Have I blown it and is it to late or will I be able to do something and get him back? If so, what can I do?",15Apr2019,2

90,"Me and my SO have been together for about 4 years, during these 4 years I have only had one conversation with his brother's girlfriend, let's call her ""Mandy"". Me and Mandy are extremely different. I love rock and metal and my style is edgy. She likes rap and dresses extremely different than me. Whenever I see her in person she walks by and doesn't acknowledge me. She parks horrible, she takes up two parking spots so whenever I come over my boyfriend always has to ask her to move. So I figured maybe she never liked me because of this. When I first started dating my boyfriend she somehow found me on all social media platforms. She would always comment or message me about stuff I posted. I was fine with that because maybe we could be friends. When I bought my new car she bought the exact same car a month later, I didn't think anything of it. I eventually got really tired and annoyed at how much she would brag online. I could tolerant a lot but it was ridiculously annoying so I blocked her. A few months later I got a request from an odd Instagram page, I approved because it was a page dedicated to certain habit of mine and I'm always looking to make friends. Well over time I noticed certain things that looked familiar, but then she posted a picture of her hand and I knew it was her. Which was creepy she was always the first to see my stories but never liked or commented on anything. I decided to check who she follows looking for someone mutual, I realize she followed ALL the pages o follow.She slowly started posting stuff that I was into that I KNEW she was not into. One day I decided to unblock her real Instagram and to find out she has literally stolen my captions, starting copying my outfits, my locations. I blocked her fake account and she found me again. I'm a little weirded out and I'm confused what to do about it, should I shoot her message on her fake account? Or should I ignore it? I do not see her in person often because she was always locked in her boyfriend's room.
 
TLDR: Boyfriend's brother's girlfriend is weird.

92,"Hi, this is my first time posting and I am conflicted with this situation I am in with my boyfriend. 

I am aware as to how I dress and I do believe that some girls can dress a bit too provocative (like short shorts, small tops, or low tops). I personally try to dress appropriately and I’m not a fan of dressing provocatively, but I also don’t like to wear outfits that have me look like a pilgrim. I still like to stick to my style and feel good about how I look. I understand and completely agree with where he is coming from in the idea that I should not dress in a way that is asking for attention from other men because I am in a relationship; which I am very happy in. However, my boyfriend says that he does not like it when I wear clothing that show off every curve to my body (leggings and cycling shorts). I personally do not wear these items to “show off,” but he says it doesn’t matter what my intentions are and that I attract the wrong attention. It bugs me a bit, though, because many other girls wear leggings and it is a comfortable item for me personally. I keep thinking, “isn’t this equivalent to the idea of him wearing a tight shirt?” My boyfriend replies that it is different for a girl and he can’t get that kind of attention that I do. 
This topic has come to a point, for him, that he will break up with me the next time I wear something inappropriate in our relationship. So my question is, I guess, should I just give up on all of my leggings and tight clothing of that sort?",15Apr2019,1

95,"A year ago I \[23m\] started dating the most perfect and beautiful woman I have ever known. Our relationship had some ups and downs but ultimately was the most meaningful connection either of us have ever had.  
When we first started dating I was hesitant because I was saving for a 2 year trip around the world and have been since. Its something I've wanted to do since I was a little kid.   
Through out the course of our relationship we avoided the subject of me leaving, basically pretended it wasn't happening and cruised through the year blissfuly ignoring the fact.

I don't know why I thought this would be easy, but this is the worst I have ever felt, and it's completely unfair towards her.

I started off as a cashier but then moved to kitchen and where things got toxic. The kitchen manager constantly gets mad at me for not knowing what to do. Mind you i have never work actual kitchen so a little patience will go a long way. But what got me mad was i got in trouble again when the cashier step off to use the restroom and ask me to cover. I took a phone order but we were out of that item and i didnt know. So the kitchen manager went off on me again saying you should know your place, you work in the back and should not be doing cashier work or front of house work.  The kitchen manager was just mad because he had to make a simple item, when all this could have  be avoided be communicating.

98,"Context: I'm 17(m), Jr in high school, I have four younger siblings and two overprotective parents. They're so overprotective that I havnt been allowed to go to sleepovers, to this day. As a result I have no close friends, as I always have had to cancel plans. My girlfriends parents are pretty chill tho, and are super supportive.

I'm at a point where I don't want to date my girlfriend anymore, just because of my family. My dad is super old fashioned and always tells me that I can't have physical contact with my gf, and he's always making passive aggressive comments to her about religion or college choice or whatever. My mom isnt much better. I'm not allowed to spend time with her unless its in my parents eyesight for the most part. We've gotten to spend time together over the summer away from my family. That time is great. I really do like her, I actually love her. Weve been dating for almost two years, and she's the sweetest person ever. But its not fair on her. She's had to go to THERAPY because of how much my dad and siblings bully her with passive comments. She has low self esteem so that doesn't help. 

Ive spent time with her family, and her parents let us be. We actually get to talk and do stuff together. I've helped her with art projects and we started reading a book together. We do these things when we have alone time. She's very religious and doesn't want sex, and I totally support her in that.

On the other hand, my parents forbid us to be alone together, and always have us sit in the living room, on the floor, while they sit on the other side of the room or watch us from the kitchen. 

Just because we want alone time doesn't mean we want to have sex! We just enjoy spending time with eachtoher without people staring at us(dont get me started what it's like when company comes over). I am fed up with my parents babysitting us. I never get to see her as we live 4 hours apart, and when I see her I'm allowed to sit next to her for 20 mins and then my times up.

A couple weeks ago a friend (Desmond) (28m), who I (25m) haven't really spoken to in about three years, just contacted me two weeks ago via texting. We were good friends, he graduated college and I left college then we haven't really spoken much since. No falling out, we just moved on with our lives.

Anyways, we catch up on what's going on in our lives and remember to good times we had in college. Anyways he has been struggling since college and has yet to have a job in the last three years since graduating. Desmond does do photography, but doesn't get paid for that. Anyways I offer him moral support since he is going through the similar depression I went through back when I was in college (sort of a worthless feeling). He also hasn't had a girlfriend since college, which is different for him since he was with a new girl about every month back when we were in school. I got the vibe that he is feels alone which is bad when dealing with depression.

This is where my problem begins. I cut people off when I feel like they need something from me. I do this because friends in the past have taken advantage of my nice side. I used to be to generous with my friends. Because of this, I have closed off this part of me so I do not get taken advantage of again. Desmond was a friend who I was close with and open around.

I have the I'm always right attitude and I don't back down easily. I keep arguing until the other person is forced to accept my point or we keep arguing or just drop it which can lead to feelings of resentment.

&amp;#x200B;

\--A few minutes later--

&amp;#x200B;

Sister: Just so you know if you plan on sticking around, she wears a 32 B, and a small (blah blah blah). 

GF: Why would you tell him that?

Sister : Your boyfriend needs to be able to buy you clothes. 

GF: But he doesn't need to know all that.

Sister: He's gonna see you naked eventually, just preparing for the inevitable. 

&amp;#x200B;

\--My GF begins to storm off at this point--

&amp;#x200B;

Sister: That's why our parents are putting you on birth control Wednesday. Just in case.

GF: OMG! 

&amp;#x200B;

\-- After shopping me and my gf hop in my car to her grandmas and her sister heads to a friends house--

I learn later in the car that my gf is extremely upset about what just happened

\-- --

GF: I can't believe my sister would do that?

Me: Do what?

GF: Say all that stuff?

Me: Oh. You just thought it was too personal?

GF: Yes! We've only been dating for 3 months

\-- I basically apologize for being involved in making her uncomfortable and try to drop the topic --

She later tells her parents, who are also displeased. I can tell by the number of times she brings it up that she is not happy with her sister. She did express that it was not my fault and that she was not upset at me at all.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I am trying to figure out is, what exactly made her so upset and uncomfortable? The awkward and uncomfortable parts I understand, but why the birth control? Would you not want your boyfriend to know such a thing? Why bring up how long we've been dating? Would her position on having sex in high school change based on how long we've dating? If she is doing it because her parent would kill her, I imagine it wouldn't change anything. I understand why she is uncomfortable, I'm just trying to really get behind her logic. Any thoughts would be great and if you want additional info or feel like I'm leaving something out, just lmk.",15Apr2019,2

We have know each other for quite some time and  whenever we hang out we have a fun time and whenever I call them we can talk for over an hour but we only end up hanging out in person when they say so, I.E when they call me, They never text me back when I text them but they're all about social media. There was a time where we didnt talk or text for a year but when they called me they acted like there was no gap of time.

They don't look gross but they just are super obvious and don't look good. Is there anything I can do to get rid of something that's that large.

122,"For context, I have been diagnosed with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and SM (selective mutism, which is another anxiety, more rare disorder stemming from social phobia). I haven't been to a therapist since I was 15, and at the time only went because I was forced to. I stopped because I never complied (I wasn't ready). We never spoke about it. Now, I'm 17. Back in January I felt like I was finally ready, but never really gathered the courage to bring it up.

I did, though, bring it up once while at the hospital for a check-up. My mom asked why I felt like I needed to go, knowing full well what my conditions were, and before I could answer she sneered and went ""I don't think you'll ever get better."" Well. After that I haven't brought it up.

I really do need to see a therapist, though. It's (my anxiety) really fucked up my life and I want nothing more than to get better. Or at least be able to improve my condition.

How do I get back to bringing it up again? I don't think I've ever had a serious conversation with my mom that didn't end with an argument. She always thinks I'm out to get her or trying to accuse her of something.",15Apr2019,1

A year ago I liked her she liked me and we had “a thing” that lasted like a week he we stayed great friends and I’m happy that we are. But recently things have been really off. She dates this guy and they’re very on and off to a point where there’s a minor problem for  couple of days every week that seriously hurts her mentally. Every time they go out she completely isolated herself from any friends like she disappears. I’ve told her that at this point they should honestly break up because he really is emotionally abusive and manipulative (from what she’s told me so who am I to really be saying all that if he may be different than what she tells me) and she breaks up with him and there’s more issues and then they get back together. What I’m trying to get at is that is after a while now I’ve had her constantly on my mind and I think I’m like in love with her but I mean what would I know I could just be infatuated but her attitude now is different and she is completely isolated and I was so confused until I saw her post a video of a date she was on with him.

I know it’s stupid and a bunch of other people need actual advice but at this point idk what to do and I just need someone else’s opinion. I like being friends with her but my heart races and wants something more but I don’t know if I really want to risk that or even tell her because we’ve already been through this type of stuff and it wasn’t very pleasant. I’ve always been there for her and I’ve always cared for her well being and that guy she’s with is just making it worse. Maybe I just think that because I want her or something I’m not even sure if so but She’s crying more often she’s more depressed and things aren’t the same between her and me.

126,"I turned 22 today, and while I already knew that I was running out of time, it was further reinforced as I contemplated my future. I have no idea what I'm doing, and it doesn't help that this semester has been going insanely badly. I only enrolled for 3 classes, dropped one, and am currently giving up in one of the two I have. I have absolutely no motivation anymore to even try, I've been stuck at ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" since I started college, and thousands of dollars and time have been wasted for what feels like effectively nothing. I'd switch majors, but I don't know what I'd swap my major to. I've talked to my older sister about this, and all she said is that everyone feels like that in college until you find what you like, but ""find what you like"" isn't really working at all. People say look to your hobbies, but all I really do is read, play videogames, listen to music, and talk to people online, which hardly even qualify as hobbies.

I know trades are an option, but I don't think I'd mesh well with that kind of environment and line of work. I'm not terribly interested in finding my passion, I just want a secure, consistent job that pays enough for me to move out and live relatively comfortably. I'm not interested in getting married or getting romantically involved with anyone, I'd probably not get a pet, so it's not like I'm going to need to support a family, it'll likely just be me. The mentality I have right now is that trying to force myself through college is stupid, since my cost of living isn't going to be that high anyway and I lowkey hate it, but I simultaneously don't know what else to do aside from just work minimum wage jobs and hate life. I'm not really wanting to give up college yet, anyway, as my parents don't know that I'm feeling this way about college and haven't really been working towards anything in particular, and it'd be hard to explain to them that I was too proud to admit college felt totally pointless. I doubt they'd understand, but it's still something that's been holding me back from doing anything drastic, assuming I'd have the nerve to do anything to begin with.",15Apr2019,1
127,"Sorry if this is a weird question. But I have an issue where I’m almost constantly very very wet. If I wear the same pair of underwear all day (20ish hours give or take) they are basically ruined by the time I take them off. Soaked in the crotch and bum area, colour usually bleached, and the crotch area will basically degrade quickly making underwear only last about a month or so per pair. I am extremely poor, so I can’t afford to keep buying underwear over and over, and I don’t let people look at my underwear. 

However, if I don’t wear underwear my thighs and bum get very wet/slippery and uncomfortable and the constant rubbing of wet skin from walking causes it to become red and sore if I don’t excuse myself to the bathroom and wipe about every hour or so. 

It also makes it so if I’m wearing pants (I rarely do for this reason among others) it smells very prominently of vagina. Not a bad, fishy, or foul odor. But just the normal bland but obviously vaginal smell. No ones every pointed it out aside from previous boyfriends, but it does make me very nervous and uncomfortable in public. 

What can I do? I’ve tried pads, but they make the smell ten times stronger and I leak right trough pantyliners. I’ve also tried tampons, but those don’t seem to help at all.

It's not a friendship where we hang out outside of school but we text a lot and talk at school. More background info is that she's a big flirt but has never flirted with me.( only the cute athlete types)

So we were in the bathroom in the after party taking care of one of her friends. It was just us two and her friend was passed out on the ground.( we were both drunk but not to the point where you can't remember anything) The bathroom is a big one so when you open the door, there's the sink and a huge mirror and then another door that is where the toilet and shower is. We left her friend with a pillow and blanket and went to the sink area. She locked the door and said she needed to pee in the sink so I turned around and faced the wall. After maybe 30 seconds she hopped down and told me to look at her ass. I looked and was like its hella nice or something like that. She then grabbed my hand and put it on her ass and I grabbed it and was feeling it. She then started grinding on my dick. This lasted maybe 2 minutes max. We then heard her friend gagging so we stopped and went to help her. When were helping her friend and  people starting knocking on the door because they were worried about the friend throwing up. As people came in she left without me seeing. We talked today about prom and she didn't bring it up. How am i supposed to feel.

I can't help but feel uncomfortable when my non-asian co-workers tell me they have ""Asian wives"", when they may have said it to be relatable. It just rubs me in the wrong way considering all the stereotypes behind Asian women. How do I avoid being sexualized/fetishized and get rid of my ""doll"" image? 

 I'm thinking of dressing less feminine, and talking with a deeper voice. Maybe gaining some weight and building muscle might help too?",15Apr2019,3

156,"Hello my fellow (supposed)humans, i request advice. 

My wonderful 23 y/o boyfriend is deathly afraid of needles. He's been there through my own oral surgeries and other procedures. He has a black molar, no joke, with a hole going down deeper into the tooth. This causes his breath to smell a bit(it's whatever i love him lol) but that's just another sure sign his mouth is rotting. Can't an infection start up and spread else where? It's legit dangerous, right? He says he doesnt feel pain anymore, i wouldn't be surprised if he has lost feeling in that tooth. How can I help him? He refuses to go see a dentist and he would rather lose the tooth entirely than do anything about it. 

My s/o has a needle phobia and it is affecting his health, and I'm so very concerned.

I know i can't force anyone to do anything they don't want to.

Advice will most certainly be appriciated.",15Apr2019,1

24yo Male, started with twitching a month ago. Body wide. The twitching greatly subsided, as my anxiety decreased.

My feet have been cramping/aching for about the same time. Roughly 2.5 weeks. 

It just sucks and makes me somewhat anxious when I think about it.
Has anyone else dealt with this? Been to a physician?

161," So there is a girl I've known for a while. We were became friends early on, but over the last 2-3 months we became really good friends much more so than ever before. She invited me to go to a concert with her and her brothers friends to celebrate her brothers 21st birthday. We first went to her cousins house though. We smoked while I was there and I accidentally went into one of the other rooms while I was high trying to find the bathroom. She questioned me about it and I explained to her I thought it was the bathroom. She eventually let it go saying it was understandable but first questioned me for several minutes. She throughout the night periodically kept asking me if I was ok. After it got really late she finally dropped me off home. She was friendly to me in school the next two days, but I still wasn't sure if she was mad at me. So finally tonight I found out there is a party soon that we were both invited to by a mutual friend of ours. I texted her asking if she was coming. That was 3 hours ago and she still hasn't responded.Is this her way of ignoring me? If so then with a heavy heart I accept it, but I don't want to make conclusions either though.

Sister 2 was in school so we agreed to cover her portion until she graduated and until her bf found a job. 
Its been over a year and a half and Sis2 is out of school, bf still has no job (just watches their baby). They belive we should split it by room (3 ways). Me and sis1 think we should split it by adult in the house (4 ways)

171,"So for the past 3 years, my brother(29) has been a jerk. Okay so for the past 29 years he has been a jerk, but in the past 3 years he seriously troubled. He has lived in a house for nearly 10 years that my dad has payed for, and as of January 2019 my dad has made him start paying and sign a contact because my brother was supposed to be paying him all along. My brother threw a FIT. He lives there with his girlfriend and her daughter and they had a baby a year ago, and they have never paid my dad anything, and my dad is really sick with kidney disease. He has went septic twice in the past year and we don’t know if he’s gonna survive this but he wants to see my brother capable of taking care of his family without him and my brother said “why would I pay for a house I’m gonna inherit when he dies” he’s so entitled and thinks the world owes him. 

I’ve recently started going to the gym where is girlfriend works, and all she does is tell me all the gross details about there personal life. I know I can’t believe everything everyone says, but if a fraction of it is true, I’m disgusted. She claims my brother is a porn addict, (I already knew this, because he has destroyed both mine and my sisters computers, my nieces computer, my mothers computer and went through a couple of his own) his gf says he won’t have sex with her and told he just wants her there so he’s not alone. 

He sits on his ass playing video games when he’s not at work and Destroying their house with dishes and trash that he won’t wash or take out. They live in filth and it’s getting to a dangerous point for my nieces. 

My mother has been the reason his girlfriends daughter has had a birthday for the past 3 years. I’m the reason my niece had her first birthday last weekend. I planned everything, bought everything, invited everyone down to cleaned afterward. My brother had apparently taken too much Xanax the night before because he said he wanted to know what a Xanax high felt like. 

My brother is on “Keto Diet”. I put that in quotation because every weekend my brother gains back anything he lost previously because he sits down to 3 double cheeseburgers, a large frie, and a 20 pc chicken nugget from Macdonalds for lunch. Then he gets mad that his girlfriend is losing. 

All of this has been building up, but today the straw broke the camels back. 

My sister asked us to go to church with her. She asked me and my husband and 3 kids to go, and she asked my brothers little family. The church was having regular service then an Easter egg hunt and lunch for the kids. 

Last night I got a text that said “we won’t be able to make it tomorrow” they said the oldest child was sick. 
Me and my sister understood and moved on and went to church. 

I actually was enjoying the service despite holding my twins(6months) the entire time. When it was over, my husband took my oldest child outside to play and my sister and I went to the bathroom to change the twins. We finished and went outside and got a hamburger for lunch and i saw my husband waving me down. I looked and he pointed toward the gate and there was my brother and his little family leaving. He saw my husband and walked up to him and my husband told him the egg hunt was over. (I admit it didn’t last 10 minutes because my kid didn’t get any) but my brother got mad and told my husband he wished he hasn’t got up and dressed for this. 

We got back in the car and I got my phone out of my diaper bag and my phone had texts from my brother. 

“Don’t invite us to stuff if you aren’t gonna answer the phone and have us walk around like idiots” 

We both replied 

“Phones silent from church” 

He then blamed us for his girlfriends kid not getting to hunt fucking Easter eggs. He said “I hope y’all feel like Christians getting her hopes up” 

He bashed on Christianity despite my sister ignoring his messages for a while, then I told him I was done with him. I told his gf that I loved her and the kids but I couldn’t be around Jacob. He messaged me and told me he didn’t want me near any of them despite his girlfriend telling me that she loved me and wanted this to blow over. 

I’m not really a Godly person, but my sister is a single mother who hasn’t dated since her divorce and works 6 days a week and goes to church every Sunday and Wednesday and on sundays goes 2x. She is not overly religious but has found a place to feel safe at her church and I love that for her. My brother shit on everything for her today and she hasn’t done anything wrong. We didn’t know they were gonna call us in the middle of church to tell us they changed their minds and were coming. I don’t know what to do with my brother and I’m sorry for the rambling but I’m so frustrated. I want to never speak to him again, but my mom wants us all to be close. How can I be close to him when he treats our family like shit? He is waiting for our father to die so he doesn’t have to pay the smallest $500 a month rent to own to my dad. He hates my sister because she makes more money than him and has her life together. He hates me because I’m friends with his girlfriend. He loves my mom but doesn’t call her or text her or visit. He just talks to her when he gets tired of his kids and wants her to keep them. He tries to bring everyone around him down. Is this a mental illness? Is this just a lazy asshole? I want to know the best way to approach this situation. I know this sounds ridiculous and it lengthy but I’m begging for help.

173,"So, I'll start this off with saying, I dont believe that anyone is this scenario is right or wrong, I just dont know how to approach my situation. When I was young (11), my sibling started to sexually abuse me. We are half siblings so I only really saw him every other weekend. He had told me constantly that if I told anyone everyone would say I was lying or it was my own fault anyways. When I turned 13 he decided he didnt want to live with his mom anymore so he came to live with us. Because the amount of time increased so did the abuse. It got so bad that I was behaving terribly towards everyone as a cry for help. It fell on deaf ears though. Everything got so bad that when I was 15 my parents kicked me out. I had nowhere to go and my sister said j could come live with her while I finish highschool. My brother would often to come visit, and we fell into the same pattern. At this point I should mention my sister had a 4 year old daughter who at the time was visiting her paternal grandparents for a few months. Right before my niece was due to come home, I sucked up all my courage and told her what had been going on. And then all my nightmares became a reality. Because my behavior had been so bad, she didnt believe me. After that I moved in with a friend. I had left some stuff at my sisters not thinking. One of those items was my journal, where I documented everything. My sister realised her mistake and called my parents, soon after they let me come home. The last time I was my brother was on my 16th birthday 7 years ago. Well Easter is coming up and my parents have invited all of my siblings over. They think that he only touched me because we were close in age, and I was an easy opportunity. This shocks me because my mother went through a similar situation with her father (except he touched my mom and 150 other young girls). Has anyone been through this before? Is forgiving him possible?",15Apr2019,1

I've held these secrets, a few longer than the newest, but it's so tiring and I get so angry with her. And I feel so bad that my father just lets her get on SL instead of hanging out with him.

Secondly, they keep insisting to book flights later when it is cheaper to do it now.

I still have a year and a few months before college and even during college, I’d still come back in the summer and winter times. But the thought of the status quo changing and nothing being the same is eating at my heart rn. I actually had a breakdown because my parents have always been there for me and I’m scared for the time when they won’t. Stuff like video games and movies has kind of just floated out of my mind as all I can think about is the future and how I’m going to be in my own (even though i know my parents will always welcome me back and let me stay there).

I’m the kind of person who cares too much about the little things. I always day good night to my parents tidy and make sure everything is set for the next day before I go to bed. The whole routine changing and the thought that I would have to text my parents to say Gn and only see them once a month hurts my soul (don’t know how else to describe it).

I hate this so much, and every time I ask for advice I get told to do something completely different. I think I should stay out of it and ignore him ‘till he dies. My sis says I’ll regret not talking to him and I “need to be the adult in the situation.” Which I think is bullshit cuz I’m literally a minor. He’s fifty somethin’. I think I know which one of us is supposed to be the adult.

My reaction is always just to sit tight until it blows over, but I wish there were some way to get him to stop. 

Ignoring him seems to work for me, but should I be doing something more? For the record, last time I tried not ignoring him he tried to hit me cuz I said his hands smelled like dirty dishes. 

He’s an insufferable prick and a massive child, but sometimes we get along. It’s ridiculous cuz I’ve researched gaslighting and he ticks every box. He even had my mum on his side for a while. She was all “he doesn’t hit you that much.”. She’s better now but damn does it hurt to hear that. 

He’s nothing compared to my mum, she’s sweet and understanding, she watches Disney movies with me and laughs at my jokes. She got me into therapy and helps me learn French. Basically all I could ask for in a parent. Then my dad walks in, laughter dies and I wanna scratch my skin off.

This is pretty tough to deal with, if anyone has been in a similar situation and knows a way to fix any part of this I’d really appreciate it.

I can't seem to just enjoy it for 10 minutes and and log off. 

Even making this post took me more than an hour because I wanted to find the community that had the most people/most online people/most active people and then make sure the wording was perfect and clear and etc. etc. 

 It seemed so much easier to enjoy things for their own sake when I was younger. Now I feel trapped. How can I change this mindset?",15Apr2019,0

Mannnnnnnn.    So I wrote this shit out twice.   And it deleted both times.  


1.  Am I an asshole for asking her to quit? responses will vary, I really don’t care though.   I know myself and my tendencies, and though I get where y’all are coming from, but it’s easier to speak on things than it is to follow through.     So my ultimatum was best for us both.  

2. Is she still a ....       NOPE.   She quit it.   I offered to cover rent and daily living expenses until she could get a job and what not.  She however has a degree in the medical field.   401k, CD,  Rainy Day Fund, etc.  etc.    she’s fiscally fine, and didn’t allow me to help out. 

3.  Where are we now?    We’re both incredibly happy.   Honeymoon phase has molted away.... and now...  we’re Happy.   Comfortable.  And bonding.   

4. Regrets:  when I ask her if there are any (which I used to do often), she looks at me, grabs my face and kisses me.   She reassured me that it was a decision she made for herself, and not me.  For our future and not in spite of my jealousy.    
5. Future.    As of now, we’re enrolled in communications course at our local Community College.  We haven’t had any communication issues; it’s just I/we want to prepare for any in the future.   I want us to be civilized, try and not hold grudges, find a sane, respectful and effective way to communicate our differences and resolve whatever we can.   
6. Love?   I know she’s the one.   I’ve known for a while.   It’s not just her looks, her beauty, but more so her inner being.    I see how she treats those less fortunate whenever we go out; she reminds me of my mother. Psych majors in here can say what they want; but I see in her the mother of my children, someone I can Invest my time in, and be myself around 




Conclusion.    We happy as fuck.  It’s not the honeymoon phase, it’s “our phase”.    I don’t really care for the negative speech that’s about to come; how you can’t turn a how into a housewife.   Etc.  etc.",15Apr2019,1

Her mom is crazy emotional and has kicked her out regularly only to call her back in the next day. But this time it seems for good. Her mom is giving her until Thursday to get out. The reason for the kick out seems to be that her mom is unhappy with how my gf is spending her money.

My gf is fairly responsible with how she spends her money. Yet her mom is pissed that she spends so much on food and eating out, yet hasn't asked my gf to pay any rent or bills instead. She's just pissed at my gf.

199,"I am 20 years old. It is my first year of college but due to AP credits and classes I have passed already I am a sophomore. I messed up my second semester of college pretty bad. I was taking five classes, had to drop one. Now I am taking four. I am failing two out of the four pretty miserably. I passed all five of my classes first semester. I was very depressed then but it was the first semester and I wanted to make a good impression so I was more motivated. 

I was very depressed during most of my second semester, worse than I have ever been before. My campus is too small and boring for me I feel and I did not like living here. I also broke up with my girlfriend in a sort of traumatic way for me (found out she had been cheating on me, left me for one of my friends, dumped me over text and said some really mean things to me) and I am finally starting to recover and realize there was an abusive, toxic dynamic to the relationship that dragged me down. The summer before school started my sister also unexpectedly passed away. This weekend I was prescribed Zoloft after I could not take how depressed I was feeling anymore. I was calling the suicide hotline nearly every night this semester just for someone to talk to. 

Now it’s almost the summer but I am very stressed at the hit my GPA will take and feeling like I am behind in credits. I also just don’t know what to do with my future. My plan for the summer is to complete four goals: 1. Work a job and make a lot of money, 2. Exercise and get fit and get better at basketball, 3. Start performing stand up live, one of my dreams, and 4. Do a psychedelic drug like shrooms and try to think about my future to see if I have any realizations. 

Does anyone have any advice about what I should do about my grades? Or how I should spend this summer? I don’t know what to do about this feeling that I am behind my peers.

Firstly, he doesn’t do ANY chores in the house. He also doesn’t get his own food, water, milk, dessert etc. Everything either my parents give to him or they make me and my sister give to him. Whenever I try to argue with them, they always say he’s little and some other bullshit excuses. If he’s sitting and ready to eat, and he forgets his water or something, his excuse for not getting it himself is he’s “about to eat.”

He’s so lazy it actually hurts to think about. He literally doesn’t do anything. Never gets homework so he sits around on his phone all day

He also can’t go into another room by himself without another person being there. So if he needs to get something in another room, he forces someone, mostly me to come in and get it with him. Recently, he can’t go to the bathroom without somebody being outside it or near him. He also doesn’t close the door to the bathroom because he’s scared. I’ve tried to help him get over his fear, but nothing works. If I tried to suggest to my parents talking to someone about this to help, they would flip out and keep telling me that I should be able to fix his fear. 

On the weekends, he wakes up my dad early in the morning so someone can come with him to the living room while he watches TV. My dad works so long on the weekdays, and I feel so bad that my brother makes him wake up but he doesn’t do anything about it. 

He also is spoiled and gets anything he wants.  I don’t know what to do, every-time I try and talk to my parents about him, they criticize and dismiss what’s going on. It’s been making me so frustrated for years. Any advice would be appreciated :)",15Apr2019,1

Just for some context, I had a crush for my friend and I told her how I felt, however she rejected me. Then she asked me to give her some time which I actually gave her. After a month and half she started talking to me again, this happened by the end of the semester. I was really glad that she spoke to me again cause I thought it was over. During vacations I didn't message her as much as I used to, but from time to time I'd send her a message or memes. Things seemed to be back to normality, until we were back in school, the first few days were pretty normal till the second week I noticed she was acting weird with me, and by weird I mean that she wouldn't want to see me or speak to me. This was really a sudden change so I asked her what was happening, she told that she doesn't feel comfortable with me but she believes this is going to get fix but not soon. Since then we haven't really talk, we've had some short conversations and we still say hi to each other if we bumped into in school. 

I giving her some space, again. To be honest, I'm feeling down that I may lose a 8 year old friendship just because I had feelings for her although she said that that was just 5% of the reasons she isn't talking to me, but my guess says that that's 100%

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started an engineering internship at a company. I really enjoyed the position until my manager hired a full-time engineer (younger than me) who has a few issues which I assume stem from aspergers. 

The hired man is very abrasive, especially when pointing out mistakes and it conflicts with how I would go about meshing  and cooperating with others. He does appear to have an elitist attitude when dealing with others which I assume stems from aspergers syndrome. 

On top of that, my desk is being moved right next to his in an open arrangement. He already likes to walk over to my desk multiple times a day and critique what I am working on. I usually have to close all of my tabs and try to maintain a conversation which is painfully difficult and slow/one-sided. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall this is very exhausting as I have a lot to deal with already in daily life. I do sympathize with him, as I do have a few symptoms of ASD myself which I manager, but I don't enjoy having my work constantly critiqued in a non-professional way. It is very exhausting to have your work picked apart without tact when you already deal with a lot in daily life and at school . 

&amp;#x200B;

The only way that I feel like I can deal with this issue is to make a fuss about it to my manager, but then I am the one with the problem. I know that I will not enjoy having my desk next to his in the next months. Should I be looking for another position somewhere else?

&amp;#x200B;

I am very confused because my manager is one of the smartest men that I have known for a long time, but yet this hired person appears to be a completely incorrect fit for the department I work in, and now they appear to want to make us (the new hire and I) work together by putting our desks close together.  I feel like I have been lumped in with him which is a little ....insulting honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated. Maybe I am analyzing the situation wrong?

thanks.",15Apr2019,1
208,"Hi, I’m a bit new to this and sorry for the format since I’m doing this on mobile.

I (23f) have a friend (23M) who admitted he likes me more than a friend, and it has started to really bother me recently.

Let’s call this friend of mine John. John is not my type of guy for a relationship. He’s sarcastic, witty, and geeky: Great qualities for a friend. But he’s not attractive to me, really socially awkward, and doesn’t hold many interests that I have (we only share maybe two common interests) and this makes me feel really uncomfortable. 

Some more background:
He admitted he was attracted to me a couple years ago actually. But things have always felt kind of awkward for me. We could only visit each other once during the summer and one of us would host while the other went to their house. I’m now starting to dread summer because of how uncomfortable things are. My sister and my mom say that his family treats me like I’m his girlfriend and I’m starting to believe it. I really don’t know how to bring up summer with John and I really don’t want to do it.


What’s happened recently is this:

I feel really really bad but I told John I’m not going to a concert in his city even though I am. I actually didn’t want to take him to the concert at all (because of multiple reasons listed below) and of course- knowing my luck- he was the first friend to ask if I wanted to go with him. I lied and said another friend wants to go. I bought two tickets and I’m taking an internet friend (Let’s call her Mary) - who actually likes the band unlike John.

John doesn’t really know anything about this band, he isn’t a party kind of guy, and our relationship has started to make me feel uncomfortable.

I feel worse because I’ve only recently met Mary, but she LOVES the band, wants to party hard, and- Is very comfortable to be around with.

I feel even MORE worse because I think I might be attracted to someone else- and that’s a WHOOOLE ‘nother can of worms for a different post. 

I feel really bad because I had to lie because John would be hurt that I didn’t want him, and chose someone I’ve recently met, over him. I also feel bad because I have NO idea how to properly break up as a friend and I know I’m one of his VERY few number of friends. But I’m really uncomfortable, and I dread when I have to talk about things with him. I used to have a lot of fun with John- He’s hilarious and very witty. But this is just so uncomfortable for me....

I’ve said uncomfortable a lot... Sorry

If you have any ideas on what I should do please tell me. But I just can’t tell him the truth about the concert. It would devastate him.",15Apr2019,1

information: 20 years old, female, 154cm and ~43kg currently. 

i started to notice that i’ve gained so much body fat recently which is expected because i don’t do any physical activity at the moment. I used to run 5km, 4 times a week but stopped since April has been a very stressful month for university so i have very limited time. In addition to that, i don’t eat healthily and rarely pay attention to the food i eat. i mostly eat bread, rice (asian tingz), and takeout. oh and i snack a lot. 

i feel good when i gain weight because i’ve always had trouble with it, but that is not what’s happening. i weighed myself this morning and found out that i actually lost 2kg in a span of 2 weeks and i have no idea how... i also missed my period this month which i think is a cause of my sudden weight loss.

i don’t understand how i can be storing all this body fat and losing weight at the same time.

i know my lifestyle is not ideal and i am hoping to change that once this semester ends. i’ve been really busy but i’m still looking for anything that i can do atm.

Lately, when she found out that a group of girls she barely knows got high grades, she kept saying how did they get these grades in a serious manner. She was really annoyed.

I also asked her if my grandmother who we both love dearly died tomorrow and didn’t get a chance to get a authentic baptism by her standards would she go to heaven? Her answer was the same. My heart immediately shattered. My personal belief is that obviously you should be baptized if you can, but as long as you accept God, Jesus Christ into your heart and be the best figure of yourself you can, you will be accepted by him, this is also what she thought until she started attending this new church. This goes for everyone to me, no one is going to be denied by their lack of access to a baptism or didn’t get baptized in time of their passings. 
I feel like shit, this is the first time my mother have been wrong in my eyes, the first time she has said something like this to me. Half of me is heartbroken she thinks such a way, Half of me wants to believe her now. I don’t know what I’m looking for, maybe how to act with her? maybe how to help her and myself? how to feel at peace? I love God and I don’t want me or my relationship with him or my mother to suffer from this. I just want to know how to interact, how to still be respectful. 

Im sorry if this isn’t the right sub. I’m sorry if this is all over the place and unclear. This just happened and I feel like a wreck and like I can’t stand the thought of being around her, like I wouldn’t know what to say to her . Feel free to ask question so I can clear anything up/explain further. 

TLDR: My mom said if I killed myself I would go to hell because my baptism didn’t meet the criteria she believes/people need to be “actually” baptized to get in to heaven. How do I handle being around her, act with her, how to not feel worthless etc.",15Apr2019,2

Instead, she just opened my snap but never responded. I am really confused as to why she did this since our conversation was nice and a bit flirty. In fact, she was the one that came up to me and started talking.

My friend is in a tight money situation and he's in high school too-- we're both freshmen.

My state allows consent if you're 13, (which I'm older than), and is kind of known for its child sex trade. Kiddies are sold constantly and extremely cheaply, and are used for porn and/or nude selling CONSTANTLY. We've kind of adapted to it, we don't get too attached to friends we know live in families who are gonna sell them off.

I don't live in one of these crazy crime families myself, but my family is absent for the most part.

I found an offer that can instantly save my friend from his family's financial hell, but it's not a pretty one. Basically, I'll go into human trafficking and make 160/h, but I'm basically giving up my mental and physical well being for it.

I'm only having second thoughts because I don't want to get cut up and sold on the black market or something.

236,"Hey everyone. First time Reddit post.

About two years ago, I was in a nasty car accident with my best friend, one that took his life as he lay next to me. I still think about this a lot. It still haunts me. He was like a brother to me, and I mention him everyday (much to other people's apparent discomfort). The driver was drunk behind the wheel and hit us head on in a huge truck. I was airlifted, but ultimately ended up walking out of the hospital with cuts and bruises, but the real damage is something that nobody can see. I feel mentally slower, unable to sleep or concentrate most of the time, and what once was a very active spiritual life has become basically an inner monologue.

I am currently medicated for depression and go to therapy regularly, and I feel like I have made genuine progress. That being said, I am a shell of what I was. I am aware that I will have to face this man who hit us, and killed my friend, in court soon, and was wanting to know if anyone had any actual advice or experience dealing with forgiveness and my role in the legal process (likely as the only witness). Not asking for legal advice, just someone's experience who has been through something similar. Basically, I am inviting anyone who may know how I'm feeling to tell me what worked for them and how their situation worked out.

Thank you guys in advance.",15Apr2019,2
237,"My roommate and I are pretty close. We’ve known each other for three years and in a way I often look up to him for wisdom and advice about our profession. 

Anyways, I’m best friends with his ex girlfriend. I got close to her while they were still together and often times we would hang out with the three of us and have a grand old time. 

He really does love her but she broke up with him and he was devastated. He isolated himself and wasn’t himself for a good while. Five months later, and he seems to be doing so much better. He goes to the gym, improves his grades, texting and checking out girls, etc... 

During the breakup, he said that it was okay for me to still be friends with his ex. Even after a month, the three of us were able to hang out together minus the physical touches that they both would do together.

So one day, I was ranting to my roommate about a guy that I was sorta interested and mentioned that my best friend (his ex) said “yeah I would be interested in him too if it wasn’t for this, that, etc...” he shut me down and didn’t want to hear it anymore. After we got home he said that I was okay but he doesn’t want to hear that his ex is interested in someone else because he still very much loves her. 

It’s been almost a week now and he’s isolated himself in his room again and barely says anything to me without me coming to him. (Like during the initial breakup.) A few days ago I asked if we were okay and he said, “if I have any issues with you, I’ll let you know.” That really didn’t help at all and now I’m scared that he doesn’t wanna be my friend anymore.

241,"My close friend experienced sexual trauma as a child. Obviously I want to be supportive. However, I believe he is embellishing his tale. He adds details that seem unrealistic, and blames current medical problems on the assault that I believe couldn't logically have anything to do with it.

He called me tonight drunk and wanted to talk about it. I found that I had little patience and ended the call as quickly as I could.

I think victims should be believed and validated but parts of his story really seem fabricated or exaggerated. I find it really taxing to listen to, because I'm not sure what's real and what's fiction. I believe that hr really was assaulted and that he has developed this tendancy to exaggerate as a result of being emotionally neglected as a child. He will not see a therapist and tends to shun professional help generally, as he feels he knows better. If I try to talk to him about the embellishments he gets extremely defensive and makes me feel like an unssuportive friend.

When I was younger (ages 7-10) I had multiple medical procedures to correct ureter and bladder issues. Obviously..that means I had to get looked at in my nether regions. A lot. 
Long story short, I developed a fear of doctors during this time of my life. 

The fear has followed me into my young adult life. I am comfortable enough to see a doctor for anything that doesn't involve taking off my pants.

At 21, women are expected to get pap smears.. I can't make appointments with my primary doctor without it being brought up. At one point, I made an appointment for a pap smear but didn't go. The whole week or so leading up to the appointment was spent panicking and crying. I haven't seen my primary since because I dread having to get this procedure.

I've talked to a counselor and she suggested that I tell my doctor and get some kind of medication to calm down before the procedure. I think I'd definitely need this but I feel I will still feel traumatized. 

Maybe if it wasn't something women have to get consistently (every 2 years), it wouldn't be so bad. I get so worked up over just the thought of it that I feel like, even if it's done, I'll never be able to relax because 2 years later I'll be doing it all over again.

The level of discomfort and the stress this gives me honestly makes me think that if I had something like cervical cancer, my quality of like would be lessened so much from undergoing treatment that I don't see the worth in these tests..

Is there a way to just.. Opt out? I would rather be able to see my doctor without having to do procedures like this than avoid going to the doctor altogether.",15Apr2019,1

Now, my mum earnt back custody of my sister a few months back, but a few days ago she lost custody again. Drugs, if you're wondering. Point is, she is already not in a very good mood, as an understatement.
Since I was little, i've had very long hair. But a few of my carers have had me cut it short- just below shoulder, usually- and my mum flipped her absolute shit. Things like ""girls are supposed to have long hair"", ""she'll never find a boyfriend now"" (keep in mind, the oldest I was last time was 8).

This time though, it was entirely my choice. My hair was waist length when I walked into the hairdressers, and I had a concave bob when I came out. I feel awesome, like that black haired woman from 'the meg'. 

The problem is, because it was my choice, my mum can't blame it on a carer this time, and I honestly think she might disown me when i see her next; that may sound absurd, but this woman is high on ice and pot most of the day, so she isn't exactly the most sound of mind, and almost disowned me when I told her I didn't want to do overnight visitation anymore, due to the smell of pot. It gave me migraines.

My bf and I use the pull out method (which i know won't always be 100% effective) but my period is late for 10 days so far and i'm getting worried. I am not on any other form of contraceptive but was supposed to start taking birth control pills after my next period (which still hasn't come yet)

We had anal sex on the 12th (right when my period ended) (i know you can't get pregnant from that) but i'm not sure if any dripped down on something ? I took a plan b pill about 38 hours later just to be sure. After that, we still had unprotected sex maybe 4-5 times since which in hindsight is stupid and i regret it.

Exactly a week later, i started to bleed for about 5 days which i read was a normal side effect for plan b. The doctor told me that my period should come on time and that if it didn't,  i should take a pregnancy test. Took a pregnancy test 4 days ago, showed negative after waiting the duration the box stated for, and waited another 5 minutes more just to be sure. My worry is that it is a house brand pregnancy test kit and that it may not be as accurate?

253,"So here is the long story short, me and my boyfriend been dating for a couple months on and off and we just recently made it official. 
Things have been great between us but there has been something that’s been bothering me so much and I just can’t seem to let it go. 
My boyfriend isn’t like the best person at showing feelings but with me he tries really hard and he is super sweet. 
The only problem is that he won’t show me affection in front on friends and he won’t tell our mutual friends that we are together. 
We could be hanging with them at a party and I have to pretend that nothing is going on. 
It makes me feel so bad to have to hide my feeling and lie to people. He’s told other friends and family. It’s just that the mutual friends the won’t tell. 
I just feel like he’s embarrassed and ashamed to be with me.. like it’s ok to tell other friends and family cause they haven’t met me yet but to tell people that know me would be embarrassing for  him. I’ve talked to him about this before and he just says that we can tell them later when we’ve been together for a while and that he doesn’t want our relationship to affect the group.

257,"My ex and I were together for a little more than a year. He told me early on in the relationship that he was joining the Air Force. I was in my last year of nursing school and while I knew long distance was difficult, I was willing to try to put in the effort. 

We made it through basic training and tech school (a total of about 5 months). While he was in basic, he didn’t have his phone, and he wrote to me every day. We still felt very strongly about the relationship. At this point, I graduated nursing school, landed a job in the ICU, and used this time to focus on personal development. We were both independent people working on our own goals. 

However, while he was in tech school, our communication started to lack. We had very different schedules and while we tried to FaceTime every day, either 1) he would get frustrated that I wasn’t able to talk due to hanging out with friends, etc. 2) it felt so routine. “How are you? How was your day?” The same thing over and over. 

Not to say that with long distance, you will hit that wall of boring communication. On top of that, I told him about my own personal goals about growing as an individual, aka “finding myself in my 20s”, and using this time to plant my feet and dive into not only this career, but meet my own personal goals. 

However, meeting my own goals turned into my ex trying to keep tabs on my progress more than necessary. While he is very disciplined and a go-getter, he would constantly ask me “well have you done ___ yet?” “When are you going to ___?” It felt like he was parenting me, and when I would reach one of my goals, having him act this way made it feel like I wasn’t just doing it for myself, but for him. 

I have been in and out of relationships since high school. I feel as if there is a very big difference growing as an individual in a relationship vs. being alone. Long story short, my ex (who at the time I was still with) came home, and I felt more than anything that I needed my own space to grow. Not only because it felt like he was pressuring me to meet these goals, but because I would like the opportunity to be by myself and learn how it feels to make your own life a priority. Long distance is also very draining, and a lot of work. Especially staring out in this career and trying to manage everything else. 

Before he left for his permanent base, he was home for about a week (this was 2 weeks ago). Towards the end of this, I realized more and more that while things are good while he’s here, that I still didn’t feel right in this relationship. I wasn’t able to put my finger on exactly why this was, but from what I can say I knew, I wanted to have the time to get to know myself and spend this time not worrying about the long distance aspect of this relationship. It’s a “right person, wrong timing” kind of scenario. 


I broke things off the night before he left to go to his new base. We sat in my car and I explained to him, completely and calmly, that I didn’t feel as if this was the right thing for me at this time in my life. And that he, also, did not deserve to have someone who was not 100% willing to make the long distance work.

He was taken back but we ended things. This was 2 weeks ago. 

Tonight, he reached out casually, texting saying “hi ___, while I don’t want to disrespect your space, I read a book you recommended, and I really enjoyed it. I hope you’re doing well”  

I responded, because I am not going to disregard someone that was (and still is) important to me. Long story short, he asked to call me on the phone. 

We talked on the phone and I asked him how he was coping with this all. He started asking about how things contributed to the break up, and tried to understand why I wanted to be alone. He was quite understanding and very sincere. 

Then he stated that he could take leave this weekend to come home and talk. I asked him if this was really what he wanted to do- I even asked if he was really coming home to just see me. He said I was a big part of it. I told him that I have pretty much made up my mind. He asked me if I have been happier since the break up, and I told him (and this is exactly how I feel) that I have felt that I have more independence at this point and have been able to really focus on myself. It’s been so refreshing to focus on myself, only, after so long. 

I then asked him if he really wanted to use some of his leave time to come home this weekend. I told him I was worried that he wanted to get back together, and that I would disappoint him. My mind is mostly made up. 

He told me that regardless of the outcome, he has no expectations for the situation at hand. He would be okay with whatever happens, and that this trip would be worth talking again in person. He said it would make him feel much better in the long run. 

At this point I told him, okay, we can talk in person. 

I’m just very, very conflicted on how to feel about all of this. 

He is an amazing man and he was so rational throughout the breakup and this whole conversation. I want to put myself first like I originally said, but of course a part of me will consider the “what if” 

I need to figure out what I will say to him if he comes home this weekend. There’s so much to consider. Do I just cut things off and move on? Do I consider making things work out? There’s a lot to consider. 

Any/all advice is appreciated. Just looking for an outside view.",15Apr2019,1

I currently live in a college dorm room with another roommate. We are both male, and we both have girlfriends.

This next part is me giving as much detail as possible solely for the purpose of getting a grasp of the situation. The sticky substance was in large quantities and thickest around my butthole. Some of the substance had started to dry on the most external part of my butt cheeks, but it was still sticky and wet the 'deeper' you go, if you will. At this point in time, I still don't really comprehend what I was experiencing, I just thought it was weird, gross, and I wanted it off me. I'm still groggy at this point and I stumble down the hall to take a shower. Now this is when a spike of anxiety went through me, when I got in the shower, the shower was immediately filled with that smell. If you haven't had sex, cum has a certain smell, and as a man who has sex and knows his body I know what cum smells like, and this was cum. 

At the time of writing this, I really have no idea what happened. Our door is deadbolted at night and my roommate really doesn't strike me as any type of predator. 

I've convinced myself that what happened is that I had a wet dream, my underwear got twisted up shortly before I woke up and it ended up around my nether regions.

A scary thing that I cannot get out of my mind is how when I was taking a number 2 today, I couldn't help but notice it was uncomfortable.

I have no idea what to do. I told my girlfriend all this she has no idea what to do or what happened. Do I talk to my roommate? What do I ask him? Do I go to authorities? I'm kind of at a loss for words as this was one of the strangest circumstances I've ever been in, and quite honestly I don't know how I feel right now. I'm looking for any and all advice. For all I know this could entirely be my anxiety thinking, and it could have been all my doing by some miracle, and I came all over my own ass.",15Apr2019,3
259,"Soo there's this girl in my class. She's one of my best friends and bi (I'm a girl btw). Last year we pretended to be girlfriends just for fun. We'd hold hands and stuff (no kissing of course).  Then she told me she was bi and we kinda stopped, cause I didn't really know what to think of that, even though I didn't have a problem with it. Then, a few months ago, this thing started again, cause I wanted to marry in the great hall of Harry Potter (I think u can do that) and when she heard me saying that, she wanted to marry there too and then we said, we wanted to marry there. We were engaged from that moment on and we planned our wedding. We even bought engagement rings and rings for the marriage. I wear my engagement ring everyday and carry the other rings in my purse. So we are like fun together and engaged. And we flirt a lot. Like per phone and in real live. I care for her a lot and I'm always excited when I get her texts and stuff. I just don't know if I'm in love with her or if she's just a super close friend. I just don't know what to think anymore and I'm very confused. We have so much in common and we can talk about anything and I just feel so very close to her. I miss her soooo much, cause she was ill for like one week (I visited her and brought her a stuffed animal and ice cream) and now she's on vacation and I just miss her so much and I don't know, if I should talk to her about that. I don't even really know what I feel. I'm not really bi, but I really really like her. Idk if I should risk our friendship to confess. And on top of that, I'm gonna do one year abroad and I might wanna stay there for a prettttty long time (forever or to study) and I don't know if it would be smart to confess to her, when I'm going away anyways.

261,"Okay so backstory. Ever since I was a little girl I’ve wanted to change my name. It started out because I hated the sound of my name. First I wanted to change it to Rosey, then other pretty names I heard from other girls in my class, then for the last 3 years I have gone by Elizabeth. 

I hate my real name. It has a tie to my birth father that is a complete asshole and choose my name. That was my parents deal, if it was a girl he chose the name, of it was a boy my mom would.  Any who now I don’t speak to this man and he is a possessive stalker that although hates I support my moms and her bfs relationship I know he still keeps tabs on me online. So a while back I decided Elizabeth would be my online name and the name I will eventually change to legally. My whole name would change to Elizabeth and my mother’s last name. 

Thing is. people in my personal life know me by my real name and some people I’m comfortable with I tell them that I would like to change my name to Elizabeth. 

But thing is I have meet my bf’s family now and they all know me by “Liz”, he knows about this and we both agreed that I’d like be introduced as Elizabeth. I am finally comfortable being called Elizabeth or Liz and proud people know me by the name I like rather than my real name. Only I really fucked up today when I went to get coffee with my bf, his brother, and his gf and gave the cashier my real name. Once it slipped out, there I was stuck on lying or just going with it, so I just went with it. Now my bf’s brother has asked me why I said another name and I had to explain, I hate being tied with this situation and honestly sometimes upsets me a bit. But now that the cat is out of the bag, what should I do with this situation I put myself in? 

I do notice that if I met someone who didn’t tell me their real name I would have a bit of trust issues. But honestly I just would like to get rid of my real name. I hate it and who that girl was back then. I’ve changed and I want my real name to be Elizabeth and it feels so damn good just being known by that name and not my real name. 

Sorry this is quite long but what should I do? Should I talk to his parents and explain my situation? Is this as serious as I think it is or am i overthinking? And how should I tell other people about this? I want to be known as Elizabeth and not my legal name but it’s quite complicated when in college they roll call you by your legal name and Elizabeth has no correlation with your actual name. I’m stuck and frustrated and ashamed and sad that people think it’s odd but I’d like to be just known as Elizabeth.",15Apr2019,1

264,"Hi. So I'm a 20 year old male, I've been struggling with a decision that's very difficult. Which is whether or not to move out. My girlfriend and I have talked and we both are heartbroken anytime we have to say goodbye(long distance 2 hours away.) At this rate were seeing each other every other weekend all weekend. Shes asked me to move to her town and get a place with her and us start our life together. I have no commitments here job wise. However, I live with my grandfather, mother and her boyfriend. My grandfather is above 80 years of age and last summer my grandmother passed away at a nursing home which was out of our control(long story.) I'm afraid if I move out, I'll regret it if anything happens and I cant be here for him like I couldnt for her. But friends have told me you cant put life on hold for that reason. What do you guys think?",15Apr2019,1
265,"Backstory: First of all, I'm 24. No shame in asking for advice about this. I'm 24 and I've only just gotten my learner's permit. I know. Rewinding back to when I was 16, a brave, courageous young girl wanted to study and get her permit. When I asked.. my parents refused. (Mostly my mom.) I was told l'd have to wait until I was 18... fast forward and we have an 18 year old, anxiety ridden and not ready to face driving. Fast forward again to 24; still scared, but my dad's boss essentially talked him into forcing me to get on the road, whether I was ready or not. 2 months later I passed the test and got my permit.

Present day: Now I'm learning how to drive. This comes with mistakes and rough patches, but 2 months into this and I'm not as afraid as when we first started. MY PROBLEM IS.. my parents. My dad was bugging me to drive all the time and then I finally gave in and actually began asking my dad to let me drive him places so I could get in more experience. Now that I'm asking to drive him places.. I've never more frequently heard the phrase ""Ughhh.. I don't want to do that."" from my dad.

Finally today he admitted he doesn't like ""going slow""... mind you, I always go the speed limit or 5mph under it through curves. I'm a new driver; not a bad one, but I don't exactly feel comfortable going the speeds my dad drives when he's had his liscence for 40 years and I haven't. 

It's not fair. I've explained it to him in every way I can. For an inexperienced driver, higher speeds = less control of the vehicle. I don't feel safe going above 45 yet and don't even NEED to drive above 45 due to speed limits. It's just discouraging.

I have my mom telling me I'm not ready to drive (even though she's been bugging me TO drive as well..) This was a conversation that took place between me and my dad while on the road today.
Dad: ""If I were behind you I would've been pissed off, honking the horn and gone around you at this point.""
Me: *going the speed limit* ... ""I'm going the speed limit. It's the law.""
Dad: ""Don't you go all moral on me.""
Me: ""Its not morals?? It's the law?? As in if I don't abide by it I can get pulled over?""
Dad: ""I'm just not used to these speeds. It's too slow for me. I'm used to being speedy.""
Me: ""You're not even driving. I'm learning.. Besides I'm sure you'd rather me be 'slow' and inside the lines and safe than being faster and crash or something cause I can't control my vehicle well at high speeds yet.""
Dad: ""It's just slow. I don't have the patience for that.""
Me: ""I'm already dealing with people who don't have patience for me all around my car right now and I'm going the speed limit. I don't need you being impatient too.""

Argument continues.. it's essentially just a back and forth of him saying he wants to go faster and me saying it's not safe for me to drive as fast as a driver with 40 years experience can...
Anyway this leads to me giving him the wheel on the way back. He takes us on the freeway and says ""See THIS is where I'M at home..."" whilst going 60...

My dad claims he is not rushing me to get my liscence.. but while we're driving, everything he says points to it seeming like he already wants me to be good at everything, have everything memorized, and act like I've got 40 fu*#ing years of experience under my belt. I'm not BAD.. but God do I feel useless and incapable. They want me to learn, then cut off my ability to learn by saying they dont feel like driving with me, making me feel like shit every time I'm ""too slow"" or make one abrasive turn out of my other 10 smooth ones.

I don't know what else to do. I'm not ready to test for my license so I can drive without anyone.. I don't have enough practice in to feel confident enough for that. Yet I feel like sh!t every time I do drive because of the way my dad treats it like my learning handicap is such a huge burden. It makes me not want to drive at all, but that would leave me back at square one. With me not driving and them bothering me to grow up and gtf out of the house.

(Please.. please please help. I can obviously recognize that this is an unhealthy situation but I have no money and no job, so I can't leave. I've put in applications and have a couple interviews for this week. Please don't think I'm not trying. I am.. I just haven't been allowed to do much, even as an adult. It's the way I was raised. I'm trying to advance myself now.. that's why I need your advice.)

I do have ONE friend who has offered to drive with me.. I didn't want to be a bother to her.. but do you think I should just take the car and go with her so I can learn how to drive with someone who doesn't treat me so poorly? Any advice would be appreciated..",15Apr2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in my first year of graduate school, I've been very introverted for my whole life but lately I'm making big progress. When we were still in highschool my friends occasionally went to parties etc.. I would always decline their invites because I was so shy. We are a group of 5 and 4 of us are still together in graduate school now. Because I always declined the invites they would stop inviting me because they would already know the answer (and I understand that). A while ago they asked me to download snapchat, so I did and they added me in their groupchat. Now I always see snaps of them and my older friend together having fun at for example a bar. It seems so fun and I really want to try it now I'm not so shy anymore. I don't know either how they plan all this, I don't hear them talk about it in the groupchat or in person. I feel left out but I don't know what to do.

268,"so about 5 months ago I was on my bf’s phone when he was ko drunk bc I had this weird hunch. caught him cheating through dating apps and through this secondary snapchat where he’d msg/send nudes to the girls from said dating apps. confronted him and decided to forgive him+stay. 

2 months ago, caught him again and he again sobbed and begged and said he’d change so I stayed. ik it’s so dumb of me to stay but he’s my first love and I really felt that he could change.

rn idk I felt a bit suspicious last week but just asked him directly bc there’s really nothing to lose at this point. he said nothing’s going on which I think I trust? not really sure but I’m trying to. 

anyways, our anniv was pretty recent but it didn’t really feel like it. we were both busy which was fine but he didn’t even prepare for it (ex. didn’t get nice clothes for dinner, didn’t even get me flowers or a gift bc “the shipping got cancelled”). before heading over we smoked a bit but then he ended up too high for our date so he was just kinda quiet. we didn’t even get pictures together and then when I told him I was bummed about the lack of, he said “send me the ones you took of me, I looked good” it just makes me feel like he doesn’t genuinely care. this may sound superficial but those are things I told him make me feel good/matter to me. bc though I hate doing certain things (driving, cleaning, etc) I still do it bc I love him but he doesn’t even do the bare minimum for me. I literally had to beg him to make me breakfast for a good 3 min

we rarely go anywhere. stuck at his place bc of work which I understand. it’s just that he says that he’s doing it for “us” and for “me” but he has never put any of that to an actual date or to ever get me anything. and what’s the point of saying it’s for us when all we do is just wither away at his place even when he’s actually finally free from work?

I’m not sure if I’m just slowly getting exhausted of that routine or realizing I deserve more or if I’m just slowly falling out of love but it doesn’t feel the same when he kisses me, I’m not as excited anymore. but in the same time I’m not sure bc what if I’m just having a mood swing?? idk I’m just scared for what is to come and I don’t think I wanna lose him either sos",15Apr2019,2
269,"About 1.5 years ago my gf broke up with me, with literally no build up. Madly in love in the morning, complete dissolving when i get back home from work. The following weeks she behaved in a very painful way and i haven’t seen or phoned her since then. The whole thing happened right before we planned to move together somewhere where she had better job opportunities, where already had signed a contract and found an apartment for 2. all that ended for me in depression, lost money, and a quit job and i couldn’t get a new one since then, aside from part time and burning up my savings.

She insisted she wanted to maintain a friendly relationship and that i look back fondly on our time together, and that we talk from time to time. So i tried that. 
Frankly, for a year she basically accused me of sending intrusive texts, even if it was just „hey, you‘re favorite band is in town, you might wanna grab a ticket before they‘re sold out“, or „how‘s work?“. She wouldn’t make contact herself, because she says any friendship has to develop naturally, and working for that is forcing it.
So, around christmas i decided to just stop trying to be a nice person every 2 months or so and just don’t text anymore. 
On Saturday she texted, she was somewhere around my hometown (i don’t live there) and thouht of me and texted „what‘s up?“.
I wanted to be polite and answer, but i have no idea what. She excluded herself from my life, even if i considered her someone i could trust enough to give actual information about my life (and i have learned to be very selective about that), there is nothing she‘d have context for. I couldn‘t tell her about friends because she doesn’t know them, about work because she never showed interested, about my problems finding a job with my degree because well, it‘s not entirely not her fault the situation is like this. When i tried that before she accused me of trying to make her jealous of the fun i‘m having without her.
I have really no idea what to tell her. Last night i texted „nothing much, have fun there!“.

Am i being impolite? Should i follow up with something? I don’t feel exactly joyous at the idea of interacting with her. I only have this vague echo of a memory of a best friend.",15Apr2019,1

TL;DR in bottom 


My school took my class to an shooting range to teach the basics of fire arms.  (Military personnel)

On of the lessons was that they tought us the difference between war stick and training bullets...

So the had a bunch of AK-47 magazines ( 30 clip size). And started the lesson, after that were done through a line we could take a look at the magazines,
And I was last in line... and when the supervisor turned around to take call from the radio(something about a leaking pipe in the basement)I took my chance and took an ENTIRE MAGAZINE and put it in the huge pocket of my jacket...

And after we fired a bunch of 1911’s the started to search us and our bags.      But not our jackets .

So when it was my turn I handed the jacked to a teacher and went to be searched with my bag. I got away with it.

I didn’t tell my friend about anything .  
And good thing to cuz the next day our principal told us about a theft in the range. 

Anyway I have 30 war stock rounds and an empty magazine.

TL;DR:I’m a high schooler and stole from the military

274," 

Just for a bit of backstory I have a brother that is a year and a half younger than me.

When I was four he burned my dolls house and set some of my toys on fire. I caught him once as a young child in a game of tag and he gave me a black eye. If I was about to win a video game against him he would pull the plug. As I got older, he would threaten me with slander, say no one would believe me and would try to get me into trouble with my parents. He hit me, threw me into walls and would constantly call me names. Names which included fat whore, ugly, bitch, idiot etc. If a man was in the same room as me he would make incredibly sexual comments about how I wanted to wrap my legs around him etc. When I spoke in front of people our age, he would say things like “did I give you permission to speak fat stupid bitch”.

He also had other strange behaviour. He used scream at me for periods of time when we are alone accusing me of raping pigs/ using pigs. He would start screaming sometimes ""stop raping the pigs they don't want you, stop using them"". He also told me he gave one of his friends permission to plough me. He would tell me he couldn't wait until I was going to die so he could dance on my grave. My father caught me self-harming as a teen and my parents told my brother. My brother used then act out someone slitting their wrists in front of me and called me a mentally unstable crazy bitch and encouraged me to kill myself. He lied on the regular and sometimes got me into trouble with my parents as they believed him. My mother told me after I self-harmed that if I wanted to kill myself to go to different stores and buy paracetamol and not leave blood on her floor. She also said she thought she had a normal life but I was not normal and threatened me with being locked up in a psych ward if I continued to behave the way I did again. The psychiatrist I was made see told my parents there was nothing wrong with me and I was just wasting his time. I was asked questions such as if I was a goth, on drugs, sexually active etc. He informed my parents that half of the country were self-harming.

My parents went away abroad one time and we were left alone in the house together. I was 17, he was about 18. He invited about 50 kids his age. One of his male friends grabbed me around the waist dragged me across the room in front of my brother and asked his other friends if he wanted to see him fuck me. I slapped his friend across the face. Not long after my brother hit me full force into a wall and I hit the ground. When my parents came back my mother got angry with me because she told me my brother said my behaviour was inappropriate towards his friends. She called me a psycho and said I should be ashamed of myself.

When I started University, he told me repeatedly my degree (Business and Political Science) was for people who are so stupid they are mentally disabled and that he would be a doctor. He was very condescending, rude and judgemental of everything I did and made sure to point it out to everyone. He was incredibly envious and judgemental of other people as well. He had a huge ego and thought he was better than everyone.

He would hit my dog and call him a retard and other names. He was incredibly angry towards disabled people, homosexuals and black people. On the regular he would boast about fucking ""sluts"" and how he used prostitutes, how all women wanted him etc. He accused me of wanting him sexually as well as being inappropriate towards him. Fast forward a few years and he has falsely accused my parents of extreme physical and emotional abuse to the police. My brother hacked my mothers online account and sent threatening messages to himself and then showed the police. He also made a false sexual assault claim against an autistic boy.

He has a good job now and is trying to get in contact with me. He is blaming everything on my mother for this bad behaviour and has made some serious claims against my father. All things I have no memory of nor saw anything remotely like what he has described in text. I don't want to be in contact with him but I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience with a person like this and what they would suggest I do.",15Apr2019,1

The same thing happened again at supper, despite him being reminded I was the one washing the dishes (though this time I'll admit I used a ceramic plate purely out of spite).

Bear in mind my father is not a millionaire, because in my country the CEO gets paid around $100-200k a year and they used most of the money to pay bills, mortgage, and my education abroad (easily $50,000 a year). Luckily, I finished my education and I am now working full time.

287,"# This will seem like I am venting/confessing, and that is partially true. I want to get everything out there so I can ask for the proper advice.

Before I get started, I just want to say that I am considering going back to my college's therapy sessions but I never get to fully tell them everything due to lack of time during appointments. Reddit, you are the only place left I can go to, and I'm writing this from my own account as a last plea for help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a first generation American in my family. Both my parents were born and raised in China, so there's a lot they don't understand due to cultural differences. I am 22, in the US, and on what is supposed to be my last year of College (chemistry major, undergrad, supposed to graduate Fall 2019). 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a really tough childhood that led to me developing horrible coping mechanisms and mental health issues. I hate to be one of those people, but ever since I was around 15-16, I started to feel like I have something wrong with me, and I later concluded that I have Borderline Personality Disorder. I've never been professionally diagnosed, but as soon as I get the money to afford it, I intend to get it done so I know for sure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Around sophomore year of high school, I came out to my parents and told them that I am attracted to women. My parents, specifically my mom, did not take it well. She gave me the typical ""why are you choosing to be gay, how could you do this to your family, you are being selfish, this is wrong, it's just a phase, etc..."" speech in response and was completely against it. I was dating a girl at the time for about two and a half years, and she was my first girlfriend. She was extremely mentally/emotionally abusive and when she cheated on me and dumped me, I was on the verge of suicide. My grades were in shambles because the entire time I was sacrificing myself to help her with her problems and her academics. I had zero friends and no support from my family, I seriously thought that I could not continue on with my life. The pain was unbearable. I went to the school's counselor and told them that I could not take it anymore, that I was failing all my classes and the breakup was so traumatic and devastating to me that I was contemplating suicide.   


If you are wondering how a simple breakup could do so much damage to me, I can explain that. If you don't want to read about that then please skip this paragraph, I don't want to waste your time that you are giving to me. My ex made sure that I had no friends, my entire life revolved around her and only her. Every time I wanted to leave, she threatened to commit suicide, and I believed it. She was so fucking crazy that she carved my name into her chest with a blade and showed it to me just to make sure I felt completely 100% responsible for everything, so I was always afraid to do anything she did not approve of because I saw what she was capable of doing. She did not have the decency to break up with me. She let me find out on my own that the relationship was over. One day I woke up and she was not responding to me. I checked her Facebook to see if anything had happened, and she had updated her relationship status to taken by this other guy. There were photos of them together, everywhere, all over her page and profile picture. I was completely in shock, confused and I was devastated. When I confronted her about it, she told me that she hoped that it would all sink in, that I would never forget about this, and that the two weeks she and the guy had together were better than the two and half years we had. So at the end of it all, I had nothing going for me, and I had nobody to turn to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I begged the school counselors to not tell my parents about it. I just wanted help, and someone to talk to because I felt like my whole world was collapsing. My parents have pressured me all my life to do good in school, they ingrained into me that I need to always think about my future. I cannot mess up at all. I knew that if they told my parents, things would just get worse because they didn't accept me for who I am and were certainly not going to accept my grades. What I didn't know is that it is by law that the counselors contact a kid's parents if they show signs of suicide. My parents came over and talked to the school counselors about it. They were clearly very upset, and they took a pamphlet home to contact therapists. I thought that they would finally get me the help that I needed, but instead when I got home, they lectured me for about four hours straight. They told me that suicide was selfish and for the weak. They told me that I did not need therapy, that there is nothing wrong with me, I just needed to suck it up and get over it. They were even more enraged that the root of it all was because of a breakup, which to them, was so trivial, stupid, and nothing of importance. My dad told me, ""why did I make you then? If you were going to just fail like this."" I will never, ever forget that. So ultimately, I got no help in the end and my mental health only got worse as I aged. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was however a moment in my life where I got everything together and my life started to look great. It was all because I was chasing after another girl my senior year. I dated her for two years, my senior year and then my freshman year of college. I think by now you can tell that I have a really bad case of dependency. People should not be able to influence my life that hard, but they did, and still do. I got dumped by the girl my sophomore year of college during finals week of Fall semester. During that time, my mom revealed to me that my father has been cheating on her and then proceeded to drag me along every single ""adventure"" to confront my dad. My mom's stability went completely downhill. She was going crazy and trying to throw herself down the stairs. I was traumatized and scared for her life, so I put all of me into supporting her. Of course it came at the expense of my own health and academics. Sure enough, my grades plummeted and I started to fail. I started to skip class, because I was too tired or mentally drained. I fell into a horrible depression that still to this day, is taking place. My sleeping pattern went off the rails, and my mental health dived even worse. It was about when I was 20-21 that I was really convinced that I have BPD. I show all the signs and symptoms of it, and many of the traits associated with BPD explained my behaviors and my train of thought. BPD is supposed to really start showing in your 20's, and I can definitely feel the full effect of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, where am I now? This whole semester, I've barely stepped foot in my classes. I had to drop a class for the very first time and it was so hard for me to do and accept. My mom put the most amount of pressure into graduating by 2019 and I know now that I can't because my University has semester specific classes. I am failing every single one of my classes right now, and it is way too late for me to make a difference. There are two classes that are going to set me behind by a lot. I dropped Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry, so I have to take that next semester. The problem is that the class that comes after, is only offered during the Fall, meaning that I have to wait an entire year (Fall 2020) to be able to take it. Another class that I'm failing, will only be offered during next Spring 2020. This means that in Fall and Spring of 2020, I will be taking just one class. I have lied to my parents that I've been doing good for about three semesters, and even then I still continue to get berated and pressured about my future. I don't know how I'm going to confront my parents about the huge delay in graduation, let alone my failure of a GPA that will probably cease any chances of me getting into graduate school. Right now, I am stacking my classes for next semester and I know it will probably be a bad idea. I'm just trying to still graduate on time but at this point, it looks like it is futile. I don't know what is best for me any longer. I don't know if I am meant to go down this path. Life is all about survival of the fittest and I question myself every day if I am one of them. It is so hard to come to terms that I may just really not be cut out for college, not be cut out for anything. I don't know what reality to accept, and I don't know if I will ever change my ways so that I can do better next semester. I don't know how to help myself. I know what I should be doing, but I struggle to even get out of my bed. Despite the lingering doom of failure, it is still not enough to get me to change. I accept, and don't accept my situation, but it feels like my mind has already given up on myself and my future. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to confront my parents about everything I've mentioned. I'm afraid to confront them about it, and this whole thing haunts me every time I think of it, especially when I try to sleep. My mom is really the one I'm concerned about, and is the only person who really is my stressor. If I tell them the truth and about my delay in graduation, I know my mom will be furious with me and give me the hardest time. I don't think I will ever be ready to go through that experience again. I'm afraid, I am literally so afraid to talk to her, because I know what will come next.   
If you want to know how usual talks about my future/education goes, I made a post about an incident recently which should help give you some insight.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b0yll9/i\_22f\_have\_an\_emotionally\_abusive\_relationship/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b0yll9/i_22f_have_an_emotionally_abusive_relationship/)

&amp;#x200B;

I know this whole post seems like it is super dramatic, and I wish it wasn't. This is not a troll post or a fake story, it's very much real and I really, really, really, wish it WAS fake. I hope nobody ever has to go through what I go through, and I hope nobody ever has parents like this. I feel like shit. I feel so much overwhelming guilt and remorse for my academic performance.

&amp;#x200B;

My main questions are this:

1. How do I confront my mom about the delayed graduation?
2. Do I tell my mom everything including my grades?
3. Am I doomed? Is my future and career pretty much a dream now? Can I actually recover from this?
4. Should I give up on trying, should I just accept where I am now in this situation? Is it futile to keep trying for my career as a chemist?

288,"I've been friends with this truly pulchritudinous girl for quite some time now, and I think I'm starting to really like her. She's even told me I know her intrinsically more than anyone else. We like the same music, the same hobbies, and have similar opinions about people. We've been talking incessantly for the past many fortnights, and out of a sudden, she's been constantly leaving me on read for the past few days. She's also been very hesitant to hang out with me. 

We use two chatting apps, Chat A and Chat B to communicate, and we used to use Chat B a lot more than Chat A. But she's started ignoring me on Chat B, which has no ""read marker"", but I can see that she's online because she's constantly talking with random people she meets online. When I asked her about it IRL, she prevaricated, and kept attempting to change the subject. After that, I confronted her again and she paltered about the subject. Keep in mind that she used to excitedly and vivaciously message me everytime she goes online, and she greeted me good-night almost on a nightly basis. Now, she just leaves me on ""read""/""seen"" on Chat A (yet she's constantly liking posts on IG), and she totally ignores me on Chat B. I honestly don't know what happened. I have never talked harshly to her even once — it was like she spontaneously decided to ignore me.

I really don't know what to do, and neither do I know what she wants. Knowing her, this girl is very transparent, frank and candid - she would have immediately told me to get the hell out if she didn't want to talk to me. Like I feel that she doesn't even want to remain friends with me anymore, y'know? I don't know whether I should wait, whether I should try to confront her again F2F, whether I should wait for this to blow over if this is a normal thing about girls, or whether I should just scurry off with my tail between my legs.

Lately it seems like the more I help around the house the more my mom gives out, I pay rent, buy my own groceries and do my own chores but if I leave one dirty fork all hell breaks lose.

292,"I absolutely apologize, this got longer than I thought it would... ended up a rant. A not very helpful TL;DR at the end.

For the longest time, my school was just taught by the one Master. We opened back in 2011, and I joined then at the age of 21. The Master let me skip a few ranks, since I knew most of the essentials from a previous 9 years of Karate training and just needed to learn his curriculum.

About two years later, I was assisting in class both for after school, summer camps, and the night time classes. Since I was going through grad school at the time (for a Masters in Statistics), I was happy for every bit of money I could get. In 2014, sometime after I had gotten my second degree, he put me through an intensive crash course in how he taught and how he'd like me to teach. December of that year, he made me an Instructor, and announced it to the school. Cue applause. I was Instructor M. Kinda.

All the kids already knew me from years of assisting, and no matter how hard I tried, the kids wouldn't pick up on the Instructor title. The Master wasn't much help, always just calling my name without the title in class either, so the kids didn't feel like they had to either. After a while, frustrated, I gave up.

It's been five years since then, and I've just been M. Sure, when we bow at the start, there's still a ""Face Instructor"" and they'll all bow to me, but still, just M to the kids. It didn't really bother me, though. I was just happy to teach.

However, things change. 

Before I continue to go into my conundrum, I have to elaborate a bit more. Since 2016, I've had a full time job, putting my MS degree to good use. I only get to teach on Saturdays now, since I get home pretty late and really only can get to my own practice late at night. I only see a fraction of the students I used to see.

Recently three of our young adult assistants (all 18-20 year olds) just got promoted to Instructor at the start of April, when the last one finally got his 3rd degree. I'm super proud of them. They've worked hard and they deserve it. They've been doing most of the teaching on the week days, and they've gotten better every day.

The Master made sure to talk to them (in our group chat) to make sure the kids know and use their titles. He will also make sure the kids use the titles. Assurances I never got from him, although frankly, I was too timid to reach out and ask him for when I had gotten mine. Maybe I should have.

In addition to all this, at the beginning of April (right before their promotions were announced), I ended up in the hospital for surgery. This means I haven't been there the entire month of April so far. And they're able to train the kids on their titles, with the backing of each other and the Master. While I sit on bed rest, hoping that the kids even remember that I'm also an Instructor there.

I don't know exactly how I feel. But it's just been bothering me. If I had just stayed adamant about making the kids use the title 5 years ago, if I had just asked the Master to help with making sure the kids used it, maybe it wouldn't bug me as much. But I feel like I've been undervalued, and this isn't the only time I've felt this way. 

I'm the ""Head Instructor"" under the Master, but I'm only able to teach on Saturdays. I judge the tests and tie the new belts for the ceremonies, but only a fraction of the kids know my name anyway. Do I even have the right to feel bothered this way? 

TL;DR - Been Instructor for 5 years, never been called title. New Instructors promoted, and it feels the Master is helping them make sure they're being called by their title more than he helped me. Do I get to feel bothered by this even though recently it's become a very part time thing?",15Apr2019,0

He’s been really low since it happened and acting strange and it’s really put me on edge.

297,"I don’t even know where to begin this post.

Background: I live on a corner in a big neighborhood. Across the street from me is another house on the corner. This house has an immaculate front yard with a ton of plants and trees. It’s like a giant garden. They even have a patio table, and giant trees to shelter their “patio area”. When I first moved in (almost 4 years ago) there was an elderly hispanic man who had two chihuahuas. This man was obviously retired and spent many many hours outdoors in his yard gardening. I’ve only spoken to him a few times. I didn’t get any weird feelings from this house until my other neighbor across the other street from me said “make sure you keep an eye on your kids, especially around those neighbors...”  I asked her why but her husband interrupted our conversation and told his wife not to spread rumors. 

So I kept my distance and I’ve always been hyper aware of that house. 

Flash forward to last year:

Summer of 2018 I start noticing that there is more cars in their driveway and this red bearded man constantly in their front yard. Now I see this bearded man outside all day. Which at first didn’t seem to trigger any red flags.. I figured the owner of the home was probably getting a little older and needed help with the yard work. I would see them together sometimes helping each other with different tasks. 

Late summer I start noticing that this red bearded man is watching me. Every time I leave my home to take my kids to school, or grocery shop, I look over and he’s staring. It creeped me out. 

One time I came home and he had a camera out aimed towards my son and I. When I looked directly at him he pointed it up into the tree, like he was photographing nature. It freaked me out and I told my husband. 

I’ve always felt like this man has been watching our home, watching my kids, and just being plain creepy. I don’t open my windows or blinds that face their home. I never let my kids play outside by themselves. I’ve just ignored his strange behavior and went on with life. 

So starting last week his behavior has become VERY strange. I was taking my kids to school one morning. We were on our front porch and I was locking the front door. Walking down our porch steps to load the kids into my car I look over and the bearded man was in the street walking towards our home just a few steps away from my yard. I told my kids to get in the car, and as soon as I made eye contact with him he turned around and headed back towards his lawn and was using both hands to punch himself in the face/head. 

After this incident I told my husband that I want to get my license to carry a firearm to protect my kids when he’s not around because this mans actions are freaking me out. 

After the head punching, I was going to go get my mail one night around 10:30pm (I had a package I needed to get to finish a project I was working on) for some reason my inner conscious told me not to go outside by myself. I told myself I’m just being silly and grabbed my mail keys. Right as I’m walking toward the door I hear yelling outside. It sounds as if someone is fighting in my driveway the yelling is so loud. I decide not to go out by myself and make my husband come with me. We walk outside and realize that the yelling is coming from my neighbors yard (red bearded man) is sitting in the pitch black yelling to himself. Yelling words that don’t even complete a sentence.  Just so strange. And he’s continued his yelling all hours of the day and night. 

Today I go outside to do yard work, he’s out there in his yard watching me. My son who is 6 came out to help me. It was quiet for about 5 minutes until he starts yelling and talking to himself loudly. I’m trying to figure out what he’s saying. His voice is raspy from yelling so much that it’s hard to understand him. But he just walks the yard yelling for awhile. Then it turns into hysterical sobbing. He’s crying and all I can hear is “fight” and “kill” Nothing he says makes any sense at all. I tell my son to go inside because I don’t trust the mentality of this neighbor. 

I’m convinced he’s extremely mentally ill or he is on a lot of drugs. And I haven’t seen the old guy for a few weeks... I’m wondering if the bearded man had something to do with it. 

So now I don’t know what to do. Do I leave this person alone? Do I file a police report to report suspicious behavior or disturbing the peace? I mean he’s technically on his own property, but it’s getting to the point where I don’t feel safe.

What would you do?

300,"I don't like the idea of dying or being dead. It's probably my biggest fear. But as of late, I feel like it's only a very close second to my fear of being alive.

I wouldn't say I'm depressed at all. I love living and experiencing new things and I still have a burning passion for my hobbies. But I'm wondering if that's only because I still live off of my parents at 18. What's it going to be like when I eventually move out and get a job? Am I even going to experience happiness at that point? *Will I even be alive?* That's the scary thing, right there, my biggest problem. I don't even know if I'll even have the chance to become an adult, or at least not for very long. Every time I go online, no matter what, I always leave with this new knowledge of why the Earth will uninhabitable in the next two or three decades.

If what I hear on the daily is correct, the entire American job industry is a complete catch-22. Apparently, you need experience to get a job and you need a job to get experience. That's not news, I know, but it's still crucial to my perspective on things. This probably means I'm going to have a terrible first job because the only place I can see myself working at that I might be able to stomach is fast food and I don't want to do that. I'm bad at managing stress as it is, absolutely godawful at it. There is such a small probability I could mentally survive such a demanding job. I have massive respect to anybody that works or has worked in food. I don't know how you guys do it. But worse than that, I'm bad at everything else, too. I'm not strong, I'm not nimble, I can't do math, I can't do much of anything other than sit, and what job lets you do that? It feels like no matter what, I'm going to struggle to make a living and I'm going to struggle to enjoy life doing it.

Even if I do make a living and get myself a place, there's probably nothing I can do to prevent the political catastrophes that take place every day. Now, I don't like politics. I hate discussing politics and I know very little about them, but they're important, and, unfortunately, they're what's going to fuck us all if things keep going the way they're going. I and hundreds of thousands of others like me are likely going to be dead at 40-something-years-old because of shriveled-up old men that aren't even going to be alive to see the damage they're causing to the world. We're probably on the brink of World War III, which probably means bomb blasts and bloodshed on every corner. Which sounds worse: getting my life stolen from an atomic blast that I never saw coming or slitting my wrists to prevent such a cruel fate right now? Not that I  remotely want to do that (I hate touching my veins, veins creep me out), but still. I feel like I got robbed out a full, happy life just from living it. I feel like I was born too damn late.

But let's say I am in one of those moments where politics and existentialism and all that depressing shit are not on my mind. It's in these times where I draw and I write. I don't think I'm that good at either, but I love doing them...which is why I get so frustrated when I pull up my sketchbook or my laptop. I haven't had a new, good idea in forever! I can't practice creative escapism when I can't get one thought to escape from my mind. I have *so, so many* abandoned projects or projects on hiatus because I keep running out of steam! And lately, it's especially bad because I feel like I actually want to finish a story I have in mind. I feel confident in the concept and the way I want to go about it (even if I haven't fully fleshed either of those out yet), but if I can't think about what actually *happens* in the book, then what the hell? When I'm not wasting my time on the progressively smellier cesspit that is my social media, I'm wasting hours of my life that has already been artificially cut down by all this bullshit happening in the world around me in front of a plain white Google Doc. I have had zero days without a new idea. None. Null. Goose eggs. Absolutely zilch.

I realize I'm rambling now so I'll try to summarize it:

I love living, but is it even going to be worth it in the near future? In a world where it's hard to get a job and make a stable income? In a world that may not even exist in a few decades' time? In a world where I am perpetually creatively constipated so I can't even distract myself from the cesspool that is literally everything in my life? I live in constant fear, no matter what I'm doing. I don't even feel safe in my own thoughts.

So should I even try to make the best of it or should I just give up right here and let everything hit me? Again, I'm not going to kill myself for any reason. I care far too much about my friends and family to ever destroy them like that. I'm just asking if it's the better option than making an attempt to exist as a grown man in this day and age where everything feels so dire.

301,"Hey everybody! 
(I'll keep this as ""short"" as possible!)


I'm 30 years old and the last few years of self reflecting has made me realize how shitty my dad truly was while I was growing up (he was physically there but mentally checked out). I finally had the guts to tell my mom how I felt recently about my dad and our upbringing. If it wasn't for her and my sister stuck living with him and my son being close to my father, I would have 0 contact with him.

(Mild backstory- my 2 siblings and I are all autistic. We all had and have VERY different and sometimes intense needs. One of my siblings was born with a cleft lip and pallet for example. My father would work and then hang with friends every day every chance be got and when he was home we all had to leave him alone. This pissed me off even as a child because I saw the emotional toll raising 3 children with needs by herself and the drain this had on my mom. When I was about 8 she tried to leave but he agreed to be more involved and she stayed which open a whole new can of worms.  He became super controlling and everything we did had to be his way and belittled everyone, our thoughts, hobbies, etc. I watched him slowly break my moms spirit ever since and could do nothing because I was a child and thought it was normal up until recently).

After voicing my concerns and venting to her today, she admitted to me that their relationship is more like a friendship at this point. She said she was broken and not knowing how to bounce back. My dad has become even worse over the last 5 years. She has no hobbies and her life revolves around my dad and his needs and then their disabled offspring and grandchild second. It was relieving to know I was not alone in my thoughts about him and what I had observed growing up was fairly accurate. He sucks the confidence and self love from people. My mom says she wants to leave but with her being in so much pain from fibromyalgia and a laundry list of other health issues (she's in her 50's), she's not able to work with my sibling with the most needs depending on her. 


I've been confronting my dad more and more about his behavior and how it's affecting the few family he has left. He won't listen and blows up. He doesn't care. 


I'm struggling to keep up with bills as is so I couldn't take on my mom and sister and their dogs financially. My other sibling is in a similar situation financially. My mom isn't close to her family anymore because of my dad so that's not an option either. 

How can I help my mom build her confidence? How can I get her to fully see how messed up her situation is with him? (I only fully realized it after a few years living away from him and minimizing contact with him and became on the outside looking in.) She does not realize the full affect he's had on us growing up because until recently we've all been too scared to speak up and I'm the only doing so. my siblings having the same feelings and issues (they're too scared and not mentally strong enough to stand up for themselves to him yet and I understand). My mom is miserable and suicide runs very high on her side of the family. I'm scared for her and her mental state. I've got so much on my mind about this and processing everything she said. Having validation from her on this has been beneficial yet extremely upsetting. I feel helpless and now idea which direction to go to even start to help her. I live 7 hours away so it's not like I can do hobbies with her to get her out of the house either.

303," Recently I was invited after expressing my interest in for a senior associate position in a Big 4 consulting firm.

The HR mentioned in the invitation email that it would be conducted with a Director, Manager and Senior HR.

However, the day of the interview, only the Director was present.  
We talked about 1 hour, mainly about the job and competences, nothing on soft skills or about my interests and why I wanted to join the company.

Finally, when the salary conversation came up, I told my number and he asked me if he were to give me that amount if I would join them, and i replied positively I would.

Overall, I feel the interview could have gone a lot better. The director was very direct and fast paced.

Any thoughts of how it went? I really want to join the company as I will learn a lot and gain experience from a Big 4 company which I hope to become a long term employer for me. Was it positive that only the director showed up for the interview and the final question about the salary?",15Apr2019,1
304,"My best friend since middle school and his fiance have come to me with a proposition, and I'm not quite sure how to take it. I'm his Best Man in the wedding, all three of us are roommates, and they came to me last night telling me that they'd like to do a foursome. We are all very open with our sex lives with each other, and we are all into the darker side of things such as BDSM/RPing, and taboo, so this didn't strike me as odd at all. I already had a general idea on who the other girl would be, but when they told me that they wanted me to be the other guy because they both wanted it to be someone that they trusted equally, it kind of made me feel unsure of the situation.

I feel like this is a very difficult position to be in. I find his fiance to be moderately attractive, but I never have once thought anything of it simply because of who she was with. Crossing that line could have potentially catastrophic risks. I've talked with just my friend about this several times since it's been brought up to me by both of them, and he insists that nothing would be different, and that they both really want to experiment in this way, and that there would be no one either of them would prefer to be part of it. Now, to be clear, this foursome wouldn't be just the four of us having groupsex in the same space. I would be sharing my partner, and my friend would be sharing his. 

I'm not worried about myself making any poor decisions in the future as a result of this. I'm not really even worried that my friend would change his perspective of me. What I'm worried about most is that his fiance is just using this as a ploy to sleep with me and that could create a million and one circumstances that would not be good. Especially considering that we are all roommates.

I tend to over-analyze things, so this could all be me just stretching things too thin, or seeing things that aren't there.  Should I just say fuck it and go for it?",15Apr2019,3

Briefly said I am with my gf for around 5 years and from early on I said I want to be honest with her and I told her that I like to go out with other people as well but casually nothing serious and after setting up some rules we found a middle ground but back in the days we didn't share a place. I was doing my stuff she was doing her stuff but for a little over a year we got a place together that really feels like home for both of us but in the same time it was a horrible year for me and only the past few weeks I managed to pull myself together so honestly I lost all interest in anything apart from us but last night kinda sparked things up like nothing else.



But I don't know what to do right now... I never talked with my gf about any new rules regarding our place together like before when I had my place I could get people over no problem it's my place she was okay with that but I just forgot to open the conversation when we moved in together. The girl from last night was pretty forward about her intentions  and she will be leaving the country in 2 days and she asked me again online if we can't meet? Eventually at my place.

310,"First a little background on my love life, I was in a pretty long relationship a while ago, it lasted a little over 5 years, it ended after I found out she cheated on me. After it ended I tried to stay away from relationships in general, I went on a couple dates, but never tried to get beyond that. Last year I met this girl at an event I attended, I thought she was beautiful immediately, but didn't make much of it. A week later, I saw her again and decided to have a conversation with her, throughout the conversation I found out that we have a lot of things in common. After that we kept talking through messages daily, and the more I talked to her, the more things in common I realized we shared. Through our conversations, I found out she has a boyfriend, but it didn't bother me at all because I only saw her as a friend. We've been talking everyday for about 8 months now, and lately I started realizing that I've developed feelings for her. Because of the way my last relationship ended, I don't want to do the same thing that was done to me to someone else.

318,"Good evening all, thanks for taking  the tine to read this. I am so confused on my relationship and i don't know if its me, her or the 9 year  age gap.

Her: 23 
Me: 30

Her: doesn't drive
Me: drives her everywhere

Her: lived at home until she was 21
Me: kicked out at 17 (step-dad was a fkhead)

(Go a head, assume the gender. She is a she and i am a he)

When we started dating,  she seemes interested. Tried to ""win"" me over by buying me things - not realizing she had already won me.

Three years later,  we live together and its almost like she hates my guts. We are approaching one year living together, so moved in after two and she said it was because I rushed her. I didnt, I just told her im ready for more of a commitment. I never threatened to leave her or anything. 

She wont hold a conversation with me. When i bring anything up, if she doesnt like the topic she gets defensive/narky and says ""okay conversation over"" 

I do things i think are ""cute"" to the average female (example: today i spent my only day off in 2 weeks running around making her an easter basket after i took her to work and before picking her up and she opened 1 thing and said 'ugh. Its one of those. Ill deal with it later' then never touched it again)

She goes out night clubbing until 4am, doesn't let me know if shes dead or alive  cause shes out eith no money, but her friends pay. Once she didnt come home so i rushed aeound before i had to work to get her home. 

Shedoesnt save money, owes me about 1500. She says shell repay me, but it never happens. Clothes shopping or partying cokes first . 

I think for me, the most hurtful thing was my mom was in a coma and when i needed her, she was drunk at a night club. In her defense, my mom was in america and i live in Australia so i flew over to be by my moms side, but when i tried to message her... she wasnt there. 

Now, before anyone hates on me. Yes. I am somewhat sensative and emotional. Im not sure why im like this. Sometimes i do need to ""toughen up"", but im lonely in my relationship and i feel like i have to book in tike with my gf. Even then, i can't talk to her because everything gets taken so seriously and it creates a fight.

Ive told her how i felt. Nothing changes. At all. 

I stay because i love her and hope it gets better. I stay because i WANT my future with her, but at the same time. I love myself just as much.

I appreciate any feedback. Happy to provide more detail.",15Apr2019,0

320,"It’s not necessarily as bad as it sounds as the cameras are not in private spaces but it’s really starting to get irritating. I’m a house-sitter through an online service that trades free housesitting for reviews that I can use to travel abroad and do the same. The owner has an alarm system app that knows when I come and go with a doorbell camera, a camera pointed at the front door, in their bedroom, and in the hallway. After talking with the owners, meeting with them after a few times it didn’t seem that this sit would be much of a problem with their two senior dogs and cat. 

She stressed that if I was gone longer than 6 hours to contact their neighbors to walk the dogs and I noted that. I’ve been diligent on feeding them, walking them and not coming home late often. It’s been 1.5 weeks. I deliver UberEats daily now and just started doing that lately as my job hours have seriously dwindled. Yesterday I left and came back at 10:30 PM and had been gone for a total of 3 hours but had already fed them and taken them on a walk. Today I met up with a friend, gave the dogs treats and left the house too early for dinner at 3:30 PM and ended up coming back at 9:20 PM and immediately fed them dinner. I knew I came back a bit late and don’t plan doing it often with the two weeks I have left. The owners are in Germany and just when I was about to go to sleep I get a call on Whatsapp to be questioned about when I fed the dogs and that she basically lectured me about being gone often—yes I need to go outside and interact with people on Earth?—and that she wants me to tidy up my behavior. She also lets me know that she watches and listens to the dogs howl when I’m gone—pretty sure they howl even if I’m gone for just an hour and she was guilt tripping me. I am a little nervous about what to do. When I try to explain myself she speaks so fast it’s hard to get a word in and I’m worried I’m gonna get a bad review!!! I just took in this local sit just so I can have a decent review to compete with other house-sitters and the wife is stressing me the hell out. I feel like I’m constantly being watched and that I can’t even leave the house without feeling like I’m doing something wrong. I can’t even walk in my pajamas without feeling like she’s leering at me from somewhere. I’m at a complete loss. I’m thinking of contacting her son to get some insight...she gave me his number for emergencies. It’s not necessarily an emergency but I’m wondering if he would be able to help to give me some insight to talk some sense into her and relax.

322,"A girl online I was speaking with for a while, maybe 3 months, randomly ghosted me and didn't speak to me anymore. We skyped, played games, talked for hours, cam sex, etc etc. She even wanted me to meet her.

First week was horrible, was fucking angry, confused, kept thinking about her, especially when going to sleep. I didn't try to contact her a lot though, she just randomly didn't respond to my messages anymore, so I stopped. I moved on, got a girlfriend, irl this time. Still thought about her sometimes, but it was infrequent.

To cut to the chase, well I'm single now, and she hit me up about a year later. Was really sorry, apologetic, says she ""part of her personality and hates herself for it"", and I didn't even feel mad. I don't know why. I think I should be mad but I'm not. I just don't care, and I thought I would. We're doing the things we were doing last time again already. I feel like this makes me weak. Does it? 

I still care for her. Makes me a bit angry actually, cuz in other aspects of life and even with other relationships I really wouldn't have. Pisses me off. Don't like this feeling of power being held over me.

So backstory Im currently dating in high school, according to her and her friends it's been roughly two years with her having a crush on me. I decided to date her the last year of high school. Her ex was a good friend of mine until we drifted after as he found out her and o were dating. This came to my house being shot with metal bb's and school abuse which has been ""handled"" by officers. No action was pushed against the ex as he's still a minor and no compensation was given to my house. (My girlfriend is constantly being asked to dump me for him because of my past relationship. My past relationship accused me of cheating, and since she was popular and no one knew me. I was exiled by everyone in school. She got into a relationship two days later and my very small friend group assumes that she was probably planning it for a long time. )

Back to my delema: 
The ex constantly bashes on me, lying to my girlfriend. My girlfriend feeling sympathetic doesn't ask for the principal or the councilors help (They aren't useful in anyway). I told my girlfriend to file a restraining order against him but she doesn't. I told her to tell the principal and to knowledge she doesn't. I get quite upset that she doesn't and explains to her in my own words, ""you're feeling sympathetic to a guy who shot your boyfriend's house."". After many attempts she finally goes to tell the principal, the councilor is also called in as it's HER job to keep an eye on students well beings. The ex isn't allowed to approach her or me in any form of contact yet he still continues to try to sneak her out of class or call her after school to talk. She has learned to tell the councilor and the principal if he approaches her. The many attempts go to the following of that he should go to her and he agrees and is let go, but continues. Her mother is called to many of these talks with the school and is informed of the information. She tells my girlfriend separately that she will be pulled out of school if it keeps up (her grades were failing too). It's the last few months of school. Her mother abuses her though physical contact and mentally. I know many of you would say that she should report the child abuse and then go live with her dad. I agree with you, but her dad has been in prison in multiple child cases and it isn't as safe as her mother's. My girlfriend also doesn't want to leave my side, she trusts me and needs my aide but I don't know what to do since I'm still a minor as well. If the principal is told that the incident had happened again with her ex bothering my girlfriend then she'd be pulled out of school no problem, but it's dumb to see that it's a few months till graduation. She has told me to keep it confidential, but I can't sleep and it's ruining my consentration to my own schooling.",15Apr2019,1

328,"Hello Reddit. I have recently (6 months) become the Front Office Manager for a hotel in Seattle. I have worked almost my entire career in hospitality and customer service to reach this point in my life. However, now that I am there, all I do is sit in an office, deal with upset guests and try to moderate employee issues. This is not what I thought it would be. I absolutely love and adore working directly with guests and making their time here more memorable and joyful. I'm really great at that. But most importantly, I love doing it. I am absolutely what you would call a happy go lucky person. The one always in a positive mood regardless of the situation. But in this position, it's all negative. It's not the company or even the staff, it's just the nature of the business. I just want to work with people again and help them be happy. My General Manager had noticed the change in my work as well. The things I didn't enjoy doing (spreadsheets, reprimanding, etc.)  took a noticeable dive in effort. She recently called me into a one on one meeting and said she had decided to demote me back to just a Front Desk Agent. At first I was sort of relieved. I get to work with the public again! No more spreadsheets! But then I realized that I wanted to work in a career field where I could move up the ladder. And that the next level would not be in an office. So, I ended up giving her my notice. I didn't want to go back to front desk because there is nowhere else to move up to except for where I've already been.

334,"When I was younger my extended family lived together. Because of my parents divorce our family separated  but we remained living together with the extended family (my fathers brother and his wife, their son and daughter) for around 5 years. The situation was though as my mother didn’t get along with my fathers brother and the house was very hostile. During this period my mother was a stay at home mum as was my aunt. 

Many years after the extended family had separated and moved to separate houses my sister told us that my male cousin who was 4-5 years elder than her had sexually abused her throughout her childhood. He had used emotional blackmail and threats that he would hurt my mother to silence her. I suspect that he as a child was being abused himself and had also been abusing his sister. He is now married to a much elder woman ( close in age to his mother) and as teenager the way he hugged and behaved around his own mother I always found to be weird and inappropriate. I wonder whether or not it was his mother who had abused him, what would be the signs? 

When my sister told my parents at the age of 14 or 15 my family severed ties with them as their son completely denied it and his parents supported him so we haven’t seen them since. My mother didn’t get my sister any psychological help and she has always been very angry. She’s very controlling and looks at situations as being very binary, you are with her or against her. If you disagree with her she’s sees it as a personal attack. I feel her emotional and mental approach to complex emotional situations mimics that of a teenager and not that of 30 something year old. She’s is so explosive It makes being around her very hard. 

My mother has never accepted that her poor parenting led to the abuse going unnoticed. As a person she blames all things that happen in her life as being the result of others actions. I have never been able to have a conversation with her and make her see her own complicity in creating and allowing negative situations to arise/ continue. She can never see her own faults. 

I as her son believe it is the result of her incompetence as a parent (along with my father) to spot the abuse and see their lack of actually dealing with the trauma it has caused as being the reason why my sister is so emotionally troubled and as of such displays a lot of negative behavioural traits that make maintaining a relationship with her impossible. 

I need advice in dealing with both my mother and my sister. Is my mother responsible or am I in the wrong for suggesting she bares some responsibility? Regardless how do I have a conservation with her and make her see that she has agency and that much of her life and the situations she has created have been through her own actions of lack there off?

With regard to my sister she doesn’t seem to see any fault with my parents. She directs her anger at me and my other sibling. She tell us that we don’t protect her and is obsessed with protecting our mother, any argument we have with our mother she get involved in and directs aggression and anger towards us. Please can you offer me some advice as I am at a loss as to how to help and manage relationships with either of them.",15Apr2019,1
335,"Ok so I’m really young/ in high school so I understand that I’m still young and have heaps of wriggle room but since I was 8 I’ve always wanted to be a barrister/ lawyer as my whole life has been based around family court from other issues. Family court has always interested me as in my situation my parents divorced when I was 5 and ever since I have been surrounded by lawyers. I’ve always wanted to help other families so that the children who are in my situation can be represented by someone who truly understands. With all this in mind I’m also thinking about some of the logical aspects about this like my salary in this profession which I understand is not usually as much as people say. Things like understanding the law to better to make aspects of my future appear easier is also another upside. I also know that becoming a lawyer is VERY difficult and time consuming. With this in mind, in my science class I have noticed that I’m quite a bit ahead of my classmates not in the sense that I’m smarter than them but for some reason it’s so much easier for me to memorise the things being taught and that sometimes when asked a question I know the answer without listening to half of it. It’s honestly fun in my opinion and is quite an interesting subject which I’m now thinking of perusing a career in. So yeah. Two almost opposite subjects being family court and science( chemical changes and the structure of atoms as well as the basics of science and physics are the most fascinating and really easy for me(also maybe biology but I’m still in the fog about that one)) at this point I’m starting to go on a tangent but I’m also very good at making professional letters and can be very formal at times many of my teachers and even my parents ask me to write notes for them if they’re busy doing other things as I can make it seem very formal because of my crazy vocabulary. For example dependent on my age other children would find this post it self quite formal but for me this is just normal talk and how I would usually speak in public to those I’m not close too,,",15Apr2019,1

John and I were best friends for 3-4 years and I learnt a lot about the world from our time as friends seeing as he is 5-6 years older than me.

But... John ripped a friend and I off ($400 each), continuously manipulated me into thinking other people were in the wrong when he’d done something wrong, took advantage of another friend of mine when John was out on his ass without a place to live by living in her house rent free for over a year and during that time he wouldn’t get his act together and save money to move out, instead he’d be out partying every weekend and blowing his wage.

I blocked him out of my life 4 years ago and focussed on the friends I have that I felt deserved more of my time.
From what I’ve heard from friends, John hasn’t changed much in the way of partying and poorly managing his money and he is now 32~.

This has happened on multiple accounts for all different services ‘EA; Uplay, Instagram, etc’. I have two step verification on some accounts like gmail and steam, so they will be safe, right? 

Since I was getting emails I didn’t think much of it. I simply reset my password and thought that any time someone tried to access another account I’d have an email. However, today I went to listen to some music and my playlist on Spotify had been changed and replaced with another called ‘Fucking ROCK’ and my recently played is filled with music I would never listen to. 

So I’ve reset my password but I’m pretty worried that other accounts are being accessed but I’m not receiving an email to notify me of it. 

Is there anything I can do? I was thinking of making a list of every account I can think of that’s linked to my email and change the passwords for all, but is there a simpler solution? Is there a way to check every account that’s tied to my email?

However, almost every day, you can hear my neighbor cussing his son like he is nothing. Jimmy (name changed for privacy) is a 13 yr. old boy who is in 8th grade. His father, Randy (name changed) is a 56 yr. old bachelor. Jimmy's mother was younger than Randy and was on drugs when she was pregnant with him. His growth has been affected by this. My son, who is in 5th grade and 10 yrs old, is taller than Jimmy. So I just wanted to tell the back story to help understand why Randy may be abusing his son. When they are outside and Jimmy does the slightest thing wrong, Randy starts screaming Profanity at his son and doesn't stop until Jimmy is crying and then his daddy makes fun of him. I have NEVER heard his daddy talk nice to him ONCE. But Everyone does hear him tell his son he is so GD Stupid and how he has ruined his life by having to raise him. There is no empathy at all from his father

Yesterday, my 10 yr. old son told me that Jimmy told him, ""The next time my daddy puts me in a headlock and chokes me, I am calling the police.

Wow!

Jimmy and his father have lived right next door for 6 years. I heard the cussing a little when he was younger. I just thought he was venting once and a while. For the past year, the cussings have been more frequent and harsher. But I still had no idea it was physical until last night.

I have contemplated for 6 months whether or not to call DSS. But I couldn't help thinking...Would it be worse on him to have no family around? What if they abused him more in a foster home?

Back in November there was a new girl that kinda joined the social group that I'm in. I thought that she was cute and all but I never said anything. I was thinking about it for a while and realised she would never like me or whatever and I put it aside. Recently I found out that she in fact had a crush on me and I asked her out. She said yes and we went on a kind of first date. 

The problem is that I didn't really like her back anymore at this point and I only really asked her out because I didn't want to lead her on. It pains me to say but I really dont want a relationship with this girl.

But theres more shit in this story  I had a crush on this girl for about 2 and a half years and realised I never had a chance with her also so I gave up (the girl I asked out was my next crush). But recently me and my old crush have kind of been getting a bit closer and I've realised I still like her. I really dont know what to do.

347,"I'm 27M and by any standards a quite decent guy. However, I've never had any sort of romantic relationship (in fact, I've had sex a grand total of one time in my life). The women I've fallen in love with have never reciprocated, sometimes for the weirdest reasons: one was asexual because she had a bad diet that messed up her hormones; another was a lesbian who'd just been through a tough breakup, and though she fell for me (I was the first men she had feelings for in a long time), she avoided all contact with me and only told me about her feelings months afterwards. 

I have no problems developing very meaningful friendships. Often my best friends are the very same women I once desired. These friendships have never blossomed into love, however. In fact, I feel the more time I spend with someone, the less likely they are to develop feelings for me.

Today I'm in a similar situation again, I fell hard for a girl who doesn't want me as anything other than as a friend. We've gotten very close over the course of the last month, and though there were moments when maybe something could have happened, I was always too shy to take a risk. Long story short, yesterday she clearly stated she's not into me.

After so many times getting close to someone but always failing to make it bloom into love, I'm really thinking there's something deeply wrong with me that makes me essentially *unlovable*.

My girlfriend had wanted us to live together but I felt like it was too soon in our relationship and I had already made these plans, so we did not. She lives in campus housing and absolutely hates everything about it. 
She recently found out that she can’t get a loan to pay for her summer housing, and if she doesn’t take summer classes will have to move back home (not a great situation) and won’t graduate on time. I asked my roommate to think about allowing her to stay with us about a week ago. She needs to know pretty soon and my roommate still hasn’t said anything. Our apartment is great and cheap, Considering how nice it  is, but that doesn’t mean it’s actually cheap (cheap for Chicago). We both struggle to pay our rent even though we always manage to pay on time, it often leaves me with $2 in the bank for weeks at a time. With summer coming up out upasses turn off so we will start having to pay for public transportation and a million other things.

358,"Last year I got my high school diploma and for the past months I was searching for a job. For the last 8 years I had a severe back pain that is becoming worse every day. In fact now I'm not able to walk or run for a long time because of it. I'm still doing exams and my doctors still haven't figured out what I have. The only time I don't feel pain is when I'm focused a lot on something else, I was doing that by going for a run or playing soccer daily with friends but now I'm not able to do it anymore. So I'm spending more time playing on my ps4 or watching movies.

The last week we moved to a new house and I had to help my dad moving stuff, this made my pain worse and I regret doing it. But at the same time I don't want to feel useless. 

Friday I was in a lot of pain and my 14yo rother was playing fortnite. My dad came back from work and he said that me and him we'll have to help him moving some stuff later. 20 minutes later I told my brother to turn off the playstation so we can go help my dad, he ignored me and my dad came and said we have to go. I dressed and when I noticed that he left my brother playing instead of coming with us i started saying to him that this is not fair especially for the fact that he knows i shouldn't be doing this kind of stuff and that he should call me only when I'm really necessary because my brother can do the same things I can do and even better without any physical consequence. He started yelling to me that I'm should stop always say why he call only me and not my brother and that I'm not sick. 

When he said that I'm not sick I lost it and had a breakdown, I started shouting at him stuff and he reacted by going to my room and kicking the console. He injured his foot and said I'm the cause. 

He and my mom know that playing playstation is one of the few things I'm still able to do and they took it and said that by playing I'm ruining my brother's life because he'll become addicted. 

My brother doesn't care if there's no playstation, he spends the majority of the day at school with his friends. 

So I passed the last three days laying in my bed doing absolutely nothing beside of scrolling reddit, watching YouTube, and applying for jobs online. 

I have some money if I want to buy a console just for me so he can't use the ""if you play at it, your brother will be too"" but my parents said that If i buy one they'll destroy it. 

I want to make clear that I started spending more time playing only on the last months because I'm not able to do other activities, in fact I play while on my bed because I can't sit on a chair for more than 15 minutes.

However I realized that I have applied for a programs that don't suit me well and If did apply for even the best programs available  I would have been accepted, So I went into depression and I though of suicide at that time because simply I waste my months of studying hard for the exam with a simple bad decision due to poor planning and I kept blame myself for that (and still). I discuss with my family that If skip this year wait till the next year to apply to a different program (university don't allow to take the exam and apply the next year unless you resign within 1 week of  the the first month of work! or so I though!) I went and confirmed form my dean that I can apply to the exam next year If resign right now and he said yes you can you have 2 weeks to make your choice.
At that point I was really depressed because I had bad two choices, First to continues with this program that I actually don't like and keep blaming myself for the rest of the life! (really I have no idea why did apply to it in first place, maybe I wasn't  confident in myself  and thought I would do poorly in the exam, I don't know :( )
The 2nd choice is to  skip this year so that I can apply the next year, the problem here that my family was really proud of me and happy for me and didn't actually understand that I made mistake and chose a bad program. 
In addition, I have been always the good ""boy"" in the family always had high score in the school, university and most importantly don't cause any trouble for my family and solve my problems alone,So this was actually the first time in my life   I needed support form my family and they couldn't help me much and I transformed their happiness for me to a sadness from seeing me depressed and sad.(which made me depressed even more).....
So I went with the 2nd choice and choose to skip this( the last) year and during this year I kept looking for work with no success sadly...
Last month, the registration for this year open , and when I tried to apply they said no you can't!!! I try every possible way and talked to the dean but he simply said that he made a mistake he didn't know at that time......  
Right now I don't what to do, I can't to tell my family about this because they already started to see as a loser and can't  I cause anymore trouble.. really depressed right now and don't know what to do, currently I am lying to my family that ""everything is OK and the exam in near and I will do well with no mistakes"" with a fake smile :')
I have actually applied to other paid training program but the one in my university is the best by far and this well known to everybody....
Really sorry the for long post but I had to talk with somebody or at least write what it in mind ( actually I feel a little bit better right now) because I have no idea what to do from now on.... 
I actually consider myself a strong person and can deal with life problems really well and I keep helping my friends and give them advice always when they need (ironically I am still doing this) but  right now I really need someone to do the same for me because I think I can't hold this kind of stress and blaming myself (you know .....if I had chosen a good program last year, I wouldn't had to go through all this)any longer..

373,"I love her so much, but she recently got 2 (used to be 3) sugar daddies. She says that they're completely non-sexual. She claims that she basically just pretends to be their friend and they pay her money. She does get a lot of money from it, so I don't think she'll want to stop, but it makes me so uncomfortable. I'm not really worried about her cheating on me too much because she's offered me the password to her discord account, and she spends 90% of her time with me. 
I love her so much, and I think breaking up with her would spiral me back into my depression. What do I do?",15Apr2019,0

376,My friend got angry at me because I said I didn’t like her boyfriend and she didn’t talk to me for a couple of days. I apologised multiple times but everytime I say something she starts ranting about how im the reason she cuts every night. She is in the same friend group as I am so it is hard to avoid her. We haven’t talked in a couple of days and now she is randomly asking me personal questions about myself like do I have a pet. When i ask her why she says she is just wondering and goes on a rant about how she is allowed to wonder. What should I do? I want to be friends with my other friends and it is hard to avoid her when we are in the same classes.,15Apr2019,2
377,"So there's this girl. Her deal is that she makes friends with emotionally unstable guys (like me) but when they start evolving feelings for her or get too attached she starts neglecting them because she doesn't want to be responsible for their well being. Same thing happened to me, but it's okay, I realised that it hurts her just as much as it hurt me, but she won't change her behaviour that's for sure. She doesn't want to talk about it anymore, although we both know it's not all fine again. So last weekend we had a party at my place and she was there as well, we were both drunk and when all the guests left she stayed and we talked very long about many things. She eventually starts crying and says that she needs someone to talk to but everyone she tries to tell what's on her mind falls in love with her and then she couldn't talk to them anymore, I was no exception. We argued a lot and said some harsh things to each other but in the end we both apologized for what we said because we were both drunk and it was like 8 in the morning. My feelings for her are gone by now, but I still really want to be there for her when she needs to talk about her feelings and I realize she doesn't really have someone to talk to, otherwise she wouldn't have stayed that long to talk to me. But she can't talk about feelings unless she's drunk, and whenever she's drunk she is very mean and jumps to conclusions a lot which then eventually ends in an argument and I can't take these conversations anymore. 

Im not sure if she's ever gonna be able to admit that she just needs a friend (and that this friend might or might not be me), but is there anything I can do besides waiting for things to go back to normal again? Should I try to be there for her although she doesn't admit that she needs a friend or should I just shut up and let her deal with her problems on her own? It's really not about my love struggle anymore, at this point it's really just about her well being and what I can do to help her. 

I know this is a pretty complex situation and I do not expect a final solution to this problem, but I'm overwhelmed by this situation right now and I'm glad for any piece of advice you guys might have.",15Apr2019,1
378,"My uncle died of cancer recently. He was moved to a hospice a month ago. So I travelled home to go see him, my parents refused to tell me which hospice and refused to give me a lift there. They said I could go see him after my deadlines. He was predicted 4 more months (what they told me, apprantly that was false he only had a few weeks).

So I went home, continued with my last year of my degree. (UK). Everything that could have gone wrong with my degree has, I've been struggling hard. My computer broke, I had to change the software of my project last minute. My supervisor tried changing my project last minute. My supervisor forgot to book an important room for usability testing. I lost a lot of work due to these issues over 20-30 hours. I'm still on track, I've nearly completed my project despite all this.

My sister then called me last Saturday because my uncle had passed during the night suddenly. My sister and I don't get on- but my parents stated they weren't going to tell me till after my deadline had passed which she disagreed with so she rang to tell me.

I rang up asking when the funeral is because I need to sort out my dissertation so I finish it early- the funerals on the day of my deadline the 3rd of May. So I said thats fine because I plan to get it finished by the 25th this month so I can come down. I always hand in everything 3 days earlier anyway.

My parents stated ""Not to worry and focus on my dissertation."" that ""They won't take me because I need to focus."". 

My supervisor asked for me to apply for extension but for that I need proof of a death certificate which my parents refuse to provide because ""You can't cope out and try to use your uncles death for an excuse"". Which my supervisor is livid about because I was very close with my uncle and they denied me seeing him three times in the past year, which I was upset about at university. When I tried to go round my uncles house to find where the hospice was, my aunt refused to let me in because my parents had my best interest at heart. They all want me to finish my degree, but I'm 8,0000 words in I just need to write my conclusions and reflections thats all! My last deadline isn't till the 15th of May which is coursework which I'm going to bang out in 10 days anyway (I've written the report and set up the project with the skeleton, it's prepared).

My sisters travelling down from Sheffield to make the funeral- I live only an hour away and nobody will tell me the location or the time. None of my relatives! I'm messaged several of them. My sister said she would tell me if I send her proof of my handing it in online, and a printed copy on my desk before the deadline. Basically, I'm finishing my project a week before the deadline just to be able to attend this funeral. 

He was my only uncle that wasn't a utter twat- he was honestly the biggest sweetheart and provided several fun memories whilst in his care. He adopted two children and was an ambulance driver. My dad discussed the music being played at the funeral which included ACDC. Which made us both chuckle. 

I just want to be there. How can I get my parents to just tell me the location and the time? I want to have the option myself to go! It's my decision, I'm 21.",15Apr2019,1

384,"Hey, it's my first time posting here and I'm not 100% sure if what I'm asking is okay but yeah. Here's the mf tea:
My best friend, let's call her GL (Girl L.), was dating this guy, BA (Boy A.), for a little over a year and GL got into a really bad place mentally and decided she needed to break up. They do and right after she meets me, BT (Boy T.).
Me and GL are just friends, but we are sexually active and we do go out on dates but it's perfectly clear that we're not supposed to catch feeling for each other and that we are not exclusive to each other.
Fast forward one month after we meet and GL gets back with BA because he insisted that they should get back together. GL was not a big fan of that and she made it 100% clear that it wasn't working, so they break up again.
At this point, GL tells me that BA was mildly abusive. He never hit her but he would squeeze her hands very firmly whenever he got upset and if they argued in the car he would punch other objects, not her.
GL was single for a few more weeks, she stills talked to BA to maintain a friendly relationship. GL is a very good person and she cares about other people too much for her own good. Yesterday after work she asked BA for a ride home and he picks her up, instead of dropping her home he takes her to a different parking lot to talk.
He wanted her back one more time and she said no. Instead of taking the no like a normal person he attacks her. He chokes her until she passed out then he threw her to the back seat. When she woke up she grabbed her phone and left the car as fast as possible and BA followed behind. She called her mom and BA stopped following. She sat down to catch her breath and BA went back to his car and just watched her while she got a ride home with her mom.

I'm the only person that knows about this. And I'm a huge advocate to being peaceful. But I'm really angry and I really don't want him to just get away with this. I don't know what to do.",15Apr2019,1
385,"Sorry, this is going to be LONG! 


First, let me share a little about myself. I’m a student at PSU graduating this June after putting myself through school. I’m getting a Bachelor in Science, majoring in social sciences with an emphasis on forensics/criminalistics, minoring in history and philosophy. (I wanted to go into forensics, but I got pregnant very unexpectedly halfway through school and higher level chemistry and physics was very hard to do with a newborn. I tried to switch back to a History major, my original passion, but I already had so many science classes and not enough arts and letters classes, so my counselor suggested social sciences was the best major to pick.) 

I also work full time to take care of my family and I’m a taxidermist in my free time. It’s just a hobby at this point, but I really love it. 

On top of all those things I do- full time senior in school, full time job, AND an apprenticeship (unpaid) at a taxidermy shop, I’m also a mom. I have a 2 year old daughter. I was told I couldn’t get pregnant, so we weren’t using birth control, and I found out I was pregnant very late. So, basically, I took a semester off school, three months unpaid maternity leave, and then jumped right back in. 

My husband, on the other hand, is lazy and has zero ambitions in life. I’ve tried very hard to help him find a job he loves, to find school or training in something he likes, or to even turn anything he’s interested in into a career. But all he wants to do is play games on his iPhone (that I bought him.) 

My husband comes from a poor and not very loving family. My in-laws are just a nightmare. So, when we met (I came from an upper middle class family. But my mom inherited all her money and was a selfish entitled person who treated me like garbage, so I left with zero money and built up everything I have on my own.) I felt bad for him and spoiled him. He had literally nothing when we met. I got him a phone, and then later an iPhone. I gave him the first car I bought myself when I had enough money saved to get another one. I helped him get his license, and he moved in with me almost right away (without me asking.) since he lived at home still with his mom. 

I tried very hard to help him grow up and get his shit together. Which was hard because he has felonies from a drunk driving incident he was involved in when he was 18 years old. Mostly, we are rejected from a lot of places or I have to pay extra to have things. (Had to pay extra to have car insurance, my security deposit was doubled.) and he was doing great for a while there. Before we had our daughter, I let him just work his part time job and then come home and be lazy on his days off. Why not? But when we found out we were pregnant, I asked him many times if he was ready for it and would he be able to change his lifestyle? And he promised me over and over. 

And for the first year, he was perfect. He had lost his job right before the baby was born and was on unemployment, so I was working two jobs for a while. Then he finally got a job right when we got a nice 2-bedroom apartment. It’s in a real bad area, so I always thought it would be temporary. I started saving money for a house. He insisted we’d never have enough for a house in 5 years and tried to convince me to not save anything, because it would never happen. He’s always trying to convince me to just NOT pay things. He has all these debts that come in the mail almost daily, because that’s always just what he’s done. I’m not like that, however. 

But, the past year, he’s changed. He’s back to his old ways, being lazy and absolutely refusing to do anything. He’s gotten fired from three jobs in the past year. One job he got fired the very first week. It’s all for being late coming in and late coming back from his breaks. He’s late to everything in life and has no respect for anyone’s time. In fact, he will lock himself in the bathroom for hours on his phone and then insist he was only in there for 10 minutes so much, I start to think I’m the crazy one. 

He stays up late playing phone games, refuses to go to sleep, and I can’t get him to look up from his phone when he’s home to save my life. My daughter will scream his name 100 times before I step in. And I have to scream it many more to get him to look up. When he’s not working, he won’t clean and he will cook one night and we have to have leftovers the rest of the week. He continued to claim unemployment benefits when he started working, so he can’t get them again and he owes the state $800. I depleted my savings supporting my family while he’s out of work and now I’m at the point where I cannot afford for him not to work anymore. 

Then, on top of everything, he’s possessive and constantly thinks I’m going to cheat. He goes through my phone and uses the “where’s my iPhone?” App to stalk me. And then if he didn’t know I was going somewhere, he will freak out on me and accuse me of meeting up with someone. I thought this was all a little much, considering I’ve never cheated on him, but then I caught him trying to cheat on ME. While I was at work and he was supposed to be watching our 2-year-old! The only reason he didn’t was because the girl (our neighbors friend) said no! But if she had said yes, he would’ve done so in my bed with my little girl in the next room! 

On top of all that, he crashed and totaled my car last month. Texting while driving. So I took back my old car I had given him, but he threw a fit about not having a car to get to his new job with (the one he’d get fired from after less than a week) so his mom gave him 700$ to buy one. And my old car? Well it’s no longer working. So now I don’t have a car. 

I am so done with all of this. Every week he is costing me more money I don’t have and on top of everything, he guilt trips me. He has threatened suicide if I leave him and will promise me he will change and to “give him a week” to show he is an adult. But he doesn’t! He will leave food out, like cut up an orange and just leave the peel and juice and knife on the counter. He will leave the milk out. The fridge door is constantly open. My daughters dirty diapers are just left on the floor, or couch, or bed or wherever he changed her. 

I have tried everything to get him to change. I guess because I’ve threatened to leave so much and never have, he’s no longer afraid I will. But even when he was, he would change for a few days, then go right back to it. And this is t even the half of it, I was just trying to be brief to give some background. 

Now, I want to leave, but here is why I have to wait and don’t know what to do: 

For the first time in a long time, I am completely broke. I’m living paycheck to paycheck and even on payday, my check is mostly gone as I pay all the things I owe and have been waiting on. He just got a new job and I need his income, at least for a little while, until I’m back to not living like this. Since I’m in my last term and all my classes are online, im hoping to get a new higher paying job with my degree so I can move out on my own. But I can’t just up and go. My family lives on the other side of the country and like I said, my mom and I don’t get along and will only help if I move back in with her, 3,000 miles away. But that would just be me going from one selfish entitled abusive person to another. So that’s not an option. I’m also so busy with all the things I do that I’ll need childcare, and that’s another thing I can’t quite afford. 

I can’t just kick him out either, I’ve tried. He’s on the lease and refuses to go. Everything we fight bad enough for him to actually leave, he comes back in the middle of the night and I cannot stop him. 

Even though we are fighting all the time, which I hate! Because sometimes our daughter sees! And (I’m tearing up writing this.) the other day she screamed “shut up!” At my husband while we were yelling. I can’t do this anymore in front of her. But it’s so bad, it can’t be contained when she’s home sometimes. My daughter hates being alone with him and won’t even let him brush her teeth or pick her up. She always wants mom. Maybe it’s because when she does want daddy he never looks up from his phone. I’ve seen her run to him with arms open and he just walks right past her, almost tripping her on the way. (Ok, now I’m full on crying.) 

I don’t have the money for a divorce, I don’t have the money yet to move out. I thought I could handle it until I graduated and got a better job , but I can’t live like this anymore. He constantly asks for money, and then gives me shit the few times Ives spent my own hard earned money on myself. I want to leave him, but he’s ran through all my resources. 

I am trying to fix the other car so I can sell it and buy a more reliable car. That’s step one. Then I applied to a ton of jobs that are higher paying and require a degree. That’s step two. Once I have enough money I’m going to break the lease and take the security deposit (which I know he will try to take or ask for half of, but HE is the reason I had to pay double since he had felonies and I paid it ALL.) and get my own place. 

But I’m not sure I can last that long. What do I do? I looked into a women’s shelter, but I’m not being physically abused so I’m not entitled to any money (they give money to abused women to put down for first months rent for an apartment.) and all the shelters won’t accommodate my busy lifestyle. I am in my senior year of college, in my second to last semester. (Next term I only need 2 classes to finish!) I already paid for graduation costs and for my cap and gown. It would be stupid to stop going now. Also, I need the degree to get a job to afford living on my own. And also, I lost everything I owned as a kid in a fire. Then when I moved out here on my own I left all my possessions at home and my mom tossed them all when she moved. Everything I have is everything I bought for myself, everything I worked so hard to get, and I’ve lost everything I’ve owned twice now. I don’t want to lose everything again just because the person I loved chose to take advantage of me. 

I am a hard worker. I am ambitious. I am generous and empathetic. I am smart. So, why can’t I do this? 

What can I do to get away from him? What should I do? I really need help. I am a push-over, the kind of person that has a hard time saying “no,”. So he guilted me into staying the few times I had enough money TO leave. Now, I don’t. And he finally pushed me so far, I need to leave. Not because of me, but because of my daughter. I can’t let her see this anymore, and I don’t want her learning from him. 

Please help.",15Apr2019,2
386,"Okay hear me out. I love my puppy who passed away and I am so heart broken until now. However, I’m thinking about my other adult dog who doesn’t have a companion anymore in our home whenever I go to work.

My bestfriend got a beagle pup from her workmate (workmate bought the pup for mom, but mom didn’t want so he gave it to my BF). But my BF has lots of dogs already and offered to give it to me for a chance to start over with a new pup.

I am hesitant to do so because I don’t want my beloved pup (who passed away) to feel neglected, unloved and replaceable. But I also want my other adult dog to have a companion so she’s not lonely when we’re at work.

On another note, I think it’s not coincidence that  the beagle pup was neglected by her original family and needed a home asap.

389,"I’m 21 years old, I’m almost finished with a degree in journalism, but I’ve learned through the course of my education that I hate journalism.

I hate freelancing, I hate the transient nature of the industry, hate that the industry is shrinking every day, I hate the way everyone more established treats people below them, I hate that you have to do complicated and emotionally draining work for extremely little pay, and I hate that I chose this degree plan. 

I initially chose this degree because I wanted to learn how to be a videographer. Now, I don’t know what I want to do. I wish I’d just studied English, so at least I could fall back on teaching.

My honest thought is that I want to drop out, and focus on my mental health. School has, since the second grade, been a major source of depression and anxiety in my life, and it’s made me suicidal in the past. I’m suicidal right now. 

I’m lucky enough to have come this far without having to take out student loans, so I’m not in debt. I’m also lucky enough to have met someone that I’m in love with, and I hope to marry them someday. I hate that my studies and work take me away from them, drain my energy, and make it so that I’m less emotionally available to them.

391,"Hi Redditors. Hope you’re all well. I saw this thread and I figured I’d share my issue and see if I can some help as I’m kinda stuck.

1. So around October time of 2018 I was going through a tinder type of app and I matched with this girl. She told me she doesn’t use the app a lot and to message her on insta. So a few hours later I saw that she had sent me a message on insta. Right off the bat we hit it off quite well. We had a lot in common, talking all the time on a constant basis. She was hesitant  to give me her number initially but once we developed a closer relationship she ended up giving me her phone number as a birthday present for myself around November. 

2. So things were progressing really well and we were sharing deep stories with each other about anything and everything. One day we were speaking about love/relationships and she started telling me about how she’s had 2 really bad relationships. The first one was very toxic from what she was telling me. This was her very first relationship and she told me how the guy would just use her for sex and practically raped her for her first time. She would do so much for him yet he’d just treat her like crap. Didn’t really love her back, every time she would go visit him he’d always want sex and her being new to the country, very naive and just wanting to keep him happy would just go along with. This was going on for about a year and a half. Till one fateful afternoon she came over and she found out that he was cheating on her with his neighbour. Initially she forgave him and they were still together for a few months, but he cheated on her again and then she finally left him.
3. A year or so later she told me she again got into another relationship which was once again very terrible and toxic. She again put her heart and soul into it but didn’t get anything in return. As a result of these toxic relationships it led her to being completely burnout when it comes to love and she and me were talking about how she no longer has it in her to fall in love or put in that time and effort again because she’s worried that it’ll happen again and she’ll get mixed up and involved with another piece of shit
4. So again we were talking and talking getting closer and closer and I ended up inevitably catching feelings. So I was straight up and told her this is how I felt about her. She kinda freaked out and said she can’t deal with this and this isn’t what she can do etc. She then ended up blocking me on all forms of social media. I’ll be honest I was genuinely torn apart and was crying for about 2 days. Miraculously about 5/6 days later she messaged me back and said hey if you wanna he friends we can still be if that’s what you want. So we talked a bit more then we ended up sorting things out
5. I went up north to eventually meet her face to face and whilst out and having some food, she tells me that she’s been thinking about a lot in regards her situation, what I said etc. She then revealed that there is a “guy” in her life who’s she in like a trial relationship with. She told me she visited him one weekend and they hooked up. Ever since then they’ve kinda had this weird platonic relationship. Where he’s fully invested 100% in it, loves her. Whereas she’s not fully in it due to her circumstance. She wouldn’t like talking about the relationship with this guy so I wouldn’t bring it up.
6. Towards new year’s eve etc I said to her I want to visit her but for a weekend and we can chill and spend the whole weekend with one another. Once again we met up and me and her were very elated. It’s like every time we met up in person our bond would just get stronger and stronger and we’d get so comfortable around each other. One evening she comes round for some drinks in my hotel room. We start drinking and dancing and having fun. I kinda got a bit too drunk and kinda fell asleep, but some time after I remember feeling and receiving a kiss on the lips. Next day as I was due to leave I wasn’t sure what to do or say about it because we had both mutually decided that it’s best we just stay as friends. So I was kinda scared and worried that it was me who initiated it. But she told me yes I kissed you. She said don’t worry, we both got drunk and these things happened. I said this has never happened to me and we awkwardly let the conversation go and I just went home
7. Fast forward a few months to the beginning of March and I’ve moved up to the same city as her because I was having so many issues at home and I needed to leave for my own well-being. Me and her were both happy that I was closer because it meant we could hang out more often, spend more time and just strengthen our friendship even more. So a few weeks ago she came over once again to do some studying. We studied briefly and then decided to drink and dance etc. Inevitably, we both got drunk and we were just getting cosy on my bed and ended up making out a few times. We met up in person a few days later and we discussed about what happened that what happened just happened. It doesn’t matter, what difference does it make. I don’t wanna give you any hope or mislead you blah blah. I’m like cool and just agreeing with her, but honestly all I’m doing is just thinking about this “guy” she’s with and how he would be feeling if he knew this was happening behind his back.
8. So ever since then it’s been playing in my mind on what to do and it’s caused me some stress. Then I kinda just said fuck it and I messaged the guy and told him what had happened. She then says to me you’re dead to me, don’t show me your face ever again... I’m here like just feeling so conflicted and stuck. I know I’ve done the right thing by telling the guy what happened. But at the same time I’m feeling kinda sad and upset and this girl is no longer my friend and wants nothing to do with me. 
9. Tbh I never asked to be in this position. I moved up north to show her that I could be a good friend to her as she’s also dealt with lots of people who’s screwed her over. But I didn’t move just for her, I had to leave my home because it was seriously impacting my mental well being and having tried to commit suicide before and cutting myself I knew that if I stayed at home and longer I may not live. Now I’m just here thinking man why couldn’t we just be friends. Why did all this rubbish have to happen. Honestly deep down she is a really down to earth and great gal but she’s just an unfortunate victim to shitty circumstances that have made her be like this.
10. Reddit I now leave it to you, for your eternal wisdom and advice. Please send me all your suggestions as I really am stuck and I’m starting to feel guilty and wishing I didn’t do what I did last night.

A little context I'm the older of 4 children, am 30 haven't lived with mother and sisters for about 7 years now.

So my sister currently 14 years old stole money from my mom about ~$100 a few days ago. Now she did this before about 3 years ago at which time I gave her a good yelling at and such.
I was informed of her doing this again at which I was angry About and was gonna go about it the same way. Then I was informed that she has done this a few times since the time a few years ago , I was just not told.

I spoke to my sister before and asked her why she does these things, her answer was that she doesn't know why she does this and that she just does , like almost if it's not her doing it.

A little more context, we are a low income family, my sister (14) is over all a good young lady, she has good grades, she is very sweet and has a good heart she's understanding helpful and very smart. But is also being a little fucking theive .

She might just be bipolar and have a double personality, maybe a psychopath I don't know. I would like some help on how to go about this besides just disciplining her, if there is a real issue at the root cause.

398,"*(I apologize in advance for the long-ish backstory)*

I had this situation in my life recently and I keep freaking myself out by dwelling on it too much. Basically a person I called a friend was meant to take a class with me this semester but she somehow scheduled wrong and didn't end up in the class. She said she really needed me in the class with her though, and there were two lectures for the given class ,one evening and one was an 8 am. However, mine was full in seats, so I switched to the morning one to be with her. (she didn't force me so i don't want to make it seem like that, but she said she wanted me with her in it) A few weeks go by and she had expressed wanting to drop because she didn't do amazingly on the first exam. We still had two more exams to go so i just recommended she wait for the second because she hadn't even failed the first just because dropping at this point in the semester may have been a bad choice, and the class was required so I told her it was worth sticking it out. She had read the messages but didn't reply for days. She also missed out on a few lectures and I was getting worried about if she was having personal issues or something. Same day tho, I saw her in school. I didn't really know if she was avoiding me on purpose, but it did upset me. Last message I had sent was asking if she dropped the class, and she told me she had.

Now this is the part where I keep worrying about me being extreme, but I sent a reply saying how I felt disrespected that she didn't tell me. Not the very fact she dropped because I said in the message I understood her grades mattered, but more so the fact she chose to avoid me for a week. The reason I felt hurt was that I felt we had a friendship somewhat outside of class (we've known each other a few months so we weren't extremely close). I think the reason I was hurt was I sort of felt someone used me. I'm not one to be confrontational, but the situation in particular had just really upset me. And the next day I did see her in school and she kind of gave me an angry look. It's been a week since this happened and now I keep beating myself up over it and thinking I was in the wrong and being extreme. My friends irl have reassured me that my feelings were justified and I had to look after myself but part of me thinks they're only saying that because they don't want to upset me. Ultimately, it is a situation I want to move on from but it's been hanging on me and it's freaking me out. If anyone here has stop communicating with someone over feeling hurt, do you have any advice on how to move on?",15Apr2019,1

401,"  

I have a co-worker who I would not say we are close at all. I don’t have her phone number nor am I friends with her on any social media.

However, she is a part of an organization at work that I am apart of &amp; we started talking more.

I met her boyfriend at an event the organization had and he seemed nice and we had small talk.

A few weeks later I invited her to my birthday party at a bar downtown. She invited her boyfriend. Again, we had small talk &amp; they all had a great time with everyone there.

Later that night I had a friend request from him on Facebook so I accepted it. Please note I am not even friends with his girlfriend so I don’t understand how he found me. 

He started messaging me saying “I know you’re probably asleep lol” at 11pm the next night. He said that because the two times I met him I kept saying how it was past my bed time when we were out late. I wrote back a laughing face &amp; he then asked what was I doing up. I just found the fact he was writing me at all odd so I ignored it. 

He then sent a Facebook invite to his girlfriend’s going away party (she is moving out of town) and I said I would go. Saturday night was the party but I just didn’t feel like going. 

He wrote me during the party asking where I was. Again, considering I’ve only met him twice &amp; the conversation was very limited I found that odd.

So I wrote back the next day and said “let (girlfriends name) know I am so sorry something came up, but I hope she had a good party.”

He then writes back “hmmm your boo probably called huh?” So this just literally pissed me off. I don’t know this guy like that. 

I sent him a message saying I think it’s inappropriate he is writing me at all considering I am his girlfriends co-worker that he does not know except for meeting on two occasions. 

I also let him know my relationship status is none of his business &amp; he needed to stop writing me. He wrote back “lol I just asked where you were I was just trying to see where you were I treat everyone like family but fine I’ll stop bothering you.”

Did I overreact to his messages? He could just be a very friendly outgoing guy. However, on the other I would be pissed if my boyfriend was writing private messages to my female co-workers.

402,"I am current doing an honours degree at the University of Queensland Australia (for those not in Australia it is equivalent to a first year PhD economics program)  and am struggling with the workload.

At the risk of coming off looking bad here is my situation. I graduated from college a few years ago in the field of Computer Technology but it’s been extremely hard to find a job in my field. I would apply everyday through Indeed, LinkedIn, Monster, Glassdoor and I would either never hear back or get denied. It’s been like this for 4 years now. It’s been this long because of the aforementioned problem and the fact that I listened to people and dropped it to find another job.

In fact because of peer pressure and fear I wasted a whole year working as a porter where I mopped floors, washed dishes, cleaned toilets etc. I succumbed to the whims of everyone gave up on my dream job and I was incredibly depressed and quit by New Years and from that day on I swore I would never compromise my happiness and self-esteem for money.

I rent a room with my brother he works a full-time job that the government got him and I keep busy and pay the rent by doing freelance computer work but it's been really slow lately, jobs are coming in scarce and the rent is piling up.

Fast forward to this month where I am behind on my rent so I asked my brother to cover me for this week while I keep looking he said no. Then we got into a fight where he tried to shame me for wanting to find a high paying job that makes me happy and put lots of money in my pocket in the long run while I shamed him for his below average intelligence and lack of ambition and him quitting his passion for art to make quick and easy money. That didn’t sit well with him and he attacked me. Trying to beat me up even though I told him not to touch me cause I'm all about self defense now after my last roommate beat me up, bullied me and made me his victim.

The problem is it still hurts that I’ve been forced to forgive him but I can’t this time.

405,"I stopped my business about a year ago and can't find anything. Reason being, I was seriously ill for a lot of years prior to working for myself so I really don't have much on my resume. It took me a decade just to finish my degree. I've been applying daily for about a year now with no success. It's getting to a point now where I feel like if I'd spent all that time on a business it could have been on it's way by now! Even when I get an interview someone with more experience gets the job. I've even been told I present myself, and my jobs (very few) well so it isn't that.   


I didn't stop my business because it failed. It was going well but it wasn't making enough money to hire staff as it was just early days and I just couldn't keep doing it - it was far too physically exhausting (some limitations from illness), so technically I've already had a successful business so I have more experience with entrepreneurship than the world of work. The idea I have for a business is cheap to set up. The reason I haven't started working on the business idea already is because I've been desperate to get a job so I have some money, to get me out the house, and because I think people that I know wouldn't really understand why I'm going for such a crazy option and would still go on to me about finding work. But, the thing is, it's starting to really grind down on my self-esteem being rejected this much, it's taking all of my time, all of my morale, and after a day of looking for work I'm doing nothing at all because I just feel stressed and exhausted. I think it's because after all that work, it's not even a job I feel great about anyway. It's not like I'm applying for decent stuff. I can't get work with my degree because it's way too competitive and I've been out of the game too long with my illness. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I'm having no luck with finding work because of my illness/lack of work experience (and where I live), I feel more passionate about running my own business than anything else, but I know that running a business isn't going to help me financially for a long time. But what if finding work takes about the same time as making a profit from my business? (Not a great deal of set-up costs, I could sell my old business equipment to buy new equipment)",15Apr2019,1

409,"Hi folks,

I'll get straight to it.

&amp;#x200B;

I live with my gf in an apartment complex. Each floor has 10 or so apartments, we live in the middle of the hallway.

&amp;#x200B;

One night, at around 3:30 AM (I'm a night owl), I hear some soft running noises and a bell go by my door. I think to myself, ""sure, maybe someone is taking out their dog for a late night walk"". But this happens several more times, and on the last time, I hear sniffing from under the door.

&amp;#x200B;

I walk out, and lo and behold, there is a large black dog at the end of the hallway. He looks like a lab mix around 80 pounds. We'll call him Bobby. I try to motion to him but at first he's scared and growls a little. A minute or two later after crouching down and showing him that my hands are empty, he comes over and sniffs and another minute or two later, lets me pet him. He starts shaking a little bit and looks scared.

&amp;#x200B;

I look at his tags and see that he's from the apartment down the hall. As I walk up to the door, I see that it's ajar. Fearing the worst, I plan to phone the number on his tag, and if no one responds, walk in and possibly call the cops. 

&amp;#x200B;

I phone the number and the owner picks up, let's call her Stacey. I say that I have Bobby with me in the hallway and that her door is wide open. She says she's at work on a late shift and that he recently learned how to open doors.

&amp;#x200B;

He's a very sweet boy. I give him some belly rubs, make sure he stops shaking a little bit, and bring him back inside his apartment. I clamp the door with a woodworking clamp and a USB cable to make sure he doesn't break out again, along with a note.

&amp;#x200B;

Stacey never phones back and doesn't say thank you, nor does she return the clamp and USB cable which are still by the door.

&amp;#x200B;

Since this incident I've heard Bobby in the hallway and led him back to his apartment twice. Since I got no response before, I don't bother phoning again and simply take him back and close the door.

&amp;#x200B;

Today as I'm typing this, he's sitting next to me in my apartment. This time I went to bed normally, woke up around 8, and my gf and I heard him in the hallway around 9 AM. We come out, Bobby remembers me and calms down. We pet him for a little bit and try to get him walking back over to his apartment, but he won't budge. We try gently tugging on his collar, but he does not want to budge.

I call Stacey, explaining that he's in the hallway again, but this time he doesn't want to go back. She says, ""Yeah sometimes I have to drag him in"". She says that she could have someone else pick him up around 10:30 or 11. This seems odd to me but I say that I  would be willing to keep him at our place until she picks up him. She says OK and I hang up.

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as we open our door and tell Bobby to come in, he immediately gets up and walks right in.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to give Stacey the benefit of the doubt until this point despite all of the red flags, but this one seems the most wrong. From owning dogs before, readily walking into a stranger's apartment before wanting to walk into your own is bizarre and smells mildly of neglect.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm likely going  to take this up with the apartment management and a 3rd party both to make sure this doesn't happen again for our hallway residents and so that Bobby is in fact alright.

I looked through my family's photo albums, but we don't have much as a family. Going overseas with just my mum or with my friends just isn't the same as going with both my parents.

As a student, while I don't have much money, I'm pretty much desperate enough that I'm willing to take out my savings to book an overseas tour together as a family, but my father is simply not having it. 

Please advice and help! Thank you :)",15Apr2019,2

This friend (Friend #1) is Bi, she was dating Friend #2 (who's also a good friend of mine). Everything was good and well until friend #1's parent's found out she was Bi. The day her parents found out she was missing from school for three days (we are all seniors in High School, she's 17. Turns out those three days were filled with her being forced to do Bible studies, being verbally berated and emotionally manipulated. She has now been forced to break up with her girlfriend (Friend #2) and she isn't allowed to talk to her. Her parents wanting her to change isn't new but now that they know she is Bi its been taken to whole new levels. They are talking about forcing her to drop out and get her GED and then shipping her off to bible college (although I don't think that will happen). One of her friend's parents has offered to let her stay at their house if she gets kicked out, but her parents are telling her she wont leave their 'care' until she changes. It seems like they don't even love her and hate who she is.

My one cat Simba recently took up to spraying last year and it was on and off at first, but now its just non stop and causing a lot of stress in the house for us. I try to keep her away from the other cats and from the rest of the house as much as I can when she’s inside because I know she’ll go and find a place to spray. 

But now she’s been spraying in my room and last night she pissed on my blanket! I love her to death and she loves me so much that she follows me around everywhere I go so I can’t imagine rehoming her.

421,"TL;DR at bottom

So in English schools the last 4 years of highschool are split in 2. GCSEs= year 10-11 and A levels= year 12-13. You study for the two years than take a month of exams, they're a really big deal and it's difficult to get a higher education without either of them. I'm in year 11.

So I've been going to an online school for the past 2 years so my schedule isn't exactly normal. I've been waking up at 7am and studying until 12pm so I can have a 30min break before class starts. My classes usually go from 12:30 to ~6pm but can go as late as 8-9pm. On the weekends I spend most of my time doing homework then studying so I rarely see my friends outside of class. 

We're also moving in the summer so I need to organise and pack my whole room. The problems is I don't have enough time for it. Wherever I finish studying/class and finally have some downtime I'm exhausted. This I can manage just fine but my mum's been pestering me about taking care of my room, I tried explaining that I just haven't had any time and maybe I could take a day off to do it since I'm on holiday at the moment. She said that was bullshit and she's constantly telling me to work more. When I tried to explain how I saw things she just left the room. 


I guess this is more of a rant but I just don't know how to get through to her, I know she's just worried about my exams but every since this started I've been sleeping odd hours, eating very little and incredibly tired.

TL;DR= I have big exams that I've been studying for month's for with little-no days off, mum doesn't believe I'm working hard enough and tells me to pack my room in the very little amount of free time I have.",15Apr2019,1

423,"Hello,
I am a 23 year old male who needs help getting his life together. My main problem is that I have lost hope for my future after graduating from college and feel like I am wasting my life.

My background/problems
1. Come from a strict Muslim family which has prevented me from ever dating a girl and having anxiety when I do. I now have no skills at flirting or speaking with women. This caused a lot of frustration for me previously and at a very low point in my life I went to a massage parlor to relieve myself. I have since worked to better myself and got hobbies, and donated to various charities to help children and women. However, I still feel guilty I did something like this (mostly because sexual acts are a major sin and I know I am a better person than this)

2. I was very driven in college and was someone who sacrificed a lot of free time to get good grades. In the academic environment, I felt the sky was the limit and so it was easy to make studies my life In order to 'make it big'. The 'make it big' mentality stayed with me but I have not accomplished anything major. I feel like a failure and this (along with problem #1) were significant towards my depression.

3. I am currently just wandering though life without a purpose or idea what I want to do. I spend my weekends trying to figure out ways to network, make friends, and date (I used meetup and some dating apps) but I have not made any connection with business partners/startup founders, friends that want to hang out regularly, or women that want to date me. I feel like I am wasting my early 20s not making the most of my freedom and lack of responsibility. At the core, I just feel like time is being wasted.",15Apr2019,3
424,"I'm just not sure what to do here. TLDR on bottom. Ok. So I (31F) have one younger sister (26F).  We are really close despite being so very different. She has a tumultuous past &amp; a drinking problem (thanks Mom) &amp; major issues with cheating &amp; lying in relationships (which she'll admit to when she's drunk). 2 years ago, she started dating my then-boyfriend's younger brother. We were so upset, as my then-BF's younger brother is such a great guy, the type of guy who would pick u up @ 2AM with no questions asked. My sister can be sweet, but every guy she has ever dated has ended up depressed, addicted to drugs, or in a mental institution. Sometimes all of the above. My sister is a serial cheater due to insecurities, which is so strange because she's seriously beautiful. Within 6 months of dating BF's younger brother she had cheated on him. Younger brother forgives her &amp; then goes on to a rubber banding (on again, off again, sister cheats, younger bro forgives, etc.) relationship for the last 2 years with sister. All friends refuse to hang out with them now b\c of constant drunken drama &amp; so my sister's &amp; I's relationship has suffered greatly. I have talked to them frankly about their unhealthy relationship many times. I have suggested therapy to both. I have been nice, mean, distant, all of the above. I love them both &amp; eventually my husband &amp; I took ourselves out of the equation completely, only hanging out with my sister or husband's younger brother\now my brother-in-law individually. But - last night, they came home from a trip &amp; my sister had a black eye, a huge cut on her jaw, multiple bruises all over her &amp; brother in law had a swollen cheek. Sister tells me she got wasted &amp; doesn't remember what happened, but yes, brother in law got physical. Brother in law thinks my sister is cheating on him, caused huge drunken fight. Face it, she probably is cheating on him again. This is crazy. Bro in law known is such a good guy but my sister has pushed another sweet man over the edge. My question is, what do I do????? I want to protect my little sister - we have no family, parents are gone &amp; it's just us - I'm supposed to protect her. And my husband wants to protect his little brother. I'm afraid their drama will keep esculating. I want them to break up, I want my sister to get therapy. She won't leave him b\c ""she doesn't want to be alone"" even though she ""wants to see other ppl."" Do I tell our family? Do I call the cops? Do I let it alone &amp; say ""they're adults it's both their faults, not my problem??"" My husband is here with me &amp; also wants to do something. We have stayed out of it for so long but now we feel like their relationship has crossed a dangerous line.  What can we do, what is the right thing to do here?? Any advice is greatly appreciated!!

Anyhow, for her birthday i bought her a really nice bag and a heartfelt card with a special message i left in there. 

She didn't open any of the presents she was given until after everyone had left (including me) the next day.

I met up with her twice during the week and she didn't mention the present or the card to me at all. It took my frustrated prompting an entire week later for her to actually say thank you. This isn't the first time - she really hasn't said thank you for much *at all* throughout the relationship 

I've been feeling really hurt (nearly in tears in fact), because i have made sacrafices for her even and i couldn't even get a thank you. When combined with the moving overseas factor, it hurts doubly so and has me doubting the relationship. 

She is from another culture, which may be a factor in her behavior. We also have a sizeable age gap between us.

It was proven that my brothers real mother did hard drugs when she was pregnant with him. My adopted sister was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my adopted brother was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome, but we all believe it’s much deeper than that. When my brother first came along, he seemed to act much younger than his age. He had the intelligence of a 6 year old but emotionally, he’d act 3 years old. We thought with some love and nurture then that would go away. It kind of did as he got older. But as he got older things have gotten much much worse and my mom and stepfather don’t know what to do with him anymore. He is now 11. He steals kitchen knives and hides them. He smokes heavily and steals cigarettes from my parents constantly. He steals phones, tablets, any electronic he can get his hands on. He has set the house on fire TWICE. He does everything my parents tell him not to do. It’s like he knows right and wrong but chooses to ignore it. We live in very rural Texas and my adoptive brother recently just revealed that he feels like he’s a girl on the inside. I told my mom that you have to support that even if she doesn’t agree with it. She kind of lost it though when she caught him putting tampons in his nether regions. My parents have tried everything to discipline him and teach him right from wrong but NOTHING has worked. He goes to several doctors and one of them even said he has psychopathic tendencies and wouldn’t be surprised if he shot up a school. My mom is SCARED of my 11 year old brother. When my adopted sister gets her apartment, my brother is gonna move in with her. This is the last straw according to my mom. If he hurts my sister or doesn’t shape up, my mom wants to send him back into CPS care because her and my stepdad can’t figure out what to do anymore. Yes, we’ve tried taking away things (he steals them right back). We’ve tried emptying his room. (He will just sleep). We’ve tried weekly therapy, we’ve tried medication. We simply don’t know what to do anymore. It fucking breaks my heart because it feels like my brother has never been wanted. And I’m afraid he feels that and that’s what fueling his outbursts. I love him very much, but because my mom is so scared of him, it’s like she doesn’t feel anything towards him anymore. It’s fucking heartbreaking. I don’t want him to go back to CPS custody.

454,"My girlfriend was recently rear ended by a young girl. 
The girl was driving passengers even though she didn’t have a full license yet that permitted that. 
The girl was at fault. And also tried to deter my girlfriend from calling the police.
Now her car needs to be totaled. My gfs car was worth around 2600 on Kelly blue book. Not sure if that even matters. 
Insurance is giving her 1400. 
Poor girl already has student loans, and we were a couple months away from an apartment.
Now that’s all out the window because of a damn child.

455,"Before we start, I'm only 16 and I don't have the means to independently go to a psychologist. However, I refuse to tell my dad or step mom about any of this as I am not close to either of them. My mom is the only person I would even consider talking to about this but she moved to North Carolina (I live in SC) around August of 2018. I know, it's stupid, I should talk to an adult but I really just can't so here I am seeking advice.

Last year around this time I started dating this girl who I thought was the most beautiful and amazing girl I'd ever met. At first I had trouble with feelings, but every time I kissed her I could feel them running through me, and before I knew it I was in love with her. Keep in mind I think I had and have some kind of undiagnosed social or mental problem, not like to where I'm slow but sometimes I don't know how to coherently respond either with actions or words, I never really knew this until... well we'll get to that. Some time goes by, and some girl who I had ""talked talked"" to a couple months prior but told her we wouldn't work out texts the girl I was dating that ""Idk what yall got going on but he's my man."" She then proceeds to Photoshop fake conversations between me and her which fucks with my already messed up head and I'm frantic at that point cause I'm scared I'm gonna lose the girl I love and I don't know how to prove my innocence. The relationship deescelates, she believes me but we're more or less taking a break. Things only get worse and the day of my birthday I get a message from her where she said ""Just forget about me"" but not in a ""Fuck off"" kind of way, in a ""I don't want you to be hurt"" kind of way and then she goes blank for a solid ten or so minutes which scares the hell out of me cause I knew she was somewhat suicidal or at least kind of depressed. Heads fucked up even more. Eventually I tell her at the rate we're going it would be better just to break up and remain friends than try to hang onto a relationship by a thread that has a slit in it. Boom we're done. Things would have been way better off if I left it at that, I didn't. Summertime came, all I could think about was her, even when I was smoking weed with my friends. Which leads me to where things got way worse, between my mentally impaired brain and the affects of the weed and my subconscious trait of paranoia and the fact I couldn't process the one girl previously mentioned who I'd been friends with since 7th grade and one other thing about her that my friend told me I began to get confused and suspicious and I caused myself to believe she [ex] was behind it. Completely and utterly irrational, that alone made me question my mentality after the fact. To make matters worse, I confronted her through text about this absolute idiotic theory I came up with. I regretted it, relentlessly tried to fix it and was ultimately blocked on every platform. I even went as far as to try to reach out to her through a mutual friend, eventually I accepted that what was something somewhat fixable I plummeted into an irreversible mess. I realize I was a crazy ex, she was my first real relationship and I didn't know what to do. Over the summer I was at my worst ever mentally and emotionally, but around August in a desperate attempt to gain the feeling I once had I dated my friends cousin who lived in another state but only like 2 to 4 hours away. That ended up not working out. School started, I would see my ex (the one which pertains to the premise of this) in the most coincidental ways. Walk out of the bathroom? She, and only she, is walking almost straight toward it (had to do with the layout of the building) and we make eye contact, genuinely makes me jump from the shock. Come out to the cafeteria looking for someone, look to my left to find that she looked directly to her right at exactly the right time I did and we make eye contact. There were other times, but not as coincidental as them, at least none that I can really recall. Eventually, I find another girlfriend, one I'm still with. I don't have feelings for her but I thought since I didn't initially have feelings for [premise] ex it'll work (forgot to mention this was also the case for previous gf). It's not, and I even messed up again. I did something I have highly rebuked for my whole life, I cheated. Physical contact with clothes on and nothing more, but still cheating. I admitted to it and almost lost her, to which I found I have an emotional connection with her. Also the girl I cheated on her with was an ex of mine from 8th grade which since I told my girlfriend about she told all of her friends a mistake I made with her when we were dating, and the mistake I made with her was wrong on my part but I will admit this one was a genuine mistake and I didn't really know much better. I've almost made the same mistake (cheating) again. Although I promised myself now I won't, and seeing as I'm mentally recovering this time I don't think there will be question about that, and yes through this all my mental state was still fucked. Still though, I don't think we'll work out, I've told her I don't love her even though I want to, I was about to break up with her until she called me bawling her eyes out. I couldn't do it, I pictured myself from a year ago about, so I stay with her hoping MAYBE there will be a chance I'll one day be in love with her. The reason I'm bringing all of this up is one of [premise] ex's friends had a birthday which I didn't know about. The first thing I see when I open Instagram is a picture with her, my ex, in it (with other people, it was through her friends account but she was the first person I saw). I immediately and shamefully started tearing up. The girl I once envisioned rocking in a rocking chair with me with kids and grandkids at age 70 is now happy without a thought in her mind about me while I don't even know who I am anymore, I don't know what reality is anymore, and the only escape I feel I can get from the past and the inevitable future is, you know. But not only do I not have the means of that, if I did I couldn't bare to do it. So I have to live on with this life that I threw away, with the worry that I probably won't even get to heaven. Which just adds onto it all seeing that I'm religious.



P.s. I didn't want to send this because I didn't want to be dramatic, I messed up and that's my fault so I don't hold much reputability. But it's been eating at me ever since and I needed to get it off my chest, if anything writing down my feelings will help. Also, I could've gone into more detail about this, and some parts I realize could have been better explained so if there's any confusion tell me.",15Apr2019,1
456,"I absolutely hate that I’m flat chested(AA-cup if you’re wondering). I feel like I can never be considered a “woman” only a “girl”. Barely. 

I don’t think I’m attractive because of it. I mean I get complemented on my face or whatever but it comes off more as “your face is nice but that pretty much it”. 

I honestly don’t think I’ll find a partner because of it unless it’s a kink or something . I know I probably shouldn’t be picky if that’s the case but I don’t want that. I don’t want to be with someone who only wants to be with me to satisfy a kink. I want to be valued for who I am. Tit-less and all.

But I don’t think anyone actually finds flat chested women attractive. It’s more of a dislike that’s isn’t a deal breaker.  Probably not the best thing to based my insecurity off, but there is a post in r/amitheasshole where a man made his flat-chested girlfriend turn around during sex. That’s absolutely humiliating and just makes me feel like my breast size is an obstacle to overcome for my partner.

I’m well aware that my partner shouldn’t care about that if they’re with me, but I think that’s what’s stopping me for being in a relationship. My body just isn’t attractive to anyone. And it’s not something that can be fixed like weight gain or hygiene. I’m stuck in a body I’m not happy with and there’s no real solution other than surgery, which I don’t want to do for a multitude of reasons.

459,"My parents tell me to work harder so I can be more successful than them. I know. They've said it a million times. But I don't think they know what I want. 

I'll sound like a brat who's ungrateful to her parents so don't read if you get easily offended.

I am blessed to be in a stable family with stable income. I do know that my parents relationship isn't all fresh fruits anymore. There's just tension between them sometimes even I can feel. I even wondered sometimes if they would divorce. 

Anyways, 
My Dad was a smart person, but due to family situations then, he flunked throughout high school and couldn't get a proper job. I scored better than my older sibling in a national exam in grade 6. This national exam is important as it streams the students into 3 categories basically by results which is a total of 300 marks. Me getting 233/300 (which I found not so well done) made my parents raise their expectations.

So In grade 7(new school) they started asking me, ""what do you want to become""

My parents chose for me a science-based subject combination. Guess what that means, my future job will be STEM based.

They ask me more frequently now ""what do you want to become? ""

""How about a doctor?"" They say without letting me answer. 

They tell me, so you can become a doctor or a nurse. So your life will be comfortable! No financial problems! So you can take care of us when we get older! So you can get paid enough! You can become a nurse! Thats good!

Dont get me wrong, im in love with biology and chemistry but I dont think I can handle peoples lives being in my hands. I know learning sciences dont mean I'll sure become a doctor/nurse, but thats what they tell me to do. And so far all the things they tell me to do, i eventually do it. 

I tell my parents ""i feel stressed"" they tell me its normal. I tell them ""i dont want to become a doctor"" they question me like a suspect. 

I say i want to draw. I want to do what I love. They say drawing will get me nowhere in this country. No high paying job. No stable income. Draw only as a hobby. Becoming a doctor is the only way to become rich. Which I know is false. 

Everything I say is wrong. Everything I want for myself will not help my parents. 

My parents tell me to study hard. To get into a good university to become a doctor when I have yet to turn 15. They tell me to work harder because they couldn't when they were my age. I get it. I do. They want me to live the best life. But do they even know what I want?

 I don't even know what I want anymore. I want to make them proud. But in doing so, I know I am not living for myself, but instead fulfilling the life they wished to live but never could. I am torn.",15Apr2019,1

461,"Last night I took a shower and when I went back into my bedroom, I didn't realize I left my blinds open. It took me about a few seconds to realize and then I quickly ducked out of sight in the hallway. But here's the thing: right when it happened, I saw someone run by my window. They looked like they were running fast so I didn't think they actually saw me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this morning, my fiance opened the door to leave and a handwritten note was wedged in the door and he brought it inside to show me.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what the note said:

**""I was walking by you're sexy as hell**

**If you want to smoke text me \_\_\_ \_\_\_ \_\_\_\_**

**Could make cash if you want""**

&amp;#x200B;

I usually open my blinds during the day to let light in so it wouldn't be unusual for someone to see me once in a while, but because of the timing of getting the note, I think this person probably saw me naked and not just in a normal moment. I'm trying to figure out how concerning this should be and if I should do anything about it. Obviously, this person now knows where I live, which is in a somewhat large apartment complex. I can't be sure, but there's a good chance this person also lives in this complex. It's uncomfortable for any woman to receive this kind of attention, but I am a stay at home mom with a toddler, and I am 7 months pregnant currently. I take my daughter outside for walks every day and come and go often through the complex. My fiance told me not to be too concerned but just don't answer the door from now on if I'm not expecting anyone specific to come to my apartment. The part of the note I'm the most uncomfortable about is the last line about ""making cash if I want"" because that feels like I'm kind of low key being solicited for prostitution. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here is where I'm looking for advice:

Should I laugh this off and forget about it or be actually concerned, especially because I'm like 90% sure they saw me actually naked?

Should I bring this to the attention of anyone, i.e. my landlord?

463,"I’m 21 years old and just over a year ago my mum, sister and my self moved towns to live with my mums husband. They’ve been together for about 4 years. I think it’s worth mentioning before we moved out here he was always nice and would always chat away to us(my sister and I). However, since we got here he has completely changed, he is controlling and quite frankly an extremely strange man. He turns the WiFi off at random times so we can’t get on the internet or play Xbox, he locks the bathroom door from the outside so it seems like someone is using it when there’s no one inside resulting in us holding the toilet for sometimes over an hour. He goes into our rooms when we are not here and moves things around, I could go on and on about all the shit he does but you get the idea. 

My mum can be a mega bitch so we don’t really bring this up much and we just sort of deal with it. I’ll be hopeful out of here by the end of the year and my sister stays with her dad mon-fri so she thankfully doesn’t have to spend much time under the same room as weirdo. 

My problem is that a few weeks ago he installed 3 cameras inside the house, 1 in the kitchen, 1 in the living room and there’s a 3rd strange looking one that gets moved about the living room so it is looking out in to the hallway, stairs and the bathroom door. I would understand cameras outside the house, but inside?? Wtf. I don’t know what to do, it’s seriously disturbing. Also the cameras are hooked up to his phone so he can watch us when ever we are down stairs. I feel on edge leaving my bedroom and so does my sister. Any advice would be appreciated.",15Apr2019,5
464,"I am friends with a women I have known for a long time. We are part of the same social group that gets together fairly often both in couples and just the women celebrating each other's birthdays, etc. We have a second home in a vacation spot where we have invited this friend and her husband and another couple twice a year for at least 8/10 years. In the past year, I hear from her very seldom- I always have to make the plans or contact her (though others complain about that as well). Last spring I had a pricey surprise party for my husband-I was very nervous about the planning of it and doing the bar along with all the other catering details. She was pretty dismissive of my questions and then, the day before the party, she started her husband and herself on a 10 day no carb, no alcohol diet. This was not a large party and it hurt my feelings that they couldn't wait to start this diet one more day--not saying you have to eat or drink to have fun, but....There are many other little things; we parked in a prime spot at a friends house so they had to park out front instead of near the back door-and she was emphatically pissed off when she walked in and let me know she ""knew my husband parked there just for (me)"" because it was raining. Now I have given them a date to visit our other home this summer and she said that that date didn't work . I responded asking if she was going to a wedding that is taking place that same weekend and she said, ""No"". Anyway I know she owes me no explanation but not giving an explanation to an invitation is something I might do to a distant acquaintance not a true friend.  Now I don't feel inclined to find another date for them. But this would be weird because I do want to invite the other couple who usually comes when they do and they can't make that weekend either (with a good reason)..

467,"So my roommate is a bitch, to be quite frank. She's disgusting as well. She's done some things that really piss me off but I have tried to be civil and politely bring it up or just keep my mouth shut and go on about my business. But last night she did something that I don't appreciate and we got into a fight. I'm not really sure what to do. For context I will explain the things she does that piss me off and then continue the story. 

1. She let a guest stay for 3 weeks without my permission. This was a violation of our lease. I voiced my concerns about the situation and she was very dismissive and rude about it. 
2. She has a cat who she does not clean up after. It sheds everywhere and she vacuums maybe once a month. 
3. She has long hair but does not clean it up when it gets all over the bathroom. We have a thing that catches hair over our drain and she doesn't clean it out after showering. 
4. She has trimmed and/or shaved her hair (including pubic hair) over the toilet or sink and not cleaned it up. 
5. Constantly leaves dirty dishes, sometimes with food in them in the sink for days on end. Even though the dishwasher is empty or already has dirty dishes in it. 
6. I used to put her dishes in the dishwasher and take them out for her. I would set them in the dish drain when they were done and she wouldn't put them away. They once sat there taking up space for over two weeks. 
7. I no longer put her dishes in the washer for her so now things just set in the sink for days on end. When they finally go in the dishwasher, she won't take them out. 
8. Leaves food out uncovered over night. Usually dairy products as well. And then complains about finding bugs in her room. 
9. Never cleans anything but last night claims that she does. If she does clean she does a shitty job because the bathroom and kitchen always look filthy unless I clean them. 
10. Her bedroom looks like someone with a slight hoarding problem lives there. 

This is a short list, I could go into more detail but I won't. She's filthy and I refuse to clean up after her. I've tried talking to her about it but she never does anything so I've given up. But last night I get a text from her (by the way we were both in the apartment so she could have just talked to me) asking if I would buy my own pots and pans. I got angry and left to go stay at my bf's place. I text her back and ask why and she says it's because she's tired of me leaving them out for days after I use them. I don't do this often but I did it this time because the sink was full of her dishes and the dishwasher had her clean dishes still in it that she was refusing to take out. I shouldn't have to move her stuff around to clean the stuff that I used. I told her this, and she said that it's common courtesy to put her dishes in the dishwasher or take them out because she doesn't use that many. She had both sides of the sink full. I ended up saying that it's not my job to clean up after her and that she never cleans anything. She basically said that I don't clean up after her and that she cleans up after me all the time. She never cleans anything and she sure as hell does not clean up after me. I'm so furious because she was a real bitch about it. She handled it super immaturely and honestly doesn't have any right to tell me that I need to take better care of her things when she doesn't take care of my things or even take care of her own things. I'm just not sure what to do now. I want to move just because she's a bitch and I know that in the future she will continue to act like this because she is petty. I need advice.",15Apr2019,2
468,"About a week ago, I got a newsletter from my naturalist society stating there would be a really interesting lecture in the city. I was free then, and decided to ask my boyfriend if he’d want to come with (usually they’re only an hour long and this one was on a more broad topic/more “general audience”), and then maybe we could spend a couple hours in the city together, get dinner, go to a park, and have a nice date, etc.. 

He originally said no because his brother was going to be over. His brother and him live separately, so every other weekend and every Thursday I cannot hang out with him (which is annoying because we are both high schoolers, and have school, so we usually can’t spend time on weekdays just because of homework, tests, etc.). Friday night, we were lucky enough to be able to hang out for a few hours even though his brother was over - I got there at around 6 and left at around 9. 

However, then his brother decided that on Sunday he was going to leave and go with his friends somewhere at 2 (and then changed it to 12, I guess because he was carpooling and it took 2 hours to get where he wanted to go). So, my boyfriend told me he was going to come to the lecture. 

Keep in mind, he said this Friday night...and then didn’t even consult his dad first. So he asks his dad on Saturday night if he can be driven to my place so we can take the bus to the city together, and his dad gets super pissed. Since we hung out on Friday for a few hours after school, his dad was like, you hung out on Friday, isn’t that enough for her? His dad was mad we were spending too much time together, he wasn’t spending enough time with his brother, he has to practice for his road test (which I think is the biggest issue, my boyfriend’s postponed his road test like 7 times), etc. So of course I tell my boyfriend not to worry about it (slightly offended his dad was acting like I was being so demanding by inviting my boyfriend to come to a lecture with me???).

Then, as I am on the bus into the city, my boyfriend texts me. He’s going into the city with his dad (I guess the road test isn’t important anymore?) to go to some market festival thing. I’m like ok. Then, while I’m finally where the lecture is housed, he starts trying to make plans to meet me since we’re right in the city. Midway through suggesting it, then he’s like oh wait, this is a bad idea. I shouldn’t be doing this because meeting up might be hard. But he’s then like, after the lecture we’ll talk and see what we can do. 

So the lecture ends and the question part comes. And so I text him. Then, he’s like, we can’t drive over to get you. I’m thinking, why were you trying to make plans with me???? I offer to meet up with him in the city by trying to find a way to get to him. He’s like ok. Needless to say, I have no idea how to get where he is, and so I end up panicking and ultimately deciding to go home instead of getting myself lost in the middle of a city all alone. But I get really upset after. 

He texts me to let him know when I’m on the bus safe, and I snap at him and am like I go into the city alone all the time, you’re not my mom. Plus, I’m kind of annoyed at him by this point. This boy would be ok with me trying to get to him, alone, in the city, with no idea how to get to him. Doesn’t try to meet me halfway or help me find directions to get there. He’s ok with disrupting my entire day with this bullshit, constantly being wishy-washy about his plans. And he’s worried about me going home on a route I literally take all the time, when I keep in touch with my parents? So I’m upset, and I tell him I’m kind of mad and upset and not to text me for the rest of the night, because I need some cooldown time by this point. 

In response to my comment about him not being my mother, he goes “It’s not my fault you were trying to get to me and then you couldn’t. That was your choice. I told you it was a bad idea for us to meet up. And the reason I was asking if you were safe was because you’d get pissed at me if I didn’t.” Keep in mind, I had just told him I was upset/mad and didn’t want to talk for the rest of the night because I wanted to feel better and then talk. I hadn’t told him what I was mad about. I told him such. I told him I knew I was wrong for trying to push it by trying to find a way to hang out with him. I knew I had overextended my reach there. But that certainly wasn’t the source of my anger/hurt. It was that he kept stringing me along in things he couldn’t actually bring me to and then bailing at the last second. 

So, tangential to this, on Friday night he was like omg we should hang out on Monday. He said that was the day he’d be free all day, and so we made these really nice plans to hang out all day today. It’s spring break right now, so of course we want to soak up time together, given that when we go back to school again we won’t be able to. So I say alright. We can’t hang out for the rest of the week. Wednesday, I have another thing in the city, a party with my friends I’ve been planning to go to for MONTHS. Tuesday, his brother’s over again. Thursday we’re free. Then there’s the holiday weekend (so duh we can’t hang out). 

Then, yesterday, he’s like yeah, my dad actually took off Monday to hang out with me, and my brother’s coming over early on Monday night. My dad wants me to practice driving and to get some vaccines. I’m not sure what times we can hang out, but we should. Maybe 2-7? And this morning he’s also like yeah Idk, let’s play it by ear today. 

So I’m just thinking, hell no boy. I ain’t hanging out with you. And I basically give him some bullshit excuse of like, go have fun with your dad and your brother, you’re going off to college soon, etc. etc. etc. But seriously. On the inside I’m still seething. 

Also, just please keep in mind. This is something I have addressed with him on numerous occasions. I was getting upset about this exact same type of behavior months ago. In like November. It’s one thing if your plans change. That’s totally, completely fine. It’s also totally ok that he can’t drive yet, so he doesn’t always have control over hanging out with me. That’s also totally ok. The problem with it is, he always gives me a maybe. He never asks his dad first. Even his yes is a maybe. So he says he can do things, or that he most likely can, and then when his dad all of a sudden can’t drive him places, it’s a no. I have told him so many times to just give me a yes or a no. And he still hasn’t changed anything. 

I think it’s so passive-aggressive and bitchy for me to just cancel when he gives me a maybe on plans. But I seriously am starting to consider just making this my main principal. I have been considering terminating the relationship by this point. My mother says not to because senior prom is coming up and she doesn’t want Big Drama. But I seriously cannot stand this type of behavior and don’t get what the point of having a boyfriend is if it’s just going to drag more stress into my life than is needed? I always invite my boyfriend to lots of things. I always give him advanced notice of everything I’m doing, and when I have plans I don’t change them. He almost never does the same. I’m getting sick of being the one who has to plan the nice dates/find cool things for us to do together because he can’t plan for shit, and then going to these things alone because all of a sudden he has to bail on me. 

Tl;dr: My boyfriend keeps flip-flopping on whether or not he can spend time with me on certain days. Then, he usually winds up bailing last minute. It is driving me nuts and I have brought it up many times before. He still keeps doing it. What should I do?",15Apr2019,1
470,"My friend told me about a girl he liked in confidence. I ,in a total stupid move, decided to drop a hint to that certain girl instead of letting him work it out on his own.

471,"Okay, so hear me out on this.

I’m an MIT (manager in training) at a restaurant. I have been since February, after they dicked me around about the promotion for eight months.

I have two jobs, so I was working nights here and getting about 20-25 hours a week as agreed upon. Cool beans, no issues.

Well, I quit my day job at a daycare and took on a nanny job instead because of the pay increase and this new job means that I can’t come in until an hour later than before (aka I was coming in at 5pm before, now I can’t come in until 6. No biggie, they said that was fine. A few other people do it too so I’m not asking for special treatment in that adjustment). They assured me that that wouldn’t be an issue, but then when the schedule for this upcoming week was released, they didn’t schedule me for any shifts. Instead, they scheduled other people for my shifts and then gave me five hours on one daytime shift. What the fuck?

If this continues, that means that I won’t have any training hours and my promotion will be delayed. Right now I make minimum wage here and I can’t afford my bills as it is, let alone on these hours. If and when I receive the promotion, my wage will increase to $11 an hour to start.

I’ve been considering quitting here and taking on a new job elsewhere, but that requires adjusting to another new job and possibly not receiving any more pay or stability.

My boss is uninterested in taking me seriously about the hours and I don’t know what else I can do about that. This job really sucks and it’s been draining the life out of me for awhile, but this promotion would look so good on a resume if it ever actually even happens.

What should I do?",15Apr2019,1

I usually would never even allow this due to bro code, but I have caught feelings for her ,but now I'm stuck in this love triangle with him still missing her, but I just can't justify bro code since he cheated on her throughout the whole relationship.

However, now it's time to actually sign the lease and drop that big fat first/last/security deposit payment, and she says she currently only has a little under a third of her share of it, even though earlier this year she said she'd been saving up. I'd offered to help her out and be paid back, but I kind of thought she'd have more saved up than one-third since she's always talking about her budgets and saving money. Paying my share plus two-thirds of hers is going to seriously take a bite out of the money I set aside for this move in addition to my regular savings. I'm not saying I'm suspicious that my girlfriend is using me for money, nor do I think she wouldn't pay me back, but there have been times that she hasn't wanted to spend money even though it's literally right there in her savings. If I could name any time you ought to dip into your savings, it'd be now, right?

Basically I'm trying to convey to her that I can and want to help her pay for this move, but that if she has more money in her savings to spend, it's not fair asking me to use my savings instead just because she might have some fear of spending money.

475,"First off I know I’m a piece of shit for doing what I did. To get to the point, I cheated on my husband that I’ve been married to for four years. I cheated on him with a coworker of mine. Didn’t really have a reason other than me being a shitty person, I was drunk a lot during that time in my life and I started doing Xanax for some dumb reason. After I cheated, I stopped doing all that, even stopped hanging out with my coworkers that I was friends with and I quit my job. I then had a random doctors appointment about 3 weeks after I cheated, which was initially for blood work since I hadn’t been to the doctors in 5 years+ but I asked to take a pregnancy test to give me piece of mind and it ended up being positive. After the appointment I called a few offices to make an appointment for an abortion. After a week or two of thinking about it and trying to justify having the abortion, and going to the appointment and leaving because I was still unsure. I went home and I told my husband that I cheated on him, told him who I cheated with and that I was pregnant. I couldn’t have an abortion just because I was scared to tell the truth, I couldn’t end a life because I was scared of my future. For some reason he is still with me, don’t get me wrong I’m grateful for that and amazed that he still loves me after I did something like that to him, I don’t feel like I deserve his love after betraying him. So flash forward 9 months and now we have our daughter and she is healthy. The man I cheated with is now wanting to have contact with his daughter (also I did not have to tell him it was his because both me and my husband are white and the man I cheated with is black so my daughter is very tan to say the least) , he saw me at a store holding my daughter and came over to me to see her and ask when he can introduce her to his own 3 yr old daughter that he has with his fiancé, and they are also still in a relationship. I told my husband that they want to see her and have her meet their daughter but my husband didn’t say much and just wanted to make sure that no one will be telling us how to parent our daughter. So my question is, do we have our daughter meet their daughter or do we avoid them and never have contact. We all live in the same town, and see each other through passing in traffic sometimes. I feel like I want to make the best decision for my daughter so in the future when she understands everything fully that she isn’t disappointed or upset with any decisions I’ve made.

479,"Hello :) 

I really am not sure where to post this but I figured I would start in this sub, please advise if I’m in the wrong place :)

I’m F, 22 years old and in full time work.

I have been studying part time with the open university for over a year now and currently have racked up 90/360 credits for my BSc degree. It’s currently called “BSc in Computing, IT &amp; a second subject, Which in my case is business.

I’m looking for some wisdom in that I really don’t feel that excited anymore, partly due to selecting this pathway because I was simply “good at it” and thought it would eventually make me lots of money.

I work in application support as my day job and want to progress further into more senior roles there so I feel like my study and job are complimentary, but I just don’t get that passionate. I’m biding my time and studying in hopes of being able to get a much better job in time. I currently have around 4 years of business support/ IT / admin experience.

I have been taking a look at my options on the OU site and there is a new degree option called “Combined STEM degree”. This essentially allows me to mix subjects a little more into the sciences rather than just business and IT.

I have a love and hobby for planetary science, basically I am fascinated by the universe and everything that goes on and am really fascinated by space, but this isn’t something I think I am smart enough to pursue a career in.  

The modules I have already completed can be used towards my degree as they are STEM, I have currently studied an intro to computing module and an introduction to business module. 

My quandary is this:

I’d love to incorporate some learning in my degree that makes me excited and happy even if it isn’t strictly what I’m going to pursue career wise. So I want a mix of IT and science (particularly astronomy or planetary science) and the business stuff I’ve already done. 

I could however, maintain a strictly business and IT degree of study which will be very related to the career path I’m good at and on. The only problem is that I find business (especially) and IT (not so much) study kind of a chore. I learn lots of new things and it’s definitely going to help me, but a lot of it to me is simply common sense? I don’t know if I’m expressing this well. 

Would I be totally shooting myself in the foot by using up module credits on something I won’t pursue when I could use the credits to specialise in IT and computing? 

Or realistically if I build up enough grounding in computing and IT will one or two modules really not make a heck of a difference in the grand scheme of things? 

I know that I need to be able to explain my degree eventually if I ascend to a higher career level. 
My attitude right now is “surely it’s more important for me to enjoy what I’m studying than to just do it to make it easier for some ignorant possible future employer to understand?”

Any advice from people that have a degree and are older would be so much appreciated!! I’m at a fork in the road right now. As much as I don’t want to sabotage my degree and chances, I also don’t want to spend the next 4/5 years feeling like a zombie :( 


Thank you so much for reading!!",15Apr2019,1
480,"It all started in the beginning of last year (2018) when I had reached grade 10, in this year I’m supposed to be taking my igcse exams which are important to my future life and to be accepted in college. It started off as a harmless “oh you use your phone too much, this year you must focus on your studies” then it reached the point where I wasn’t allowed to use my phone except for one hour in the weekends. You’d think it ends here, right? No, she continued to slowly remove more and more of the activities I was allowed to do in the past (going out, reading books that aren’t related to studies, building LEGO contraptions which don’t even take 10 minutes to finish) 

Now she took my controllers which I even forgot they existed and she also took my first phone, a super old Nokia with an lcd screen, because somehow it might be distracting me. I also have a laptop which must stay in front of her at all times to make sure that I am not allowed to use. Now she is trying to stop me from saying the word cat, but she’ll walk around meowing. She’s also taken a liking to repeating what I say in a mocking voice as if she is twelve. Yes she is perfectly sane and holds normal conversations but I don’t know why she seems to be happy on making me suffer.

She’s been taking my sister as a standard and wants to hold me to it (my sister is like a robot, never playing or taking breaks) and there is no way I can study an entire day straight with the only breaks being lunch. I’ve been calm and not saying anything bad but sometimes I snap and shout at her, to which she finds something else to take away. I used to love her but now everytime I am in the same room as her my blood boils from anger. Yes I’ve tried releasing my anger on other things but it only ever works for a week before it stops.

The most forbidden thing are games and entertainment, even mentioning it casually gets her screaming at you for the whole day. My entire steam library is composed of games I’ve bought with my own money that I get from yard work that I do at the neighbors when school gets cut short so she thinks I’m in school. She also leaves me no privacy and the only time I am allowed to be truly left alone is in bathrooms. I think she figured that out too and now wants me to be in the bathroom for 20 minutes or less.

I’ve confronted her many times about leaving some time for me to have a break and she simply says that if you don’t want to study a certain subject go study another. I could go on for days but this post is getting quite lengthy so if you’re still reading thank you for baring with me.

How in the hell am I supposed to get her to hand over even a little bit of my freedom?

Now before you say that these are exam times she is just worried for you. I’ve taken previous year’s exam papers and solved them and gotten straight A’s, I even proved this to her by doing 3 years worth of exam papers in front of her and when she graded it by looking at the answer key I got A’s. She knows that I can do this exam.

Secondly I’ve been wanting those controllers back since when she took them I remembered that I actually want them so that I can play console games. And like you guess, anytime I mention it she avoids me like the plague or takes my ears off. I’ve also asked her if she would give them back to me once the summer break starts (ambitious, I know) and her only response was telling me to go find someone who would buy them.

I’ve exhausted all my patience with her so how do I get her to loosen up?",15Apr2019,2

482,"Hi all, 

My friend recently came out to me as trans. (MTF) She does not present herself as female yet since her family does not support her and she’s worried about opportunities. 

While I support her for wanting to be truly herself, it is hard to be around her. Not because she presents a male atm or is trans. Because of her overall attitude. She can be very judgmental and rude towards me and others. Often times she belittles people for doing things a certain way. She’s very smart so when she sees someone doing something less ideal for her, she questions why they do it that way. Not even in a nice way, in a belittling way. It’s really hard to be around her because she constantly is like this to me. She’s very nit picky on what I wear, I eat etc. Making me feel wrong for doing what I do. Others feel the same way.

The thing is, it’s hard to stand up to her or decline her invites to places. I don’t want her to think I don’t support her (I do), and I know her not having family supporting her is even harder. It’s just hard to be around because of her attitude.

It sounds like a lot, but I am not overwhelmed. It’s all manageable, and I don’t actually mind taking on lots of work. My pay structure is such that if I accomplish a certain amount of things within a designated timeframe, I’m allocated a bonus equivalent to a percentage of my overall salary. I depend on those bonuses.

Every day she reaches out to me to see if I can make her a new special one time use business card, or a poster that isn’t actually needed. She also wants to customize our website just to personally help HER and only her get sales. I spent a huge chunk of my week accommodating/responding to her requests. 

I’ve asked her manager to personally approve her requests before coming to me. That being said, her manager is approving everything, even the most ridiculous stuff.

489,"Hello. I am a 14 year old boy and I have issues that I don’t kniw how to deal with. 

1) I am spoiled

Ever since I was born everything was done for me. From prepearing food, getting ready for school, cleaning my room to taking a bath and getting dressed. (the last two I started doing myself at the age 8 which is still bad but atleast its something.) If I wanted a toy I would get it. I never had to deserve anything to get it.  Most people say that it’s my parents fault but I feel like it’s my fault, and that I am a terrible person. This leads to depression and sometimes even suicidal thoughts which is stupid and ironic because I have a good life.

2) I am overweight

This one started at age 7 aka when I started going to school. I do not know what happened or what snapped in my head but I started eating a lot more since then. I started rapidly gaining weight. (10-15kg a year). Today I have 125kg and thats only because I started doing sinething about it, which brings me to the next point.

3) I am incredibly lazy.

I am lazy. Lazy to the point where I literally don’t when to get off a chair sometimes. This is most likely cause by it being hard for me to move because of my weight aka my spoiledness and fatness combining itsself into another problem. I sometimes make a huge scene and/or argument that takes hours because of homework that takes 15 minutes to finish. This is alsocaused by the next and final point.

4) I am addicted to video games.

Although my generation usually plays Fortnite, thats not my case. I am addicted to games in general. I mostly play Warframe and MMO games. I spend 8 hours a day behind my PC, sometimes not even playing anything and just staring at the screen. I dont do anything else when I get back from school. (If I even go to school that day because I often act like I’m sick or tired to stay home.) I like doing graphic design, but I cant improve because cant help myself from playing video games. This addiction is also what causes my obesity because I usually go outside once a weekand sometimes not even once.

495,"So, first off, I kind of want to write this just to put it out there, so it’s probably gonna be a wall of text. Secondly, I know this situation is not that rare, and probably not as bad as I feel like it is, but when talking to my peers it really does seem like I am exceedingly bad in many areas, and I don’t really know what to do about it.

So, the current situation: I have just started uni, and I’ve not really had a great first semester so far. I’ve done relatively well on tests and quizzes, but have already not handed in a few of the weekly tasks, having done all of the ones I have handed in at about 3am the night before. I also have an essay due the day after tomorrow, and an essay plan the day after that, both of which I have barely started, and will probably fail. I am pretty miserable in the course overall, whereas everyone of my peers I have talked to seem to be enjoying it, and finding it very easy. For example, many of them completed both the essay and the essay plan a week before they were due. I am past the date where you can drop out without paying, so I can’t just swap degrees or drop out and go on a gap year or something, but I also feel like there’s no point in completing this degree.

I think the main cause of the procrastination could either be from stress and anxiety, which I’ve been feeling a lot lately (e.g. feeling like I can’t take a full breath for multiple days, chest pains, stress headaches every time I start work or study, spasming eyelids, etc.), depression (I don’t know if I am actually depressed, because I do feel happy a fair bit (while watching tv or talking to friends or something) but when alone I often have suicidal thoughts and am very self-deprecating and down most of the time), entertainment addiction (I watch a ridiculous amount of youtube, bingewatch tv, am constantly listening to podcasts etc., and find it very difficult to switch from that to working), or a combination.

In terms of knowing what to do with my life, I really have no interest in anything except for maybe being a musician, which is unrealistic. But, the ‘interest’ in something isn’t really the point. I can easily see myself doing something that I don’t love for a living, I just feel like I lack the motivation, drive or ambition to become successful in any area. When it comes down to it I basically just want an easy life where everything is just given to me, which is obviously very entitled and lazy. The fact that I’m aware of this, however, adds to the self-deprecating thoughts. 

I also have read something about how people use stuff similar to what I’ve said as a shield against having to face failure, because if they convince themselves that they are all of these bad things then they can just blame that, and avoid any deep personal responsibility. This is probably true of me, especially because I was a very ‘golden child’ person all the way through school, and am not used to failing. 

I also have other personal problems, such as not really having any close friends, and not being able to talk to my parents about much at all - especially revealing something like what I’ve written. I am not very confident in social situations, and have also never had a romantic relationship. I do talk to people (mostly classmates) but I always put on a very fake face of happiness, and have no one that I could talk to about anything serious. I understand that I am young and that these kinds of things will improve (well, maybe not the parents thing) but it just sucks to not have anyone to talk to when I’m feeling like such a fuck-up. I also get that it’s not anyone’s job to fix me - I really just want someone or some people who I can rant to and have them tell me I’m just stressing too much and that things aren’t that bad, because maybe then I would stop feeling like such a crazy person.

In conclusion, I don’t really know. I’m basically just confused and scared about life, and I don’t really know what to do about any of it. I probably have anxiety and maybe depression, but I don’t want to self-diagnose. All this stress is amplified by the assignments, and by not having anyone to talk to. I think, when it comes down to it (this next bit is probably going to sound very depresso so just know that I know what it reads like), my main problem is that I am a weird, lonely, socially awkward person who bottles up all my feelings and thoughts to the point where they are actually causing me physical and maybe financial harm, but I’m too insecure, or afraid, or something along those lines to actually let them out, and it feels like I’m just going to keep them in until I kill myself, die of a heart attack at like 35, or luck out and end up becoming successful with no hard work because I was born into a nice life (which is the option I’m hoping for, and I hate myself for doing so). 

Alright, rant over. I don’t expect anyone to actually read any of this or respond, because it is admittedly very ‘edgy teen’-ish and very long, but there it is. If you can provide any help or advice, please do, because I really just don’t know what to do.",15Apr2019,1

498,"Weird title and a weird story to boot.
My boyfriend has two college buddies living in a different state. He misses them and plays a moba with them to bond over the distance. I joined them, as I am pretty good at the game. Naturally, tempers rise in game, and his friends can be pretty blunt and disrespectful in my opinion. On several occasions I've felt ganged up on by his friends, and turn to my bf who doesn't defend me. It makes me feel humiliated and disrespected. Also on days my boyfriend was out and I wanted to play, I'd wait In lobby for his friend to join, and I'd message him or invite him. He began a habit of ignoring me. Recently, my boyfriend and I got on the game and he asked if we'd play with his friend. I said I didn't want to that I'd rather play with just him. He negged me about it till I caved in. We were all playing and I decided to remain pretty much silent during the game, as not to draw attention to myself. My bf audibly negged me about it in the voice chat for everyone to hear. At the end of the losing game, I said one piece of advice to his friend, and his friend blew up on me, calling me a bitch and saying that noone even wanted me to play with them in the first place. This greatly upset me and I left the house (since there are no real rooms besides the bathroom). After a couple hours I come back and bf is still playing with them, like nothing happened. This upset me further, and  had lead to a night of arguing with my boyfriend on the subject. He finally understood me and said his friend didn't want to play with me again anyway. I unfriended him and went about my life until a week passes and I notice he sent me a friend request. I add him and ask why, he says he'd like to Make things work.

The way I feel about it is complicated. He and I has a decent friendship, but given that we've never met and are only connected through my bf, it makes the foundation not so solid, thus leading to these off and on fights. We used to play together on days without my bf, and joke around and have a good time. But things just kept getting worse because he keeps escalating these tense situations by calling me names or interrupting me. Personally I could never be friends with someone who disrespected my partner multiple times, and I could never be friends with someone who has disrespected me personally multiple times with no end in sight. I'm having a hard time in my life, and this is just unnecessary stress for me. I don't know what to do considering it's my boyfriends friend and I feel obligated to play nice. But my feelings are valid too.

500,"(24f) I'm in a bad situation where I currently live and need to move soon, by fall at the latest but hopefully way sooner than that. I'm also in the process of trying to figure out how to end a toxic, manipulative friendship before I'm forced to move in with the aforementioned toxic friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

My very best friends all live in a state that's about 3-4 hours from where I currently live. I'm here at my friends house now visiting for the next week because the school I work at is on spring break and I'm so at peace and happy here (which is always the case when I come here,) and I'm with my best friend in the entire world who is without a doubt my platonic soulmate, as well as my other close friends.

For years, I've dreamed of moving here to live closer to my friends. My friends have all assured me for years that we could make it work and that they would help me make it happen and help me get settled here. I love this state, it's a smaller more rural state and it's very peaceful here. The area where my friend lives is a big enough town that there's job options and lots to do, but small enough to where it's not overwhelming. 

I so badly want to move here. Every time I visit the desire gets stronger. I'm happier here. I feel safer here away from my toxic family members, the manipulative friends, and the crowded noise of my home state. Rent is cheaper here, the air is cleaner here. Moving here would give me the chance to be closer with the people I care about as well as give me the opportunity to focus on my mental and physical health, (both of which are suffering in my current situation.)

&amp;#x200B;

Guilt has stopped me every single time because I've had to care for my siblings for years and most of my family lives in my home state. If I move I would be away from my siblings, cousins, grandparents, and my parents would be very angry at me for leaving, (they would see it as ""abandoning"" my family.) My parents will try to guilt me into staying in my home state. My emotionally abusive ""friend"", who I am trying to break away from, will be even worse and there's a possibility she will try to stalk my family. My father will be so incredibly angry, and I am scared of my father.

My therapist has told me that if I were to move she would support me and doesn't think it's just me being impulsive. But I'm still terrified of the guilt that I will feel for leaving my family.

503,"A little backstory on me. I’m a 20 year old male who has worked 2 part time jobs in my life both as a cashier in the grocery industry. Both jobs left long lasting issues with me mentally and emotionally because of poor treatment. I was yelled at in front of customers multiple times and was never appreciated despite working more hours than most people in the department as a high school student. I left the job last June and haven’t worked since. 

I’ve passed the time by taking 2 semesters of community college for communications. But I refuse to go to college for 4 years so a bachelors degree isn’t happening, and I don’t have the patience to stick it out 3 more semesters at college living at home just for an associates degree. My parents are done letting me not work and I want to be able to get past this block.

I want to be independent and live on my own. I’ve wanted to do that for a year now. My girlfriend’s lease expires in September and even if we aren’t ready to move in together come then I would like to have a full time job and be making money. The problem is I can’t put those past jobs behind me. It’s caused me to be an extremely picky job hunter and if there’s one small ounce of me that thinks it might not be perfect I move on. I’m shy and introverted and don’t have a lot of interests either so there’s no field I want to work in more than others.

Im writing this crying in my room while he screams at my mom and sister because my sis told him to “chill”. 

I hate this so much, and every time I ask for advice I get told to do something completely different. I think I should stay out of it and ignore him ‘till he dies.

At first I thought it was nice to have a co-worker who wanted to go out for lunches with me. So I accepted. However after going a few times, I started to feel uncomfortable. The overall tone of the lunch was she was just trying to get information. It was like she wanted to gossip about other co-workers or find out information about them.

I never gave any info out, and I just played dumb during our lunches. However Cynthia got upset because our manager came up with a new workflow and Cynthia was unhappy with her tasks. Some work was taken from me and given to Cynthia by our manager (I had no say in the changes).

Cynthia has since been ignoring me and icing me out of the group (addressing everyone but me in meetings). However this week she has completely done a 180 and been overly nice to me. This also 'coincidently' is the week that we are having our performance reviews. 

Cynthia asked another co-worker who had their performance review on Friday out for lunch today. I know she is going to be asking about the co-worker's performance review.

I work in a mall and the fire alarms sporadically go off. Multiple times a day. The mall says they are testing them. They have been “testing” these alarms for 6 years. They go off before during and after mall hours and with no rhyme or reason. 

I looked up Maryland state fire code and it says that testing is only required four times a year, and a written schedule should be provided. They have never provided us a schedule. 

Fire code also says that it is mandatory to evacuate the building every time they go off, unless it is a test and the tenets have been notified with a written schedule in advance. 

The mall has never been evacuated. 

There was recently a fire in the food court. The fire alarms went off. No one evacuated the building because they assumed that it was another test. No one was hurt, so the alarms still go off, and no one evacuates.

Recently a fire Marshall came to inspect our fire extinguishers. I asked the Fire Marshall about it and they didn’t really seem too concerned. 

There is major construction going on right now, and I discovered that my stores fire evacuation route is currently blocked by construction materials. I’ve brought up my concerns to my manager, the mall office, and the fire Marshall. No one seems to care. 


Part of it is that the stores don’t want to evacuate every time the alarm goes off, because it’s bad for business. The mall doesn’t seem to want to invest in fixing the fire alarms because the fire Marshall isn’t shutting them down and it would probably cost a lot of money. 

The fire Marshall won’t take action because no one has gotten hurt and the alarm does go off during a fire if someone pulls the alarm. 


With all the heavy construction going we can smell fumes and dust, and sometime what smells like methane or natural gas. 

I’m afraid we are one accident away from a fire, and that the mall has played boy who cried wolf so much that when an actual emergency happens, live can be seriously in danger.

516,"TLDR;

Influential HS Coach was nasty to me on graduation some time ago. Is it wrong to tell him how his words have affected my life since then?

&amp;#x200B;

Back in High School I was a pretty avid athlete. It never really opened any further opportunities for me, but I was okay enough to quickly develop a close relationship with my coaches. Towards the end of high school, my family began to go through some separation issues that affected my ability to perform academically. The feeling of free fall in a few areas of my life prompted me to dive fully into my fitness and my performance as an athlete. I relied heavily on approval from my coaches and finished high school with only a couple good friends and an intense feeling of being incomplete as a person leaving HS.

On the day of my graduation my head coach starts a conversation with my as I'm waiting to walk. He's clearly in a bad mood and tells me ""Today is not a day to celebrate your accomplishments, today is to show appreciation to your parents for getting you here"". I remember feeling heartbroken that one of the few people I gave my efforts to, and defied my parents to dedicate even more time to, couldn't validate me.

We had never really exchanged foul words before, and I was left dumbfounded. Those words have entered into my head periodically in the few years since my graduation. Since then, my life has been completely changed by the passing of a younger sibling, and diagnosis of a behavioral disorder. Some of my old coaches have reached out, but my head coach still has left me with those hurtful words as our latest interaction.

I am by no means debilitated by these thoughts. I've developed immensely as a person, and I'm proud of my ability to have entered college with some nasty stuff going on, and come out feeling successful. My coach has recently announced his retirement, and I see an outpouring of support and love towards him from currently graduating students.

I have a relatively deep urge to remind my coach of his words to me, and tell him that as an adult, I know that I have overcome a lot to be in a successful position right now. I feel the need to tell him that his words were a part of the adversity I overcame.

I hope you guys can help me with some advice on these feelings.",15Apr2019,1

They sent me the offer letter and I find out it's only four months . Moving to another country for just four months doesn't sound appealing to me, so I messaged the person who contacted me ( he is in a very senior position there ) and let him know that it won't be possible for me to join at this point in time, and that I would definitely re apply in the near future.

He immediately messages me back and tells me he is now going to speak to the HR , and will make the contract longer. 

So in the meantime- I contact a few people who work there , and asked them what the situations like. They tell me that the management is chaotic, and they are all working overtime and are under a lot of pressure.

I'm open to interpretations if I'm being the toxic one here of if I'm being over controlling but I generally feel that he (and her) disrespected our relationship over the last two years. She has taken him on holiday to Amsterdam and theyve not bothered to get seperate hotel rooms (although they had a bunk bed), he would call me in the bathroom late night to tell me he was aroused but the whole thing made me really uncomfortable they were away together. During this trip they also went to sex shops ( apparently to buy stuff for me and him ) but it makes me uncomfortable he spoke to her about our sex life let alot went to a sex shop with her. He's also told me he had a crush on her when they were younger, it kind of came across like the only reason they're not together is because she friendzoned him, I kind of felt like the ""available option"", as if he was with me but she was his ultimate goal. One day I confronted him about it and he told me he sees her just like a sister but when I asked him if he would date her of we ever broke up he said ""of course, how could I not"", when he realised this hurt my feelings he tried to play it off with the argument around ""any guy would, how could I pass that up"" but it just made me think he doesn't have genuine platonic feelings towards her. Coupled with other comments hes made about her which I won't take the time to explain and how theyused to talk every night around 1-3am (he sleeps really late) over skype. She used to buy him gifts and they would say I love you to each other everything was pissing me right off. What hurt the most is that her and his wider group of friends label me as insecure , and I can't lie it's partially true that I am insecure in this situation because this really has hurt my self esteem to see that it is HIM who has not set any boundaries with her. But I know I am not inherently insecure, I don't have a problem with him hanging with other girls and I never complained over he period he was speaking to his ex, I just feel that he was blatantly disrespectful.
Here comes my own toxic share, I encouraged him to set certain boundaries (not taking her out to eat or come over) as I felt that was somewhat like a date, I would prefer if they hung out in their friendship group etcc but over the course of the last year he had been meeting up with her behind my back and covering it up, even going as far as spending new year's Eve with her at a party and telling me the reason he was not inviting me as a guest was because the venue was really far out. When we broke up he promised to work on the boundaries but after everything I am not sure I can deal with trusting him around her at all. When it comes to her hes shown he can lie to me again and again and again and even though we are working on building trust he has it in his mind sometime in the future she will be reintroduced to the mix. He's very upset that he has betrayed his long term friend by cutting her so harshly off and has had alot of backlash for it from her and mutual friends and I'm worried he might resent me for it. I know that he loves me and he has worked very hard to prove that and I love him too and we have an, otherwise, great relationship with talks of marriage and kids etc but ultimately this shadow in our relationship is something that keeps coming up. I am working on building trust with him but I can't stand the thought of having this girl around anymore. Not really because I think that he likes her romantically but because he's crossed me line too many times.
We have been together 4 good months since he last saw her on new year's day but I feel guilty I have stopped him from seeing his friend, I know it hurts him (he cried when I brought it up),ever since new year's he's been an example boyfriend and working hard on himself and the relationship. He's been consistent with me but we never talk about the elephant in the room despite me being aware she has tried to call him or mutual friends have asked him about why they aren't friends anymore.

 I know that there is not solution with all three of us in harmony, I feel like he's fucked up too many times for me to stick around to be disrespected again. Staying with him I know he is happy in the relationship (as am I) but is missing his friend alot. And leaving him I know will be very hard for both of us but maybe one day he can find the balance right between a new girlfriend and his female friend and I can find a new start with someone without the hurt of the past. What do you guys think?

TL;DR 

My boyfriend and his female friend made me uncomfortable during the beginning portion of our relationship. Now that he doesn't see her anymore (because of me) despite us having a good relationship I wonder if it is the right thing to do. I feel like there's an elephant in the room and that he is secretly missing his friend. Of course I wish it never got to this stage in the first place but I don't think I can forgive&amp;forget how they have disrespected me in the past to stick around to try kumbaya again.",15Apr2019,1

So now I don't know what to do, his parents are ignorant to a lot of things (they think taking away his electronics for a month when he has an anxiety attack is a good idea so he rarely even has access to them, and they act like he isn't autistic at all) and I can't do anything to convince them, I mean I only met them once for about 2 minutes.

533,"I’m a girl in high school. So a year and a half ago, I discovered a weakness to my school’s technology system. Basically, a lot of the staff passwords were the mascot of our school plus the year it was. For example if the mascot of your school is a tiger then the password would be Tiger2019. I then took this to my advantage and viewed student grades until I tested my luck a few months ago and tried to change teacher passwords by using the forgot password tool.(I was going to change the password back to their original passwords, I just wanted to see how many teacher logins I could get) The end result was that they basically traced my steps and figured out there was a hacker after a whole year of me remaining anonymous, and then they reset the majority of teacher passwords to something obviously a lot more complex. However, a few days later I viewed messages sent by the technology department and they basically narrowed down the culprit to me based on the activity of the hacker. So funny thing is, why haven’t they obviously confronted me about it by now? This is illegal and people who are caught doing it usually get expelled or if they’re lucky, a suspension. I know what I did was immoral, but I’ve learnt my lesson and never tried to do it again. I didn’t do anything like change grades, I viewed student grades and transcripts.

534,"Hello all,

  Last year in march i lost my father due to cancer. I immediately invited my mother to my home, knowing i couldnt necessarily afford the extra expenses. A year has come and gone, my mother and i have fought so much, shes an alcoholic that cares to have nothing but alcohol, fights begin when she doesnt have anything to drink, she has tried to turn me against my wife. The drinking she did before my father passed, they actually both enjoyed drinking heavily. It has left us feeling uncomfortable, never leave our room unless we need something out of the kitchen.

 Passed couple months she has been acting better, no fighting, shes been trying to get along with my wife. It is leaving me feeling bad for the decisions i have decided to make.

 In January my wife and i had a baby girl, natually we want to raise her with love and happiness. So im deciding to move us back into a 1 bedroom and leaving her to find a place to live. Problem is no one wants to deal with her alcoholism so she may end up homeless(Which i am going to help when i can), which makes me feel like a POS.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know if anyone has any advice what i can do for her. She refuses to go to a doctor because she doesnt want to be ""labelled."" She has been a house wife pretty much the entire time they were married, almost 40 yrs.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Moving family back into a single bedroom as i cant afford the current living arrangements. Trying not to leave my mother homeless.",15Apr2019,1
535,"First-time post for me, and sorry for the length.

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't classify my upbringing as ""sheltered"" per se, however, a lack of exposure to absolutely anything drinking-related has not put me off well I believe. For reference, my parents have always frowned upon drinking and drug abuse, but my parents are also not the type who would kick me out of the house if they discovered I was into such things (I am still living at home at the moment). Of course, I do not mean to say I wish my friends and family were drunken bastards, but some better advice other than ""drugs and drinking are bad"" would have been nice.  


I am currently at community college, and at an event for school recently, I was surprised when a friend of mine, who is of drinking age, casually purchased a beer and continued to play pool while we were waiting for multiple hours at a mall, then was taken back even further when the group I was with began looking at some CBD (I know it's harmless, but it was the mention of weed that got me). I gather that these moments are normal and quite harmless (and truth be told, I think of my friends no less), but the shock of how casually these things happened threw me for a loop. I even discovered a few of my new friends from college brush off smoking marijuana as casually as drinking at parties.  


This alone isn't why I am asking for help though. Like I said before, I figured that these things are fairly common, and I have no problem with drinking. It was that sudden realization though of how sheltered I believe I am that I am asking for some advice. Just some general advice on dealing with exposure to these things, and what people consider normal with regards to consuming such things. I have heard multiple stories where people who grew up in sheltered environments, go to college, then become the biggest drug and alcohol abusers in the world only to drop out with little left in their future save for working at a low-end job. I have no interest in drinking, or getting into drugs at the moment, but I fear that if I am put into a position where things like alcohol, pot, and other possibly addictive substances are easily accessible to me, that I would not be able to stop myself from trying them and become addicted only because I wouldn't know how to handle myself in that situation, and that alcoholism ran rampant in previous generations of my family that I have hardly met.

I have no friends. My engagement is ending. I need a hug but have no one to turn to. 

Over the years I’ve changed quite a bit; having given up my toxic tendencies. While I was fixing myself I realized how unhealthy most of my friendships were. People were using me, talking behind my back; just general shit I didn’t need in my life. Eventually it just became me and my fiancé.

538,"I moved in with one of my best friends about 4-5 months ago. It's in an iffy part of town (ghetto), but rent is great, the size of the place is big, and his parents, who live in the building, are our landlords. I've known them as long as I've known my friend (roughly 22 years). They're very good hearted, kind, religious people. Well about a month in, I noticed a pattern of my friend coming home Sunday nights after the bars close with a bunch of people he worked with. Not opposed to hanging out kinda late, but they would do coke everytime and stay up and be loud as hell until the sun came up. I work early Monday mornings and it's excruciating to work 11 hours at a store by yourself open to close on 2-3 hours of sleep. Well one night about a month or so ago, I exploded on him and his friends at 6 in the morning the night my roomie got fired from his job. He came home all sad and crying and gave all MY booze to his friends, were blowing lines til 6 in the morning, and causing havoc. His excuse was he was sad and needed to have a good time for everyone. I laid it out that I can't deal with this shit anymore. My things are not his to give away and why can't I have the same respect, consideration, and hospitality that he shows random people from a bar? I pay bills and rent here, after all. 

That seemed to stop it for a little while. We were living on the first floor and his parents on the second until his mother had some bad medical problems arise. So she was hospitalized for about a month, then rehabilitation for about another month. Short story is she can't walk up stairs anymore, so we SWITCHED FLOORS with them. Took about two weeks because she had so many things. Today is about one week after we completely switched floors and last night he invited 2 very loud girls and 2 very loud Irishmen over from some bar in the city. Drugs and alcohol ensued. I had just layed down to sleep about 20 minutes before they came over. They were doing karaoke, a singing circle with guitars, yelling, laughing, slamming the bathroom door each time someone had to go (which is right next to my room). I made my pissed off presence known early on by walking out back to have a cigg and not answering anyone when they said ""Come here! Say hi!"". Came back in, it didn't stop. About an hour later, I pounded my fist on the wall that was between my bedroom and the living room where they all were and screamed stfu. That worked for all of 10-15 minutes. That was at 4 A.M. I somehow drifted off from exhaustion eventually hours later for all of a couple hours until my alarm went off for work at 10 A.M. Guess what? They were all still there being coke babies. I got ready for work and left and here I am. 

Needless to say, I'm done with it all. The crappy thing is I just emptied my bank account to pay off my taxes I owed. I need to get out but have no options. Obviously, I'm going to have to save again, but I'm ready to kill this friendship and leave. The good/bad thing is I'm not on a contract or anything to live here, so I guess I can just up and leave, but I don't have the option of another roommate or moving in with parents. My questions are these:

What can/should I do if/when this happens again?
Am I allowed to call the police on my roommate and his random coke friends?
Would I get in trouble if I'm in the apartment if the cops DO show up?

539,"As a girl whose parents have been really restrictive about where she can go, who she can talk to, keeping me well away from guys my entire teenage life etc, I have grown up to be a very socially awkward woman. I find it quite difficult to talk to new people, and especially difficult to talk to men.
 
6 months ago I started my first weekend retail job. I’ve recently made some great woman friends. On Saturday evenings, we make the store ready for the next day. This means there are no customers, and we’re free to converse with the other employees. However, Saturday evenings are usually mostly guys working and because of my difficulty in talking to men, I feel really left out at times because they’ll all be joking around, the girls included, and talking to each other, but I’m just there on the side, feeling very lonely and self-conscious, going about with my job. A couple of times I’ve heard them talking about me, and even mentioned that I’m ugly. I don’t know what I can do so they’ll talk to me too.

542,"My sister in law currently lives with me and my wife (her sister) due to circumstances in her life warranting a change. She is quite a bit younger than me and my wife for that matter. My wife and I are fairly happy, we have our issues just like anyone else but ever since she moved in I have found that me and my sister in law have a lot more in common.  My wife can be quite controlling in regards to both of us and we typically will vent to each other in times that we need an ear. 

My sister in law is pretty smoking and I am not ashamed to admit that everyday I look forward to seeing her and checking her out.  To this day I have absolutely no idea if she feels the same. We obviously laugh and have fun together but at the same time it eats me up a bit wondering whether she has any sexual feelings towards me. 

I’m not necessarily looking to start something with her (unless we could both find a way to do so without harming my relationship with my wife) but I would love to find out if she feels the same even if it doesn’t lead to anything. 

She has mentioned that she is a fan of reddit and browses the subs fairly regularly.  

Maybe we can try a social experiment that might help others as well in a similar situation as me. If you are currently a sister in-law living with your sister and her husband and have a thing for the husband, send him a text asking what he wants for dinner.  I or you as the husband will respond with, “do we have any veggie burgers?”. 

Nothing more needs to be said after that and we will both know where each other is as far our desires towards each other. No aspect of our current relationship will change it will just be our little secret that deep down there is a mutual lust. I obviously hope she reads this and sends the text but others in a similar boat might find success this way as well, who knows! 

I would also love any  advice on how I can gauge her feelings for me? At the end of the day life is too short so let’s bring our feelings out in the open even if it is only for the benefit of it being our little secret.",15Apr2019,0

Hello there fellow Redditors.

So, it was my first girlfriend. We got together after she confessed her feelings to me. In the first month, it seemed like she was REALLY into me. Couldn't stop texting me, giving me compliments, talking about future etc. (I have to say that she is 16, i am 18, so i obviously knew that thats unlikely to really happen).

I really love her. But for the past \~40 Days, she kept telling me she has no time.

We've seen each other maybe ONCE in 2 weeks, even though we only live 15 minutes apart from each other. I told her i wanted to see her more often, she responded that she's trying her best and she will change it. Nothing changed.

She then always made plans with friends, going to a movie, sleeping at her best friends house, or vice versa. All the time.

She stopped messaging me in general, kept quiet and showed no affection to me anymore. After i asked her through WHATSAPP, because I couldn't wait weeks for that question, if she is still interested in our relationship, she responded it's just the immense stress shes under and she has no time for herself whatsoever.

In the end, she said maybe we can try it out sometime else if the situation gives it, but other than that it's over for now.

She is sick quite often. Is anything but stress resistant. She told me it was her first time actually loving someone within the first month. It also was her first real relationship.

I assume I put her under extra pressure because I always said I wanted to see her more often.

My Idea was that maybe her sickness and the stress made her over react - and I'll wait a week without any contact and then ask for a meeting in real life. What do you think about that?

Reddit, please give me your advice - i really love her, dont want to lose her ( even though i already did.)  - and dont know what to do. I unfollowed all her social media but didn't block her Number.

She also told me her feelings weren't as strong as in the beginning. But that was inevitable! There always were weeks between every meeting, and losing the ""strength"" of the feelings is just normal right?! (Well, i suppose, not in the small time frame of this situation.)

1 month ago, she was writing with me like im the one. She cant believe she has found such a great guy. And now this.

I just want her back. But somewhere in me, i know it's probably impossible.

550,"Hi all. First time poster here. 

As the title says, my parents have always made sure that my path in life has been smoothed with all necessities that I can possibly ask for. 

They aren’t “rich” as such, they’re middle class and have worked and saved really well. They paid for my education, which is normal in an asian society. But it has been continuing even as I start establishing my career. They bought me a car recently, and a house where my husband, son and I can live rent-free for a few years till we save for our own place. I am an only child, my parents are much older (60+) and they tell me these won’t affect their retirement savings. 

Husband and I both work very hard, manage everything with our son by ourselves, starting to budget our money much better and starting to save even without any help. We both unfortunately earn entry-level salaries (with good room for advancement in the future), husband because his small company can’t afford a pay hike, and me because I’m less than 1 year into my work. 

The help is very welcome, obviously, but I feel ridiculously guilty about it. I almost can’t enjoy what they give me because of it. I feel I didn’t “earn” it, and I don’t deserve it. I try to earn it and pay it forward as much as I can but the guilt and the burden of trying to pay them back / pay it forward is sapping all happiness from my life. 

I know this may be controversial for some. But I would love to hear ideas about how to handle the guilt, in a positive way, without taking it out on husband (he’s feeling a bit guilty too, but deals with it better than me), and taking it out on my parents (they are only trying to help).",15Apr2019,1
551,"Might regret posting this on my main account but oh well.

For some context: I'm 21, live in Australia, I'm currently studying at uni, and I graduated high school in 2015. Near the end of my last year of high school I started going out with a girl and we stayed together until early this year, so I'm single for the first time in what feels like a long time.

I had told myself I was happy to just be single for a while and that I wasn't going to worry too much about relationships or anything. Problem is, there's a girl in one of my classes that is absolutely gorgeous. She's really cool to talk to, funny, understanding, and generally great to be around and we've kind of ended up in the same friend group which means I've had the opportunity to hang out with her a fair bit over the past few weeks.

I'm not a particularly shy person and I wouldn't usually have a problem with asking someone out if I felt something, but since I haven't really felt like this in about four years I'm definitely a bit rusty when it comes to the whole communication thing. It's like whenever I see her I just forget everything I was going to say and just end up either rambling or not saying anything. I don't know if it's just me being nervous or if it has some foundation but I don't get the feeling she sees me as more than a friend either. 

The other issue I'm having is that she's an exchange student from Scotland and I know that being in a relationship with her long term wouldn't really be viable because in a couple of months she'll move back there and I won't.

I don't really know what to do, it's been way too long since this stuff affected me and the only thing I know for sure is that I think she's amazing and, given I've been having a pretty shitty week, she's pretty much the only reason I went to uni today and the reason I'm still lying awake at 3 AM. I'm not going to see her for another two weeks and I don't know what to say (if anything) when I do see her.

I went to a At&amp;T store, didnt know it wasnt corporate and learned that it was a Authorized Retailer after the fact but, I bought a S10+, I was ecstatic and I was looking around the phone, and saw something like a scratch on the phones corner and asked the guy(Jake) what this was, he said oh this is just because of the cover, it's nothing on the phone. So I didnt think much of it, and said ok. So I bought the phone, and went home, after transferring files from old to new, I took the cover off and after taking the cover off saw that in the back the phone had a crack on the ceramic part in the upper left corner.

So next day first thing in the morning, I go back. Demand an exchange. They said no, we will not exchange it, if it was cracked you shouldnt have left with it. I was furious but I couldnt do anything at that moment, because I had to leave for work. So they said they will open an investigation and I said ok, and I left the phone there at their store.Next day I went to another At&amp;T store(corporate) and they told me, they(Retailer) need to accept it back, and I can demand a reversal for all my money back in 14 days. So I went back to At&amp;T authorized Retailer told them I want a reversal and a refund. They told me screen is cracked, they cant accept it back..... that is the reason I want it exchanged because they sold me a faulty phone but they wont budge. And my phone is still at their store.

I don't usually hear the music from my apartment, however, when I stepped inside his apartment one day, I couldn't even hear his TV. The music is so loud it literally shakes the walls in his apartment. I asked him if he would like me to talk to the people (politely, I assured him), and he told me not to do it ""in his name"" and that it doesn't bother him since he won't be staying here much longer (he's on a 6-month lease). He has talked to our inept management about it and they have done nothing (he also has a rodent problem). It just bothers me that people can be so got damned inconsiderate, I feel like throwing rocks through their window until it stops. The attitudes of people like this are not conducive to reason or decency, I fully expect them to ramp up to some pretty pathetic and petty behavior if they are confronted about it in any way. So Reddit, is there any surefire way to handle this situation or should I just mind my own business?",15Apr2019,1
558,"I often struggle between trying to be the best person I can be, but also just trying to make people happy. I still have a strong desire for people to like me, and not be angry with me. For example, one girl a few months ago completely disrespected me on her page, even though I was just trying to be nice (accused me of mansplaining). Instead of being honest, and telling her where she is wrong, I apologized to her.

I still believe it’s important to be nice, and respectful. But sometimes, I feel like I’m just “giving in” or “rolling over”. I do have my own thoughts and opinions, and I will speak them, but I sometimes think I should be more up front about how I really feel, and not try to play peacekeeper and facilitator all the time (I got it a lot from a mom that was irritable often haha).

Is this ok? Just to be like this all the time? Personally, I feel people learn best from themselves, and their own mistakes, instead of me yelling at them and telling them they’re wrong. Telling someone they’re wrong usually never works for me. 

So where do you draw the line? How can I be both honest, and respectful, without just giving in to other people?",15Apr2019,2

560,So I had a very important appointment today. I have to say that the appointment was 3 citys away which meant I would have had to get up really really early to catch my bus but my friend told me that he would drive me to the appointment so I can get 2 hours of extra sleep. I was so happy that I didn't have to get up at 6 am. So I woke up at 8am I went outside annnndddd... My friend wasn't there. He just forgot me. I called him emmidiatly and he was really sorry. He ran to his car and drove to me the moment I called him. Btw he lives in the city my appointment was in which meant he had to drive 20minutes to me and 20 minutes back. Because of that I got late to my appointment which was really really important.

565,"SO was put in medical leave a few months ago due to severe depression and anxiety. Neither of us foresaw it going beyond a few months of trying out new medication, but seven months later it’s been... rough. I don’t work; I’m currently a full time college student and live at home with my parents to help watch over my dad, who has Alzheimer’s. So the past few months the short term disability checks have been the only thing keeping him afloat. It all goes to rent and bills, leaving little for anything else. I’ve been using a portion of my gas money to buy him groceries when I can. Early on his leave, we adopted a cat to keep him company, as I live 30 mins away and can’t visit every day. The situation was not ideal, but it was manageable, the first few months.

At the turn of 2019 things started getting a little complicated. The doctor’s office declines clearing him to go back to work every month, and money starts getting tighter. The disability checks start slowing down, often going a week or two later than scheduled. My credit cards are maxed, and we haven’t been able to pay them for four months now. We’ve done a cash advance loan to pay for a month of rent. His family, who lives in Kentucky (we’re in Texas), have given him as much as they can, despite not being completely well off and my SO’s hesitance in borrowing money from family. More than once he’s contemplated pawning possessions, but he doesn’t have anything to pawn. 

It’s April now, and the last time a deposit was made into our bank was mid-February. He’s called and hounded the office as politely as he can multiple times the past few weeks, and the money situation has been the cause of more panic attacks than he’s ever had prior to this situation. I’ve tried to get a job to get help with what little time I can be out of the house and school, but I’ve had no luck. His brother bought him a plane ticket to Kentucky for his birthday and he’s been there for the past two weeks to recuperate from stress a little, but last week we found out the lady who usually handled his paperwork was fired two weeks ago. He hasn’t gotten a dollar in two MONTHS but okay, fine, paperwork is getting filed now. We thought things were settled but his apartment complex, despite saying he had this Friday to pay his rent, has told him he’s been evicted and he has this week to leave.

So right now the situation is this: he’s borrowing money from his brother to be able to fly back to Texas, because we still have no money. When he gets back we have no plan beyond getting his stuff out of the apartment. (And he cant stay with me because he doesn’t want my parents to know his situation, and my brother and his gf are also moving back into my parents house this week, leaving no room.) I really don’t know what to do in so little time with literally no money. He wants moving back to Kentucky to be his last resort. Any other advice would be very much appreciated, thank you.",15Apr2019,1
566,"I just turned 20 years old and I've been with the same guy for about 3 and a half years now. He's 5 years older than me. 

He's the only person I have ever had sex with in my entire life and in the first year of our relationship it was going great. We were having a lot of sex and it was fun, but literally after that we'd only have sex like around once in the span of three months and it wouldn't even happen unless I bring it up??? He's had multiple other partners before me (around 18 women), so why is it just me? My libido is pretty high and if I could have sex everyday, I would, so imagine how hard it is for me to just be okay with having sex once in three months. 

I'd try to take advances like I'd put his hand on my boobs casually, or while we're lying down I'd start touching him but he'd just play it off as if I'm joking and say things like, ""aw babe you're so cute"" or ""I'm really tired from work today"", or the classic ""I have to be up early tomorrow"". I'd even ask him if he wants a blowjob but same thing. He's perfect in literally every other way and it's really just the whole sex thing.

I'm a pretty attractive person so I really don't think it's about my appearance. I mean, when I'm out, theres always at least three guys who try to hit on me and you know when you're attractive tbh but I've always been super loyal. NOT ONCE have i entertained someone else while we were together.

Imagine in the first year or so we'd have sex almost everyday literally everywhere. I know it'll never be the same as when you started but really???? once in three months???? He's pretty attractive and popular, and whenever we're out with his friends he makes it seem like we have sex a lot even though we literally dont anymore. If we want to leave early from a party he'd use sex as an excuse and his guy friends would joke and make fun of him he'd be like ""you know it"" and when we get home NOTHING. ""babe i drank, maybe tomorrow."" He's extremely sexual in public like he'd slap my ass or grab my boobs as a joke when no ones looking but when we got home literally NOTHING. 

I've opened this topic up multiple times already but somehow he takes it an attack and we'd fix it because he assures me that he's just having an off week or whatever and we'd have sex just so I'd shut up about it but after it's the same thing all over again. It's gotten so bad I've cried to him multiple times about it because I'm just so frustrated and sometimes we'd have sex to shut me up so now i just feel like I'm forcing him to have sex with me and it makes me feel disgusting. I don't want to do it if he's only doing it because I forced him to. He just calls me ""shallow"" or ""seriously? are you really mad just because of sex??"" and i get so ashamed and insecure I'm too shy to even tel my best friend about it.

It's hard to break it off with someone just because of that. It seems like such a small thing when everything else is perfect. I love him and his family so much but I've literally spoken to him about this so many times and it's really such a temporary fix I've gotten so used to it. It's sad. I really need some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently studying for a levels (I'm in England, these are exams done at the end of year 13 after two years) and I'm doing four subjects. I'm struggling with one of the subjects (physics), I have been for a while. I have improved in physics and in the last exam I got a B. However, this has been at a detriment to my other subjects. Maths in particular has gotten bad, while last year in year 12 I was averaging 85% on my maths tests, this year it's been at about 40%, because my mind has been all over the place. My mental health also hasn't been the best and part of me is annoyed I was stubborn and didn't drop earlier. My exams are in May.

I'be been thinking about dropping over the last week and I'm also worried I'm 'taking the easy route' and will regret it. I've also put in a lot of work into physics but I feel like it's taken up so much of my time.  It won't effect my university offers as I've already checked but I'm leaning more to the side of dropping. Any advice would be appreciated.",15Apr2019,1

I recently visited home for a few days after being away at university for 4 months. I got back, after just 3 days away and found the kitchen a mess, the shower disgusting, and my desk occupied by food scraps and trash. 

I am so fucking done being the housemaid for these jerk off roommates of mine. 

I don’t ask much, I am more than happy to do the heavy lifting when it comes to cleaning, I WILL NOT tolerate any more disrespect from them though. After a long day of class, golf, and homework I am treated to 5 drunk and high people unwilling to leave my room at 3 am when I have class at 9 am the next morning. I don’t even know why they want to hang out in my room, it’s probably because it’s he only clean space in the entire apartment. 

Every single time I have expressed my desire for a quiet nights rest, I am met with shitty reasons as to why I shouldn’t be allowed this “privilege” and why I should be more accepting of them.

All I want is some peace and quiet at night time. I can’t get 1 night without high people blasting that ground-shaking noise they call good music.

576,"Hello everyone i have posted some time ago here about a youtuber who I have a crush on. I understand that since she lives in America and I live in europe, that the chances of even meeting her are null. However I really like her content on youtube and I watch it not only because I like her but mainly because of the content. 
I have had this idea of sending her something I made, since she did an older video where she opened fan mail. I am planning to send her a fiction book in simple french since she said she is also taken up french and wants to get better, a painting I made and a carte postale where I will write that I appreciate her content. However I am scared that maybe my fan mail might look too personal and I don't want to look like I am invading her personal life in any way.
I am asking now because in her recent video she announced she will answer questions on twitter and I asked if I can send her fan mail, she said it was not really necessary to do that and that it is enough for her if we like her content on youtube. She liked my comment however.

I have a faint feeling she might not want fan mail and that my present might be a little too much. I am not sure though. Also she travels a lot and she has posted an address where people can send her fan mail if they want to but there might be a long time since she receives it.

 I typically like sending gifts and I like to prepare them myself. I don't have many chances of doing this in real life and I think it would be fun if she receives it and maybe opens it in a video.

Now, I’ve almost developed a sort of sex anxiety. I’ll say I want to, and I do, but when we start to initiate foreplay or sex, I tense up and freak out. I have no history of abuse or trauma, but just an overall negativity surrounding the image I have of myself as sexually active. I hate people knowing I’m sexually active, or when I’m having sex because I feel like they might picture it. I picture myself and my partner having sex and it turns me off. 

I feel like it might be my poor self esteem mixed with my low sex drive, and the guilt I feel that my partner continues to have a high sex drive. We’ve talked about it a lot but the issue continues to persist. Today, he asked if I’d like to and I said yes, but then his roommate came home. We wait for about two hours and when the roommate finally left, we just got extremely quiet. Like we were both thinking about it but not acknowledging it out loud, and he started to kiss me and I just shut down. I was thinking about having sex and what I might like to do and the second he kissed me I completely flipped. My mind spiraled out of control and i just didn’t know what to do, and it resulted in me telling him I don’t want to anymore, and then feeling just panicked.

583,"I was working with a man doing freelancing jobs for his business. Every job i did i was paid for. My rate is 25/h but since im a quick worker most jobs were only about 50 dollars. 

I completed two final jobs for him,one that took one hour and one that took 3. This was totalling 100 dollars.

I always get him to sign off on my work before i finalize anything, so he had said MULTIPUL TIMES that my work was okay.

He got back to me saying that he passed my files around to people because it wouldnt work and what resluted was a print that he couldnt use. He then told me it was my fault and I cost him 1200 dollars...

Problem 1 was he already knew my files were good hence the reason I sent my final invoice. 

Problem 2 my file has been modifiex and touched by many others so the mistake made may not have even come frome me.

He proceeded to tell me tjat im a mistake to work with and that he is not working with me anymore. I agreed that that was best (since before he was trying to force me to meet him for a coffee date). I reminded him what his outstanding owings were and he said okay.

Fast forward 14 days. I message him and inform him that the invoice has been due for the first job 3 days proir and the second job is due that day. He then tells me that he doesnt want to pay me that much because if he would have done the job it would have only taken half an hour. 

I inform him that it took me 3 hours to make all the changes he requested and if he was only interested in paying for half an hour he should have made that clear. I told him that he had agreed to pay me and that was that. 

After some arguing I droped it to 80 dollars so I could just get paid and not worry about it anymore. He said he would pay me in 14 more days. 

Today is the 14 day mark since then and 28 day mark since the begining of the project. I requested payment on friday if it was possible and he read and ignored my messages. I messaged him today reminding he said he would pay me my 80 by today the latest and again, no response.

So I'm not working because I hate the under 18 jobs, I 'dropped' out of college because I was totally unmotivated for that thing, and now i'm waiting.

Seeing this I really am becoming more sad everyday, But my parents told me that if I do get a diploma, They would get a Pc for me, which I want to work on with game engines and 3d modeling.

After she said that. I instantly became from 'put a gun up to my head I wouldn't care' to I can't WAIT to get this pc and do my part on this, I've ALWAYS loved designing my own games, and because my parents knew I wanted it i'm also going for college in that degree for them, imo I don't really need the diploma because My passion and love and dedication for creating my own games is WAY too big, but I'm still doing it for them so the next 4 years will be me working on my own big game and be on college as a 'game developer' aswell at the same time, I have a feeling my life will have a VERY great turning point from here on, once i'm 18 i'm also going to start go looking for jobs to work, while also handeling college and my own game, so when I build this pc anytime now or next month, I will spend my ENTIRE time on it before we go to vacation, I will spend hours upon hours upon hours to make the 'movement' of the game as smooth as possible, I will spend alot of time creating my maps, closely, detailing every bit and all of that has to be done with the free given assets.

So as an advice, am I doing somethinng wrong here? Because funny enough no one in my family somehow supports me with this decision because they think 'i'm going to drop out from that degree aswell after a few weeks' and they just don't have hope in me, and i'm a tough guy if it's about that idc what they're thinking because I know I can get far with this, and even if I can't, I will make a living off of this one way or another, halfway through my project. I am going to take the next first holiday on next college year and use that whole week to 'fully' study and learn 3d modeling, after that I'll slow down and start on making my own game's stuff and on sideway, perhaps sell them online?

Can anyone help me here if i'm thinking realistically?
Just in case, I love coding and am not a simple minded thinking 'making a game isn't playing a game'
I've worked in stuff before in the past I know exactly what it is, and honestly I don't even like playing games as much as creating them, I really need advice.

Also another reason why I don't do another normal degree in collegr is because I *hate* everything school tries to learn you alot of them is useless and they never learn you usefull stuff and it makes me depressed, even as a kid I was always the smartest one, but I never showed it because I simply can't, I somehow can't do ANYTHING for school while I somehow do 'know' alot about stuff that I find interesting, and school has nothing that interest me so this game developer degree is 'my only choice' as I see it for a degree.",15Apr2019,1
587,"My birth mother gave me up for adoption when I was just a baby (arranged before she gave bith to me). My biological father was an alcoholic and he and my birth mom had been broken up for about a month when she found out she was pregnant with me. From what I can gather, he was on the agressive side, so she opted not to tell him because she didnt know what he would do. I will be 25 this year and I have wanted to tell him about myself for a while, because he deserves to know. It was an open adoption and Im actually facebook friends with my birthmom! She told me that she ran into him a few years after I was born, and that he was sober and going to AA meetings. 

So the advice I need is, how do I go about contacting him? A text is too casual, but a phone call doesnt feel right either.  There is zero protocol about how to do this.

I just have hatred for myself. Society says I need to be good with women to be a man, I guess I'm not a man than. Will things get better? Will I find someone?

589,"In September I moved into an apartment with a girl that I had roommate matched with. I received a parking pass which was $20 a month but quickly realized I did not want to drive in this new area because everything was in walking distance. So I offered it to my roommate because she was unable to get one. We agreed she would pay me back for the months she had it. I would remind her about once a month that I haven’t been paid yet and she would always respond with “ I’m being paid next week” or “ I don’t have cash on me today” We did try to have it switched to her one time but then it would charge both of us for that month and we didn’t want that. But then my roommate moved out a month ago and took the pass with her without paying me anything. I’ve tried texting and calling her but she will not respond. I asked the apartment if they could charge her for the past 6 months instead of me but they can’t because I’m the one who signed for it. And now I have to pay a $25 for loosing the pass. She also stole $10 worth of art prints from me when she left.

She won’t respond to me at all and I just don’t want her to get away with this with no consequences. Can someone recommend something like a site to write a bad review about people or something that I can do that will negatively affect her. 

Some extra information that maybe can help. She smoked in the apartment even though we both put we are non smoking. Her boyfriend lived in the apartment with us even though it was only supposed to be us two. I have nothing about the parking pass and her in writing or text. We live in different states now so I can’t really confront her in person.",15Apr2019,0
590,"So there's this girl I met last summer back in my home country. First time I met her right then and there we clicked. We had a lot in common and she's my type, but sooner or later I tend to be really awkward around girls, mainly ones I get to know well. I'm a very open guy, I was always the class clown and a friend to all. I love getting to know people, but lately I feel like somethings been bugging me. I went through a faze during my first year in high school and this girl really helped me and gave me a better understanding on life. Nevertheless I really like her and always when I end to catch feeling for someone I start becoming distant with the person. I don't know why, but I sorta feel insecure while talking to her and always overthink what I say. This only happens with her and this one other girl I had a crush on.

I don't know what I'm rambling about since I wrote a perfect post before this describing the situation very well, but I quit safari by accident and I didn't save the draft. 

Long story short there's this one girl who I really thinks might be the one, but I really don't know if she feels the same way about me. We really started off well and had long conversations everyday about ""deep"" subjects until New Years Eve, when I suddenly stopped talking to her. She also stopped and I don't know if it's she's not interested in me as I am in her or she just feels that I don't want to talk to her. I really don't know what I'm even saying anymore since I lost my last draft, which is furiating. 

Ya'll might get the poin that I'm clueless on the matter since I can't even explain it well. I just don't know if I should send her a text not or just wait two to three months till I go back to my home country and maybe see her there. The whole thing is just awkward and I feel I can't see her anymore.

I just know that she's the only person in this world who understands me and I can talk to. Hopefully someone can help me. If you have more questions I can answer them. :// I really had a well thought text written before this, but my mac had to swith up on me.",15Apr2019,1
591,"My ex and I broke up awhile ago, but it was on good terms and we've stayed great friends.
We were doing a FWB situation for a few months until about 2 months ago another guy she met started pushing for her to be exclusive with him.
She told him she wasn't really ready for it, and got him to back off, but eventually she didn't want him to leave her and agreed to be exclusive.

They've been together for about 2 months and she and I have stayed platonic, until yesterday. We had plans to watch Game of Thrones and she invited me over early. We hung out in her room where we could use the computer for games/videos.
I'd stopped myself before from doing anything romantic with her. I kept telling myself it wasn't right. But we got to close and I just didn't stop myself and we started kissing.
She stopped it, and then I suggested we go to the living room so we'd get out of the situation. But she wanted to talk and we admitted that we still have feelings for each other. One thing led on to another, and while I'm happy that we could have a close personal conversation, what we did is terrible. We both cried.

The guy she's currently seeing lives 2 hours away. She feels like she rushed into being with him just to make him happy, so that's coming to a close.

It's just that apparently he has trust issues because his last ex cheated on him too. And I can't even imagine how he'll take this. Is it ever right not to tell him the full truth? He may never trust again. It makes me feel terrible.

I'm in the wrong. She's in the wrong. What we did was wrong. But what's right to do now?",15Apr2019,0
593,"Hi All! I desperately need advice.

Just a little bit of background. I am in my mid twenties. I am a student and work full-time. My life has been up in the air for the past couple of months. I am in between universities right now. I recently just graduated community college and am deciding on what program at school I want to study. The company that I work for was bought out. I have been applying to jobs, and I already went through a couple of rounds of interviews for a great job. To top it all off, I have to move out of my house in two weeks. As of yesterday, that is no longer an issue :)

&amp;#x200B;

 To be honest, I've been having a lot of trouble juggling all of these pieces of life and figuring out how to piece them all together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Below, I am going to breakdown my particular situation by piece. Any advice on each piece and how to make them all blend together would be greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

1) School

I was recently accepted into the Business Administration program at the school of my choice. I was given a huge scholarship. Essentially, they are giving me a full ride plus extra money to cover other expenses. This is very exciting, however, it is contingent upon me taking 15 credits (5 classes) per semester. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Work

I work full time. As mentioned, my company was recently acquired, and I have to find a new job ASAP. I am told that I can stay until December, but I am a contractor with the company, and I really don't feel safe trusting this new company to uphold that agreement without signing a contract. I've been looking for a new job. I found this really great position for a huge global company. I applied, went through a couple of rounds of interviews, and now I am waiting to hear back. It's been a couple of weeks, so I need to follow up with the recruiter ASAP to let them know I am still interested.

The problem is, I'm not sure if I should even follow up with the recruiter because I'm not sure if I should take the position. I applied before I found out that I had to take 5 classes per semester. Here are the issues: A) I would HAVE to ask for flex hours. B) my school is like 40 minutes away. They offer night classes starting at 6pm. No online. No weekends. C) I live in one of the largest metro areas in the US. Getting anywhere at any time is hell. Commuting during rush hour is awful. If the job is normally 40 minutes away, it would be probably 1h30m during rush hour. D) I would have to do this literally 5 times a week. It would just get beyond exhausting, and I'm afraid it would impact my ability to be a good student and employee.

I feel really confident about this job opportunity. I interviewed very well, and I was recommended by someone notable in the company.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, I am torn between two very good opportunities. It really comes down to: will I choose my education or financial security. Here are some ways I've thought through how I can play this out:

&amp;#x200B;

1) I take the full scholarship, take out some loans for bills/living expenses, and work part-time. This would allow me (for the first time) to be a traditional student, and it will allow me to immerse myself in my studies. I could maybe even join clubs. I can even get through school faster if I focus all of my energy into 5 classes. 

2) I cut down the course load (maybe 3 classes per semester) and work full-time. I will likely still receive aid, however, it may not be a full scholarship. Any other expenses can probably be worked out with the company. I read that they have tuition reimbursement, but I don't know the guidelines to receive that. I would also be financially stable! The company would be a great resume builder, but it would take forever to finish school.  

3) I stay with my current company until December and reject the job at the other company if it is offered to me (this means I wouldn't follow up with the recruiter, I guess). I go to school full-time for the first semester, see how heavy the course load is, and base my work status on that. I would also try to find a job in the city where my school is so that I would be able to balance the two more effectively.

4) I just say fuck it, let my boyfriend finish his master's degree (1 year to go), move to Europe with my boyfriend, and go to school there. Since this is our plan in the long run, maybe getting a European degree would be better if we plan on working/moving there.

5) Just bury my head in the sand (which is my inclination because this shit is so stressful and I don't want to deal with it anymore)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really partial to choice 1 and 3. I feel bad not considering the job as much because someone really opened doors to get me in there.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Any other suggestions?",15Apr2019,1
594,"I'm 27M, and after being dumped by my ex-girlfriend last year, I've thought a lot about what I'd really want in a lasting relationship.

From others' advice here and elsewhere, I've learned that every relationship will require compromises on both ends, and there are also things that you should not compromise on (e.g. respect, core beliefs, friends, family, etc.). For the following things, I'm not so sure if I should be hard set on, or be open to flexibility:

1. Communication style (direct vs. indirect): this was probably the root cause of my ex breaking up with me. I'm a dense guy, so I need things to be communicated with me very clearly, and often two or three times before I get it right (not for lack of trying, but because I'll often see things in multiple ways). She, on the other hand, said that she wanted to give me more credit, and not treat me like a kid that needs things spelled out for them. In her head, she thought she was being clear, and also when listening to me, she would often read into things a little too much (e.g. if I made a suggestion to go eat pizza, she would take it to mean that I REALLY want to eat pizza, when in reality I was just making a suggestion and would've been cool with eating anywhere). From the beginning, she claimed that she was not shy about communicating, but I didn't realize that she would do so indirectly most of the time.
2. Sex drive: I don't know how to say this without sounding rude, but I think that personally, a reasonable frequency to have sex would be about once a week. More would be great, but much less, not so much. I'd say that this is something that is pretty important to me, at least for now, but I don't know if it's too demanding or unreasonable to need a partner that shares the same drive as me.
3. Major hobbies: I'm not a sports guy at all, but I know that many people (men and women alike) are passionate sports fans, and will follow every game, know all the players, host parties, etc. And I totally respect that, but to me, it's a huge waste of time because I have no interest in it. My interests are classical music and video games, but 1) I don't dedicate a lot of time to these interests, and 2) even if I did, I would not want to force either of these down anyone's throats.

If anyone can share their experiences with any of these values, and offer some insight, I would really appreciate it!",15Apr2019,1
595," Well hi there first of all\^\^

&amp;#x200B;

**backstory for everyone wanting to go into my reasons:**

so i have always been socially awkward and one of the ones with not many friends. Well i had a revolution from 12-14yrs of age but then i turned an awkward loner again :D. anyways: i don't really have friends and honestly most people dislike me, which really is my fault i just seem to do most things wrong and think differently and what not ya know\^\^

well now since a few years i have turned actually being sociophobic\^\^ sometimes i just stand in my doorframe with the door in my hand but just cannot move from the thought of so many ppl out there who might be watching and judging me yada yada yada - sorry for the long backstory\^\^

so noooow i am slowly trying to get better\^\^ going out more, actually actively trying to involve myself at team-meetings and even with customers and mentioning idead etc - also: i love music and even clubs if there is like a dark corner i can spend the evening alone in or sometimes with friends now (after a few yrs of not going at all)

&amp;#x200B;

**actual situation (for skippers):**

so i was invited to join a lover and a group of i don't even know how many friends of his to a music festival\^\^. i like the lineup and honestly festivals and the fact i ""cannot"" ever go to one has always been a sensitive topic (yes i cry a lot when i try not to seem jealous about such things yada yada).

&amp;#x200B;

*well so how did you guys visit your first festivals?*

*any sociophobics/socially awkwards got any experience on doing such things with like strangers?\^\^*

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be a glad about any input just could not stop daydreaming about this but then again i don't wanna fck up with the guy and also like i don't know how many strangers x.x

Afterwards though, it feels as though they don't really want to engage in conversations as much and I've started pretty much all the conversations we've had so far. Perhaps, it's just us becoming busier. I totally understand that it's okay to be texting everyday.

i grew up in a small town in florida and have recently moved to a military town in georgia so i’m not as involved in family drama as i used to be. 

my grandparents come from a traditional southern background and tend to give their problems to god, pray about it, etc. my aunt is and was their golden child - valedictorian, beauty pageant queen, etc. that was all in her glory days. but for as long as i can remember, my aunt has always been an addict. it started with a shopping addiction that got her into a good amount of debt, then it progressed to cocaine, that got too expensive so she met a guy who she started doing meth with, tramadol (from an “ankle injury”) and from there, who knows. my grandparents have remained blissfully ignorant to this problem and have managed to isolate all other family members while they allow her to sell their things, my dead great grandmothers things, to keep up her habit. she has lost her home and her job within the past few years because of her drug problem. she has blown through all of the money she got from her house foreclosing. she got herself a car, loaned it to a drug dealer, and filed a false police report saying it was stolen when it was found in south florida all smashed up. my grandparents bailed her out of that one too. she has always managed to not get in trouble with the law. she has brought drug dealers to our family property where my grandparents, dad, and great aunt reside. she has taken pictures of me when i was a minor and completely unaware and sent them to men she does/gets drugs from (i have never told my family this in fear that my dad would hurt her). she borrows my grandparents vehicles constantly for drug runs. 

she is a master manipulator and it’s killing me and my family to have watched this go on for so long. we feel so isolated and have to walk on eggshells surrounding the subject of my aunt.  we are convinced they will leave nothing to us and everything to her when they pass. my fear is that she will drain them penniless before their time comes. or be the reason their lives are cut short. i love my grandparents so much and it terrifies me to think of what is and could be happening to them. isn’t this elder abuse? can i put in an anonymous tip? how do i approach them without them feeling attacked? what do i even say?

609,"She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say boo.She began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We’d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends help.When I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said ""Nobody else is as big as you"". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.

As I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.

Well now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything.

I am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it. I am just heartbroken because she feels like the best female friend i ever had and will never have someone like her again. The best female friend I had but she bossed me around and kind've abused me and has been for years. I have been hurting for years. I want to be friends but the way she acts makes me not want anything to do with her but I do care about her and love her platonically.

TL;DR

I met a girl when I was younger she did stuff that's impossible to ignore to get my attention.

611,"I'm very close to my sister in law and I would say she feels really comfortable speaking to me as well. I recently found out she is racist and makes many racist remarks about black people when we're alone. 
(By racist I don't mean ""they should all burn"" type of racist, but ""I'm better than them/they're monkeys"" type of racist) Whenever it happens I try to steer the conversation in a different direction. She has said some unnerving things to me about my niece that I decided to tell my boyfriend. He was very shocked and didn't know how to handle the situation either. He loves our sister in law but it has strained his relationship with her. 

She loves our father in law and even said she would want him to walk her down the aisle when her fiance and her get married (She has a strained relationship with her father). But this morning she said something about our father in law (he is black). Something along the lines of ""It's because he's black. I'm sorry I'm not racist but you can dress a monkey up, but he'll still be a monkey"". 
When I tell you I was so shocked that all I could do was walk away and pretend I was changing, I literally did not know how to even respond to it. She laughs when she says it so I don't think she says it maliciously? Maybe she just has this old school mentality that jokes like that are okay?? I just honestly am so confused and don't know what to do. I already strained my boyfriends relationship with her when I told him the first thing. I'm afraid if I tell him this, even if she was joking, he will completely cut her off. 
The reason I'm so conflicted is because she has stage 3 almost 4 cancer and I'm not sure if the chemo is just making her say things she would normally not. These were the first times I've heard her speak of black people like this.

619,"So, I have practiced law for the past 10 years and am looking to move on and try my hand at something else.  I handle professional liability defense and am just tired of the litigation grind and constant fighting that it entails.  I've been with my father in laws for for the past 7 years after he asked me to join as he needed help and it allowed his daughter and I to move closer.  I was offered an in-house general counsel position about a year ago and after talking with him didn't take it, plus my wife wasn't on board as it was a lateral move. I've been looking to leave litigation behind and move more towards risk management and business growth.  I told this to my FIL and when of his selling g points for me to stay was that he would get me into a company locally.  Despite my asking this hasn't happened, he wants to get me a role at a business that will feed the firm business.  So I don't think he really wants me to leave.  Well, I'm back to looking and happened to speak with my father.

He runs a successful company and I was asking him for ideas on how best to move on from law and what advice he could offer over the weekend.  He calls me today and offers me a job working with him as he has been looking for someone to take on a management role with his company so he can start cutting back.  He told me he wasn't aware I was still looking and that my skills in law and finance tick the boxes of the candidate he's looking for.  It would require an hour of commuting with some work from home days after getting familiar with the business. He sold it to me that the experience would increase my marketability in the future if I chose to leave as I'd be trained to manage and gain valuable skills that could be used in any industry.  I expressed concern about me coming in as a family member and his response was that I've spent 10 years in finance and 10 years in law...""your not some 21 year old riding my coattails, you've had 2 successful careers.""

I'm conflicted because it seems like a great opportunity and my father is a wealth of knowledge that would be invaluable to learn from.  However, I feel bad leaving the firm and putting them in a bind.  However, I'm down the chain at the firm due to other family members being involved and my FIL looking out for them first no matter what he tells me.  This was evident when I told him about the prior position I was offered and he commented that he thought his daughter was a better fit and why wasn't she recruited.  My salary would increase significantly and my wife is in the camp that I should take the opportunity because she believes her family would hang us out to dry of work dried up at the firm.

620,"I realize I went about this entirely incorrectly, but it's the situation I am in.
About nine months ago, i rented apartment (that does not allow animals), it was kind of run down and shitty, but it's what I could afford. After six months, I had a serious medical emergency related to suicide. I was recommended to get an emotional support animal, a cat to be specific. I did not tell the manager of the complex. Well after they sprayed for bugs, they found my cat, and said that I had to pay half of my normal rent, and to remove the cat. After I showed the manager my certificate from a doctor's office, he said that it would require a judge to verify if it is a real emotional support animal.
So now I am stuck paying my normal rent plus half (for the animal, that is a real emotional support animal). He has not made any real moved to evict me. But he is incorrect about requiring a judge to verify if my emotional support animal is legit.

631,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I feel pretty desperate at this point and am hoping that someone can give some good advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot focus worth a damn about 95% of the time. This means that when I'm at work, I spend a lot of time staring at the screen and not doing anything. I am very concerned that I could get fired (even though no one seems to have noticed so far). In addition, I don't do much in my personal life. I often don't even feel that I have enough energy to play a video game or board game (which I love doing). So I spend most of my personal time watching TV. I've even gotten sick of watching TV, which is something I've loved my whole life. I'm very big on TV, but not lately. I'm also just very sleepy a large portion of the time. Caffeine pills barely do anything for me at this point. I spend most nights getting high on weed because I'm tired anyway and can't get myself to do anything. Plus it helps with my back pain (this might be a little backwards, but I describe this more in #3 below). BTW - this problem definitely started before the weed came into the picture, so that is not the cause. I am taking multi-vitamins now, which have not seemed to help at all, but I still take them. I've also tried a couple different supplements that are supposed to help with focus; I do not remember the names of them at this time. I'm trying so hard just to stay afloat, but those close to me usually tell me that I'm not trying hard enough. This has been going on months, if not a couple years.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few noteworthy possible factors here. 

1. I have struggled with depression my whole life. However, I experience the lack of focus and energy even when I don't feel like I'm depressed at the moment. I do take anti-depressants and have tried many different kinds. Being on them is better than not, but not a lot better.
2. My eating habits aren't the best. Mainly the problem is that I eat a lot of sweets in the evening. I usually have 2-3 bowls of ice cream. I've tried cutting down, but It's quite an addiction I'm facing. It's particularly difficult because I feel like eating sweets is the only thing that gives me enjoyment.
3. I do not exercise like I used to. I get very little exercise in fact. I know you might say ""well you need to exercise, dummy!"", which I know is true...But I have no energy and cannot get myself motivated. Also, I think my decline in exercise started when I injured my back. I now take Norco for pain on a daily basis. I am able to exercise like anyone else with some exercises, but with others I am limited and can only do it for a short time (Ex: I can only do short walks before my back starts hurting and there are some exercises that are generally not good to do with a bad back).

633,"Hei guys. 

I really hope I can get some advice from You. 
I am apologizing now for any misspelling because English is not my first language. 

I need advice on how to improve my healt/diet. I feel so down and awful all the time. I have gained some weight and mood is always down. Basically I think my biggest problem is cooking. I hate it. Not just hate is but I can't stand being in front of the stove and cook something, especially healthy. Whatever is fastest and simplest will go. Also I work a lot and when I get home I am so tired I just want to sleep. 1) how can I overcome this? 

The second factor I believe is my boyfriend. He is a very picky eater. Like VEY. Basically only potatos/macaroni and some kind of meat. I don't really enjoy meat. I'm not vegetarian or anything but i just don't like the smell of meat when frying it. And a lots of sweets. Candy, chips, pastries etc. And he is not down to try anything. It's pointless argument. 

So I come home, have to cook some kind of dinner for him, which I hate but want to take care for him as he has 12 h shifts and is also tired. And then i should cook something for myself. I dislike cooking, so preparing 2 meals is torture. Usually I snack something for dinner and that's it. 

I don't really believe that comments ""try something new "" or ""try to convince your bf"" will work.

636,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I'll admit this is a luxury problem, compared to the stuff I've been reading on this sub, life can be so so so much worse than having a small dilemma like this, and I'm fully aware of that.

&amp;#x200B;

So I figured that it's the best to start describing myself to clarify this situation. I am a 19 year old boy from the Netherlands, raised in a very regular atheistic family, and I'm very happy with my life. I am aware of all the privileges life has given to me. And I always feel so arrogant by saying this, but in the eyes of most girls I am very good looking, which I am really happy with. Especially last 2 years it was never really difficult for me to get interest from girls at school or at party's as example.

&amp;#x200B;

But for some reason, I've never really made use of that (yet?). I have always thought that I am to much of a romanticus to do such things. The last few years I always was one of the popular guys who wasn't afraid to talk to anyone, or step up to anyone, but I can surely say that I have never kissed a girl that wasn't my girlfriend. I never made use of some drunk teenage girl who wanted my attention. And it is not because I'm scared or shy or anything, it just doesn't really feel right, even though I have never tried it. I've only had a relationship with a girl once, when I was 18, she is the only girl I ever kissed and had sex with. So I kissed a girl and had sex for the first time at 18, (which also really isn't a problem at all, and it never happend earlier because of a comparable reason; i wanted those moments to be with someone special). Right now I will be 20 in a few months, and since I am single right now I am really hesitating about how to live my life. The next 5 years will be years that I'll really miss when I'm older, and I really don't want any regrets. Some of my inspirations and idols are men who enjoy life and just do whatever they want, and I am also trying to live life the fullest, which I am mostly succeeding at, except from how I act with girls/women. Peer pressure also definitely isn't the problem.  On one hand I just want to enjoy life, do the things I like, have 'fun' and have onenightstands, and hook up with some random girl from tinder or at a club etc, which seems really fun to me (excuse me for sounding so incredibly female unfriendly). But when I'm thinking neutral and clearly, while listening to some beautiful music as example, I just feel like I am very sure that I would regret doing those things, and that it would damage my dignity and self-worth in some way I guess. I think you can compare it to the feeling some men have after visiting a prostitute (weird example, i know eheh). And I don't have this problem with other things, like trying drugs or drinking alcohol, I've always just done whatever I felt like with most things, but except from girls. But I just really really really don't want to have any regrets when I'm older. Right now is the time to live, enjoy life, be handsome and enjoy being young.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've read trough all this stuff above, thanks a lot for taking this time. I am just kinda struggling with this the last few months and don't exactly know what to do. Could some of you please give their perspective/opinion/experience on this matter? I am hoping other peoples seeings on this would may give me a fresh perspective.

Background info on me: I have depression and generalized anxiety disorder (diagnosed) and I think I might be autistic, but I haven't gotten a diagnosis. I have only ever been in one relationship, and she was emotionally abusive towards me. All my friends left me when they found out I was with her (because they thought it was a sin) except two, but those two live far away so I can't see them. This happened a year ago, and I haven't made new friends since. 

It was pretty soon after that, when my mom decided that her, me, and my sister, would move in with her boyfriend temporarily. It is a small town, everyone is very conservative and/or on drugs, and a I've heard a lot of rumors about people dating their own damn family members. So I'm pretty much scared of everyone. 
Now my mom is saying she wants to live here forever. 
Background info on my mom: She has anxiety too. She also seems to have anger issues. She's had mood swings and emotional outbursts frequently. She is very controlling of me and seems to sabotage new relationships I try to make, by talking bad about me in front of people I talk to. She says I can't do anything on my own because of my mental illnesses. I have had several suicide attempts and all of them were mostly because she made me so scared to be alive. 

Background info on my mom's boyfriend: He doesn't ever look at my face. He ignores me, I try to ignore him. He yells at my mom a lot. He's not beating her as far as I know, but sometimes she cries and won't say why except that it was something he said. He has two dogs, one of them killed my previous dog. No one knows why, his dog just randomly attacked. He made fun of me for crying. 

I hate everything about this town. I want to see a therapist, but my mom won't take me, and I can't drive myself. I want a job, but I can't drive myself. (There's nothing within walking distance) I'm not getting any kind of education, and I don't know how to make friends. I have no social skills, no life experience, and no education. My mom seems to want me to stay that way, though I don't know why. 

Recently my dad visited. I told him how lonely and miserable I am in this town. 
He said I should come live with him, in my home town. He even said he would come pick me up asap. 
Idk what to do. 
Background info on my dad: He is a health freak. Part of the reason why my mom left him is because he kept commenting on her weight. My sister says that the reason why she used to have an eating disorder is because he kept commenting on how unhealthy her diet was. He's very religious (christian) and the reason why all my ex-friends were homophobic was because most of them were people at met at his church. He guilt trips me a lot about how I need to get right with God. But he seems to be a lot more willing to take me to doctor's appointments, including therapy. He says he will help me get my driver's license.

So I'm really considering moving in with him. 
Mostly because the location is so much better. Idk exactly what my plan is, but in his town there are options at least. It is a big city, so things are closer together, therefore I can walk to most places. I can ride a bus if I need to. Theres a really nice college that I'd like to go to. There's more liberal people who might accept me even though I am bi. There are lots of places to work. 

But I'm scared of what my mom will do if I leave. I feel like I would be abandoning my little sister. She has admitted to me before that she doesn't want to live with my mom. She might try to come with me if I leave. But if she does that, I don't know if my mom could emotionally handle it. She's very unstable. Idk what she would do. 
I don't know. 
I have so much going on right now.

652,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I work at a retail job that pays $11 a hour and is almost full time. It does not include any benefits. I also have a small eBay store and Discogs store that I've been using to try and make ends meet. My eBay store has tanked in sales since November 2018. I have completed a General A.A. degree last year from a state college and do not have the money or the time for more traditional schooling. I'm considering trying classes with University of the People for Computer science (Supposedly free higher education) anyone heard anything about them? I've applied for over 50 different jobs in the Sarasota, Venice, Bradenton, St. Pete, Tampa area to no success. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in Credit Card counseling trying to get rid of almost $35,000 K of debt. A lot of it came from being in a loop of buying a crappy car trying to pay for repairs so I can get to a job that seems only to pay for the car. I've tried going without a car and it did not work out (Live in the Sarasota, Fl area and was almost killed 25 times in a span of two months. Older population that can not see is a massive problem here. Public transit is a sick joke around here) I've managed to reduce Auto insurance last month but the savings were quickly taken up by the increase in gas. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moving is not a option due to my parents that constantly require attention (older and slowly losing it mentally) Rent is spiralling out of control in a span of only 3 years it has increased by $450 a month and I'm in the cheapest studio apartment in the area. The landlord knows this and likes to remind myself and other tenants of this every lease renewal. Living with my parents is not a option because they think that anyone working full time should be able to afford their own place and it is not a problem for them... I also can not stand them as they blast Fox news almost 24/7 these days...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I just filed taxes today and owe the IRS money; from not having healthcare that I can not afford. I'm at my wits end. It feels like everything I do makes the problem worse.  Please point me in the right direction to do better or share your own experience about how you got over your financial issues.",15Apr2019,2
653,"My apologies if this isn't the appropriate thread to post this on.

As a disclaimer, based on my discharge papers, as well as the MRI and CT scans, I do not have epilepsy. It was the typical grand mal seizure that you see in the movies. I actually had two within a 3 hour span that day. I didn't have history of seizure prior to this and I'm quite sure I know what caused it (though I won't go into detail); It was great stress. I don't drive and my plans of getting a car in the coming months is pretty much a wash because I'm not sure how my license renewal process will go. I've been on KEPRA (seizure medication) since being discharged. I know in my state in the U.S you must go seizure-free for 6 months before being allowed to drive again. Plus the symptoms of my medication includes dizziness for some (Not me though) and the Neurologist and my primary care physician said not to drive. I know the application for license renewal asks if I have any twitching disorders and I'm not sure if they mean epilepsy. How should I go about this license renewal process?

663,"Hi everyone,


In September of last year our company was bought out by a much larger company from Florida. (We are in California) 

Things started off awesome with them doing renovations in our California office and making it a second headquarters, promoting from within, and making sure we all felt comfortable.

The company I work for sells certain electronics online straight to customers, and we also have a wholesale force for shops.

Recently, a new trainer for the wholesale side moved to California from Florida and has been training a new group of reps. However, the way she is training them is questionable to say the least. She is using accents. Specifically middle-eastern accents. She also throws in what she calls her “valley girl” accent and some sort of Asian accent every now and again. She is not quiet about it either and most of the time is screaming in these accents of hers.

I’ve never seen this type of “training” before and many people in the office have been uncomfortable with it and have told her about it and she still continues to do this and thinks there is no problem with it. 

One of my coworkers reported this to HR which is also in Florida, this was almost two weeks ago and it has not been addressed nor has this trainer stopped. I am writing this as she is currently screaming with her accent. Is this common when it comes to sales? I’m in a more IT position so I don’t have a good understanding of it all but feel like this wrong. I’m not sure what to do now or even what I can do.

 I'm dating this guy who I had really liked for the longest time. He found out I liked him about a month ago and I have been dating since. At first, it was really great, I normally tend to keep myself more reserved hell I haven't even had a boyfriend before this. we talked daily we would give hugs here in there, as he knew I wasn't the greatest with interactions with other people. Lately, all he's been talking about is either wanting to kiss me, which he knew that I wasn't ready for (and yes we are in high school) or I'd pretty much be getting these long ass paragraph about how much he loves me or how self-conscious he is about himself and his past ex. Normally I would leave this kind of situations right away, but I feel as if I have to stay and talk to him. It's becoming to the point where I'm exhausted by the time we finish talking and dread all of his text messages. And it is not that I don't like him anymore its more that I don't know how to react in these situations and the fact that he's very different from before we even started dating. Before we got together we'd spend our time talking about anime or overwatch league, now it's all about our relationship or how much he is so lucky to have him. And on top of everything, rumors started going around that I was going to break up with him and I don't want to break up and he is like ""oh so you told the whole school before you even broke up?"" I don't know if I'm over thinking it but I just really need some advice on what to do in this situation.",15Apr2019,1

668,"First, I just want to clarify that I’m asking for help on wording an awkward request. I am not looking to do any further actions other than that.
Second, I am not looking to bash my father’s second wife or anything like that.
My father passed away a few months ago. He had been sick for 2 years (Heart disease) and got remarried a few months before his health took a turn for the worse. As soon as he got married he updated his paperwork to have his wife as the beneficiary to make sure they had easy access to pay medical bills. It has his intent one day to help my sisters and I with weddings, but he didn’t have time to change that in his will. He trusted that his second wife would manage things as per his wishes.
Soon after he got sick, it became too overwhelming for her and she completely stepped out of the picture. At that point my siblings and I took over managing his care, but did not change any documentation. She did not want to get divorced but has had no contact for the past 1.5 years other than the day before he passed away. Right after he passed she mentioned to us that she still plans on honoring his wishes and help us with weddings. She brought it up initially. Soon after that she was given a copy of the estate and all the accounts that she is beneficiary on. At that point she ghosted all of us. She is aware that she is getting his assets. I know that legally she owes us nothing and I should let it go. I do know that my father would’ve wanted her to have something, but I think it was never meant to be this disproportionate. 
We never tried to get them divorced because we did not want use money meant for his care to pay a lawyer, etc. 
I think I will regret it if I don’t gently reach out and ask, but I’m struggling with the wording. 
My sisters and I planned to never get the assistance because we were hoping it would all go to nurses, etc while he lived a few more years. Now that I’m starting to get back into life routines, it’s been nagging me to check in.

682,"Hello everyone,

Throwaway account for probably the most obvious reasons out there.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my situation, I'm an adult male, mid 20s, recent college graduate. I am working a job that I happened to stumble across through some networking, which led me to meet a man who, for the sake of this, we can call Paul. Paul and I went to the same small school, which has VERY strong alumni ties and a pretty successful network of alumni, just many years apart. Paul was about as high as you could get in this company (pretty big company) and was more than happy to meet with me, get to know me, have a quasi interview, and offer me the job in the course of one night's meeting at the office. This was about 2 years ago. Following the interview we stayed in contact, had a dinner or two, golfed once or twice, etc., nothing that seemed crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to modern time, he has moved on to a bigger role in a bigger company, we have stayed in contact (happy holidays, birthdays, stuff like that). He reached out recently to catch up over dinner. To be quite honest, I'm not the biggest fan of my current job, and one of the cardinal rule in businesses is to keep mentors/your network close to you, so of course I'm happy to do this. Following my acceptance, he invited me to go to his beach house instead (brand new, he's been super hyped and was talking to me about it previous to this). He'd invited me out before, but I kinda feel uncomfortable, because per my understanding I'd be out there alone, and he mentions things like ""just opened the pool"" ""whiskey bar is looking nice"" etc.. Let me also say, he's the nicest man ever, he's gotten to his high positions in life because he's extremely personable, can sell work to clients, stuff like that.. so I'm not sure if this is just him being a very gracious person or something a little bit more strange.

683,"Me \[F27\] and my (ex)bf \[31M\] know each other for almost two years. We had some difficulties last summer. He never cheated or anything, and he never wanted to or would. It were mostly misunderstandings, but still those things created trust issues between me and my (ex)bf. Is was just some clumsy things happening in a short amount of time. Some things that happened, for example:
- A female friend (N.) he has known for four months didn't know I was his girlfriend (or he had a girlfriend at all) when I first met her. When I met her she looked interested in him, even though he says she's not.

- He once lied about wanting to see a girl he kissed once. they didn't met, but he asked hir out for dinner and told me he had no intentions of seeing her.

- We had a break in the summer and I deleted him on facebook, because it was too hard to see his account. aAter we got back together he accepted two other girls (including N.) but not me.

- I asked him to go to the city and market, he said no because he wanted to finish some things at home. Later he told me he went to the city and market with another girl.


We talked about it, and he really tried to be open about who he saw. Even though he forgot to mention he has saw N. Kinda believe he really forgot, but still it hurts because some things happened with her.
Lately I've been having a hard time dealing with it. Mostly because the summer is getting close again, and because things haven't been processed as much as I hoped and we had some set backs.


He's saying I should work on this, since those are my thoughs, insecurities and issues. I don't really agree with him, since I think trust is something we should both work on. The one who broke it and the one who's left broken. I agree with him that I should work on my own insecurities, and some of my thoughts and feelings are unrealistic, but that alone won't fix the trust issues (in my opinion, he thinks different about it). We would really love to talk about it and make agreements we're both okay with, and try to work things out. But we look at what needs to be one quite different.


I want to know what you all think the both of us can do to overcome it?
I don't need opinions on how bad he is or I am. We both have our learning points. We just want to overcome this, and need some advice on how to. Thanks! (:


TL;DR: last summer some things happened that caused trust issues (not cheating). We're trying to work it out, but have a different view on how to. The (ex)bf thinks it's all my responsibility, while I think it's a shared task. I want to know what the both of us can do to overcome it?",15Apr2019,0

696,"Hi reddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is the right place to post this. If not just let me know and I'll remove it.

&amp;#x200B;

In Primary School (Ages 4-11) I had this really close friend. We were friends throughout Primary school. She was one of my best friends infact.  When it ended and we all moved to different Secondary/High schools, (Ages 11-16) all my friends stopped contacting me. Except her. We would email each other multiple times a day. Back and forth. Back and forth. Back and forth. It was great.

&amp;#x200B;

Until one day I  went into a depressive episode. And I stopped talking to her. Not because I wanted to. But because I didn't know how to respond to her messages anymore. At first it was days between me replying to her. Then days turned into weeks. Weeks turned into months.  To the point where I hadn't talked to her in years. I didn't have it in me to check my email because I'd feel anxious about what she must think of me now.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years passed, I was still in this depressive episode, and I bumped into her in a nearby shop. She seemed really excited to see me again, despite not talking to each other since we were kids. She immediately gave me her contact details so we could talk more again. I was surprised she still wanted to talk to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted her and explained to her why I stopped responding and she understood. We started messaging each other frequently again but I had this aching thought in the back of my head telling me that this wasn't going to last.

&amp;#x200B;

Well... a few months after something happened which led me to delete all my social media. Not related to her at all. Something else.

&amp;#x200B;

Aaaand now a few more years have passed and here we are today. I'm out of that depressive episode now. But I'm not as good at communicating or starting conversation. I bumped into her again earlier today and she was excited to see me. Despite everything. She gave me her IG and told me to DM her. I've sent a DM but how do I make sure things don't turn out like before?

So, last night my friend and I were just driving around having fun and talking, when we decided to take a few signs from the political candidates in my city. We then thought it would be even better to dump them at another friends house. 

Of course, the friend found out, and now they would like the signs removed. My other friend who was driving isn’t taking any responsibility for it and doesn’t seem like he will help with the clean up. 

What should I do with the signs now?",15Apr2019,1
698,"Hi, I’ve been working fast food to earn some extra cash and get some experience in the working field. I’ve been working at this place for about 3 months now and I’ve learned every station very quickly, and I often get praised by my boss and other coworkers for my work. The only person who seems to dislike me is my supervisor.

She’s quick to criticize me, like for example: today I was at register giving out food. One of the trays was missing fries so I went to get some. I ask my supervisor if the fries are salted, and she looked at me with a nasty face and said “no.” A customer wants my help so I go to attend them. When I turn to salt the fries, my supervisor says with a very condescending voice, “you know it’s not that hard to salt fries right? Like it’s actually the easiest thing to do (fake smile)! So why don’t you salt them, m’kay?” It failed to get an external reaction out of me, so I simply said “okay.” And someone asked what happened, and she said “nothing, she apparently think salting fries is hard.”

Then later, I was busy making like 10 orders of sandwiches, and she yells my name across the kitchen and says “Hey, there’s a tray that’s been out there for like 8 minutes and you haven’t been doing shit, don’t let me see that again.” And I say “with all due respect, I’m not the one taking orders at register, I’m on sandwiches and I’m not going to run back and forth between sandwich making, unless you want the orders to get mixed up.” She pretends to not hear what I said and goes back to drive thru.

I don’t feel like I’m doing anything wrong, she’s friendly with everyone else but me, and she always gives me these glares that make me feel like she’s being hostile. It’s like no matter how well I do, she will look for small things I do “wrong” and she makes it seem like I did way worse (the fry situation). I’ve always been friendly to her, but it seems like she just does’t like me at all. She invited everyone to the movies on Saturday except me, which makes me feel a bit bad.

What can I do? Should I talk to the manager about her passive-aggressive behavior?

TLDR; Supervisor seems to dislike me. She speaks in a condescending tone and leaves me out of hangouts. Should I speak to the manager?",15Apr2019,4
699,"On Friday, my friend and I were perfectly fine. Let's call her N. We had a great time hanging out at a school event at night, and went home happy.

Then Sunday, she asked me to hang out with her again that day, so we tried to plan it out. Sadly, I was too busy that day and had to work on chores and schoolwork. I felt bad because we've been meaning to hang out over the weekend for weeks now, but I've been busy with schoolwork, taking care of my family, completing chores, and catering to all of my friends' needs. So I apologized sincerely and went back to work.

She wouldn't let it go, and kept nagging me about how bored she was and how she needed to get out of the house. I apologized again each time and explained how all of this work needs to get done first.

Later on Sunday night, she just replies with ""Whatever"", and that made me snap a bit. I have been suffering severely with mental health issues for the past year, and I've been sacrificing everything for other people because that's how I was taught. I've only just started learning how to accept people treating me out and accepting help, and I haven't been making good progress lately. I replied with this monologue:

""Look, I can't stop the world for you. I love you to death, but I'm a person too. I'm not a tool, and I'm trying to learn how to take care of myself. I can't just drop everything  to hang out with you. I have many friends that I have to cater to, and a family to take care of. I barely take care of myself anyway. If you have a problem with that, then I'll just leave you be. ""

About 30 minutes later, I apologized, and called myself selfish, mean, and self-absorbed. I said that I was just frusturated, and that my emotions got the best of me. Then I said I didn't wanna bother her anymore.

Right when I'm about to go to bed, N replies, nitpicking everything that I supposedly did wrong. My heart broke when she stated that we shouldn't be friends, and I begged her not to leave. That night I broke down and loss a ton of sleep.

Fast forward to next day, my friends have reassured me all day that I didn't do anything. They told me that she was just a negative and toxic liar (based on their personal experiences with her). I just tuned it out, not wanting to believe it all. Later in gym class, everyone sat out due to shortened periods. I sat with one of my friends, and N sat on the other side of him, glaring at me. I broke down again in gym, crying and explaining all of my stupid problems and what I am going through. He and another girl I don't know try to reassure me the best they can. Eventually, I calmed down and sat in silence.

On the bus ride home, I decided to text N another monologue due to guilt and anxiety:

""I'm sorry for pissing you off. I know my feelings don't matter and you probably never wanna hear from me again. I know you hate me, and I don't deserve your friendship. I just wanna apologize. I honestly don't know what I did, but you can tell me. I don't mind anymore if it hurts. Good luck on life, and I'm sorry I fucked up. I still love you. I'll stop bothering you now. You won't have to deal with me anymore soon.""

I don't know what to do. She is one of my best friends, and I feel completely destroyed. I don't know what I'm gonna do with/to myself. I don't deserve her friendship anyway. I don't know what I did, and yet I still fuck everything up. This is the icing on the cake for me.

This is the second time something like this has happened, but this time was way worse.

702,"I work at Walmart. I was promoted from an overnight stocker to a department manager. My new boss told me I started the 13th. Signed the job offer. My boss said the 13th was a miscommunication, and she wasn't expecting me yet, but I was there so oh well. She went in, and set my schedule to days because I was still scheduled for overnights. Just assumed that was a mistake.

The store manager came and talked to both me and my boss two days later. He said I have to go back to overnights because a replacement had not been hired for me yet, and the freight is not getting worked. My boss can bring me to days once my replacement is hired. I will be getting manager pay to do overnight stocking.

I'm paranoid that they won't find a replacement very fast, or they'll decide it's easier to give someone else the dm position because they're just easier to replace. Or that something else is up, and they've changed their mind about promoting me. I don't want to work there anymore after getting promoted, and than losing the position for no solid reason.

703,"This is a though one. Please excuse my scattered thoughts and the possibility of me leaving out key information while mishaps overdoing the unnecessary ones. Given that the person that made me seek out your advice indeed is a fellow redditor, some of the information will be rather vague and skewed in a way which should barely affect the bigger picture. 

I've met the woman I love approximately 5 years ago on an online language learning board as she was preparing for traveling through my country of residence.  Back then I had nothing to offer else than dreams. Due to a rather turbulent first (hopefully) quarter of my life, I had no school degree and only dreams and hopes to offer. In the 3 months in which we contacted one another, she invited me to join her on her travel and so I did. 

The fact that a random person from across the globe would want to travel for 2 months with an absolute stranger still baffles me up to this day. Those two months were beautiful. Given our young age, we took things slow and as per my nature and the fact that I had been used to referring to my right hand as my girlfriend for years, I had no reason to be pushing. Not to mention that the idea of a long-distance relationship with thousands upon thousands of kilometers in between seemed more than ridiculous to me at that time. Even with financial stability such seemed troublesome. 

At the end of this travel, it was more than obvious that the both of us fell in love and what started as a friendship slowly and dynamically transformed into a relationship. As a white man myself and her being part of an minority while taking strong interest in gender and race matters, the last 5 years have been more than eyeopening for me. 

I accomplished my educational goals as she studied for multiple semesters and even her masters degree in my country of residence and on paper, our relationship was going well. I've always taken a huge interest in her culture, hence the reason that we met on an language learning board and it never really upset me to wait almost 3 years before I met her parents whereas she was struggling to accept the kindness and warmth that my family welcomed her with. 

But I wouldn't be here if it were as peachy as it might sound. About 1 year into our relationship I had to confront myself and the fact that I'm far from sexually active anymore despite challenging myself intellectually and physically on a daily basis. This was something that she also noticed. And ever since then, the path down the downwards spiral has been taken. 

I sincerely wish that I could love her body the way it is yet, I can not. From scratch marks and skin picking (?) I have no idea how else to describe it, over bruises that are caused by her bad sense of orientation and overall chunkiness to an ever lasting yiest infection all the way to places, where I don't even feel like I don't have any right to 'criticize'. 

There were multiple encounters where she asked me why it is that I'm not as attracted to her anymore and expect for a single moment in which I slipped my tongue in which I told her, that I won't let her thighs freeze even if they were to get a little slimmer, I'd like to think that I did a great job at lying to her. Does that help my problem? No. Is it her job to become more attractive for me? I sincerely do not think so. I've never liked the idea of changing a person and I'm sure, if it weren't my first relationship, I wouldn't have undervalued the importance of sexuality this immensely. 

Yet it wasn't until we almost broke up due to her walking in on me, jacking off on amateurs of her ethnicity. Ever since then and more specifically since I've been studying in her country she became imminently insecure about her appearance. To an extent where it seems like she's given up on it. I can't remember the last time she's put on make-up when we went out together. 

Recapping and summarizing this makes it seem like a done deal. Yet, she is still my best friend. I sincerely do love her and want nothing more for her than to be happy. Yet the way we fight. The way she abuses me psychologically and the way I fail at making her feel beautiful makes it eminent that this relationship won't last forever. 

I regret that she had to be the person teaching me these lessons given that I know how hard it is to find someone who believes in you and literally wastes years of her life waiting for you as you work yourself up to become even remotely acceptable as a member of society. 

Yet I can't help but desire to be with a type of woman that she is so far away from, that simply hoping for her to continue changing to the better, like she has with a lot of her psychological shortcomings, seems unfeasible.

I however can't deny that I'm reliant on her. Most of the people that I interact with are somehow related to her. My proficiency in her mother tongue is still far from proficient enough to be part of the society and the prospect of becoming even more lonely sincerely scares me. 

I can't help but laugh at my own situation. I'm discontent with what I'm having, yet am fantasizing about being with a type of woman I wouldn't even be able to express my thoughts to unless I somehow stumble upon such in the local expat community. Nonetheless, this is more of a ramble / confession type of post.

Second, my lease terms are for 12K miles (36,000 total) and I'm already at 34,000. That's six months for just 2K miles before the 0.15 cents per mile penalty takes into effect.

What are my options to either (A) terminate lease early to somehow NOT have a vehicle payment while I'm out of town for 3 months and just get back and lease a new vehicle -- or -- (B) some kind of trade offer people do with individuals or the dealership?

713," I need some advice on my current place of work.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For a bit of context I worked at my current place of work for about 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I started doing job X which is completely unrelated to my current job (software development) but during my time at job X I developed software to make my life easier in the job, this was picked up on and I was ""promoted"" to my current role.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have been in this role for 3 years now and have never had any form of new contract, despite asking for one multiple times. I have never been given a pay rise or any form of compensation for my new skilled job, despite asking multiple times.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say I have developed multiple pieces of software for my company and I am looking elsewhere for jobs now as it seems quite apparent they have no interest in providing a new contract or a wage to go with the work I do.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is relatively simple, who owns the software?

&amp;#x200B;

Most software developer contracts I have seen implicitly state that software created is owned by the company etc. Seen as my contract is still from job X, would this apply as it's ""implied"" by the fact they have paid me a wage for the past 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Would I have any leg to stand on if I pulled all of my software? (I wouldnt do this as I don't want to sever my ties with the company)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Could I bill them for the software?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have no leg to stand on at all and just have to take this as a learning experience?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Promoted from job X to Y, developed lots of software, never got pay or contract to reflect this, who owns the software, what are my rights?

715,"This requires a bit of back story and sorry it's long. 

I work for a manufacturing plant and interned for a company last summer, then coming back in January for an extended year long internship, in grand total I've been there just over 6 months but just over 3 months since I've returned. I'm generally well liked by all, and I do good work.

I work in the engineering group, all of which are salaried except for me, and have been holding myself to the same expectations they are held to (with consideration given to my skill set as an intern and not an engineer with 30+ years experience). Over the course of this year I'll get a few hours of overtime a week (between 2 and 3 hours but never more than 4), as engineers often have lunch meetings, skip lunch, or a little stay late as the job demands. I usually just mark this on my timesheet and my manager approves it. 

This year one of the plant goals is that all ""salaried, engineering, and support personnel"" go out into the plant during off hours (weekends or nights) to interact with the operators in the name of safety and health, I don't know why this is a goal or entirely what we're supposed to when we're out there but it was intentionally left vague. We are to do this at minimum 4x per year. I went for the first time last Saturday. 

Today my boss is mad about overtime, particularly the Saturday I came in and these voluntary lunch safety discussions. He said he did not realize that the off hours thing included overtime and said that I was not included in the requirement, despite me talking to him about it in out weekly meetings including the Friday before I went out. Also he's saying that the lunch meetings I've been going to, of which there's been 3 (I've only counted 2 of them) do not count because they are voluntary and it's lunch. Also my position is not to generate overtime. So now I don't know exactly what to do. I feel I need to explain why I felt the safety meetings counted; I gave up my lunch break and planned to be there to discuss safety in the plant and how to work towards better safety in the plant so I thought that should be counted as work and everywhere else I've been would have counted it, although my bossed seemed to think because it was voluntary and lunch it did not count. Coming in on off hours, it had always been mentioned that our group was responsible for doing that. The other few hours I have stayed late finishing up work, getting things ready for meetings the next day. I never kept a log because my boss has always been fine with it and I knew why I was there and I was told when I started, overtime must be approved and no one is keeping track of your comings and goings. I thought if there was an issue he would just not approve it and bring it up, but I didn't see an issue.

But she probably doesn’t love me back, we get along really well and we’re similar, but she’s really pretty and I’m ugly and I think she sees me as more of a friend, but she’s so unhappy and it kills me because I care about her so much and I can never tell her how important she is to me and how happy she makes me feel when I’m usually low, because we’re just friends and it would probably weird her out, but I just want her to be okay and it’s killing me, it’s making me so fucking sad. Bcos I’ve never felt like this about someone and I don’t think she feels the same way but I want to tell her how amazing she is because maybe it will make her feel a bit better but that would fuck things up. It’s all I’ve thought about today. Help.",15Apr2019,1

721,"So I thought that I had my life planned out. I picked my subjects I want to study and the uni’s I will be starting soon. But I was sitting alone at home, and whilst knowing I had to do a lot of work on mathematics and business studies, I took out my old paint brushes and started painting. I realised a reoccurring pattern of me coming back to do something artsy, something creative etc. as a way to cool off some of the pressure from my statistical subjects. Then I was wondering if the things that I picked out to study are actually the things I want to do for the rest of my life. The only reason I’m not picking anything to do with art for my career, is because I’ve been told that I will live as a “starving artist”. So I resorted to forcing myself to believe that I like business, maths, management... Telling myself that art is a hobby, and I can always come back to it whenever I’m overheated. Does anyone else feel torn between picking out a favourite career or a stable career..?",15Apr2019,1
722,"I'm honestly not even sure where to start with this, so I'm just gonna start talking and hope that it's intelligible.

I just turned 20 a couple months ago, and I'm really wanting to stretch my wings and start living life again, but I don't know how to do that when I've fallen somewhere about 5-10 years behind on just about everything in my life.

I was pulled out of school in the 3rd grade to be ""home schooled"" (haha that didn't happen), so everything I've learned since then has pretty much been from reddit and youtube. I know enough to generally get by on a day-to-day basis, but I'm still missing a lot of basic fucking knowledge that I really should have, and more importantly, a GED so I have at least the bare minimum chance at finding a job. I've tried khan academy, and my math skills alone are probably still somewhere around middle school level at best. I don't know how long it's going to take me to catch back up to where I should be, or honestly if I even can at this point.

The other joy of home schooling is the lack of social interaction I've had since then, which probably puts me at around middle-school level in that category as well. I at least had friends online I'd talk to every day up until a few years ago (~2013?), but I was a massive dick and managed to scare them off (not even being hard on myself; I was an asshole, and I did a lot of introspection after I lost them to try not to let it happen again). I'm not sure how to talk to people anymore, and I've basically regressed back to the same shy, quiet kid I was when I was 5 years old. I used to at least be funny, but that muscle's atrophied thanks to not having anyone to talk to, too.

So here's today. I'm 10+ years behind on education. I don't have any friends. I don't have any social experiences within the last 5 years. I don't have any connections. I don't have any money. I don't have any work experience. I don't even know how to do my own fucking laundry or cook for myself. All I have is art, which I'm not even that good at, and I kinda wonder what's the point.

Especially after hearing more about the death of Daniel Kyre (musician/comedian from Cyndago). Incredibly kind and funny dude, super talented musician, friends that love and cared about him. Everyone that he met only had positive things to say, even if they only knew him for a few months. He had everything that I want (I feel shitty taking his death and making it about me, but that's what humans do, we're shitty and we relate things to ourselves), and even still, at around my age, he took his own life.

If I could read my own obituary it wouldn't be more than a sentence long.

I'm not suicidal (yet). I may be going on 6 years of depression, but I've never gotten as far as trying to kill myself, so don't worry about this being a suicide note or anything. (Though I could also see someone looking through my history a year from now and saying ""oh, so this is where it started""). I guess it's just a crossroads, and I don't know which path leads to where I want to be and which one ends with that 1-sentence obituary.

I get the idea of ""everyone moves at their own pace, don't try and rush yourself to catch up to others"" or whatever, but if I don't move at some point, I'm going to stay like this for the rest of my life (however long that is). Sitting on my ass, in my room, browsing reddit, living to die, unremembered.

I don't know what to do and I'm overwhelmed and scared.",15Apr2019,1

724,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started talking to this guy from Tinder and I don't really know what to make of this situation as I can't tell if he's interested or not.

Long story short, we had a conversation about what we were both looking for and while he has no expectations since it is a dating app, ideally he would like a relationship but only if he vibes with that person - we basically had the same answer when it came to this topic. Anyway, it's been about two weeks and he's messaged me every 4-5 days saying things like I came across his mind and he wanted to send a message and he hoped my day was going well to checking in on me and asking me how my work and exams were going.

&amp;#x200B;

Now unfortunately today I had to tell him it's just not the right time for me to be talking to someone as I realized that I have way too much on my plate and both work and school to which he said he appreciated the fact that I was honest and had the courtesy to tell him about the situation and did not ghost him. He then said if I wanted to get together and grab a drink that I should keep his number as he'd love to hear back from me.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this is a stupid question and I'm over thinking things but do you think he was actually interested in me? Or were we looking at more of a friend situation here?

However, literally all of my friends are graduating this year. At the end of this semester I will be completely alone. 

I'm not great at talking to people. Even most of the girls in my sorority don't talk to me or like me very much, which sucks but it is what it is. I was way too shy to be able to form bonds and now they just permanently think I'm weird or not worth their time.

I've gotten all the advice on just joining clubs or talking to people, and it really isn't that easy especially as a senior on her way out. I've come to terms that maybe I will just be alone the next semester.

However, I am dreading having to be alone every weekend and eat all my meals alone again. I did that my freshman and part of my sophomore year and it was hell. I feel like a loser and a failure just typing it out.

I want to make some online friends that I can hang out with on weekends. I started listening to D and D podcasts recently and that also sounds like fun. The problem is I don't know where to go to find people who might want to be my friend, or find a group of people that would accept someone who has literally never played D and D before. 

I just don't know where to go and what to do to find people to talk to and become friends with. I already feel so lonely and I just want anything to hold onto to feel like I'm not a complete failure.

727,"Recently, I signed up for a personal trainer. When I initially signed up, I was feeling really determined and confident about getting a trainer- now I wish I hadn't. They told me at signup I would have to wait for 1 month billing period to go by before I could cancel, but because of some upcoming events I was planning for, I only ended up paying part of the upfront fee (the other part is due this week). I was hoping because I haven't paid in full (and because I haven't used any actual training sessions) I would be able to cancel early and maybe be refunded. 

As for the reason I joined: I'd tried their complimentary sessions since they wanted to get more people in and really enjoyed them, so I said I'd be interested in signing up. I had been at the gym for a while and liked working out a few times a week, and I was feeling extra good after getting out of an emotional slump (due to depression and some other reasons). When I start to get into a happier mood I usually make impulsive decisions, though this is the first time it's been with money.

732,"21/m. Dropped out of Uni, lost my faith (family ultra religious), been fake attending for a full academic year now and family asking about when I graduate. Options available to me: (1) Vanish and maybe leave a note or something. Change number and cut ties. Live whatever life I choose (2) Say I dropped out this year because it was too hard or something. Would be super disappointed as I am a role model to younger siblings but would get over it in time. Also just fake continue being fake religious if it means having my mums love. (3) Suicide

You have to remember if I ever did mention I left the religion I would be cut off from the local religious and ethnic communities. My mum would truely believe I am going to burn in hell forever. I feel like the lesser of the 2 evils is going missing. She would have a heart attack if I left the religion and family would probably confine and try to revert me because of the shame I would bring to the family if anyone else found out.

Sooner or later shit will hit the fan as graduation date closes in. Decision will need to be made before then. 

I literally leave home as if I am going uni and then sit around wondering what's stopping me from just ending it all. At least when I was religious there was the fact suicide meant eternal hell. Now I have been thinking about it more and more. Panic attacks have increased in frequency and I break down into tears randomly. I am living a lie. I would sooner go missing than face my family with the fact I am not who they think I am.

737,"My bf (21m) and I (19f) moved into a house my boyfriends father bought for us in mid July. Initially it was supposed to be a flip, but there were more problems than we thought so now only the major projects will be fixed up. The major project of this post is the floors. 

Now, we moved in in July. We haven’t done anything but paint the living room walls. The floor in our bathroom is rotting and if I were to jump it would break all the way through. The carpet smelled of cat pee before we moved in so now our cat is peeing on it and the house smells terrible. Right now the carpet is the cheapest of the cheap hotel/office carpet. 

My boyfriend and I can’t fix the floors on our own since there’s a foundation problem in the crawl space which needs to be fixed first. I have begged and begged for months for my boyfriend to reach out to his dad that we NEED the floors done, and he does, but his dad disregards him. (It might be a money issue, I’m not sure. Boyfriend &amp; his family don’t like sharing “weaknesses” like that.)

This post is not about how to get my way, or who’s right in this situation. My boyfriend wants me to be patient and understanding, but it’s making me resent him because in my head I think, “if he really cared about how much this meant to me, he would be on his dads ass to fix the floors”. But again this could be a money thing, or something else I don’t understand. 

I need advice on how to control my anger with this. I look at my shitty house and hate it, and get mad at my boyfriend and his father for telling me it was gonna be this awesome house to flip and design, when in reality it’s the same crap hole we bought 10 months ago.

I have this thing of trying to be someone else since I was a kid (It started when I was 10/11 probably). Whenever I see a movie, a sport game, a TV show or even when I'm with my friends I feel the need of copying somebody I admire or is successful in life.

For example, one day I listen to some successful musician so I get the urge to copy every habit of that person, like his music taste, the music he/she makes and the way they look. I want to be a music producer so I've been having this problem a lot lately.

I remember that when I was 13 I ""wanted"" to be a sport journalist because I admired a famous journalist, so everyday I tried to watch and learn about soccer. But I got bored of it every single day so I was getting nowhere. At the age of 15 I started this music thing so I'd say i'm pretty good rn (I'm 19).

Admittedly I got a bit loud here... Then he tells me he wants to meet me and he will do it if i agree. I said something to the effect of ""are you fucking kidding me?!"". He then offered to pay all my bills... I said I didn't want him to pay my bills to just remove me from the calling list and never call me again.

749,"You ever get a song you hate stuck in your head? It’s kind of like that. Just this nagging thought that gets triggered over and over again because I keep thinking about what happened the time before, a never ending cycle.

So, it all started as a joke. My friends and I were drinking and talking and somebody brought up something they thought was funny. To be fair I did too at the time but that was before I knew it would wreak havoc on my psyche.

He said, “wouldn’t it be hilarious if Steve Buscemi was literally every character in the Lord of the Rings?”

Harmless hypothetical. Anyway we laughed about that and for maybe ten minutes posed different scenarios about what the movies would look like with a cast of exclusively Steve Buscemis.

Next day or two, I pick up a book I’d been reading off and on over the past week or so, one of my favorite books, Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut.

I’ve read the book probably a half dozen times and always had a picture in my head as to what the characters looked like, but all of a sudden all of those visual images were gone and all I could think about was Steve Buscemi. I tried to push it out of my head but Steve kept creeping back in.

A week later and I tried reading another book only to have the same thing happen. All Steve Buscemi all the time. 

Over the course of several books, the same problem plagued me, no matter the characters description or gender all I can think of is Steve Buscemi.

Even the voice in my head as I read is no longer my voice but rather Steve Buscemi’s and sometimes when I’m not even reading and just thinking I’ll stop and notice my inner monologue is being narrated by Steve Buscemi. He has consumed my very being.

I used to love to write but when I try to describe a character I always just end up subconsciously describing a ‘slender, gangly, bug eyed man’ 

The last book I read was Stephen King’s ‘It’ about 4 months ago and all I could think about was a bunch of Steve Buscemis being tormented by even more Steve Buscemis and there was an all Buscemi sewer orgy I did not need in my life. It made the book more terrifying than it was even intended to be to be honest. 

After the orgy scene I tried making love to my wife a few days later and to my utter horror all I could think about was Steve. I didn’t even know what to tell her. “It’s not you honey, it’s that damn Steve Buscemi again?” I hoped that would be a one time occurrence but I was wrong.

I have pretty much internalized it too this point. Too ashamed to tell my wife I am being haunted by Steve Buscemi, that when I make love to her I have to keep my eyes closed. That sometimes I involuntarily imagine myself as Steve Buscemi when we are intimate. Somehow that feels like I’m violating her that she doesn’t know my penis is his in spirit. How do you tell someone that you’ve been possessed by the spirit of a living being and they are now cucking you without remorse. 

The worst part is that for the past four months she comments on how much more she’s been enjoying the sex. It is emasculating that I am only able to perform at these levels as Steve Buscemi and not as myself. I mean is it really even me at that point? It’s like she is having an affair but she doesn’t even know it.

The other day I looked in the mirror and I don’t know if it’s because I’ve loosing so much sleep but my eyes were just as wide as his and for a second I looked just him.

It was the straw that broke the camel’s back when I walked into the kitchen and my wife stopped and stared at me and said in all earnestness, “you kind of look like that guy from Reservoir Dogs,” then went on to say it was a good thing. I can’t confirm she was referring to Steve Buscemi but who else could it be? And apparently she finds him attractive? I can’t help but think their love making has attached her to him spiritually in some way.

The problem has reached a head and I need help. The more I try to avoid thinking about Steve Buscemi the more I seem to think about Steve Buscemi. I’m at my wit’s end. It’s been going on for nearly a YEAR. I want to tell a therapist but I’m afraid they will lock me away or put me on super really heavy medicine. But honestly, at this point, I’m willing to try anything.

Is there any secret trick to getting something out of your head? Is hypnotism a viable option? Has anything like this ever happened to anyone else?",15Apr2019,2

I yelled as strong I could to put it back at his place and after that, I broke my finger with a punch.  Fracture of the fifth metacarpal.

757," 

Apartment complex is acting unprofessional, and quite frankly, childish. Not the first time.

Lets quickly go over the facts:

1. They have lied in the past.
2. Their management changed.
3. In the current situation they are attaching themselves to something that is true, but blowing it way out of proportion.

After speaking with someone who ""didn't know anything, please call back later."" I did and got the person who does know things on the phone. Now this is where the story goes off the rails a bit. In a verbal agreement I had with the previous management, as I could not use their trash service during their operating hours (which I'm not going to explain here, its honestly not relevant), there wouldn't be a problem with me taking the trash out of my apartment every friday/saturday.

So they decide this month they are going to come around on Thursday instead of Saturday for 'regular maintenance.' Which didn't even take place. The things listed they did not do. Maintenance man entered my apartment (I was there working remotely) checked to see if the water was running, and left.

I get on the phone:

Me: ""Hi, yeah I got a call, a voice mail rather, to our non primary line talking about trash in our apartment?""

Her: ""Yes there were 9 bags of trash blocking the door when the maintenance men came in"" This is the first lie.

Me: ""No. That isn't true. There were 4. How is this a problem? Also they weren't blocking the door, a door jam was."" This is the second lie. The trash was beside the trash can.

Her: ""Well your apartment was pretty messy when they came up and \*NINE\* (she says with force) bags of trash is just gratuitous.""

Me: ""Well, first we need to address this. There were not \*NINE\* (I repeat in her tone) there were \*FOUR\* (in her tone again).""

Her: ""No, no sir there was not. I got a note and the note is telling me Nine.""

Me: ""Well great, but that is simply untrue. You should probably go ahead and speak with your maintenance men about why they didn't' tell you correctly. Also why were they up here?""

Her: ""They were doing checks of the apartments to see that there wasn't an outstanding issue with trashy apartments.""

Me: ""Ok so this flyer you guys put out is not accurate?""

Her: ""Excuse me?""

Me: ""Yes so that means that you didn't actually have a reason to come into my apartment or you lied about it. Given the flyer says they were going to be checking the following things \[things\]""

Her: ""Well sir, to be completely honest, I wouldn't live in trash, and four bags of trash are to much.""

Me: (Starting to lose my patients) ""Ok, well given when I moved in and explained the situation to the previous managers and we all verbally agreed that what I was and am doing wouldn't be a problem. So can you please explain how or why its now become an issue.""

She doesn't respond.

Me: ""Can you please explain that?""

Her: (Condescending tone) ""Sir, we both know that is absolutely absurd. you can take your trash down every night or get fined for using the service improperly. Honestly I can't believe people live like that."" &lt;- This means that she looked and this was something the previous management agreed to, given I didn't mention anything about how we couldn't use the service.

Me: ""Excuse me? Four bags of...""

Her: ""NINE BAGS, also this can lead to problems with insects."" &lt;- This is false. You (typically) get roaches by either moving into a place with roaches, or bringing them into where you live. Most roach infestations come from potatoes. But fuck me for having a fiance for having a stem degree, and working in stem myself.

Me: ""No it was four. Actually three and a box, but whatever. Well if this place is having problems with roaches I'm going to need to know now so I can leave the complex. I would prefer my things didn't get infested with roaches.""

Her: ""We are neither confirming or denying that we have roaches. Oh well whatever. You can say whatever you like sir, I know you aren't being straight with me. The fact that you are living in filth isn't our problem, but it will be yours"" (She said this like a cartoon charterer says ""tee-hee""

At this point I lost it.

Me: ""OK well FROM NOW ON PLEASE DO NOT CALL ME WITH FRIVOLOUS SHIT. You should probably be taking your statement back. For starters I am getting married here shortly and even though there was a huge pile of three trash bags and a box that WEREN'T EVEN IN FRONT OF THE DOOR, its from WEDDING GIFTS. How unfortunate your maintenance men didn't take note of the fact that the apartment was literally spotless given I work in IT and clean the entire apartment three days out of the week, other than BOXES FROM GIFTS sitting beside THE TRASH CAN, and NOT IN FRONT OF THE DOOR! You don't even have your facts straight and you are being condescending for no reason. I expect an apology! So unless you are going to admit that they didn't tell the truth and apologize for how you have spoken with me tonight I don't think we have anything else to speak about.""

Her: ""OK SIR, WHATEVER! HAVE A GOOD DAY."" (In a clearly false friendly voice. Then starts laughing and making fun of me before hanging up.)",15Apr2019,1

I checked around and found nothing. It happened again today. This time, it was really windy outside the whole day, so it's not out of the question that it got blown away somewhere. But, after looking around for 30 minutes, I haven't been able to find it. The frustrating part is that I got this recycling bin a couple of weeks ago.

Well, my cousin and her husband where planing to go in a vacation in car, and as usual they left their son with me. Sadly they have an accident, I don’t want to get in much detail but the house in which they hospédate had a gas leak.
This situation itself bad, we have to tell our nephew that their parents were dead, obviously a lot of crying during the nights, we allowed him to sleep with us and that help but it didn’t solve everything.

The problem was that we realized that now that their parents we’re gone, he needed a home. My cousin has no brother or uncles and only has his olde mum, which is in no way capable of raising him.

764,"First, I'd like to note that this is my first post and I've made this account specifically for this because I've no idea what to do. 

Backstory: I'm 16 years old and I'm female, and I go to a school that allows us to finish high school classes by our junior year and begin earning college credits as early as our sophomore year; which in turn gives us an almost guaranteed scholarship (full ride) to the university which houses our high school program. A lot of info but it's important.

I began talking with this girl who I'll call Z about four months back. We'd gone to school together since our freshmen year but, it was't until second semester of our sophomore year that we actually got to know each other. She came out and told me that she was questioning her sexuality but, she had a crush on me. And one thing leads to another, and we've been talking for a while now. This all began last week when she'd chose to confide in me about ""something important"" and that night, she called me and confessed that she had been raped four times. She didn't want to go into detail but after me pressing for a bit more information, she confessed that as a child she'd been raped twice by an uncle, once by a cousin and again by her father. 

She and her siblings were sent to live with their dad when they were much younger. She had two older sisters and younger brother (her oldest sister passed last year from cancer). If her dad hadn't chosen to take them in, they would've been put into foster care by their mother -- this makes her feel like she owes him. Z told me all of this on a Saturday night and by Monday morning, she told me that she hadn't told the entire truth. But that her dad still molests her. 

She is unfortunately, very sick and often times has to go to the hospital for treatments but, the argument between us stemmed because she wasn't taking her medicine. Z told me the reason why was because she had to run out the house before her dad tried to take her to the hospital which, obviously, alarmed me. This is when she confessed that she was scared to ride alone in the car with him. It's been a week and a half since she told me and things have become much more alarming since then. 

Z has three other siblings living in the house but, has never told them about the abuse. She says that he only rapes her because he ""doesn't like her"" and leaves the others alone. He catches her before she leaves for the bus because her siblings have already left the house before her and shes often come to school with her legs aching and bruises on her wrists and neck. The reason why I've decided to post this is because I'm terrified for her; her dad is forcing her to stay home from school tomorrow but hasn't told her why although she already knows why. I don't know what I can do because along with being a rapist, hes insanely homophobic (We've gotten by as pretending to be 'best friends'). 

She has no other family in the state, so if she were to get police involved, shed be taken from the home and removed from her siblings. If she's sent to live with a relative, she'll be forced to give up her scholarship at our school and lose everything she'd been working towards for the past two years as well as the friends shes made and me.",15Apr2019,681

I know this issue I'm posting might be cliche and not very interesting for many people to give advice on, but I have seen all types of advices on this matter on the internet and in real life, and almost none have helped me. Being a somewhat silent redditor for the past couple years, I have come to know that reddit might be just the place I am looking for that can actually help me.

I have had this issue for years, some people call this laziness, slacking off, running from important things, etc. Others have gone and said it might be something serious like ADHD.

I can only keep working continuously on the stuff that my mind treats as entertainment. But it gets very hard for me to work on anything thats productive for the world or even myself. Even when there are things I'm working on that im good at, like anything English related, documentation or whatever, my mind knows it's work and tries its fucking hardest to take my focus elsewhere. Yes, maybe if I'm writing something really good totally unrelated to work or productivity, I might enjoy it, but I think this thing is crippling me, my body is forcing me to flush my life down the drain and I have been legit worried for a while. I don't tell people this because anyone who hears it will say yeah nice excuse for being a lazy cunt. I have seen, heard and witnessed countless motivational things and convinced my mind to get working on something and that it's really important, and when the moment comes, what do you know, my mind is completely numb and unaffected by the pressure and importance of the task and I'm just mindlessly wasting my time on stupid shit one hour after the other.

There are so many things that I should be doing for my career and my life yet I seem to get none of them done. I am also thinking of seeking medical help in the matter, but still not confident about it as this issue is common among a lot of people and they might not take it seriously.

I’m in college and live in a room with two other people. One of the roommates (let’s call her Good) I really like and another one (let’s call her Bad) we both cannot stand. Our room selection for next year comes out tomorrow. 

So at the beginning of the school year Good, Bad and I got along pretty well. We were close friends and talked about a lot of our issues and just in general got along fine. We didn’t choose each other to live together we were randomly assigned. 

Fall quarter break Good and Bad planned a day hangout together because they would be in the same area. Bad went to visit Good’s house for the day and make some strange remarks like “wow this house is really small” and “you only have one bathroom for your whole family to share”. Now Bad knows that Good has had some financial struggles and still chose to say that. 

Good and I really didn’t think much of it and come winter quarter we all decided we wanted to live together the next year, about 3 months ago. 

Now as soon as we said this, Bad just started to get worse. She makes comments about the private things we told her before to other people that live on our floor and to her mom. 

She literally called her mom scream crying because we went to a restaurant and had shitty service, (like really shitty I’m talking we were never given silverware or water and the waiter just took some utensils out of our hands, now normally I’m not the one to complain about this stuff Bc I used to be a waiter but it was very bad) and she wanted to tip them 25%. We said no (me, Good,and a few other people). We wanted to tip 15% and she got all pissy and started saying how it was important to her to tip and that she would pay for the extra. So we said fine ok whatever you pay. So I put my card down and wrote in 25% tip. Everyone Venmo-ed me and I asked her to send the extra money Bc she said she would. Bad then refused and said that we all ate there so we should all pay.
 We took an Uber back to the room and as soon as we got back, Bad went into our room called her mom and started scream crying about how we are “menaces” and  that “our parents raised us wrong” she also called me fat and said that Good was anorexic when she was younger because she was selfish. 

As I said, Bad had this conversation behind a closed door but Good and I were outside in the common room and since she was screaming, we heard everything. (This was about a month ago) 

After this we became more observant about what she is saying behind our backs and whenever Good or I go in to our room and she is on the phone she ends the call immediately or changes the subject. 

She also has very early classes this quarter and is not considerate to us when we are sleeping in. She opens clif bars and slams her dresser while we are trying to sleep in the morning. She also does similar things while we are trying to sleep at night except she also FaceTimes her mom and dad at night (without headphones on). 

Good and I don’t know what to do. We want to tell her we don’t want to live with her but she also has a history of mental issues (a story for another day) and we don’t want to hurt her. We just don’t want to live with her anymore. 

She is expecting us to live together in an on campus apartment next year but we really (and I cannot stress This enough) really don’t want to. We also have to live with her for another 10 weeks until the quarter ends. 

If you guys have any advice on how to approach this situation and how to tell her we don’t want to like with her anymore that would be so helpful! Thank you!



Tldr: have a difficult  roommate I don’t want to live with anymore and don’t know how to tell her I don’t want to without ruining my other roommate and I’s lives for the next 10 weeks",15Apr2019,1
774,"I do not usually create my own posts on reddit, so I'm sorry if I've done something wrong in advance.

A few months ago I was placed into a mental health hospital for being suicidal.  I had to spend around two weeks there and they had wanted to keep me longer but my mother does not have much money and insurance only could cover so much.  I am 16 years of age, my mother is the only near relative I have as we are immigrants from Latvia and the rest of my family is across the world. (Around 3 relatives there)

I currently live in the U.S. as you may have guessed, and have nothing I can work towards accomplishing.  I live in a small town, and I have no close friends, almost everyone in my school likes me but not enough to really care about me on a deeper level.  I dont want to sound like an angsty teen to all of you in the subreddit but I have nothing tying me down to where I live.  I was in the top of my class in academics but so I have straight F's.  The staff at my school could care less if I live or die and provide me with little help for my case.  I seem to always understand others but others never understand my life.  The same happened in the mental hospital where I had advice and could understand what problems other patients faced, however, my own problems seemed to be all patients combined but with increased severity.

I have constant headaches and stomach aches which my therapist and family doctor say are linked to anxiety. This seems to be the case.  The only relief I've had from the pain is when doing something requiring a lot of attention from me like playing video games, which I do not is healthy for me as I would sit alone playing them.  I do not know what I worry about as it seems I am unconsciously worrying about things in my life.  I grew up worrying about adult problems like losing my house or having to make money to bring food to the table.  My therapist says I have had a lot of loss and trauma in my life which cause these problems for me as I've just burrowed my problems deep inside myself, attempting to hide them away.

I live in a nice house and my mother works really hard so we do not have to worry like we used to.  However, I am ashamed of myself for being depressed when I have more than what I did when I was younger.  I also find myself being mean to other children at my school even though I do not understand how what I said was perceived as mean.  My therapist says it is common for smart people to have this problem where they say something factual and it hurts someones feelings because I dont tie emotions to facts or something like that.  This really hurts me inside when I do this as I do not want to be mean to those I care about, I have even done this to my own mother who is all I have.  Seeing others be hurt by what I say and not knowing what was the problem with the statement really grinds my gears, leaving me contemplating the situation I had been in.

I am very lost, and have no idea what I should do with my life.  I would excel in school before my condition became very severe, and now my mother is dissapointed in me as I am failing everything.  I do not have any reason to stay where I live currently, and I seem to lose interest in almost everything I used to be very passionate about.

I'm sorry that my thoughts are so scattered, I am very lost and I plead for some guidance to be sent my way.

Thank you",15Apr2019,1
775,"I don't deal well with emotional pain at all. I often have suicidal ideation when left alone with nothing to distract me. Crippling existential feelings and feeling like I can't get through to the other side, and how pointless it is to suffer. There are people who get dealt such shit in life, unimaginably worse than I've had so far, and they somehow overcome it. But I feel like I couldn't be that strong.

Since he will only drink from them, I make sure to empty and refill it every time he goes for it so I at least know it is fresh.

778,"So here's a trigger warning for anyone that this may bother. (Sexual assault)

So a bit of back ground information. I dated this guy, we'll call him D, off and on for a while. One day I went over to his place after school, this was when we were broken up but still decent friends. I was there with D, his brother we'll call Z, and my then best friend and Z's now ex, S. They aren't important people in this story.
Z and S went to Z's room to ""watch movies"" while D and I went to his room, (both side by side) to play video games. I was tired pretty tired after school so I got under the blanket to take a nap. D had never done anything (that i knew of at this time) to prove he was untrustworthy, we only broke up because we had busy lives. Anyway, I doze off, and I'm a very heavy sleeper so I didn't wake up till it was too late. He lifted my dress, moved my shorts, and shoved it in. I woke up, but before I could yell at him he said ""just go with it"" and held me down and my face was in the pillow. It finally ended and I was blank, I didn't know what to do, I looked over and D started crying. He held on to me, cried, and said ""I just raped you"" over and over again. This was so stupid of me, I held him and said ""it's okay, it was a misunderstanding"" or something like that, and stayed quiet for months. I found out he was cheating on me so I cut all contact with D and went on with my life. I was in denial and pushed what had happened out of my head the best I could. Later down the road I start hearing rumors that D had raped the 2 girls he cheated on my with. The first girl was too drunk to consent, and the other girl was at a party with him and they were dating but she didn't want sex. Obviously he did. We'll call the other 2 girls A and G. G was the first to come forward and I told her what had happened to me, we've been talking the past few weeks. A just made a report today. I'm still deciding.
So far D has pleaded guilty to G, he will be sentenced next month. All three of us want him to have a maximum punishment a minor can get.
Either way, I have a part in this because I'm a wittness. G and I confronted D a while ago and he admitted to raping both of us.
He's 17, I'm 17, G is 6, and A is 18.
Is there any way I can make a report without having to tell my parents? 
I'm absolutely terrified to tell my parents.",15Apr2019,2
779,"Okay before i start BF = best friend (not boyfriend i wish lol) and EF = ex-friend

So I’m gonna try and make this as short and vague as possible just in case one of them is reading this somehow.

Anyways, I went through this whole thing a few years ago where BF and EF started ditching me, which led me to stop hanging out with them and ignore them whenever they tried to say anything to me afterwards because honestly friends shouldn’t ditch each other and make each other feel left out.

Anyways, I completely cut all ties with EF and BF, but when the next school year started I noticed that BF and EF weren’t talking to each other anymore and that they both hung out with different people, so I took it as my chance to patch things up with BF.

Just a little context, me and BF have known each other for a LONG time and we only knew EF for about a year. I found out all the ditching stuff was EF’s idea from a friend of EF and wanted to fix things with BF since we’ve known each other for so long. Honestly, i think she just got caught in the moment and decided to go along with EF’s idea.

So we patched things up, but the fear of being ditched and left alone again stayed with me, and I still worry that BF might ditch me again even though I know I shouldn’t worry about it.

Anyways, we’ve been friends again for about a year now and things were good, but then, I found out BF and EF recently talked things out and that they’re friends again.

My feelings of worrying about being ditched again is now 5x worse and honestly I cant stop worrying about being ditched again.

I honestly don’t know what to do, so what would you guys do?",15Apr2019,2
780,"I’m (23F) struggle with mental illness a lot. I have borderline personality, depression, anxiety, and struggle with psychosis. I recently got laid off of my retail job, and instead of getting another one, I’ve been getting pressured to go to a trade school. I did okay at my retail job, because honestly, it was easy. I didn’t feel stressed out and managed okay. 

But everyone around me is saying to get on with my life. To do more with it. So I gave in and today I went to orientation for the trade school. Honestly when I was there I was having an out of body experience because I was getting stressed out. I start disconnecting with myself and my surroundings, which leads to a panic attack. 

I ended up signing up and paying the down payment, but I don’t know if I can do it. I don’t know if I’ll fail because of my mental health.

781,"Well, I just recently got engaged to my boyfriend we’re in a long distance relationship. We’re from 2 different countries so, we usually stay in our parent’s house if we’re visiting each other.

The thing is his sister is also living with the parents, she’s 16 years old and I swear she is the  girl human version of Satan. Being with her feels like I’m walking on eggshells. She is extremely rude and is the most disrespectful person I’ve ever seen in my whole entire life. She used to be nice to me but now, she insults me and say rude comments about me. I’ve been dealing with her bullshit for months now since I’m staying at my FH’s house for 9 months. My FH tried to call her out in front of their parents and it became a shitshow. The parents always got her back and they’re saying that it’s aaaall because of her disease (bitch got some autoimmune disease, eczema) that’s why she’s so rude. They justify every little nasty thing she does, like it’s normal. So, there’s no way that telling her parents about it, is going to help. She’s a spoiled brat and is soooooo jealous of everything. You can’t get the spotlight away from her, you can’t dress better than her when going out as well. Every time we go out, she will literally look at me from head to toe and judge whatever I’m wearing. She probably resents me for using her brother’s money for buying clothes and paying for medical reasons bcos I haven’t had a proper job yet. She is just aaaaaaall about MONEY, Kylie Jenner, and GUCCI. She wouldn’t stop ranting when I’m around how “broke” and “poor” they are NOW. It’s like she’s saying “gtfo bitch you’re just another mouth to feed, go home.” She doesn’t have friends and a social life that’s why she’s always inside the house. 

I suffer from anxiety and I swear this is the last thing I need in my life to stress and overthink about. How do I deal with her? I don’t want her to treat me like this forever. She’s making me cry every fricking night. She’s kind of affecting our relationship because it makes me question if I really want to deal with her behavior in the future. I mean she’s related to my fh and I want to get rid of her. ASAP. We can’t afford to move out yet so it sucks so much.",15Apr2019,2
782,"I can’t stop thinking and idk how to control it/lessen the thoughts. They’re mainly conversations in my head that I *just do* for some reason, they replay in my head and it’s usually me repeating it in different way like tonality (In me) and wording, to see what the other person says or does in turn. The person can be anyone and it’s al day everyday, hard for me to sleep sometimes because of it, sometimes won’t sneeze too lol. I day dream a lot too, lately it’s been consistent. I don’t know what to do and I hate the thoughts. Like I said they’re mainly conversations but they can have a twist to them. Sometimes it’s a way of me seeing how I can *get* my way, or get someone to back off. Sometimes violent. Any meds for this? Help! If you experience this too and have found a way to diminish them.

784,"Hey r/advice,

Today I had to break the news to my friend, and our wedding photographer, that we simply couldn't afford him for the wedding. I'm lost and don't know where I need to go from here. My fiance and I had money in savings we planned on using for wedding expenses and were under the impression we'd get more financial help from our parents for the wedding than we did. We ended up having to cover the majority of the costs of the wedding for ourselves out of pocket along with budget overruns on moving into our apartment.   


Long story short we originally planned for our friend from Ohio to drive to Virginia to do our wedding photos (Expenses Paid + $625 for 5 hours of photos.) Trust me, I know it's a great price by comparison to other professional photographers. He's not a photographer by trade, but is very talented and does it as a strong side-hustle. We realized in the end it was going to run us about $800, which we were willing to pay before we burned up our wedding savings on unexpected expenses. We realized there was no way we were going to be able to pay for rent (we don't make much), if we were having to have him do pictures. We ended up finding a less experienced photographer (someone we used to go to high school with) in Virginia who said they could do it for $125.  

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like it was such a dick move having to cancel, even though we aren't the closest of friends, we still were friends after all. I feel if I was in his shoes, I would be upset understandably too. I don't know how to convey how sorry I am with him or where I should take the conversation. I don't want to push it further and piss him off more. Would inviting him to come as a friend be insulting to him? Do you feel he's angry, or I am reading too much into it?  


Here is the exchange of texts between us.   


Me: "" Hey man,  
So \[fiance\] and I have to cancel pics for May 18th. We had to go with a cheaper option down in Virginia. I'm genuinely sorry I had to cancel on you, and really wish we could have stayed with you as the photographer, but things are very tight for us right now as we're paying the majority of the expenses for our own pocket for the wedding and we simply wouldn't have the money to pay you. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Him: ""Ok.""

786,"Been dealing with this for a few years now and I am at a loss on how to make a change that would result in a positive outcome. I have been able to hold jobs in the past but there was one in particular that got me really burnt out and depressed, started drinking heavily, the whole 9. I quit the job after a few years and lied about what the reason was for leaving at another interview as I was afraid of the idea of looking weak which ironically has made me look even weaker upon the new place of employment finding out about why I left in the first place. 

This has happened again and again when I have interviewed at new positions and is really wrecking my hopes of ever achieving anything. I just got another job and everything seems great during the interview phase but when i go to train, I get the cold shoulder from the people I have interviewed with less than a week prior.

I tried very hard to give an accurate depiction of why I left other jobs in the past without discussing the perceived warpath I feel I have left behind during this most recent interview but again, it is not working out. 

I feel self-destructive and I am considering pulling the plug strongly as it seems no matter what I do, someone has an issue with it and I cannot move forward. I have one person who I feel is genuinely a friend and I have my family who I know just wants me to get over this slump but I do not know what to do.

Overall Im at a point where I know I want to be a good person but I feel my past decisions I made are my downfall.

787,"Didn't think this would be my first post but it doesn't help that college decision day is May 1st 

I'm currently a senior in hs, graduating in about two months. The college I've wanted to go to has accepted me, and is only 30 minutes away from my house.

Bc I'd been so late into applying for housing, and we can't afford it anyway, I'm going to have to commute to school my freshman year.

Problem 1: my household of four technically only has one parent working(mom, dad,""disabled"" sibling)so we can only afford one car. My mom works out in the other direction of my future college .

Problem 2: I've had a fear of driving, and my parents overall keep forgetting to get me to practice. Also bc of transportation and money issues I never did driver's training. Sure once I'm 18(coming soon) I can just take the test, but there's kinda no point if I have no car bc we can't afford another at the moment 

Problem 3: My first ""solution"" to this was to contact the admissions people and move my start date to the winter instead of the fall, and get a job so I could save up to afford a car, but the reason I can't even get a job now is that my parents can't take me to my job

Problem 4: I'll have to talk about this to my parents again, but they WILL NOT allow me to take public transports(bus, taxi, cab, Uber, Lyft, etc.) And we don't know/trust anyone else going to this school, or in that area that could give me rides. I'd rather not be a burden to their lives

At this point, I may just have to transfer to a community college that's 15 minutes away...which may still bring the same problems I'm having now
