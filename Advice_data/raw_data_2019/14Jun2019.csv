0,"I'm 18 year old computer networking major and I'm looking for work. I've tried everything, man. I applied for every job position available, tailored my resume to be specifically for that company, I did extensive research on the company and looked up potential questions. I didn't over-prepare, but I didn't under-prepare either. I didn't act desperate. I wasn't the best-dressed person in the room but I looked fine enough (I'm on a tight budget). A big problem is that a lot of the entry level positions are so far away and I don't have a car or money to transit. I'm so sick of being poor. I applied to a technology store and in the interview I thought I did great. My answers showed sound knowledge of the product line and each answer demonstrated necessary skills for the position. I hate to be vague, because I don't want anyone to know about this. Does anyone have advice? I just want a job, but it's so hard to get one. They want someone who kisses ass at every opportunity.",14Jun2019,1
2,"TL;DR: I feel like shit and am at my wits end. I want to push through to the end but I feel so hopeless. Dunno what to do to keep myself going 

I'm in the last class I need to graduate. It's an accelerated course, only three weeks, but it's four hours every day, an hour online lab, I have my second midterm tomorrow, and my final next Friday. 

On top of that I just had to stop contacting my mom because I've recently understood just how manipulative and abusive she is (for so long I was entertaining the idea that it was just a momentary blip, but it just kept getting worse), not to mention I've not been speaking to my father for five years (also very abusive. Fun fun). 

My brother is also on the path to realizing how fucked up our parents are and I'm seeing him go through this and it breaks my heart. 

On top of all of THAT I have a chronic illness which leaves me exhausted, aching, and uncomfortable pretty well 24/7. I have asthma and there's a lot of air pollution because of wildfires up north, and I can't afford my meds. 

I have a whopping 87 cents in the bank and two weeks til payday. 

My thoughts have been getting quite dark lately too. That little voice in my head saying ""give up"" and giving suggestions on how to...

I broke down and cried for three hours, in a cycle of feeling sorry for myself and feeling guilty for not studying.",14Jun2019,2
3,"Today has been a rough day. My family is extremely verbally abusive, mainly my brother and my stepmother. It honestly makes my depression a million times worse and makes me contemplate things. 

I am currently in my 3rd semester of college after this semester I have one more so I‚Äôll be graduating in December. The degree I‚Äôm going for would allow me an easier route into getting into my job field easier. However if I got into the job field and stayed with a job for a little that would be about the same as the degree. 

At the end of this year I am planning on moving to be closer to my fianc√©. I‚Äôm really debating on just dropping out of college if I can get a good job offer and move there ASAP like within the next month. 

The cost of living is to high where I am for me to be able to afford anything besides a cardboard box on a beach. The apartments here even on the cheaper side is almost 3 times what the apartments cost where I would move to. 

I just don‚Äôt know anymore. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can take their yelling and their threats. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can take of the uncertainty. I‚Äôve been doing well at hiding my fear lately, hiding how much my brain has become damaged over the past few months alone. I‚Äôm doing so well my fianc√© doesn‚Äôt really notice anymore that I haven‚Äôt been eating as well anymore because I‚Äôm afraid to cook food in the kitchen or even go upstairs to go out of the house past them. 

Should I drop out of college and take the Chance? 

Or should I risk it and try for the next 6 months?

Sorry about the rambling, my brain is all over the place",14Jun2019,1

Sorry if this is a long story I just felt context was needed.

When I was in sixth form (last 2 years of secondary school) I ended up becoming good friends with a girl who I shared the same free lessons with. Every Friday, we‚Äôd have 4 hours free in the afternoon and we would talk the whole time and we‚Äôd never get bored.

at the start of our last year of school she got a mutual friend to tell me that she really liked me. I was completely shocked at first, I think incredibly lowly of myself that I would never ever assume anyone could be attracted to me. Ever. 

A combination of fear and uncertainty about my feelings for her lead me to behave very stupidly, I remember the first day back at school after I found out she liked I literally sprinted away when I saw her in the corridor and hid in the toilet cubicle. I didn‚Äôt talk to her for a week, not because I meant to, but I would just freeze up in fear. 

I realised I did actually really, really like her but I had never had anyone reciprocate feelings for me in my life. We‚Äôre both girls, I was always used to having crushes on straight girls who I knew I‚Äôd never have to worry about liking me back so when this amazing girl actually initiated me, I didn‚Äôt know how to respond.

But I was so afraid because I was so insecure and felt that I wasn‚Äôt good enough for her that I just made her think that I didn‚Äôt like her. She was literally the prom queen at school, got great grades, could sing, was beautiful, and I felt like nothing compared to her. I would have felt guilty being in a relationship with her.

Just over a week after she told me she liked me, we almost slept together on her 18th birthday but stopped because 2 of our friends barged in drunk and got into bed with us (they didn‚Äôt know what was going on) and we never spoke about it since. It left this very awkward palpable tension on our friendship that wouldn‚Äôt go away. I could only talk to her when I was drunk, in school I felt so insecure around her that I could hardly make a conversation.

I haven‚Äôt seen her in 2 years, and she‚Äôs doing a year abroad at university so I won‚Äôt see her for another year. But I‚Äôve never stopped thinking about her, how close we were and how we would never get sick of talking to each other. We have all the same morals and political beliefs. There were so many wonderful moments i had with her that just play through my head everyday. 

We were very different in personality, but we balanced each other out. She brought me out of my shell. But we were the same in all the ways that mattered. The worst thing about being a lesbian is how hard it is to find someone you click with that will like you back, and that also shares the same beliefs as you. And she had it all and I didn‚Äôt realise it.

I know I hurt her a lot because I would be very dismissive towards her because I was so scared. But she never tried to hurt me back even though she thought I hated her. 

I‚Äôm not necessarily trying to initiate a relationship with her, I‚Äôd be fine just being friends because I just miss her so much but I‚Äôll be going to university in a city hours away from where she lives next year so I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs worth it. I don‚Äôt know what to say to her, I‚Äôm not looking to declare my love for her, but asking ‚Äúhey let‚Äôs be friends‚Äù to a person you haven‚Äôt seen in year and lives hours away from you just seems dumb? Help me out here.",14Jun2019,1

6,"My brother has been emotionally unstable for most of his life. Every time he has a major problem in his life he reflects it onto another family member, this can either be through assault, threating to hurt us or by manipulating us.

He had recently severed connections with all his and my friends because he was against everyone in an argument he had with one of my friends. Over the past few weeks he has been manipulating me and my parents psychology into believing that my friends talk behind my back and are chronic drug addicts (he knows I have slight paranoia and knows he can benefit from this)

Over the past few days I have become emotionally unstable and have gone back into a depression due to this situation causing me to just overthink things.

So, for 70% of the year we aren‚Äôt together in person also she made plans in March and I just came back for the summer in the middle of May. I confronted her about it today and she said I never went but she has lied to me about multiple things before small or big. Also, around that time she said she was done with me, she wanted to break up but decided otherwise. So, I personally believe its cheating. And I‚Äôm thinking about ending the relationship.

16,"I have thoughts I find reprehensible sometimes. I got in a big fight with my family today, and in my mind, I thought of how good it would feel to hire an arsonist to burn down the house with all of them inside, or hire someone to run my dad off the road while he's driving to work, or have a hitman line my parents, sisters, and brother up execution style and just off them all one by one with a shotgun. I've noticed that a lot of these have me hiring someone to do the dirty work for me instead of doing it myself, and I think maybe that's that tiny sliver of me that's still a decent person trying to get me to stop thinking about this. I obviously won't do it, but the biggest reason is the legal consequences and not me actually caring about anyone in my family. I honestly don't know how I can sleep at night after justifying these types of things.

I guess what I'm asking is basically how to make this stop so I can actually stand thinking again, because I know for a fact normal people don't think about things like this.",14Jun2019,1

after doing both for a little while my part time job tells me i either have to work full time or be let go.
so i decided to go to school full time and wait until i have a diploma to look for a better job.
well today on the way to school i was pulled over for going 41 in a 25. I was also ticketed for not having a license.
well my car is a real piece of work so my speedometer and just about every other meter doesn‚Äôt work on it. 
nevertheless i messed up so i know i deserve the tickets.
after returning home i checked the mail and saw i received a letter from the irs about paying my taxes from my construction job.
i have enough saved to pay for either a lawyer for my speeding ticket and no license ticket.

or pay some of my taxes
i‚Äôm not sure if i can pay part of my taxes but this is why i‚Äôm asking on this thread
i have no clue what to do

21,"Hello, I'm posting because I'm quite shy and don't know how to handle being cut throat when it comes to business, and therefore am not sure how to proceed.  I graduated college recently and moved to California. I'm a writer, and therefore was connected to a possible freelance client. Get ready for this difficult relationship connection: The freelance client is the sperm donor father (and friend) of my sister's husband's sister. (Me &gt; My sister &gt; Her husband &gt; His sister &gt; Her sperm donor/father of her child).

I had never met this man before, and had only met his ""baby mama"" (my brother-in-law's sister) a few times since my sister got married to her husband. The ""baby mama"" connected us, I sent my resume and writing samples to baby daddy, he did a phone interview, and then gave me some freelance copy writing work. In 2018 I did about 10 total projects for him. 

The copywriting business he owns caters to the film industry, which slows down towards the end of the calendar year and during the Oscars. I emailed him following up for more work in January, and he got back to me right away and said he would have stuff soon for me. 

I emailed him again in February, and he said the same thing. In March, I was leery to email again, but he enthusiastically said ""Yes, thank you for keeping up with me, I'm working on \*XXXX Confidential Movie\* so get a head start reading the book it's based on, and I'll email you soon with the project.""  I said thank you so much, I'd get started right away, and he never got back to me. 

In April or early May I emailed AGAIN following up, and got no response this time. I'm just confused, because he told me that he was glad I was keeping up with him, and seemed encouraging in the last email he got to me. At this point, I'm not sure if he's intentionally blowing me off, or he genuinely is too busy and hasn't responded. I mean, he does own a marketing company in Los Angeles, but I also don't want to embarass myself if he is ignoring me. 

My sister gets in my business (love her, but she does) and she brought it up to baby mama. Baby mama said that Baby daddy is busy and frazzled all the time, and is blunt enough to say if he didn't have any more work for me/didn't think it was going to work out.

23,"I want to preface this post by explaining the situation and then I will provide details about our relationship and her relationship with her parents.  This is also a very long post but I believe all the information to be pertinent.

When my girlfriend was around 8 years old, her mom and dad were in a rocky part of their relationship so my girlfriends' mother reached out to her sister, in order to house them.  My girlfriends' aunt has a son who is 24 years old which is 3 years older than my girlfriend and myself.  During this period and years after, my girlfriend was repeatedly molested and raped by her cousin (Whom I will refer to as POS).  From what she told me, she repeatedly asked him to stop when it first started but he threatened to tell his mom and her mom that she would get in trouble if she ever did.  One important thing to note is that my girlfriends' mom has always been very protective of her and her siblings (i.e. no sleepovers, no boyfriends or phones, and at one point she even went as far as to not let her shave any hair on her body for unknown reasons).

&amp;#x200B;

Another important tidbit of information is that my girlfriends' mom and her sister barely rekindled their relationship a couple of years ago.  My girlfriends' aunt is also a very stubborn person so if she disagrees with something, it usually ends up in a huge fight.  My girlfriend fears that if she tells her parents it will lead to a fight between her mom and her aunt and it will cause a divide in the family.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I mention the strictness of her mom is because my girlfriend also does not want to tell her parents for fear that they won't believe her when she tells them.  I have told her countless times that even if her mother does not believe her, her father definitely will and he will talk sense into her mom and their relationship will not be affected.  I have always supported my girlfriend with this matter and I will continue to do so no matter what happens with her family.  My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years and have known each other for 4 and we are very comfortable around each other's families.  Since my girlfriends' mom is oblivious to the events that transpired years ago, she often invites POS everywhere and anywhere and I have to avoid him completely for fear of losing my temper since he has this smug facade that makes it seem like nothing ever happened.  Her mother has noted previously that I avoid POS and that I should be nicer to him whenever he's around.  POS also knows that I know which is why he tends to avoid me which makes my girlfriends mom think we hate each other and this, in turn, makes my girlfriend uncomfortable for fear that the past will reveal itself accidentally.

&amp;#x200B;

I have known this information about my girlfriend and POS for 2 years and we have decided to wait until she is ready to talk to her parents.  Previously I was completely fine with this arrangement since this whole situation must be very stressful and she probably doesn't want to think about it.  A couple of weeks ago she showed me a video of a woman and her mom who went through the same situation and they were discussing how it went and that it was for the best.  Despite this video, my girlfriend recently told me that she does not plan on ever telling her parents what happened and that it will go with her to her grave which means she wants me to forget about it as well.  She is also currently seeing a therapist about some depression and anxiety which I believe resulted from this trauma (her therapist has also advised that she tell her parents).  I really really don't want to let POS get away with doing this to her and pretending that it never happened.  I know that I should respect her decision but it hurts me to see it affecting her to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently both attending university really far from her parents but we will be visiting them next month.  I have not decided whether I want to do it or not, but I plan on pulling her dad aside when we're alone and letting him know everything in the most respectable way possible.  Should I go through with it and if not, what should I do?  Like I said, I really don't want my girlfriend to keep it a secret forever but it's not necessarily my decision.",14Jun2019,6
24,"This is my first, and hopefully only post, so I apologise if I'm doing anything against etiquette.


Recently, my aunt past away young, at 52. Growing up, I watched as she slowly began ruining my mother's like with her drug abuse. She never treated myself, or my mother right, and on occasion threatened my mother with physical violence. I've been attempting to distance myself from this side of the family, since the majority of them are incredibly toxic towards myself, and my mother. After another death in the family, she, along with my grandfather, and other members of my family, haven't spoken to me in two and a half years. My aunt and my mother had only started talking to one another again because my grandma was diagnosed with ALS. My aunt hadn't spoken to my grandma for 20 years before this.  (For context, my grandparents are divorced and absolutely hate each other, and I'm very close with my grandma, while, as stated above, my grandpa hasn't spoken to me). My aunt was obviously not interested in my grandma's well being, and she was only in it for the inheritance. Constantly asking her for jewlery and even going as far as stealing house keys. 

Now that she has passed away, personally, I don't feel much grief or sadness, my my mother is absolutely destroyed with grief. I feel like I should go for her, but at the same time, she was such a grossly awful person towards her and myself, it goes against everything I stand for. I understand the idea of going to pay my respects to other family members, but none of them hold a lot of respect for me, and personally, I feel the same way about them. It feels like a lose lose situation, and any major advice would be greatly appreciated.",14Jun2019,1

27,"Every year, my high school holds an athletic competition which concludes at our end of the year pep rally. Pretty much all the fit students partake in this event every year, and I‚Äôve won the past 3 years (freshmen, sophomore, &amp; junior yr). I‚Äôm a graduating senior this year so all I needed was one more win to pull off the ‚Äòdynasty‚Äô.

I would also get additional scholarship money if I won again. Everything was going great, I had assumed I was well on my way to a fourth straight title to cap off my high school career but then a tall, boney sophomore girl started mowing through all of the other top candidates. She ended up making the championship where she would face of against me. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, as I had figured there‚Äôs no way a young girl would beat the experienced senior guy. 

I lost. This scrawny little girl beat me to win the trophy and scholarship money. The worst part is all my friends and fellow classmates saw it. I‚Äôm so humiliated. I‚Äôm not very used to losing and I know I probably sound like a spoiled brat but I just can‚Äôt get over the fact that only one person, a girl of all people, stood between me and my destiny. 

I‚Äôm depressed and embarrassed to go out where everyone can see me and mock me. I feel like a giant loser. I was suppose to win this. Instead, the worst possible outcome happened. I lost to a total unknown and that person was a girl. It‚Äôs humiliating.

It‚Äôs already been over a week since I lost and all I can think about is her holding that trophy up. I can‚Äôt get over this. I‚Äôve tried to think about other things but I just can‚Äôt. I honestly feel like I don‚Äôt even wanna live anymore. I have lost my desire to do anything. I don‚Äôt want to go out in public where peers can see me and remind me of the humiliation. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",14Jun2019,1
28,"Hello Reddit. I would like some advice and opinion on a situation. 

A few months ago I was standing on a train station and a train conductor drove by and wink, catcalled, and said verbally inappropriate things. I felt this action was very unacceptable, unprofessional, and inappropriate and submitted a complaint. At first the public transit company didn't respond to my complaint but I insisted on one. I have since received a response from a superintendent apologizing and stating that the incident will be referred to labor relations recommending further discipline. The superintendent also asked my willingness and availability for an administrative hearing in the future to provide a formal account of the events that transpired and identify the conductor.  I gave them time, train cart #, location, and description of the person but they state that in order to physically identity the employee, my presence is needed.The employee will also be allow legal representation from the union and my testimony will be public. 

 I bought this up to my boyfriend and close family members. Although they all agree that the train conductor behavior is shitty and inappropriate, some of them are concern for my safety and time. They point out that I would be wasting my time and there won't be much end result. Boyfriend is concern that if the employee decide to take revenge and I would be in danger. I'm not sure if I want to proceed with this especially after reading articles like this: [https://nypost.com/2019/06/08/mta-bus-driver-suspensions-surge-but-drivers-rarely-fired/](https://nypost.com/2019/06/08/mta-bus-driver-suspensions-surge-but-drivers-rarely-fired/)

29,"Hi everyone,
So I am currently working at a place where I am a consultant.

I technically as the boss say am right under the director even though my title does not say that. 
I get paid about $1.50 more then other consultants and do not get paid holidays or commission as other consultants do. 
My director gets paid holidays, get paid more then me and I do the same exact work as her and the boss teaches me exactly the same as her. 
My questions is since I do not get paid the same as her, do not get paid holidays and my status is a consultant not a manager as it would be under her. Should I ask why I don‚Äôt get paid commission. 
I‚Äôm just confused should I be grateful or ask for my part. 
I‚Äôm very bold usually but for some reason due to past issues I have become very shy and humble and unfortunately feel like I‚Äôm not standing up for myself.
WHat and how would fellow redditers advise me?",14Jun2019,1
30,"It‚Äôs not as simple as blocking a number either, as most of the calls are mirrored off of other numbers. For example, my number starts with 637, and I will get tons of calls from other numbers starting 637-xxxx but with different four digit combinations. If I call these numbers back, it goes to a random person who has no idea what I‚Äôm talking about. I‚Äôve also received calls from people asking why I called them when they are in my situation.

Additionally, I get out of state calls, which also hop around different numbers and area codes that say they are with the FBI and Social Security Service.

Does anyone have any recommendations as to how I can start to prevent these calls? It‚Äôs starting to get absolutely ridiculous.

31,"A few weeks ago I asked my friend to help me out with a girl, lets call her Grace. He said he was friends with her and would ask her what she thought of me. She said she thought I was really hot and wanted me to start snapchatting her. I had a lot of schoolwork that week so I told my friend I'd wait to talk to her later. A few days later my friend told me she was freaking out and really wanted me to start talking to her, but I didnt want to make a move yet.

That weekend I was at home when a kid I dont talk to much snapchatted me and told me to come over to this girls house because Grace was there and wanted to talk to me. This terrified me because I'm horrible at talking to most people, especially girls, but I decided that I had to go. So I went, and it was awkward at first, but then we were alone for a bit and just talked and it went really well. Same sense of humor, funny, nice and was just really chill. I ended up driving her and her friend home, and when Grace left I talked to her friend and she said ""I know you guys didnt hook up but at least you talked"" and I actually had no problem with it. Grace sent me a snapchat right after a dropped her off and we continuously talked for days.

A few days later I was complaining about this English assignment we had due and she was in the same class. She offered to help, but I knew she wasn't great at English so I just said its okay but she insisted so I finally let her help and said ""I know this sucks I'm a dumbass"" and she replies ""you can be the cute dumbass that entertains me while I look at this by calling me."" I really didn't want to so I said that I'd walk around school with her the next day. The rest of the night she kept calling me cute and it kinda made me uncomfortable and I was contemplating the whole thing. But the next day I still met her because I didnt want to ghost her and we talked for a while. Later, she asked me to come over to study for the ACT and I said sure. For the next few days, I'd ask her every other class or something if she wanted to meet, and most of the time she said yes. She seemed like she really wanted to talk to me so I thought she'd like it. After talking with her for a while, I decided I actually liked her and was happy I started talking to her.

So a few days later I go over to her house and meet her parents and we study for a while, nothing really happened; we just studied and I helped her with a few math questions, then I left. Before I left I asked if she could walk me to my car because I thought that she invited me over for a reason. She said she had to pack for a tournament and go to sleep for the test, so I said that was fine. She said that she ""pinky promised"" we could hang out again soon and hugged me.

The next morning I text her good luck before the test, and she texted back a while after, then a longer while after. She was at a tournament so I thought little of it. I snapped her again because we were about to lose our streak, and she left that on open and never replied to my text. I then thought something was up.

The next week at school, at lunch we made eye contact and I kinda picked up my phone and pointed to it to ask her to text me later. She never did, so later that day I texted her asking if her phone was broken. She said that she was trying to use her phone less because of finals and sports, which I said was okay and she could text me if she wanted to talk. The next day, I was walking around with my friend who helped me with Grace. Our school has a massive window on the upper floor that looks into the gym, and I saw one of my good friends in there so I went up to it and waited for him to see me. And of course, Grace is right there too. I instantly move over, hoping she doesn't see me, and my friend sees her and points to me. I knew that looked really bad, but I didn't think it meant much. At the end of the day, her class was right next to mine so I thought it might be a good idea to wait for her and ask her if she was okay. I waited for her and when she saw me she looked so unhappy to see me, but I went up and asked if we could talk for a second. She said ""No i have a meeting right not"". I literally laughed out loud and said she could call me later. She never did.

The next day, I was talking to the same friend that helped me out with her. She said she had told him something but he couldn't tell me. I asked if it leaned towards her wanting to break things off with me and he said yes. He said there's a chance that I could still pull her back in but didn't explain what he meant. The only thing he told me was that she thought it was creepy how I waited for her after class.

I've been replaying everything I've done with her or said to her for the past two days but cannot understand what could've possibly happened in the 2 days we didn't see each other to make her change her mind so quickly. Should I just wait for her to reach out? Should I just forget about her? Should I wait until schools over? I'm just worried shell never text me or talk to me and I'll continue wondering how I messed up. I've had girls do stuff like this to me before and they've ended up coming back but this time I see no mistake I made or that I could have made. I'm just so confused.",14Jun2019,2

36,"Okay, so it's probably stupid but several months ago I met this person online, let's call them Elliot. After just a few days, it felt like we had known each other for years. But Elliot was really needy and they took over my life. Their problems were all I could think about and they relied on me for everything all day, everyday. 

I really care about Elliot, but they are a lot to handle. Anyway, about two months ago, Elliot told me that they had met a girl and needed to keep that part of their life private. After that, we lost contact, completely. Not a word for two months. I was really hurt, and I hate to say that I was a little relieved. Elliot was a lot even though I really cared for them. Yesterday, they sent me a text saying ""I'm really, really sorry."" 

I don't want to hurt them but have no idea what to say. It's probably stupid, but I'm really scared that if I ask them to leave me be then I'll hurt Elliot. They are really fragile and have had a lot of trauma in their past. I really don't know what to say to make sure that they aren't going to get upset.

37,"Background knowledge:
I hate being a cliche 8th grader getting involved with relationship things but here we go. I‚Äôm a gay male in 8th grade goin into high school next year. My crush (I‚Äôll say C for short) has known me for a long time and has been in most of my classes through middle school, however I‚Äôm not in his main friends group. I don‚Äôt know his sexuality because that‚Äôs typically a weird thing to bring up into a conversation.
Here‚Äôs the actual story/thing I need advice on:
Lately this year C has been showing me like some ‚Äúaffection‚Äù if it even is affection. He talks to me way more, or just more ‚Äúphysical‚Äù w/ me. I just really like his personality and he‚Äôs basically just my type. But like I said before I have NO clue if he‚Äôs gay or not. The last day of school is next Tuesday and we probably won‚Äôt be hangin out that much over summer (because our hobbies contrast each other a lot [he‚Äôs a sports person, I‚Äôm really artistic and stuff]). And I won‚Äôt be seeing him in high school as often because- 
1. I take all honors and he doesn‚Äôt so no regular classes together
2. Different electives aka more classes we aren‚Äôt together in
I want to be able to confess but not ruin our really good friendship. Or just be able to be near him more. Helpppp!!!
(Sorry if there‚Äôs some typos and if it‚Äôs kind of vague, I‚Äôll reply with more info if needed)

39,"One of my best friends of 11 years has recently informed me that he uses WiFi to connect his GAMING PC to his home router, this so-called friend has been using Virgin Media Fibre optic broadband. (Which by the way, is fibre optic to the router)  


I don't think this kind of behaviour is in any way tolerable, now my whole existence has come under question. Any time he said he didn't 'see' something, was it just the internet warping his view of the world? Was it dropped packets from the unstable 5 GHz connection he uses? He has informed me since that he's having issues with Counter-Strike Global Offensive, where the 'net\_graph' would be red, 'is that alright?' he said with gusto.

41,"Sorry if I over-share, I just want you to get a good context of the situation.

So I'm a 20 year old male living with a lesbian couple who are my best friends. I love them both dearly and would never want to hurt them in anyway. We'll call the one girl Sam and the other one Taylor. So I'm living with these girls because they took me in when I was in a really rough situation. And we've been living together for about a month now. We've known each other for about 6 month and we met over a video game online. I have a hard time believing that they actually care about me though, due to many reasons, I'm not sure how many of those reasons are just in my head though. But anyway. They both work night shifts. And I dont really sleep during the night, so I frequently spend the night hanging out with them on their off days. Sam has more off days then Taylor, so I spend alot more time with Sam. And I feel I'm alot closer to her. And I always thought i was very nice to her. Cause 1. I hold women in very high respect. And 2. Shes my best friend and I love her, and would never want to be mean to her. But last night, we were texting while she was at work, and i was telling her about this lump i found in my armpit. And she was like gross. And then i made a joke about body positivity.  And then she said, ""yea, cause you make me feel great about my body"" and I was thrown aback. And asked her what she meant. And she basically said that I upset in regards to these situations 

1. Sam just got artificially inseminated a few days earlier. And there's only like a 10% chance shes pregnant.  But she keeps going around a pulling her stomach out and saying that shes pregnant.  And I joking said that it looks like shes already got a baby bump. Obviously as a joke. And I've told her on multiple occasions that she is 100% not fat

2. One night I made a comment about how I thought I could smell someone's breath, but I said that it wasnt a bad smell. And I have a good nose so I can pick up smells from further away than most. And I even said later that it probably wasnt even someones breath. But she took that as I could smell her stinky breath from across the room.

3. They always talk about taking their bras off as soon as they get home. And yesterday I asked if it was healthy to keep your bra off for so long. Cause I was under the impression that breast will get saggy, so I was just curious. Her answer was that they were going to get saggy anyway. And I didnt give it another thought.  But in her text she said "" and for what ever reason you decided to look at my boobs and make a comment on them"" ( this one kills me the most, cause now I feel like shes under the impression that I sit there and stare at her breasts and judge them like some sort of pervert.

4. She said that I tell her bad stuff that other people say about her when It should be obvious that she doesnt want to hear about it. And the only thing I can think of that she could be talking about was me telling one of my other online friends about their pregnancy attempt and I was getting all excited.  But this friend said that they shouldn't be doing that and it was a crime against nature. And that there was a reason that 2 women cant have a baby. And this upset me. So I just vented to them about it. And they said that some people will believe what they want and there's nothing you can do about it. And so I thought that it didnt bother them at all. But apparently I was wrong

And I  was under the impression that I was so far beneath them that nothing I could say would effect them in that way. Like they're both so beautiful and confident.  I didn't think someone like me could say anything to bring them down. But Sam said that she  told Taylor how I made her feel and said that Taylor wanted to kill me, but she told her to stay in bed and not to come out into the living room. As to not to blow up on me. And I immediately packed my things and left. I dont have a car so I was walking. And then it started pouring. So I took cover underneath a store arch way and eventually feel asleep. Got woken up with a kick to the ribs by a cop saying I couldn't sleep there. He said I could sleep at the station tonight and in the morning, he can take me to the next city over. Where they have homeless shelters. About a half hour before he was supposed to take me, me and Sam started talking. I told her I was leaving and she kept saying that I  wasnt leaving until she can take me someone or by me like a bus ticket or something. And I tried to apologize, and explain what I meant by all those things she took offense with. But she just wasnt having it. Then I tried to say about how they make fun of me as well, like they call me ""bitch baby"" sometimes. And I struggle with my masculinity so that really bothers me, so I thought it would be good time to bring it up. And I was trying to explain why I struggle with my masculinity so much. And I believe its because I was raped from 8 years old to 12 years old. And it made me question my sexuality for a bit. And I told her that. And she said that I'm always throwing the fact that i was raped in her face and using it as an excuse.  But I honestly dont know what shes talking about. The only times I bring it up is when she says things like "" how do you know you're not gay if you haven't tried it"" (she wants me to be gay for some reaosn) and I tell her that I did try it when I was raped. That's the only other time I've brought it up. 

She eventually told me to come home and I did and immediately went into my room. And then we texted back and forth a bit more. And I asked if there was anything I could do to make this up to her, and she said to stop hiding in my room. Then a few hours later she messaged me. Asking if I was gonna be hiding in my room all day. And I said ""do you expect me to just come out there and pretend like everthing is fine"" and she said yeah, cause everything is fine. But I honestly dont feel like it is. She never said she forgave me or anything. And I tried to explain the things away so that I dont seem like a bad person. Cause I honestly never meant any of the things like she took them but she wouldn't have any of it. And now I honestly want to kill myself out of guilt. I was under the impression that even though im worthless and ugly and black and all these other bad things, that I was always a nice guy. Like I thought I was always extremely nice to girls especially her. But now after last night i just feel like a pervert and a scum bag. I feel like there's nothing good in me left, and I don't know what to do. I'm home alone now with Taylor,  but shes sleeping and I'm staying in my room. I don't know what I should say to Taylor. And I just honestly don't know what to do. I fear I might kill myself soon. I feel so guilty.

Oh. And just another piece if information. I have found that I don't compliment them as much as I would like, and I think its due to the fact I might have fallen in love with both of them. And i fear if I be too honest with my compliments they might find out. Like I'll say they look pretty sometimes. But not as often as I would like",14Jun2019,1
42,"I apologize in advance if this is the wrong place to post this. I am part of facilitates maintenance at a small private college. We are currently in the process of upgrading our surveillance cameras throughout campus...including installing them in each classroom. We had a head of security that handled this, but he abruptly quit, leaving me to handle this.

My question is in regards to the art classrooms. I know in several of the classes that they use nude models. I am curious to hear if anyone can tell me how their campuses handle these classrooms. On one hand, it seems insecure to exempt the art classrooms from having cameras, but on the other hand, seems it might not be appropriate to have them when a nude model is present. Unfortunately, the ceilings in these rooms are about 15 feet high, so temporary measures like covering them when in use wouldn't be practical.

Long story short I graduated from university a year ago and the last 12 months have been bad. I‚Äôve been unemployed due to various reasons(10% my fault, 90% not). But even in my last year of uni I had this feeling of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting old and is it too late to achieve the things I want‚Äù or ‚Äúmy youthful days are over now‚Äù.
Funny thing is when I was a teenager I couldn‚Äôt wait to go university and be an adult because my teenage years sucked. Yet my brain is making feel nostalgic about those years and making me feel depressed.

It doesn‚Äôt help that all my high school and college friends are doing really well in their relationship life, financial etc. And I‚Äôm over here single and unemployed(again don‚Äôt want to go into detail but I went through health problems etc so not my fault).

Also to note, I‚Äôve been babied my entire life by my mum. Mostly due to my dad passing away when I was 5 years old. My mum always felt the need to make everything easier for me. So as 23 year old man I‚Äôve never had any responsibilities.

My question is am I feeling like this because I know deep down I have to face the responsibilities of life? And that is making me uncomfortable so I‚Äôm thinking about the little good about my teenage years.

Well... surprise surprise we've gotten fat. Part of my gaining weight was because of a medication I was taking, but I also wasn't eating a low calorie diet. My friend just eats a lot and indulgent things.

A while ago she told me that she had scarily high cholesterol. She tried eating better but her levels didn't decrease. It's like have a heart attack bad. 

Right now she's in New York for work for the next two months and she's pigging out. Pizza, Mc Donald's, mac &amp; cheese. All sorts of good stuff. Not heart friendly things all.

Anyway, tonight she made a comment about mac &amp; cheese for dinner and I just had a pang in my chest thinking about her cholesterol. I was wondering if it'd be in my place to bring it up?  I'm successfully dieting so I'm hyper aware of what people are eating. 

Should I say something? Like I'm worried about her health? She's a grown woman and knows how to eat healthy if she wants to. I've mentioned how much portion control has helped me, but I don't know if I should flat out ask her to eat better.

I dont know what to do as the school is not believing me for not having any involvement as the ""witnesses"" basically just picked on everyone in that corner of the room (my desk is literally behind the pc btw). Im really stressing out right now as this could affect my final average which could potentially cause my offers from university to be taken away. Mind you i have never even received a copy of the exam nor have i ever even touched the pc i was just simply a bystander to the whole situation yet im being treated as one of the main suspects even after i came and talked to the teacher/principal of what exactly happened. If anything needs to be clarified please comment and ill try to clear up any misunderstandings.",14Jun2019,1
48,"Hi Reddit, there's a cute girl I've see at my gym the past two months. Her and I make eye contact alot and I have seen her staring at me before. I think she has interest in me too, but I don't know how to talk to this girl. 

I feel super creepy and super wrong trying to pick up girls at the gym and normally would get over my infatuation. But she's just wife material, what do I do?",14Jun2019,1
49,"So I‚Äôm in a small city in BC, Canada. I‚Äôm very far from Vancouver (15 hour drive or so), but I don‚Äôt want to be here. 

A few complications: 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm mature enough to live on my own, I‚Äôm not organized or responsible enough to handle life without my crappy parents. I only hit puberty like 8 months ago, so my brain‚Äôs development is delayed by a few years. 

I can‚Äôt apply to any university for what I want to do, because I‚Äôm missing a course that I need (Chem 12). I originally was planning on taking it, but then I decided I wanted to be an architectural engineer, and I wouldn‚Äôt need it. Then I changed my mind again, I want to do computer science (hopefully at UVIC), but I now need Chem 12. I only started last week, and I don‚Äôt think I will finish it in time to submit an application for regular acceptance. 

Some major reasons I want to leave:

I don‚Äôt get along with my parents, they have horrible parenting skills (source: they were too hard on my oldest brother, who is now an alcoholic and is going through a divorce from a woman who abused him like crazy and forced him to give her a baby, and he wouldn‚Äôt have ended up in this relationship if he was raised with a proper support system from our parents. I‚Äôm scared I am heading down the same path, which is why I might stay an extra year). I fight with both of them, usually it‚Äôs me ‚Äòdefying‚Äô their outrageous standpoints. Sometimes I will get ‚Äòadvice‚Äô from one of them, and I‚Äôll tell them that their advice is irrelevant in our modern world, and I‚Äôll give examples from credible sources, which they view as rebellious. 

I hate my job - I‚Äôm a shop bitch for a mechanical and hydraulical repair shop in town. This is obviously useless as far as work experience goes; it contributes nothing to the skills I need when considering teamwork (the dynamic is very different in a shop compared to the average office from what I understand), as well as the actual content of what I‚Äôm doing; sometimes minor mechanical repairs, mostly cleaning floors and driving around town to get parts vs. learning how to code and everything else that goes with computer science. The biggest problem with my job, however, is that I work for my dad. My dad is not a pleasant boss, and he is very hard on me for things I have no control over. Additionally, my brother works there (he‚Äôs taken the first two of the four levels of commercial transport technician education) and he‚Äôs very hard on me for the same reasons, and it influences all of the other employees there. 

This town itself sucks. It‚Äôs an oilfield town, so there‚Äôs a lot of dirty money and not a lot to do when you‚Äôre not working (little to no extracurricular activities to be a part of). 

What should I do??? I don‚Äôt know whether to stick it out for one more year, then go to school down south, or move down south and work for a year before going to uni. Or is there a third option I‚Äôm not seeing?",14Jun2019,1
50,"SO I (F22) live with my brother (M22), my best friend (F20) and two other girls (F22), (F21). Caitlyn (F21) is a girl I met through work and really hit it off with. We all moved in at the same time (give or take a couple weeks) and almost immediately suspicions were aroused as food started to disappear. Things really began when my brother moved in, as he cooks a lot. He came into my room, absolutely dumbfounded as to how an entire block of cheese he had bought had dropped off the face of the planet. It wasn‚Äôt like there was half left in the fridge, or the packet in the bin, or it was on someone else‚Äôs pantry shelf... it was just gone. He also noted that a pot was missing, and my best friend, Anna (F20) noted that a full bottle of her chili oil was gone as well. We were all baffled, as these were such unusual items to go astray. 

HOWEVER. Caitlyn divulged to me just before she moved in that she was severely anorexic and had been in treatment for about five years. I was concerned and sympathetic, and quietly worried about her moving in, as I personally struggle with mildly disordered eating and I didn‚Äôt want to trigger her. So we moved in, at this point still working together, and things were fine. I spoke to my psychologist and aspired to be a positive influence on Caitlyn and my concerns were alleviated. Things were fine, until a couple of weeks into living together she began calling in sick at unreasonably late notice (I was assistant manager, managing at the time) and generally just being unreliable. I spoke to her privately and checked in to make sure she was okay, but also had to let her know that the higher ups were unimpressed and her shifts were going to be cut. She was livid (as was I) at their response, and shortly after she resigned. I was also at the end of my tether with the job, so I completely understood (I resigned today! Yay!). During the past month or so she has been getting sicker and sicker. She barely leaves her room, doesn‚Äôt socialize with us, and whenever I go to the bathroom at night her light is on, so I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs sleeping. She has been trying to voluntarily go into inpatient treatment but has been met with hoops she‚Äôs worked so hard to jump through, and it‚Äôs taking it‚Äôs toll on her. She is incredibly emaciated, threatened frequently with being hospitalised, and overall just a very unwell individual. Just days ago she cried in my arms over her fear of never recovering. I feel for her incredibly, and want nothing but the best for her, as she is an absolute angel and so unbelievably sweet. 

I include this information so you have an idea of our dynamic, her current state, and how ill she is. 

Food has continued to go missing. The cheese thing, I asked her about, and she said her niece had mistakenly taken it and she would replace it. Okay, understandable. 
But then more went missing. I had a cookie slice that I had half eaten, and in the morning a full one was in its place. Anna‚Äôs leftovers are eaten nearly every single day. I had a jar of aioli, half eaten, and a full one appeared overnight. Anna has been the one most targeted, and has mentioned multiple times to me that something has been eaten - even some juice she had was half drunk and replaced with water. Just this morning I found my half full bottle of coke was in the fridge... empty. This is so much more than just a one off, and its not just small items. Sometimes they‚Äôre replaced, sometimes not. I notice every morning when I go to the bathroom that the toilet (without being too graphic) looks as though someone has thrown up. Some days it looks worse than others. It was never extremely obvious until a couple of days ago, where it was visibly dirty from vomit. I know that this isn‚Äôt my brother or Anna. The other girl, Lucy, moved in after these strange happenings began and she went away for a while and they continued, so it isn‚Äôt her. 

It‚Äôs definitely Caitlyn. 

But what the fuck do I do?! She‚Äôs SO fragile I wouldn‚Äôt dream of asking her up front about it. Currently, we‚Äôre considering hiding our food, or labelling it, or maybe just waiting until she goes inpatient and dealing with it in the meantime. I‚Äôm so concerned and I don‚Äôt want to push her over the edge by confronting her, but Anna is getting increasingly frustrated and I really feel for her because money is tight and 90% of her food is being eaten. 

AHH. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I am so conflicted. I can‚Äôt put even a general message in our flat group chat as Caitlyn doesn‚Äôt engage on social media, I text her personally about bills etc. HELP.",14Jun2019,1

But this is where it gets confusing. I've also been called attractive. I've had girls come on to me. I've had sex where I didnt even have to try to get it. Had girls chase me and I've been hit on in public. Hell I even dated one of the prettier girls in high school, albeit it was very short lived.

64,"Hi. I'm 15 and have a problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad has had a tendency to shout at me since I was around 11 or 12. Typically every month or two it happens to some degree. This hasn't just nagging or checking me, it's legit yelling. He cusses at me, threatens me, insults me, and intimidates. He gets up in my face and looks at me as if he wants to kill me. When he first began treating me like this I'd scream and cry almost instantly. Today I've built up some tolerance to him though.

My dad is in his early 50s. He has a lot of back pain, and a stressful job at a mental facility to help messed up kids who around my age. I think it really takes a big toll on him, and influences him to yell at me.

Now the thing is most the time I'm a good kid. He'll even admit that. He's a pretty normal person aside from being a bit quirky most the time. He absolutely loses it though every month or two (as I said) and becomes a monster. 

Sometimes he'll apologize after he cools down and feels bad. I've tried to forgive him and move on each time, but he does it again and again and again. It's starting to take a toll on me I feel.

The most recent example I can give is when he asked me to go mow the backyard. He's toldme that if I don't it's fine and I just won't get the money he gives me for doing it. He also told me that if he goes to do it himself, I should just let him finish.

So my dad went out to mow the lawn because I was busy doing a round of Dead by Daylight. At first he seemed fine with it. I noticed, though, that he kept walking in offering me and my sister the job for money. Each time he sounded a little more frustrated and impatient. Eventually he came in and offered the job to my sister one last time, and claimed I was being lazy. If I remember right she was busy on her computer too so he just went back out to work.

He came in again and started yelling at me the way he typically does. He told me that I'm, ""Fucking lazy,"" and slammed the door as hard as he could to go back out and continue his work. My mom just claimed he was justified in his anger, and that I'm making myself worthless. I gave up on the dead by daylight round about a minute afterwards, and went out to finish the lawn for him (even though he told me a while back to just let him finish work he started). 

When I came out to the lawnmower, he just looked at me and screamed something about how I should've come out before he started mowing. He said I had the whole week to do it. He was yelling loud, and I mean REALLY LOUD. The entire street probably heard him (I mean this literally, not as exegeration). He sounded like he had truly lost it.

Our backyard is a bit of a wreck from us moving stuff around to fix some of the fence. So I tried explaining to him that nobody went out to clean up the stuff we had left everywhere. He yelled at me to get away from him as he stormed back into the house.

My mom for some reason thinks that keeping up with the backyard is entirely my responsibility. She thinks the way my dad treated me was completely justified. She did nothing to defend me and even encouraged how my dad treated me.

TLDR: I was hysterically screamed at by my dad for not mowing the lawn even though he said I didn't have to, and my mom defend him. 

That whole story is just one of these many sessions of him yelling like that.

My mom also plays a huge role in my dad treating me how he does. Often when I do something any normal kid would do my mom frowns upon it and complains to my dad. She makes me sound a lot worse than I really am. She's uber-religious too, and I've told her I'm an agnostic at heart. Sometimes she'll have her own meltdowns in front of me as she tries (and fails) to convert me back to Christianity. 

These things happening even every other month or so is still too much. I'm starting to think it's verbal abuse. Is it? If so, should I get help?",14Jun2019,1

69,"I currently have a decent paying entry level IT position, especially for my age \[19\]. I plan to move out this year at some point, and i'm taking in all of my options. Currently i'm enrolled in a college that's not too far from home and right next to work, but I have 2 friends that live 2 hours away that are looking for a new roommate, and of course i'm next in line. I'd love to move in with them, and I already know their habits as roommates as i'm there quite alot, and I hear alot of stories, complaints, etc, so that's not really an issue, they've been living there for a year already. Pretty much i'm debating on keeping where i'm at right now, and finding a place to live near my current employment, or moving in with them 2 hours away, transferring both colleges and to a different store, which has it's own whole process aswell, it's not just a ""i'd like to transfer."" If I move in, i'd likely live there for a year-year and a half. I'd love to move in with them, but i'd have to jump through so many hoops to actually make that viable.

My issue with this is, if I go through they whole application process of transferring and hoping they'll actually let me, after we all split from the current location, do I ""attempt"" to go back to the previous location, or try to find a place to live near my new place of employment.

71,"Yep. A meth lab. It's not really a big surprise, but I just thought there was meth sales going on. Not a full on LAB. A bit of history. My dad was put in prison, for drugs that I don't remember (probably meth), when I was 10. The taking of drugs was happening in the barn, but we kids were there a lot, so they hid it pretty well. Couple years go by, he's out (After only a couple of years! He was ""second in command"" of a drug ring!), and I went out to the farm every once in awhile. But I stopped at around 16. 

That's when I have no idea what happened out there. He started drinking again, but oh well, that's the only way I knew my dad. And a few years ago he ""adopted"" 5 grown ass adults and started teaching them how to best live off the government. As you can guess, they are all druggies. And apparently they are gun toting druggies. My dad taught them how to protect the farm. 

Now to a couple days ago. I was talking to my cousin about the farm, and she told me she found the meth lab.  Holy crap, okay. When I asked her if she told the police yet, she said they have known for years about what's happening on the farm, but they won't go out there because they will be sitting ducks to whatever backup my dad has. I asked if we could try contacting the DEA. She said they probably already know, and it can take months or years for them to take down drug rings.

73,"My boyfriend(22/m) and I(21/f) have been together for 2.5 years and we live together. We‚Äôve only started living together for about 6-7 months. 

Lately, I feel like he‚Äôs been very comfortable in our relationship to the point where he doesn‚Äôt really try anymore or maybe he never did and I never noticed. 

The number one thing that has been bothering me lately is our lack of connecting on an emotional level. When we are ‚Äútogether‚Äù we aren‚Äôt really ‚Äútogether.‚Äù 

Here‚Äôs a timeline:

- He goes to work at 6 am and gets home either at 10 am or 12 pm. 

- Takes a nap right when he comes home till about 4 pm.

- Wakes up and gets on the computer to play video games and 75% of the time he talks to his online friends. 

- I go to work at 6pm-11pm (sometimes I‚Äôll go into work even earlier) 

So, basically we are together in the same room but not really spending quality time together. This is basically everyday. 

I talked to him about how I wish he showed more interest in things I like for example: music, youtubers, artwork I‚Äôm creating, etc. sometimes he does take interest but it‚Äôs rare. I noticed he will really only like something I‚Äôm into if it has something to do with his favorite things. For example, if I show him a synth wave song he won‚Äôt care for it but if I play one that was featured on Dr. Disrespects (twitch streamer)s YouTube channel then he will like it. Or if I make a drawing based on a video game he will take interest but if it‚Äôs anything else I‚Äôm working on he won‚Äôt come over and take a look or really have any opinion on it. 

I try to talk about interesting philosophy‚Äôs and lately I‚Äôve been really into learning about consciousness and I try to talk about some interesting facts I found or existential thoughts and he has no opinion on any of them. He just goes ‚Äúokay‚Äù or doesn‚Äôt really respond because he says he doesn‚Äôt know what to say or that there isn‚Äôt anything to say back. (Just to be clear I talk about other stuff too like stories at work or stuff that happen with my friends, or events I have been at)

Sometimes I‚Äôll tell a story about something cool I found or something that happen to me personally and he will space out or give me one worded answers. He told me that I need to make stories more interesting. 

The main stuff we talk about is stuff he likes, so video games or memes. I like both those things but talking about that and only that is repetitive and gets tiring. It‚Äôs all he ever talks about with me. Now, he has had some interests in things I‚Äôve shown him like TV shows. And he has given some of the things I like a chance. Some he likes and some he doesn‚Äôt which is fine. But if I like something a lot he will just go ‚Äúoh boy.‚Äù For example, my favorite band is coming out with a new album soon and I told him that I can wait and he just goes ‚Äúgreeaaaat‚Äù which idk if he‚Äôs joking or not but I feel like he isn‚Äôt joking around.

But he tells me how much he loves me, kisses me good morning and goodnight, we cuddle, and he surprises me with food or a present. But our emotional connection is not there and it‚Äôs really taking a toll on me. I find myself not really wanting to talk to him because of how he responds/doesn‚Äôt respond. 

Anyways, am I overthinking all of this? Is it different love languages? Is he just selfish or am I being overly selfish?",14Jun2019,1
74,"My partner [24M] and I [24F] are coming towards 18 months of a long and painful job search and are both struggling to continue to persevere. 

For a little background, my partner is a pilot who has recently become qualified enough to be applicable for Airline jobs, but he is sitting very much on the bottom end of the requirements. He is going to interviews where, while he is technically qualified, he is competing against people with years more experience than him. While it may seem obvious that he should just acquire more experience, this is complicated by the fact that his boss is very aware that he is now qualified enough to move out of his current job and has stopped him flying at work. General aviation jobs are VERY hard to acquire, and by stopping him flying his boss has basically marooned us in a very poor situation. My partner makes minimum wage, is not given sick or annual leave and no longer enjoys this job as he took this job to fly, not to sit in a hangar. 

We have spent thousands of dollars we don't really have to send him to get more qualifications, to fly him out to interviews internationally, and to send him to courses to help in the interview process. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm ready to just give up on all of it.

Has anyone experienced something similar? How did you cope?",14Jun2019,1
76,"So I know my issue isn't as big as others but it's been bothering me for as long as I can remember.

So I'm a 16 yr-old female. When I was 6, my parents put me in swimming till level 3 - just as I was getting somewhere they took me out because they said I haven't learned yet which means I'm a faliure. The first 3 levels teach your child to be comfortable in water and float, in level 4 I would learn to swim.

When I was 7 they put me in skating. It was one group of lessons of figure skating which I succeeded at, they took me out because I wasn't as fast as the hockey boys who had been skating since they were 4. Also my mom said it was too tiring to have to lace up my shoes once or twice a week.

Fast forward to the rest of my life, I was getting no physical activity and it affected me in every aspect of my life. I'm extremely unhealthy and starting to gain weight which they keep on reminding me about. I always did average in gym. I can't join sports teams at school because we're a very competitive school and everyone on teams do rep - 80% of people don't make it on. I'm so slow and I can't join track.

""Go to the gym, workout"" you say. I have been begging my parents to put me in sports for so long, they say it's a waste of money. I then begged them from the 7th grade till now to get me a gym membership. They say it's a waste of money because I'm lazy and useless - they force me to stay home all day. I finally got them to get me into kick boxing last year and then they took me out after 3 months because my mom lied and said I was horrible at it. I was good and was proud of myself for once. She was comparing me to some 25 year old athletic woman.

I ask them to go on runs outside, they say it's not safe- that I don't blame them for, I live in an very populated area.

I don't know what to do, I just want to be normal like everyone else. I had dreams of joining a soccer team and I was never allowed.

I do some YouTube video workouts but it only takes me so far. My salvation is when my local gym makes it free for teens during the summer.",14Jun2019,3
77,"So I (20 f) have had depression for a long time. The earliest depressive symptoms I can see go back to when I was 10, but I wasn't able to get any help for it until I was 16. Needless to say, I do suffer some of the consequences of having untreated clinical depression, mainly insomnia and being unable to make choices easily. I left the church I was raised in at 17 (I was raised Mormon) and started dating the guy I'd been attracted to for years. Two months ago, after the end of our second year at college, we moved in together. Honestly, if I hadn't started dating him, I'd have already killed myself.

I have three siblings. My brother verbally and emotionally abused my sisters and I when we were younger. My sister was emotionally manipulative and during her mormon mission was supposedly diagnosed with depression. She has depressive tendencies, but I think they're mostly rooted in anxiety and another medical condition she has (hypo-reactive glycemia, I think is what it's called). In short, it's vastly different from mine. She was able to find a lot of help through her church, her husband, eating right and exercising. In short, I don't want to be vulnerable in front of them again.

My dad used to be understanding that this was something wrong, that it was debilitating. My mom, however... it can be summed up by a message I sent her a couple weeks ago where I mentioned I had a miss work because I was fairly suicidal and she gave me a list of essential oils to use. I had to miss some work today, again because I was very tempted to kill myself, and he said I needed to get some good endorphins in my bloodstream. It may help if it was mild depression, but god that felt like a shove back into the hole I was inching my way out of.

So I'm lost. And lonely. And I don't know what to do. I'm seeing a psychologist from my college's services, but it's definitely not doing enough. I'm on medication, but I need an updated one but I can't afford to see someone. But I can't work because working while your mind in doing the mantra of ""if I kill myself, it won't be my problem anymore"". But my boyfriend doesn't work so I'm the only thing keeping us afloat right now and clearly I'm not doing so well.

80,"Basically, my best friend kind of shaped me into a psychopath lesbian, and it all started with one shabby shrimp.  
     I was stalling on an essay in class, so I decided to go into Google Translate and type in a bunch of kanji. It translated into ‚ÄúIt is ok to leave it to be a shabby shrimp.‚Äù So I told my friend. Actually, at the time, she had this other friend who I felt was stealing her from me. But that‚Äôs my yandere speaking, and a different story. Basically, she told her other friend that. It didn‚Äôt end well at all. At a track meet, her friend and her- who I guess I should refer to as Aliya and Andrea, dared me to call one of my classmates, specifically one who was obese, a shabby shrimp. An AID caught me and automatically assumed that I called him a shabby shrimp because he got last place in a race. I didn‚Äôt know that at all, so naturally, I denied it. She didn‚Äôt believe me, so she told my homeroom teacher. She confronted me, and being honest, I said that Aliya and Andrea made me. She believed me, so she talked to them. The track meet ended by then, and the next day, I tried talking to Andrea and Aliya, but Andrea said that her parents banned her from talking to me. Aliya didn‚Äôt seem happy about me either, but she didn‚Äôt talk. I was mad at them at first, but over summer, my psychopath treatment began. I missed Andrea so much, I cut my wrists. I couldn‚Äôt resist it, as my psycho mindset always kicks in when I see a knife. Now, my psycho mindset is easier to control, and Andrea and Aliya are my friends now, along with 3 others.

83,"I‚Äôm pissed as fuck tonight. Sorry this is probably gonna be long.

A few years ago my parents lost their house because they‚Äôre financially illiterate and keep believing in their failing ass business. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my parents to death and want the best for them but they make 0 effort to improve their situation. It‚Äôs seriously gotten so bad that they don‚Äôt even give a shit about their credit scores and just take out random lines of credit they can get with no intention of paying it back. We are at that point.

So when they lost our house (foreclosure) , my saint of a grandmother sold her house and used her equity to buy a house that would hold us all. She loves her family to the point of not being able to see what‚Äôs horseshit and what isn‚Äôt. She is literally the best human being to ever live (since probably Jesus Christ if you believe in that shit). 

So we all move in together. Everything is just fine up until Christmas when my parents pull their usual ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs dead season in the business so guess we can‚Äôt pay the mortgage and have to buy Christmas presents shit.‚Äù They get an entire month behind on the mortgage and have made all but one payment on time since January. I only know this because I made an effort to check my grandmas credit karma and the poor lady went from 780 to 598!!!!! In 3-4 months!! 

I asked my grandma what‚Äôs up tonight and she made mention that my parents never showed her any mortgage documents and I know they‚Äôve made an effort to hide any and all mail from her. All she‚Äôs seen is her credit score go down and her hard work being destroyed by two people who are working for nothing. I told her to get that shit under wraps but she‚Äôs too afraid of my mom. 

I can fucking handle it anymore. I‚Äôm 23, graduated from college last year, have had a full time job since, and help in huge ways around here. I bought a new lawn mower with my grandma (we are the only 2 who contributed). I also paid for a vacation for my entire family (I haven‚Äôt left the state in 2 years and my job situation allows so I figured why not at the time. Plus I wanted to do good by my grandma too).

I‚Äôm just at a fucking loss. I bitch all the time about them working too much for nothing and it falls on deaf ears and results in more excuses. How the hell would you all handle this? I love them to death but I‚Äôm seeing red tonight and trying my best to not go off.",14Jun2019,1

88,"So bit of background, I have been with my partner for a while now. I live in Australia, he is in America.  He is non-Australian permanent resident there, so not a US or Australian citizen, but has working rights there.  
We have spoken about marriage recently but are unsure how this will affect taxes. I assume I still need to put him on my forms, but will the amount of money he makes (and vice-versa) affect anything?   
I think tax times vary as well between the countries. Australia - end of June and US is April? So I wouldn't know what amount I would put on the form. For his forms, I wouldn't have the SSN that they require for their returns  
I did call up the taxation office from my end, but the person I spoke to didn't know how it would work or what I would have to put on the forms.   
Would it be best to hold off until one of us moves? But then there's also the part that a marriage can also make the visa process a bit easier.

There's a preschool/daycare center type thing near one of the complexes and outside of its fence is a steep ravine into a ditch, complete with thick foliage and small spaces, a.k.a. cat nirvana, so I decide to go into this mini-wood, and right next to the fence for the daycare center, hidden by the trees, is a vhs tape for an old kids cartoon (90s) and a black fabric bag next to it. I hate littering so I go to grab the tape and the bag. The bag makes a clanking sound and it has a camera tripod in it. I think it's weird but think maybe I can use it for something, so I put both in my bag and head home, still looking for the cat (cat is still out there, unfortunately).

94,"Hi all, I have a pretty tragic situation that has pursued me since I was a kid.

I grew up in a very conservative family and had very limited options on what I could do. I went to school, got home and repeated. I was never allowed to have hobbies, I never had privacy for any, I was sick a lot and lost basically all interest in anything that could push my life forward.

Now my life is getting back on track, I'm moving away from my family soon and I realized I have absolutely no talents or any idea how to advance in life. I'm unable to get into any good colleges but I'm working on changing that, but I still fill empty and useless.

What can I pursue that will bring me joy, something I can get into even as a 20 year old. I loved sports but was never really allowed to play them, I currently have no means to take up something pricey, and it needs to be something I'll have a use of later in life. I don't know how to learn a new skill because I was never taught anything, nobody ever bothered to guide me in life and I have to learn something all by myself. I would like to learn to code, however as I said I have no idea how to do that. I'd also like to learn art or get into sports but I feel like I'm too old for that.

98,"Long story short, I (19F) moved in with a guy shortly after we started dating. We were hot and heavy and faded out after a year or so. During this time, we've combined our whole lives, and I brought two cats into the apartment. 

Financially, he could afford the apartment, but it would require him to work more hours, or cut back on the few fun things he does, or tap into his savings a good decent bit for the remainder of the lease. He resigned the lease, and added my name to it with the idea that I would be here to help him pay until the lease is up in January. 

Now, hes allergic to cats and never really wanted pets, but he has come to love ours, and since we broke up, the opportunity for me to move pretty far has appeared and I want to take it. The problem is that I can't take the cats with us. 

If it matters he broke up with me. It was spur of the moment to me and broke my heart, but he says it was building for a couple of months so I'm trying to not be mad at him. Especially since during the time we were together, he was nothing but kind and attentive. He loaned me 5,000 dollars for my car because I couldn't afford payments. 

Because of that, I've always tried to buy everything for us. All the groceries and house supplies, all of the dates, even the couches(he ended up giving a couple hundred for them because of delivery and assembly), and I've tried to give him extra money each month to help pay him back. I started working a lower paying job to do something that made me happy for once, but it really tightened the bank up for me, so I haven't been able to save anything and basically gave him every extra cent I had. 

Now that we are broken up, I still feel like I owe him all this money and dont know how to pay him back. He says that he doesnt want me to pay him back, but he did ask me to stay until the lease was up, and continue to give him so much money each month for bills. 

I just feel like I can never be in the apartment. I cant sleep in the bed because it's his, and it smells like him and every time I lay in it I just feel wrong. We work different shifts, so we never share the bed anyway. I started sleeping on the couch, but that makes me feel like a stranger in my own apartment. He avoids coming home, I avoid coming home, and the rare time we are around each other, I can't even look at him without wanting to cry.

I could leave this weekend. I could just rent a uhaul and take the bare minimum of things that I know 100% are mine and never be back. But I dont know what to do. I dont know what I should do. I feel like I owe him and should stay, but at the same time, I dont know how long I can stay here and be reminded of him. 

We also share a car insurance payment and basically every streaming service but all of them are in his name. I'm willing to lose all of that, and send him money for my car insurance until we can separate it, but I dont want to be an asshole. 

I also have a pretty good job now, I could transfer to where I want to move and go there with a job. Or i could quit and accept a better paying job right here and put in the time until January and pay him back everything that I owe him, and when I move, get a new job there. Or i could leave my job and start over fresh when I get to where I would go. 

Here I have friends, I have a community that I know, couches to crash on if need be, and this area has my favorite hockey team, so during the series I could go watch games. But if I moved, I'd be moving in with my sister, I'd finally have one of my favorite fast food places near by which isn't available here, and I'd have the chance to go to school and live rent free, the chance to be a kid for once. And I would be with my niece, the sweetest little girl who I could have the chance to spend time with and get to know. 

My sister is urging me to leave, she says staying here is bad for my depression and anxiety, which it is, but I dont want to leave and abandon him with all the bills and cats and things we built together here. Any advice on what to do is desperately needed and appreciated. 

Also, if it matters, the last time we spoke he told me I could go and that he didnt want the cats to lose us both. I haven't gone back and confirmed what any of this means quite yet but I do believe that he wouldnt lie to me. If he said it, he thought about it and he meant it. 

TL;DR boyfriend broke up with me and asked me to stay and help him pay for the apartment that we rented together. I would have to leave my cats if I left, would I be the asshole if I left him with all the bills and the cats?",14Jun2019,1

108,"I'm a 17 yo dude, almost 18 in a few months.

I graduated college 2 months ago (private),  I have my diploma and I have a job that will last me till the end of this year.

I feel life is stressful as a working adult, even though I don't pay for bills, working in a call centre is kinda difficult especially if its only your 2nd job.

&amp;#x200B;

My mum is controlling and overprotective, which is understandable because I'm the only child and I'm the youngest in my whole family. However its starting to get irritating because neither am I allowed a gf, and neither am I allowed to drink. My friends parents allow them to drink but my parents don't. All I want to is to drink so I can let off some stress from life, I don't plan to get wicked drunk/blackout.

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow, my parents are going overseas on a short trip and I have work (which is a Saturday) and what I just wanna do is let loose and get drunk, with a couple shots of vodka and glass of whisky. I want to play some games at the dive bar (pool), while getting drunk.

&amp;#x200B;

However I am afraid of betraying and breaking my parents trust if they find out. I'm not sure If I should wait 3 months till I'm of legal age or I should just do it now anyways. I just want to have freedom to do what I want, and my parents aren't giving that, I also find it ironic that my dad drinks and doesn't want me to drink because he doesn't practice what he preaches.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice r/advice ? I'd appreciate it. If you're reading this, pls give me your input as I only have a day before I make a decision to either go to the bar or not",14Jun2019,1
109,"I used to talk to a girl online, initially as a friend, then more intimately. (Though not serious as we did only talk online, and didn't expect to meet in real life.)

Eventually though, I broke her trust by messaging one of her friends behind her back, at which point things broke down to a basic level, minimal talking, and mostly arguments, at which point she blocked me. One of the things she said was that I was emotionally abusive.

This isn't the first time I've been called emotionally abusive, and I do have some issues on that front, and I am trying to sort it out / handle it.

After a few months, she unlocked and messaged me again, saying she was sorry, she over reacted (She didn't I don't feel, though she was rude / hurtful, it wasn't as bad as me...), And is constantly asking to talk / call, and is being really kind.

What's going on? 

Why did she suddenly change her mind and message me, why does she want to talk again after we seemingly burnt bridges, and she's being really sweet, kind, friendly, etc.

110,"I just finished my freshman year at college. For reference, I go to a top 5 engineering school studying Chemical Engineering and an Additional Major in Computer Science (ranked #1 in the US) so I am not in any way unmotivated.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, I feel like I am stuck in a constant loop. I am going through the motions of college. Finishing assignments, studying for tests, going to lectures, having a life outside of school. But I can never fulfill my personal passions with intensity and energy after being so drained at college. I just don't get what the point of me being here is. I don't even want to get a normal job when I graduate. I've always had entrepreneurial interests and endeavors and want to do only that. I can't actually see myself working as a chemical engineer or a software engineer. I just want to be an entrepreneur.  

&amp;#x200B;

This might sound na√Øve and dramatic (especially for a 19 year old) but I would rather die living my dreams, than live a life of regrets. I have always been ambitious and driven. I have a firm vision and I know what I want to be doing in 20 years. Yet, unfortunately for me, I have to focus on the present. That is why I have been questioning my reason for being in college and I realized it's for 1) a source of income when I graduate and 2)  job security (or at least that's what my parents want). Admittedly, a degree in engineering would grant me these things, but I am not one in general to care much about having a lot of money in my pocket and being comfortable. I am taking these ridiculous, hardcore math and CS classes and I don't see how they'll help me with my goals, even though I want to dive into tech entrepreneurship.

&amp;#x200B;

I have managed fine trying to learn programming languages outside of school and working on becoming a better version of myself, both professionally and personally. I do believe that experience trumps anything that I would be learning while trying to earn my degree, as I have learned while studying for things outside of school (i.e., web development). Although I do believe that I am highly stressed at the moment, I do speak truth since this has been inside me for months now. Obviously a good part of this is just my emotions speaking, but this is how I feel deep down.

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice on what to do. I'm so confused with what I am doing in life. All I know is that I want to promote humanitarianism and actually contribute to society. I know that I have something to offer to this world, and that I have no selfish intent but to help advance society and the people around me. I believe that I am blessed with creativity and above average intellect and I want to be able to make a difference (said every college student ever). Anyways, (and I am not shaming anyone or trying to be offensive), but I do not believe a 9 to 5 job will give me any of these that I want. All I would be doing is working my ass off so that the person at the top would have more money in their pocket. Very few companies nowadays have a greater vision and purpose in mind. Unfortunately for many, that is not the case. By the way, I pay no tuition at college right now which is making me feel even more guilty for even thinking about taking a leave of absence. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has been tearing me apart for months. I would appreciate any advice. I just don't know what to do with college? It feels like 4 years of my time left on Earth is being erased. Do I take a gap year? Withdraw? I am taking summer classes as well right now so I won't have a break for at least a year.",14Jun2019,22

112,"Okey so, context.

My dads gf has a nephew that is 20 years old and is kind of my cousin, I've known him since i was little. We never really get along but it wasn't a big deal until he moved in with us. He has been living in my dads house for about 6 months now and at first I was okay with this, but now some things are really bothering me. He works at a bar at night, so he usually is out of the house at 5 or 7 pm, but the rest of the time he is in here with me is unbearable.

 He always is smooking weed, at the rooftop of my building or sometimes even on the bathroom, right next to my little sibblings room. He comes back really late at night, shitfaced most of the time (sometimes I've found vomit on the bathroom) and I dont like that at all considering that my sibilings have to live and grow with that around them. He's always rolling joints at my office, were he has his pc, and it smells like weed all the time so I dont even use it anymore. He also plays League of Legends all the time so the wi-fi is shit. 

I've confronted my dad and his gf about this, and they told me that they are aware of this. She told me that he lived in a difficult enviroment and that he's suicidal and has troubles with drugs so she made him move in with us in order to help him to get out of this situation. They told that they would talk to him about it (and they say they did) but I see no change at all. In fact, the other day I came home early (when noone but him was around) and the bathroom smelled like weed and he was watching porn at my office, so I was pretty pissed and now I dont even talk to him (witch is hard, being that he sleeps in the same room as me).

During that ride home, she offered her car for me to borrow while she was on vacation for 3 weeks (starting today- crazy timing). I politely declined the first few times (because I felt it was more of a gesture than a real offer, she‚Äôs very kind and I‚Äôd expect her to offer but that‚Äôs still a big deal, at least to me)  but she offered a few more times.

123,"I'm a college student with a year left before graduation. I've been applying to internships in my area and have had no luck. 

Recently, I found a new listing and applied to it. A few days later, I saw another listing from the same company (just a general labor job, not an internship) and applied to it, as well.

About a week later, I got an e-mail asking me to come in and interview for the labor job. Right after interviewing, I got a call offering me the job. I accepted and submitted all of the paperwork that was e-mailed to me. I was upset that I hadn't heard back regarding the internship, but thought this job would be a great fit for my schedule both in the summer and when school starts again in the fall.

This Monday, I got another e-mail asking me to come in for an interview--for the internship this time. I went in today and interviewed. I think I did well and I think I have a real shot at landing this position which would carry on through my last year of school and very likely lead to a full-time job offer--basically a dream job.

I'm supposed to start the labor job in about a week, although I'm still in the dark as to the exact start date. I'll know whether I did well enough to land this internship in the first week of July.

What am I supposed to do here? I obviously can't start the labor job if I'll only be there for a couple weeks. That being said, I don't want to give up that job if the internship doesn't pan out.

128,"So not give you a whole life story but ill try to recap what I can fairly easily and ill put an over all at the bottom if you want to not read all of this. But I though I'd come here for help and advice, it's my first post and probably won't be my last like this. 
My family, is a family and as every family is, it cam get dysfunctional. I have 3-6(2-3 of which we don't know) my older brother and sister are old enough to live on there own, and have a different mom then I do. My little brother lives with my mom, while I live with my dad but he has a different dad then I do, who isn't in the picture. My mom...is appearntly recovering from rehab for drug abuse, and I do not know which drug. She is my mother and I do love her, but she is crazy and not a good parent. She used to abuse me and my little brother greatly, and has a bad habit of getting in relationships with abusive men. My little brother is..mentally challenged and I think it correlates with my mom. He has bad anger issues, ADD ADHD and probably a bunch of other things my mom only knows how to solve by doping him up with medication. She wants to stop taking him school, she can't keep a job doesn't have a car and has no food for my little brother. Ive already decided when I'm old enough I'm going to take him into custody. These are some reasons as too why I live with my father.

My father isn't much better though. Now I know I'm young, yes but I also realize that I am at that age where I need to be given freedom. But my father is in the way of that. And I'm not a snobby kid really I'm not, there are multiple people who can account on my behalf because of my dad. He says I don't have responsibility, I never do anything he says and that I don't deserve to have fun. Mind you, I've never done anything wrong, im a great student, I always do what he says, and I do have responsibility. There are again many who account for this. I have barely any freedom but my dad says I need to be ""railed in"". Not only is this taking a toll on me, but my boyfriend and his family as well. He inconvenienced them so many times, tries to make do the adult things instead of talking to the other adult and fixing the problem, he acts like a complet child, his logic makes no sense. I have friends who's parents don't want me coming over just so they can avoid interacting with my father. My father goes to my siblings for help as a scare tactic against me thus ruining what I had with siblings, and when he tells them something i did even though in that situation he was clearly the one in the wrong, he makes me seem like the bad guy. He outed me to my entire family telling them THAT IM GAY when I AM NOT. I am bi, but now they all think I'm gay. Ive tried to plead for help telling him I have depression and want help and I'm very suicidal but he never listens ans gets mad. The first time I tried to tell him he said if I told him again hed beat my ass. Hes also held a throat to my knife telling me to kill myself, he's told me to hang my self and if I cut to ""make it count"" he calls me names such as ""fucking bitch"" ""duntz"" and other things that should be told to your child. Today at my orthodontist appointment the lady doing my teeth was listening to things my father was telling her, mind you she has no clue who I am and I met her today for the first time and during the whole time she was whispering to me telling me it'll be okay, and sympathizing with me. Everyone I know is so done with my father, and his childish selfish ways. I should not have to be the adult in this relationship or get punished for things I can not control. I've done nothing wrong to him in my life except try to fight for my own life and freedom. 

I don't know what to do anymore, and I'm ready to give up on life complety. How do I deal with this?


//OVER ALL//: my father is over controlive, unfair, and childish
Its not only affecting me but others around me, and people who don't even know me sympathizing with me because of him. People I know are more than done with him, and want to ""teach him a lesson"". Its gone on to long and I don't know what to do.



Ill probably be posting more about this, but please any advice would help for now.  :) thank you",14Jun2019,5
131,"This is long. TL;DR at the end of post. 

My boyfriend and I live in a duplex. Which means we share a house that is split into two sides. 

Back in March, the previous neighbor sold her side and a couple had bought it from her. They didn‚Äôt move in right away and had some work done before fully moving in. I don‚Äôt recall really meeting the wife or husband for the first time. More so just a hello in passing and brief introduction. 

Not long after they completely moved in, in the beginning of April, we heard them arguing pretty loudly. The husband was screaming and we heard pretty much every word. He was calling her all sorts of names. Many vulgar, horrible things to call your wife.  She didn‚Äôt really raise her voice much. It was just awful how mean he was. It had gotten to the point where it was a weekend occurrence. 

I started noticing that any time my boyfriend and I were outside, he would come out to find some reason to talk to us. He was obviously trying to make a point that he was there or something.

There was one night he was insanely drunk. His wife had said that he cheated on her, to which he came back and said she was looking through his personal stuff. Constantly screaming that at the top of his lungs. Over and over saying ‚ÄúWHY! WHY! WHY! THATS MY PERSONAL STUFF! WHY WERE YOU GOING THROUGH MY PERSONAL STUFF! WHY!‚Äù. She had called the police on him. When they arrive it stayed quiet. It was like that for a couple of days. We heard some arguments but not like before. 

It then progressed to him coming outside any time I was outside. If I was outside smoking a cigarette, he would come out on his side and smoke a cigarette. If I was coming or going in my car, he would come outside. I wouldn‚Äôt initiate any conversation at all. I would ignore him, not look at him and keep to myself. 

Just about a week ago, he had a friend over while I was mowing the lawn. I noticed he had come out and just didn‚Äôt look over. I had my earbuds in, listening to music. Then I noticed his friend come out. They were watching me mow the lawn, in rotation. It was obvious but they tried to make it look like they were doing something else outside that was just blatantly unnecessary. 

When I started mowing, I cut my finger and texted my boyfriend to bring me a bandaid. He didn‚Äôt read the text so once I finished mowing, I went in to get a bandaid and a drink. I was going to start weed whacking, since I have never done it before, my boyfriend came outside to help me set it up and show me how to do it (He had oral surgery and was told not to do any labor). While we were outside in the shed, the neighbor came out again. Once he saw my boyfriend, he doubled back into his side of the house. 

Tonight before work (I work third shift from home) I went to get some food and when I came back I was finishing my cigarette in my car listening to music. Since I didn‚Äôt go inside right away, he came out on his back porch. Trying to watch me without being noticed but I always notice. 

I‚Äôm honestly at a loss here. I feel like I can‚Äôt be outside alone at my own house. I can‚Äôt mow the lawn. I can‚Äôt take my dogs out. I can‚Äôt smoke a cigarette on the porch (I don‚Äôt smoke inside and I smoke ‚Äúcasually‚Äù/not a lot). I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. 

TL;DR: my neighbor constantly watches me when I‚Äôm outside. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in my own home alone. Help.",14Jun2019,1
132,"I am not sure from where to begin but here's what happened. Basically 2 yrs ago i've met a girl online , well at that time i always have been using social medias. I am an introverted person so i have difficulties talking to people in real life. Anyways the first time i met her i had talked to her we had some good talking and everything and i liked her, I have told her that i liked her and everything and she told me that she did too! . I was so happy that the first time ever i thought someone would love me since i've never been loved before. And after a month i guess we still kept talking and we didn't really dated but she herself told me that she has been manipulating guys online. I was hurt and shocked because such thing never happened, she told me how she would date two guys at once and dump both of them and it is really disgusting. I confronted her and told her that what she is doing is very bad and you should apologize to them and i've told her how much i loved her and have blocked her.

Well it was hard to forget at first but everything went smooth later on but what confused me is she made another account and she came texting me back telling me that she loves me and so on, I didn't understand what she wanted i told her to apologize for the people she did this to and i thought maybe i could give her a chance. But it was a mistake i should have realized it would be worse. few months later she lied to me and turns out that she was dating a guy in real life and she got intimate with him and she told me what she have done. And she'd tell me that everytime she kissed him she'd think it's me and i don't get it WHY me. We argued and i have moved forward. Also i forgot to mention before everything has happened i have also mentioned her some app that i use so we can talk there. so after i have been moving forward she came to me in that app and there i was so scared for a second i mean how could she been there right? but then i remeber that i am the one who gave her. At that time she had seen how many girls i have been talking to she'd get angry or jealous because i did , I never understood why i've even told her that it is none of my business if you talk to guys too? . Because i remember in the past she have told me she'd go to parties get drunk and have sex. Which of course hurt me but i had to forget about it. I kept blocking her and she kept coming to me and all we did was just argue everytime over and over again it never stops. I am trying to let go but i can't it is very hard for me. Usually when someone i love or been with for a while it is hard for me to leave. Until one day she told me she is going to have a heart surgery and i am not sure if she is telling the truth or not she lies everytime to me so of course i wouldn't believe her. But i said to myself maybe i should give some sympathy well i did and she claimed it was a ""successful"" surgery, But that doesn't mean everything has stopped. we kept arguing again and now again she claims she has to do one but this time she says she heared her parents telling her that "" we can't do the surgery and that she would die"" . And everytime i would ask her that we could call to talk and she'd do is change topic and ask me about the girls that i talk to which really doesn't make sense. But also i really suspect that this person is a catfish? i am not really sure . I asked her for her instagram but she refuses to give me and she'd always tell me that there is many things that i do not know about her. Until know she keeps telling me that all these years she loved me but i kept breaking her heart which doesn't make sense. Anyways i am very tired of this i wanna move on so please anyone give me advice tell me what to do i really would appericiate it if you help me. I know i am stupid i should have done something but all i am asking for is some help.",14Jun2019,1
133,"Throughout my adult life, I've been victim of extremely serious violence or other misconduct (as in somewhere around seriously life threatening) on the part of police or other law enforcement 5 times.  

I know it's different for different people, and it's also different in different places.  I'm not saying I was perfect.  But I'm also excluding the one and only time I was victim of brutality and actually did break the law.  

I have two federal lawsuits going.  And it's really hard for me emotionally.

My anxiety is through the roof.  I cannot even go outside most of the time, because I'm afraid.  I want to emphasize that.  I just want to yell it.  I CAN'T GO OUTSIDE BECAUSE I'M AFRAID!  That's how bad it is!  I can't water my garden.  My fear and anxiety of people, and of just being outside hinders me and my life and my opportunities so bad, it makes me really depressed, and I already have a tendency to become depressed even without that. 

It's also a real danger.  At 5 times throughout my life, some of which are really hard to look back on and think of anything I could have done differently, my life expectancy is already past!

This is NOT ACCEPTABLE!

And I need help!

The courts want me to (1) rewrite my 60 page lawsuit that took me a year and around probably 800 hours to research compile, draft, etc., (2) I don't even know what I'm supposed to do for my other one.  It's just a huge mess.  The representatives of the Sheriffs department are \*obviously\* lying.  And I hope I catch them on it at court, but odds are, at that time, their lawyer -- paid for by COUNTY TAX DOLLARS -- will have coached them enough that I won't be able to.  Even though I've caught them in several lies already, even though they won't release \*any\* information about their investigation or the incident, whatsoever, I didn't record it, it was over the phone.  So unless they admit to what they said (unlikely) ...

Meanwhile their lawyer is already accusing me of ""not complying"" with my duties... like I'm the ONLY one who has been doing ANYTHING towards actually resolving this or bringing any facts to light.  Getting money over this is the \*last\* thing on my mind.  I just want to be safe.  Honestly, I could break down right now and cry and beg on my knees if it would help me to feel safe.

I do not care about the money \*at all\*.  

I've called the ""free legal aid"" \*four\* times, now.  They don't call me back.  I've called 25 different lawyers.  The only lawyers who actually spoke to me told me I won't find a lawyer for this, and there's plenty of information about this online, that there's \*no money\* in civil rights cases like this, and they're incredibly difficult.  But despite that, I have educated myself on how to file the federal lawsuits, and I did both of them.  And dare I say I did them kinda well.

These things shouldn't have happened.  It's fucking insane, and illegal, and a lot of money of both the taxpayers, mine, and my family's who supported me through these, has gone down the toilet.  I could have ended up dead, or falsely convicted.  It's absolutely, unambiguously unethical.

Now I have two weeks to rewrite the 60 page, enormously complex suit, and I don't even know why.  The judge was totally wrong, and I have numerous case law to prove it.  But he is telling me ""I gave you leave to amend most of your case"", and I basically get how he wants me to amend it.   But I have to do so much for the other case, too, that one is crazy, because apparently there's a deeply entrenched culture of dishonesty and intentional irresponsibility within the government where the other incident took place, in addition to the violent action on the part of one officer, and it's just become this huge mess.  And I just am having a really hard time motivating myself to work on this stuff.  I'm going to have to call the FBI about one, because the government keeps blatantly lying, and doing things to cover up the incident.  And I am really intimidated of the FBI because they do not have the best track record of not violating people's civil rights themselves -- much less actually enforcing them!",14Jun2019,1

136,"I'm really sorry if I come off as the ""ohhhh I'm a poor teenager and i'm depressed blah blah blah"", because I really feel as though that's not what I feel about this. I'm just asking legitimately, because I've lost a lot of drive and a lot of motivation lately. 

This dismal way of thinking came to be because I've just finished my first year at college and I subsequently spent many hours applying for jobs this summer because I desperately needed one to pay for summer classes in order to stay on track with my curriculum, but I never heard back from 1 of the 25 places I applied to.  So that really just got me to thinking about the very real odds of failure in every aspect of life, whether it be vocational or educational or in relationships. 

This is the only way that I've seen it lately: in primary and secondary school, we tried very, very hard and gave it all we had in order to make it into college, only to then bust our asses in COLLEGE just for the CHANCE of getting a JOB, which will only require further BUSTING of our ASSES. And for what? Money? Why? When does it pay off? Retirement, when we will be too old to experience the pleasures of life? Working sucks, we can all agree! Even if you are in the profession that perfectly suits you (which I believe I am), and the work you're doing is something you enjoy, work in that field will still be MANY HOURS A DAY! With no escape! Regardless of whether or not you enjoy it, that's still like 8 hours a day that you can't spend how you want!

This may sound like a very basic statement of facts to everyone who reads this, as it sort of seems to me as I read it back, but this is really the first time I've ever been confronted with these feelings. I think that the fallacy that I had made was a general sense of always feeling that my current state was bad, but that it would always get better from there, when the cold truth is that it really doesn't! When will I, or any of us, really enjoy ourselves? It seems we just move from state of misery to state of misery! 

It's actually very difficult for me to try to accept. This realization that I made a few months ago has severely affected my mood and general disposition about anything; it's permanently made my mood very bad wherever I go, and it's motivated me to turn down the several offers to be social made by my friends. I've totally secluded myself simply because I've realized that it doesn't matter! Prior to all of this, suicide was never even on the table, and it's still not as the main option, but I can now fully understand a few reasons as to why someone would take their own life.",14Jun2019,3
137,"I wrote a much longer version of this post earlier but only one person responded to it. Can anyone give me some advice for what I should do?

\-My dad yells at me typically every month or every other month

\-He doesn't just nag me or anything, he screams to a point that he sounds truly insane. I mean like the whole street could hear him (Literally, I'm really not exaggerating, he yells that loud). He also looks at me likes he legitimately wants to kill me when he's yelling at me.

\-He cusses at me and threatens me a lot when he yells at me.

Now I'm hesitant to do anything about him because most the time he's pretty normal. Sometimes he'll even apologize after he calms down. He has a lot of back pain and works a really stressful job. I can't do anything to help him though.

Even though he's in pain though, he doesn't have the right to treat me how he does. He needs to learn not to take his anger out on me.

My mom is of no help. She sees any way he behaves as justified. She's uber-religious and sees dads as always being justified for how they treat people.",14Jun2019,1
138,"I don‚Äôt want to go too far into detail, but in a nutshell, my dad has quite possibly ruined my life. This all started in August of 2016, when I was 12. He quit his job because his schedule was being changed and didn‚Äôt try to look for a new one. I have told him to get a job at Walmart, but he straight up refused. Instead of looking for a job, he blew most of his retirement money on $2,500 worth of photography equipment (which he has literally no skill in). Once we ran out of that money, he started ‚Äúborrowing‚Äù money from me, my sister, and my grandma. Today, he owes me around $1,400, owes my sister around $2,500, and around $6,000 to my grandma. She is retired and gets money from social security every month. To this day, the basic expenses are covered from her money. I feel so terrible about it, but I can‚Äôt do anything to help. I‚Äôm only 15 and can‚Äôt get a job in my state. I‚Äôve tried mowing lawns back when my dad‚Äôs mower worked, but everyone I went to already did it themselves. My dad‚Äôs car got repossessed in January of 2018 and since then I really haven‚Äôt gone anywhere. All I ever do is sit in my room either on reddit or watching YouTube. My computer barely works anymore, and I‚Äôm surprised it still is. It‚Äôs so slow to where I can barely run a flash game on chrome. I‚Äôm gonna try to not go into too much detail but here‚Äôs what has been happening:

I live in Florida and have no air conditioning. It‚Äôs been broken for 11 months now. Back in May, it would get up to 105 degrees F in my house.

My dad is refusing to get a job, even a minimum wage.

I‚Äôm stuck in my house all day because my family doesn‚Äôt have a car. All I have is my phone to keep myself entertained.

My house was supposed to get auctioned off in May, but it was rescheduled for August. And once it happens, I have nowhere to go. Not to mention my house is in terrible condition. The toilets don‚Äôt work, only 1 shower works, the septic system is clogged, and most of the appliances are broken (fridge, washer/dryer, freezer)

My dad is VERY verbally and emotionally abusive to me and my mom. He can‚Äôt control his temper and throws a fit over the smallest things.

Now, I would‚Äôve already called the cops and had him arrested, but...

I have quite a few pets, cats and dogs, and if I were to call cops to my house they would take the pets and probably euthanize all of them. Also, my mom might get arrested too since she is my parent and is supposed to take care of me. Although I don‚Äôt blame her one bit. I‚Äôve talked to her many times and she feels extremely bad about the situation, but she can‚Äôt do anything either. She could get a job but that would require a car as I live in a rural part of town. And if I were to call the cops, I would most likely be placed in the foster system. I have thought about running off, but I have nobody to stay with and no money.

So, this is where I need some advice.

142,"I am 16 and have a big examination coming up.

Here's the problem: I have been struggling with most of my subjects so I have signed up for many tutoring classes but still get Fs for my grades. I do know what went wrong in my test papers (such as inability to understand some concepts and questions, randomly putting down answers without reading the questions, e.t.c) and I know I need to work very hard to pull my grades up.

My teachers, friends and family are very concerned about me because of my detoriorating grades.

I have come to the realisation that maybe the cause of my horrible grades is because I do not understand the subject well enough AND I am emotionally unwell + my negative attitude towards life.

First of all, I know I should do something to buck up, but I would rather lie on bed, use my phone and could go a day or even a week without studying.

Maybe that is just laziness?

Second of all, these days a lot of things has happened to me. Friends left me, still hung up about the rejection from my previous crush, parents consistantly yelling at me to study and not use my phone so much. Parents told me that I am a disappointment, Brother just shakes his head at me and tells me I am a failure.

I am literally alone, no one is friends with me in my current class to begin with and the friends who left me are all from different classes.

Whenever people reach out to me, I push them away.

I do not think that I am mentally ready for this big examination, but I do not want to repeat a year.

Who can I blame for being in this horrible situation? Only me.

I do feel that because of the way things are happening to me now, it has affected my attitude towards life hence affecting my grades even more. I have been struggling with my grades even before all these shit has started!

Maybe just leaving this world would be the best option lmao.

I don't know....How can I be a better person? and most importantly, what can I do to buck up my grades?

145,"Exactly what the title says. My friend (let's call him Adam) has been distant recently. I didn't think it was much at first because a lot of us in our friend group has been acting this way because we've all been working. Adam left our group chats a couple days ago but I didn't figure this out until yesterday. I messaged him asking if he was ok but he didn't respond until today. He said he was mediocre. I asked Adam if he wanted to hang out if he wasn't feeling well or if he wanted to simply talk. He said no to both and justified his answer with wanting to cut ties with everyone. I felt hurt and asked him if I did something wrong. We've known each other since we were little kids so I took this a bit personally. He said I didn't do anything and that he just didn't have the motivation to keep ties anymore.

Again, I was upset and hurt but I proceeded to ask if this had anything to do with him going away for school. He said it wasn't. Adam asked me if he wanted an honest answer or if I wanted a bs answer. Obviously, I said the truth. I was at home at the time making some food when my phone lit up from a notification. It was Adam messaging me. I didn't open the message but from the notification preview, he told me he liked me. I didn't know how to react. I haven't actually looked at the full message yet and he doesn't know that I know the gist. (it shows if I read it) Adam knows it's my anniversary with my boyfriend and that I love him. 

About a year and a half ago, Adam actually told me he liked me but I was interested in my soon-to-be boyfriend at the time. We cleared things up and we never spoke about it again. We were still acting normally around each other and nothing was uncomfortable either. In the duration between then and now, he's gone out with a couple girls so it would've never crossed my mind that he still liked me. I feel like a mixture of emotions is swirling around me. I can't stop thinking if I did something that gave mixed signals or if I did something else that hurt him. I don't like him in that way but I do love him as a friend. I know that might sound hurtful, but I do and I would never want to hurt him. He still means a lot to me. 

I told my boyfriend something happened and he immediately knew just by me stumbling around with an explanation. He's actually out with family (it's also his birthday) so he said he would call me later so we can talk about it. He said he's not mad or anything but he feels we should talk about it since it's affecting me so much. I'm not sure what to do..

154,"I‚Äôm 21, and go to Uni about 7-8 hours away, across the state. My family consists of my mum, and her parents. They‚Äôre very conservative and very, very catholic. I mean, they wake up to pray early in the morning, attend church more than twice a week, donate a lot of money they don‚Äôt have towards church stuff like buying the priests stuff and building new additions to the church, and the like. 

I‚Äôm agnostic, but mostly only because I was raised by them and it‚Äôs kinda second nature to pray when shit goes down and I know there‚Äôs nothing I can do. I don‚Äôt believe in organised religion or the kind of worshipping they do in their churches because I believe it‚Äôs a waste of time. 

So every time I visit, there‚Äôs a lot of arguments, yelling and crying. They don‚Äôt let me straighten my hair (one of my biggest insecurities is my thin curly hair), wear any clothes I like, wear clothes that fit (they make me retain my clothes from when I was 11 and when I was fat - I was 161 lbs and now I‚Äôm a 110), don‚Äôt give me medicines when I‚Äôm sick and attempt to cure it with herbal stuff that doesn‚Äôt agree with me, play very loud gospel music in the morning so everyone can wake up to it, make me do things so they can look good and get mad at me when I don‚Äôt act like the person they‚Äôd made me out to be to the people here that haven‚Äôt met me. 

In addition, they tell me they‚Äôre ashamed of me when I come to church in clothes that are my size, or without sleeves or expose a part of my legs. And worse, they don‚Äôt let me come without covering my head because the Bible says women have to cover their head. That doesn‚Äôt mean I get to skip church, I‚Äôm still forced to go.

They believe that every girl has only one responsibility - to be a good wife and they‚Äôre trying to train me to become one. Marriage in my family is a decision taken by parents, uncles, and relatives you‚Äôve never even heard of. When someone knows there‚Äôs a family with a girl ‚Äúof age‚Äù they immediately tell another family that has a boy everything about the other family and if they like the families (for the money and their reputation in society), the marriage is fixed. Many of my cousins have gotten married to guys they‚Äôve never even met before the ‚Äúengagement party‚Äù. Here‚Äôs the worst part, they all have to definitely be (atleast) distant relatives. 

I don‚Äôt want to get married, especially not someone from this family because ever since I was five I‚Äôve wanted to run away because I know this isn‚Äôt the family for me. But I‚Äôm afraid it might not even be in my hands to decide.

155,"Howdy all. This is my first post on reddit, I wish it could‚Äôve been a snazzy ol‚Äô meme, but I need to get this off my chest before I do something I might regret. 

For starters, this is my first relationship and I‚Äôm 16. This past year my (ex)boyfriend has stuck with me through my parents divorcing and me having an insane stalker harass my entire family.

My ex broke up with me via text two nights ago and I can‚Äôt sleep, eat or feel anything. His reasoning for leaving me was because he was too afraid to express how he felt about issues within the relationship, therefore the problems accumulated and then SPLAT. I told him I understood and I asked him to reconsider and to take more time to think about it so we could sit down and talk about it, but he shut me down and me to respect his decision. 

None of what he was saying that night sounded like it was coming from him, so I can‚Äôt to the conclusion that his mother told him to break things off with me. I feel this way because I jokingly said they should come to my graduation (which is in two years) while we were out having dinner and his mother awkwardly said ‚Äúoh sweetie... that‚Äôs a while away‚Äù. An important note to have is that I was becoming close with his mother, having actual bonding time alone with her so I don‚Äôt see why she would have any resentment towards me. 

I‚Äôm just really hurt and confused by everything and I want to sit him down to talk about everything still. I don‚Äôt want to throw away what we had, especially since all of our friends expected us to last for much longer than we did. 

I understand all of this is still new and raw, so I need advice on what I should do; Talk to him? Leave it be?

My girlfriend was to open a bakery (she is my same age). Right before we moved up here I grew more anxious and  reluctant but her family started pushing back and convincing me to go. I just got out of high school, and I feel like my time to find myself was finally here but now it seems like I am starting from square 1 and distracted with having to look for good paying jobs that will allow me to support this girl and we need medical benefits for her sake. This is stuff her family tells me, and tells her so she reflects it back on to me. The day before we moved up here I got a ‚Äústern talking to‚Äù by her Mom because I told her daughter all the things that she was doing to push me away. Suddenly everything is fine now that we are here but the feelings that I felt about coming here haven‚Äôt necessarily dissipated. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs the truth in my heart that I don‚Äôt belong here or if it‚Äôs because I am not letting myself go. I have and will be leaving a lot of good stuff behind, and it doesn‚Äôt seem like I am doing it for myself, it seems very altruistic and that I am suffering in silence in a loving relationship with this girl and her family because I am afraid to do what‚Äôs right for myself.  In short I need to absolutely ruin the trust and faith of at least 5 people, leave my girlfriend who I still love dearly to live in a basement by herself with decorations that we picked out together or break my own heart and continue to do this until it feels right and that I can live here.",14Jun2019,1
157,"I made this account because I‚Äôd like to keep this post off my main and keep myself anonymous; however, you can call me Kai. I‚Äôd also like to apologize for the terrible writing. My thoughts are a huge jumble and I was never good at writing. 

First, I‚Äôd like to introduce myself. Hello, my name is Kai, I am female, and an upcoming senior in high school. I was born and raised in a fairly small community before I moved last year (June 2018) to a large city. My hobbies include performing piano and playing video games with a single very close, online friend. I am quite terrified to describe myself anymore, so I will just leave it at that. I apologize again for the horrible writing. Thank you.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
As an emotionally sensitive person, I am currently struggling to find a reason to be happy. Moving to a new city and making friends has been very difficult for me as I am very antisocial; however, this isn‚Äôt such a big issue since I never really had many friends to talk to before I moved. Luckily, I was able to meet a couple of amazing people. 

I currently with my mother who drills the priority of studying into my brain. Although I understand studying, keep good grades, and getting a high ACT/SAT score is ideal for a brighter future, this is all I do at home. There is never much else for me to do. During the school year, I cycled between school work and piano. Now that it is summer, I cycle between learning next years material ahead of time, prepping for the ACT, applying to colleges, and Piano. 

‚ÄúBut Kai, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything wrong with that.‚Äù you may be thinking. This is where it starts to go downhill. 

Throughout high school, I have almost NEVER been allowed out of the house to hangout with people. My mother would have this ridiculous list of standards; ‚ÄúWhat are their parents‚Äô jobs?‚Äù , ‚ÄúAre they Christian?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo they have good grades?‚Äù, etc. If there were any boys involved, she would snap and the conversation was not to be brought up again. I understand a simple solution would be to let my friends and/or their parents meet my mother, but she never takes the time and doesn‚Äôt want to take the time to meet them. 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need friends.‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúThey just waste time and take away from your studies.‚Äù she said 

I have tried discussing with my mother about being pent up at home just studying is really degrading my mental health. At this point, I do not believe that having no friends is my source of being unhappy, but instead having no chance to really do anything different. Her reply is to yell and simply say, ‚ÄúIf you were busier, you wouldn‚Äôt have time to be depressed‚Äù before giving me a huge speech about how I do not have depression - which as much as I tell her I‚Äôm not very happy today, I never say I have depression - and to ‚ÄúLook at these several people who have it worse than you and are much happier. There is nothing for you to be depressed over.‚Äù

At this point, my goal is no longer to win such an argument, but rather what can I do to handle such situations at home and how can I possibly take time to make myself happier. This is only a fraction of what I go through at home, but it summarizes the majority of my situation. 

If you‚Äôve read it all the way. Thank you. I appreciate it very much, and if you have any suggestions or comments, please leave them down below. If you‚Äôd like to know something a little more personal, feel free to send me a private message. If the question is little too invasive, please do not take it personally if I reject to answer.

Thank you again,

159,"So the last year my grandmom has been obsessed with a clairvoyant that she watches on youtube, the woman basically says really stupid stuff about angels and dragons who'll apparently bring God's justice to Earth and that stuff? And the woman just realized that she won't be getting more money from her 10k subs unless she starts making up shit about her daughter getting kidnapped and raped and telepathically connecting with her mom? Jeez, it's completly cringe, fake and made up but my grandmom and her brother, who live with me, totally buy into this shit and won't stop talking about it all day.

&amp;#x200B;

I normally wouldn't mind, but jeez it's became annoying how much my grandmom tries to prove to me that the stuff she listens to is real, but the little things that I've heard are so stupid and senseless that I can't believe how my grandparents can buy into this. But the real question is... how do I let her know that I don't want to hear or talk about her beliefs? I've tried to explain to her how everything is a scam with facts but she doesn't care, so I gave up on that and just like I respect Christians, I gotta respect other non-damaging beliefs. 

&amp;#x200B;

But she tries so hard to convince me that I don't know how to let her understand that I don't believe anything she does and I also don't want to speak about it? If I just nod and say ""oohhh woah wow that's so wow"" she'll get more excited and want to talk to me about her stuff and I seriously can't fake that, it's just too much, faking my heterosexuality is far easier.

&amp;#x200B;

Any idea? I don't tell her facts anymore, I've tried to calmly tell her that I respect her beliefs but I don't share them and I don't want to speak about them but she won't stop. Everytime she brings the subject I start getting pissed because I feel she's not hearing me when I try to tell her, and it's damaging our relationship because I want to talk with her, I actually do it, but not about magical lizards and witches and made up youtube polemics.

160,"I've been used to working retail at various stores at the mall but this summer I got a job teaching little children how to bake at a summer camp.  I know I should be excited about this job but I'm also really nervous since I never worked with children before, or been in a setting where I'm teaching people how to bake. I also deal with anxiety and worry that I'm going to fail at my job and not be good at it. I've only cooked dinner for family once or twice a week and baked desserts for my family a few times throughout the year when I'm not at my college dorm.

161,"So, a quick description of what‚Äôs been going on:

I have a 2014 Ford Fusion 2.0 eco boost. It‚Äôs going on 90,000 miles and I had a P2099 engine code come up which means the car is under boost. It felt like the turbo was barely doing any work. I take it to a shop (not ford) and they say the problem is a cracked muffler, and I end up replacing that. One month passes and the code comes up again. Along with the turbo issue, the transmission is literal trash in that it‚Äôs laggy, and extremely jerky. I bring it to ford because I have a CPO and want to get it fixed under coverage. The ford rep told me they just flashed the ECU and cleared the code, and that for them to fix real problem I have to drive the car a certain amount of miles and then come back. Sounds sketchy, especially considering my warranty ends in 8 months. Advice on what to do? The flash helped the transmission but the turbo is still definitely messed up, lol.",14Jun2019,1
162,"This is very long so please bear with me.

So for a bit of context I have 4 siblings, the oldest (18m) of which has trisomy 9 and I am the second (15f) but am treated like the oldest because of my brother‚Äôs disability. The rest of my siblings are 14f, 11f and 9m. My parents are currently in the process of divorcing. Hopefully none of my family finds this post lol

My mom favors 14f above me by a lot and is constantly comparing me to her, giving her gifts and praising her appearance/behavior and doing quite the opposite to me. I‚Äôm not saying she doesn‚Äôt deserve it as she does a lot of housework along with me (my parents are almost never home, as they both work and try their best to avoid each other so 14f and I pretty much are raising my youngest two siblings and take care of 18m).

But here‚Äôs the catch. 14f and I are still just kids so obviously we‚Äôre going to screw up parenting every once in a while especially since we didn‚Äôt even ask to be doing this. 14f provides with me necessities like food water and bedtimes, and reminding them of homework and such. 14f does a lot of the cleaning (I help too but cleaning is mainly by her) while I do all the emotional stuff, i.e. somebody is bothering them at school and they need advice or they have questions regarding schoolwork or they need to vent and have someone to listen to. It is very emotionally draining but I listen every time because when I was their age I had nobody and it messed me up bad. But this situation they are in is seriously affecting them negatively to the point where 11f bullies 9m so badly I have to physically restrain her before she can hurt him more. He most of the time isn‚Äôt at fault but he is sometimes I do admit. They have a very hot/cold relationship because at times they also get along very well.

14f knows she‚Äôs favored. She does at times take advantage of this but it‚Äôs to be expected as she doesn‚Äôt seem to be very mature. I also listen to her when she needs to talk. Even still, nobody in my family listens to me at all and I am thankful to have a boyfriend who does so I‚Äôm not totally alone and can handle it.

Anyways. My dad has never been there for me or any of my siblings emotionally of physically even since he just goes to work and sleeps and rarely even talks to us and I‚Äôve grown to accept it and not care.

About 5/6 years back on the other hand my mom had breast cancer and had to do radiation and take medication for it and I don‚Äôt know if that was what caused her behavior to change drastically but it‚Äôs just a guess.

She would be very very abusive towards me and me only. None of my siblings got anything nearly as bad as what I did. A lot of the times my mom would wait until my siblings went to bed so that she could scream and yell and throw things at me (they are heavy sleepers) so that I would have no witnesses and nobody believed me because when company was over she was the nicest person alive.

But it was bad enough that I almost commit suicide several times. I was in so much pain and still am going through depression from it but I don‚Äôt think she truly knows how much she has damaged me. I have self harmed before but not much and have not in a long while though even still it is a temptation. I have scary hallucinations (auditory and visual) and am at times overly paranoid she will begin this behavior again or I don‚Äôt even know. I‚Äôve had panic attacks all the way to emotional numbness at times, and at other times I was flooded with this immense feeling of guilt for no apparent or legitimate reason. I have had a very very very difficult time focusing on things and I still do. I have physical injuries from straining my back and hips from carrying so many bins of laundry and children away from fighting each other etc. Doctor literally said so. In other words I was a train wreck but am a bit better.

The past year and a half she is still degrading and still puts me down often but she is nice to me now at times and I have more freedoms. It is a situation I can now breathe in even if it is just a tiny bit. I have recently after years of begging begun to see a therapist but have only been there twice so far so no difference yet. I still want to die very badly but would never actually do it. It‚Äôs more of a hope that something will happen rather than a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make it happen‚Äù kind of thing. Cleaning is the absolute worst because I‚Äôm in constant emotional (and physical) pain and the last thing I care about though it has to be done is just that. I don‚Äôt do a very good job at it because of those things and lately I have begun detaching myself from this family. Here‚Äôs where I need help.

This summer I‚Äôve almost never been home and I‚Äôve been the happiest I‚Äôve been in a long while. I feel incredibly guilty though as I know my younger siblings need me but I didn‚Äôt sign up for this at all. I‚Äôve been seeing my amazing boyfriend more now that my mom knows (the first like 3 years it was kept secret from her because of how my mom was) and it is still a secret from my dad. The relationship will be 5 years old this October and yes it‚Äôs healthy and yes we‚Äôre going strong. Now back to the point.

I haven‚Äôt been contributing nearly as much as I have in the past and I pretty much have begun locking myself in my room if I‚Äôm home to avoid what I always do and lately my mom‚Äôs been super stressed and is like ultra depressed lately and cries a lot and is going through a divorce so it‚Äôs difficult for her.

Whereas I‚Äôve been getting literally everything I‚Äôve wanted this summer (nothing materialistic but like all I‚Äôve wanted was to be free and able to leave my house and do things and have fun with friends/ my boyfriend). I‚Äôve been so much happier and for the first time in forever I‚Äôve felt hope for my future.

My mom is in so much pain and 14f has been yelling at me saying that now more than ever is when I should be helping out the most but it‚Äôs literally me sacrificing all of this mental progress I‚Äôve made but the right thing to do is to just go back to how I have been but frankly I really don‚Äôt want to. And my younger siblings need somebody to talk to and listen to them and my youngest brother most of all needs a protector. But it‚Äôs so so much and I‚Äôm finally feeling free and I feel incredibly guilty for not being as much of an active role in my family. What do I do? Do I wait until I am 18 to want to improve myself again because then I can move out? Once I do move out I am also thinking about minimizing any contact I‚Äôve had with them because of how miserable I was and how messed up I was because of the situation I was in but isn‚Äôt family important? I‚Äôm so lost and confused as to what I should do, anything at all would be appreciated",14Jun2019,1
163,"As the title reads I need some advice on talking to the wife about the amount of money she is giving to her church.

Have maybe been home for a total of 2 or 3 of those years, due to training and deployments. But she puts at least $800 (rough estimate) into this church. That includes choir robe cleaning, pastors birthday, mothers day, (pastor is a woman) vacation, and any thing else that we celebrate. On top of that church rent, special offering, tithes and offering. I mean I'm all for doing God's work and helping his people but I don't think this is right at all.

At first I thought nothing of it so I just carried on and got the groceries, but then when it was time to pay for them I thought she is actually pretty cute so let me go to the one she's working at, after waiting for the people in front of me to pay for their groceries my mom went up to get ready to pay for the food already. I forget if it was before or after my mom came the girl behind the register started staring at me for a really long time which made me feel real good and I did the same back and smiled at her.

166,"So I worked as a server in a fine dining restaurant. I have worked for the owners at 3 different restaurants and worked a lot of off sites for them and private home wine dinners they hosted. I worked very hard for them for 5 years we have gotten along really well since they hired me. 
We had got a new GM who has never been in fine dining before and he is just a real two faced  shit bag. 
So what happened was I had this table who have been in the restaurant before and I knew they spent big money. The last time they were in the restaurant they had a private party so we had their credit card on file and the instructions to put on an automatic gratuity of 30% on the bill. At the time I was getting the table situated and going over the menu for that night and getting their wine order, the GM showed me a text that the owner sent to him saying that he was bringing in a double magnum of 2005 Crystal Champaign and he paid $2500 for it and whoever could sell it for over that price would get to keep the difference. So I go back up to this table and offer it for $5000 and they said yes. So I was stoked that I was automatically getting $2500 from the owner for selling it. As I‚Äôm ringing in the order which was tedious because it was 13 people and 5 courses, the owner comes up to me and says that he didn‚Äôt really mean to say that in the text and it was a misunderstanding because he was voice texting but said he would give me a few hundred dollars for selling it. So I was already frustrated because of that. He can be shady like that sometimes. So after the dinner is through I told the guy at the table that I still had his card on file with the notes of the added gratuity and I asked him if he wanted me to use that card. He said no he would just use another card he had. So their tab came to about $7500 and I put the gratuity on there which was $2500. So it came to a total of just about $10,000. The guy ended up putting another $3000 tip on. All fine and dandy and I was so excited to have the best night of my life. Then 2 weeks later the guys assistant calls and said he forgot there was automatic gratuity and asked to be refunded back the extra $3000. I was kind of bummed but still had a good night at work so it was what it was. 
We also did team service at the restaurant so me and my partner from that night had to pay back $1500 each. My GM told me we could chip away it but to get it payed back as soon as possible. I had spent the money within a couple days to pay off some debt so I didn‚Äôt have the funds to pay it back right away. So over the next week I payed back a couple hundred dollars a night. Then my partner paid his portion back in full. I had paid about $800 back so it wasn‚Äôt going to take me long to finish paying it. Then we go into work one day and the GM sits us down saying the owner was hassling him about getting back the rest of the money and that they wanted to sick lawyers on us. Which was weird because my partner already paid what he owed and I was paying mine off daily. I just thought it was the GM being the douche he is and and using the ‚Äúowners hassling him‚Äù as an excuse so he didn‚Äôt look like the bad guy. So after this talk he proceeds to fire both of us for ‚Äúmisallocation of funds.‚Äù I messaged the owner thinking it was just the GM‚Äôs decision and he wasn‚Äôt even man enough to message me back. 
I live in AZ too so it‚Äôs a right to work state so you can be let go for any reason. So I am out of a job that I loved and dedicated a lot of time to. The situation from start to finish was just so bogus. I just don‚Äôt know what to do or how to feel about it all. Any words of wisdom, advice about any of it?",14Jun2019,2

169,"About 2 years ago my boss told me she‚Äôd had breast cancer, we chatted about it, I told her how my mum had breast cancer too etc.

6 months later a guy in my team dropped a hint that our boss was in the hospital that day. Obviously I was quite concerned and asked about it but he wouldn‚Äôt tell me. He actually seemed quite pleased that he knew why and I didn‚Äôt. He said he didn‚Äôt know if he was allowed to tell me.

Then a year ago my boss told the Management group she has cancer again and it eventually trickled back to me. I was shocked, I had genuinely thought she was in remission and fine. She‚Äôs really fast paced and high energy, you‚Äôd never guess.

Over the past 6 months I‚Äôve pieced together more information and have realised she‚Äôs told a lot of people but not me. This is a boss that offered to make my friends bridal shower cake for me a month ago. We‚Äôre on pretty friendly terms and we do trust and respect each other. There was the time I helped her plan a last minute getaway with her husband, and months later I find out it was a drug trial in another city. She asks me if her hair looks crap and I always tell it looks good (it does) but she said it‚Äôs from medicine she‚Äôs taking. She‚Äôs not dishonest, but she‚Äôs intentionally hiding it.

Ive stressed a lot about why she won‚Äôt tell me for ages, but I‚Äôve recently just accepted it. I‚Äôm never going to understand it and it could be a good sign or a bad sign that she won‚Äôt tell me. Hence why I accepted her offer to make the cake, she was so excited about it and I‚Äôm not meant to know so I guess she wants me to act like I don‚Äôt know.

But lately it‚Äôs getting harder to work with her. Her decisions are becoming more flippant, she‚Äôs taking more time off for treatment but doesn‚Äôt tell anyone she won‚Äôt be in. Yesterday she‚Äôd accepted a meeting I needed her to be at and then didn‚Äôt go because she was having treatment. Her energy levels are like a seesaw. It just feels like it would be easier if we were open about it now. I could just move our meeting you know?

170,"

So theres this guy let's call him John because its easier than typing this guy 

I don't know my own feelings towards John and yet it feels like I know his towards me. John and I have started talking more recently in the past few months. Before this we weren't ever close but we talked. I don't know when it started but at some point we started to talk more. This involved me stopping him in the hall to ask werid things and even walking with him at the end of the day. During most of this people shipped me and him ( he doesn't know about the ship at this point) because it started with one of my guy friends saying he has a gut feeling about this. Around this time I started putting notes underneath my desk (that clas was boring and they mainly consisted of doodles) and found out later John read them. Sometimes he would write back if there were any blank notes. I thought he found them annoying and I stopped. Eventually I found out he liked the notes from one of his friends and from there his friend (who shipps us) said I should write pickup lines on the notes underneath the desk. I did because why not and I asked my friend to find out his reaction (I'm not in the same class when he reads them). Apparently he looked away and smiled saying hell tell me later. Eventually he stops me in the hall and pulls out the notes and we talk about them. I said I did it because why not (its true) and that's that. Idk how long but at some point he finds out about the ship and talks to me about it. He asks what are my feelings towards him and I respond with you tell me first. John responds with sorry no and so do I. Months pass and me and John are still talking and at some point we started to get to know each other more and joke around more. He straight forward told me he didn't find me annoying and some other stuff. 
(I could into more stuff we've talked about and done but idk I feel like this is enough)

I don't my feelings towards John because idk if it's respect or if it something else. I know he doesn't like me in that way because he said so and honestly I don't think he ever showed it. Since its obvious he doesn't feel the same way how do I prevent my self from liking him?

172,"Hello. Sorry if this doesn‚Äôt make sense but I‚Äôll do my best to explain. I‚Äôm 21 and a girl. I suffer from major depression and anxiety and have been in therapy and medication for both. Things go up and down as they usually do, but the last few years have been rough. I have failed a lot of classes in school and I struggle to be around other people (anxiety). A lot of this is due to home environment and feeling like I just can‚Äôt go anywhere. My dad is very kind and tries his best to help and understand me, but there‚Äôs only so much he can do. My mother is quite abusive (emotionally). I love them both but it‚Äôs hard. I really want to move away. 


Recently I had a very awful fight with my mom (I live with her). At this point I‚Äôm having a mental breakdown and don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôll be safe if I stay here for much longer. I know my parents will be upset if I move away but I‚Äôm not sure what else I can do. I could move in with my dad but ultimately that will not solve my problems, even if he is nicer than my mom. 


My boyfriend and I have been together for a year (known each other for longer). He lives across the country but I told him about everything that happened and he said we can find an apartment or roommates together and work on things. When we have visited each other I always feel a lot calmer and safer and much less sad/anxious. He‚Äôs lived by himself and did fine but moved back in with parents to cut costs.


I want to ask if it‚Äôs okay to move away even if my parents will be upset? I know it‚Äôs weird to move in with a boyfriend and that will cause a lot of concern. I also know moving so far away will stress them out. However I really, really just want to get away. I don‚Äôt feel like staying here is good for my mental health and what‚Äôs happening here isn‚Äôt working. 


I thought of a plan where I can easily move away without saying a word (before I move, I fully intent to keep in contact after I move). I could also talk to them before I move but I know that will result in a really awful fight and probably start another mental breakdown. 


Any advice is welcome, just looking for some help. Thank you so much.",14Jun2019,2

174,My brother and sister in law asked me to be the Godmother to my nephew in December. His baptism is this Sunday and she emailed me telling me I was going to be the proxy for the godfather and her mentally abusive sister is going to be the Godmother. I have done so much for her more than her sister ever did and now she is taking the one thing from me this soon. I don't want to be the proxy because I feel that is a slap in the face to me and disrespectful. Should I still go to the baptism and just watch?

175,"The Accident:

My Dad is 83 years old.  He has had mobility issues (really bad balance and a shuffling walk) for years and a different diagnosis from every doctor he visited (from ""a series of untreated micro-strokes"" to a ""variant of Parkinson's"").

3 months ago he broke his leg/hip after a fall in the bathroom while wintering in Florida.  Since then he has been in a Florida hospital and a Florida assisted-living rehab center.

He can now shuffle (barely) on his own around a physical therapy room with a walker. He cannot ""do transfers"" (things like ""get out of bed"", ""get out of a chair"", ""climb stairs"", or ""walk over a big curb"") without professional assistance.  

The rehab center recently stated he's recovered as much as he's going to and wants to release him next week (a bit of a surprise because at the end of May they had a timeline of ""6-8 more weeks"" of therapy).  Or he can stay there if he's willing to self-pay.  That makes me think some insurance cap has been met.

Their Situation:

My Dad and his wife have a ""big retirement"" multi-story home (on stilts) in rural Maryland -- it is not handicapped friendly and is far away from hospitals.  It's like 30 minutes of driving through farms just to get to a stoplight.  They also have a small one-story home in Pennsylvania that is far more convenient to medical services (eg, in-home assistants).  The PA home has not been upgraded to be handicapped-friendly, but it'd be possible.

However, my Dad prefers the Maryland house to the Pennsylvania house and is intent on returning to Maryland.

They are also having money issues.  I believe selling the Maryland house would fix that -- but they have many excuses on why that isn't feasible (filled with their stuff, other houses in same community for sale, etc).  Pushing them on this just makes them mad and ends in ""My Dad just wants to die"" type ultimatums.  

My Situation:

I am exasperated with their inability plan.  I can't imagine the fear they are experiencing.  I live in California and can only visit for a few days at a time (putting my own career in jeopardy as this is emotionally heavy on me too).  

Last month I went to Florida for a week to allow his wife to travel to Pennsylvania to address some of her own medical issues and get the PA house prepped with an accessible shower and lots of hand-rails/ramps.

No prepping happened (an appointment with ""an architect"" was made, but she was unable to make that appointment).

I personally do not have the skills to remote-manage retrofitting the PA house to be handicapped friendly.  I do not believe they would cede control to me to ""go there and fix it for them.""  Especially since my Dad still has it in his head to go to Maryland.

I've given my Dad $30k since his accident to ""help with medical expenses"" but I don't know how that money has been used.  The advice I've been given so far is to ""go full 'tough love'"" and stop interacting with them until they focus on a realistic plan.

My Question:

Is that good advice?  Do you have any better advice on how to help them?",14Jun2019,1

I joined a band with some of my best mates and spend all day with them, I have my girlfriend of 4 years here working on her nursing degree, and I have the comfort of my own family here all the time. It‚Äôs a dream for me. Moving away for college wasn‚Äôt what I hyped it up to be.

I have a decently good engineering school in my home town, but it doesn‚Äôt have Aerospace Engineering, which I just got accepted to days ago at the solid school. I would have to switch to mechanical engineering if I moved back.

My parents spent close to $800 a month and dipped into a significant portion of my college fund so that I could attend my school of choice at the time. I feel terrible about this.

However, I believe that I could rack up many scholarships at my hometown university to pay for a large chunk of the rest of my schooling.

Lastly, I thought I could trick myself into losing my passion for music and gaining one for engineering, but I have found that I just can‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt want my parents to spend any large amount of money on something i‚Äôm only half-hearted about.

This is a complicated situation for both me and my parents, and i‚Äôm worried that they will be disappointed in me. I would love some advice on which direction to go.",14Jun2019,1
182,"Hi, I'm a 22yr old college drop out. I was raped in college... It led to me eventually developing a nasty case of ptsd and losing a scholarship. But the thing is, I HATED it when I was interning. I was studying to be a paralegal, but when I actually did my work study I thought it would EVENTUALLY get better, but after 8 months of it, I wasn't sure I couldn't do that full time for forever.

Now I just want to restart my life. I love cooking. It's the one thing I enjoy doing the most and constantly try to improve. My problem is that most culinary schools require a decent GPA, but by the time I left my previous school I had a 1.3. Recently I was accepted into a technical school. It doesn't have the fancy name, and I've only worked in a kitchen where the chefs went to Culinary Institute of America or somewhere well known (I really admire these people). I'm not sure if a technical school has any merit.  My goal is to work hard in this, get great grades, and the certificate that goes along with it. Can you go to an accredited culinary school after getting the certificate? I'm not sure how this works. 

My parents have been entirely negative. They look down on this sort of profession, and it irritates the hell out of me. I want to get out of their house, and understand I can ignore them. I haven't developed the best credit (300-400 range), so I just worry they wont sign for a loan.

Another problem is that since I was raped I've got a tough time interacting with people in general even with counselling. I used to have no problem walking into a room and introducing myself. How do I brush off this anxiety and jump into this new path that I want? I'm having a hard time taking any action, ie. calling the admissions office, scheduling appointments, ect.

My gf just graduated college recently and has no debts. She makes some money off of commissions and has about $700 saved right now. She also has a vehicle. We both own a snake, bearded dragon, and a cat.

We live with a family member currently, who's not charging for rent. My gf and I want to move into an apartment together soon, but I have so many questions about that. What should we look for? Where do we get furniture? How much should we save for it? Anything we should avoid?

I also have to get a new phone plan soon! I pay $75/mo for 3GB data and I own an iPhone. I want something cheaper and I was thinking of just getting a slide phone and keeping the iPhone at home. Is there a better idea or plan I could do?

189,"I‚Äôm a freshly graduated high-school senior (17f) and this guy recently started texting me exactly a week ago. He just turned 16 and is a rising high-school junior. I knew him from weight room class and I always thought he was kind of cute and had a good sense of style. We clicked sort of right away and found we have a few things in common such as being interested in anime.

I was initially thrilled because I thought we really hit it off and I‚Äôm usually not one to make new friends and am also pretty reserved so it was fun talking to him at first. I‚Äôm not one to jump into relationships and usually take years getting to know someone before dating them (I don‚Äôt date a lot lol). But, sometimes you can just kind of tell when you know, when the friendship is headed in tHaT direction.

I would also get additional scholarship money if I won again. Everything was going great, I had assumed I was well on my way to a fourth straight title to cap off my high school career but then a tall, boney sophomore girl started mowing through all of the other top candidates. She ended up making the championship where she would face of against me. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, as I had figured there‚Äôs no way a young girl would beat the experienced senior guy. 

I lost. This scrawny little girl beat me to win the trophy and scholarship money. The worst part is all my friends and fellow classmates saw it. I‚Äôm so humiliated. I‚Äôm not very used to losing and I know I probably sound like a spoiled brat but I just can‚Äôt get over the fact that only one person, a girl of all people, stood between me and my destiny.

193,"So my grandparents like to ‚Äúforce me to have fun‚Äù. They think that everyone has fun doing certain things, and that if they make me do them enough, I‚Äôll learn to like it. 

I hate amusement parks. I hate the heat, the large crowds, the long lines, and the roller coasters. Boy do I hate roller coasters. 

I have always hated amusement parks. When I was five, they took me to Disneyland, and I honestly didn‚Äôt like it. They forced me to go on rides I was afraid of multiple times, even after telling them after the first time I didn‚Äôt want to go on them again. 

Every year until I was about thirteen they forced me to go to the county fair with them because I would have fun, even though every year I told them I hated it. When I was thirteen they finally decided I was ‚Äútoo old‚Äù and, to my relief, stopped taking me. 

When I was twelve, they took me to Disneyland for my birthday. I tried to have a good time and enjoy myself because I knew it was really expensive and that I should be grateful that they spent all that money. They forced me to go on the biggest roller coaster at California Adventure (I think it was called California Screamin‚Äô, I believe it has since been renamed) three times. I told them I didn‚Äôt even want to go on it the first time. They told me I‚Äôd be ruining their vacation if I didn‚Äôt. 

Every time I bring up not liking Disneyland or the fair, or any other amusement park they‚Äôve ever forced me to go to, they insist that I did indeed have fun. I have no say in the matter. I had fun at Disneyland, and that‚Äôs that. I‚Äôve flat out told them I do not want to go to Disneyland again. They don‚Äôt agree. Clearly I want to go back because I had fun right? 

In June of next year, when I graduate from high school, they want to take me to Disneyland again. No matter how many times or how many different ways I tell them I do not like amusement parks, that I hated Disneyland and don‚Äôt want to go back, they don‚Äôt listen. By then, I‚Äôll be 18 and they technically can‚Äôt force me to go, but the fact remains that they think they‚Äôre going to spend all sorts of money to try to force me to enjoy myself, and it‚Äôs just not going to work.

My grandparents are not the kind of people you can so no to. They are going to keep on insisting that I do want to go to Disneyland, going as far as to book time and buy tickets, no matter how many time I tell them I‚Äôm not going. And when the time comes to leave, I‚Äôm either going to go because they spent all that money, so I might as well, or I‚Äôm going to refuse and they‚Äôre going to be very angry.

He quit his job because his schedule was being changed and didn‚Äôt try to look for a new one. I have told him to get a job at Walmart, but he straight up refused. Instead of looking for a job, he blew most of his retirement money on $2,500 worth of photography equipment (which he has literally no skill in). Once we ran out of that money, he started ‚Äúborrowing‚Äù money from me, my sister, and my grandma. Today, he owes me around $1,400, owes my sister around $2,500, and around $6,000 to my grandma. She is retired and gets money from social security every month. To this day, the basic expenses are covered from her money. I feel so terrible about it, but I can‚Äôt do anything to help. I‚Äôm only 15 and can‚Äôt get a job in my state. I‚Äôve tried mowing lawns back when my dad‚Äôs mower worked, but everyone I went to already did it themselves. My dad‚Äôs car got repossessed in January of 2018 and since then I really haven‚Äôt gone anywhere. All I ever do is sit in my room either on reddit or watching YouTube. My computer barely works anymore, and I‚Äôm surprised it still is. It‚Äôs so slow to where I can barely run a flash game on chrome. I‚Äôm gonna try to not go into too much detail but here‚Äôs what has been happening:

I live in Florida and have no air conditioning. It‚Äôs been broken for 11 months now. Back in May, it would get up to 105 degrees F in my house.

My dad is refusing to get a job, even a minimum wage.

I‚Äôm stuck in my house all day because my family doesn‚Äôt have a car. All I have is my phone to keep myself entertained.

My house was supposed to get auctioned off in May, but it was rescheduled for August. And once it happens, I have nowhere to go. Not to mention my house is in terrible condition. The toilets don‚Äôt work, only 1 shower works, the septic system is clogged, and most of the appliances are broken (fridge, washer/dryer, freezer)

My dad is VERY verbally and emotionally abusive to me and my mom. He can‚Äôt control his temper and throws a fit over the smallest things.

Now, I would‚Äôve already called the cops and had him arrested, but...

I have quite a few pets, cats and dogs, and if I were to call cops to my house they would take the pets and probably euthanize all of them. Also, my mom might get arrested too since she is my parent and is supposed to take care of me. Although I don‚Äôt blame her one bit. I‚Äôve talked to her many times and she feels extremely bad about the situation, but she can‚Äôt do anything either. She could get a job but that would require a car as I live in a rural part of town. And if I were to call the cops, I would most likely be placed in the foster system. I have thought about running off, but I have nobody to stay with and no money.

199,"Before anyone says that this is about a lack of patience, I want you to picture scenarios where it could in fact be rude.

For instance, an advantage of text is both parties can answer at their own leisure, but if it's known between the two that there is no real excuse for avoiding a question, and one still spends 10-minutes between texts that just say ""yeah,"" or ""cool,"" or seem to avoid engaging on the level that is expected or reflective of what they received.

I feel like a stooge when I send a sentence, and get one-word texts that only take a moment. Especially if they leave hanging the deeper question of the text. For instance, if I ask: ""are you going to be there much longer?"" and the response is ""a little bit,"" 10 minutes after the deeper question is actually, ""May I visit you at [said location]?"" 

It's known to both that the answer will be ""yes,"" but the person receiving should have just said earlier, ""you can come over if you want to.""

The problem is upon arrival, they might both be upset. Person 2, we'll say Jonah, says, ""what is with you getting mad at one word texts?"" And person one says they sound rude and lazy, if not downright angry, and like you want them to not hang out. Jonah can plausibly deny any of these interpretations, even if Person 1 was hurt over the sudden rudeness and flat tone! ""I talk to all of my friends this way,"" Jonah says.

I‚Äôm in the point where she tells me she doesn‚Äôt want to speak with him but I want to try and make a move what should I do?,14Jun2019,1

206,"For as long as I remember I have lied and tell lies about almost everything, there are the dumb ones, like my pretending to be Venezolana to a taxi driver because he was trying to hit on me to very serious like, never telling my mom for six months that I didn't finish high school.  
Supposedly, I'm in my second year of college, have friends and go to the gym.  
In real life, I only pass one class, haven't go to classes in 2 months and have barely interacted with another human.

208,"I‚Äôm going to try and sum this up best I can.

I used to work Tues-Sat. We kept getting busier and my supervisor consistently asked me to work Mondays as well. This went on for a couple of months until I told my supervisor he needs to find someone to cover Saturdays if he wants me to work every Monday. So we went back to the original rotation of coordinators covering every 7th Saturday. My manager caught on and asked us to quit beating around the bush, are we deciding to make my shift Mon-Fri. My supervisor said yes and that was it. Email notifications were sent out and that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been for almost 2 years. 

Now today, my new supervisor told me that they want to move me back to Tues-Sat, citing that the original change of my hours to Mon-Fri didn‚Äôt go through the proper channels. I told her that if they want to move me back to Tues-Sat they will need to involve Employee Relations because it is wholly unacceptable to say proper channels were not followed. If they hadn‚Äôt been followed, they should have made the correction at the time of the decision instead of not doing anything about it for 2 years. I told her the precedent has been set by allowing it for so long and again told them to include ER in any further discussions about it. 

She left to meet with my manager, I went back to work. I was pulled off the floor into my manager‚Äôs office now, and was told that I misinterpreted what was said. They didn‚Äôt say I was being moved back to Saturdays. They wanted to see me take it as a challenge to correct the OT that is required on Saturdays. They said instead I just jumped to conclusions. They said I should have known that they wanted me to see it as a project opportunity instead of what was clearly communicated to me by my supervisor while she was reviewing notes she took in a meeting earlier in the day... about me moving to Saturdays. 

It seems that they expected me to be a pushover and just say ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù like I usually do. But to be perfectly honest, I‚Äôve had enough of their antics and am no longer afraid to call Employee Relations. Once I mentioned  ER they drop it entirely and try to make me believe I somehow got it all wrong. 

Am I crazy? Or are they gaslighting me?

If they are gaslighting me, how can I best combat it?

Sorry to make my short story long. Thanks for any advice.",14Jun2019,2

210,"My crush began during my sophomore year, it wasn‚Äôt too big of a crush but enough to know that it was nice. She worked at the school store as a class with my senior friend (who is in a relationship with another) and I would always come around and say hi to the both of them. Mostly everyday after eating lunch on my lunch period on my way to the library. I didn‚Äôt know to much of her then, but her being her was cool to see. Now just about a week ago I see her at my senior friends grad party with some other familiar faces (friends of my senior friend). 

We start watching our friend play overwatch, I make jokes and I get a few good laughs (felt good) my senior friend Brian (a friend of the seniors grad party) commentated to the online chat of the game how bad our friend is playing. 


Anyway after people started leaving it just came to my good friend Aidan who is also an ongoing junior as myself, Brian, and the girl I liked Grace.

We started talking as a group and decided to play some Minecraft. She loved the game and even had a PC where she played Minecraft, she was the best like I have ever seen in a person. She is the whole package - beautiful smile, fantastic personality, loves psychology, and just loves to have fun. She even knows more Minecraft than me, she said mobs don‚Äôt spawn on slabs (something I never knew). She likes Minecraft, she likes to have fun, and she likes the endeavor of psychology the why we do things. She thinks it‚Äôs so amazing how the brain works in its own way for every individual. She‚Äôs all out on what she‚Äôs interested in, that‚Äôs truly beautiful to me. 

After we played a bit of Minecraft on the Xbox and after ‚Äúhaving to go vegan‚Äù under her discretion to not kill any animals (until she later did the same thing) and some funny jokes that got me in the spotlight for being sexist (not that I am they just joked on me for a bit).

We played Pool (8 ball, for all those game pigeon ppl), and we had a tournament with all the people at the grad party. I was paired with my bro Aidan and Grace with Brian (they are just friends). We DESTROYED THE COMPETITION GOT ALL THE HOLES IN ONE LIKE HOLLLY..... Well I had like a 5 shot streak and after that everyone who almost beat us at the end SCRATCHED THE 8 Ball (look it up). But we were against Grace and Brian (not the championships of the tournament, I‚Äôm not good at chronological order in typing this). We INSTANTLY WON, they had first shot And BRIAN dun messed up. 

I say HECK NO WE START A GAME AND WE PLAY A GAME ‚Äúok..‚Äù Brian agreed. I helped Grace with her shots and how to align the ball to ball to each other and make shots in angles and such. I didn‚Äôt really care if we win or lost but just being there helping her and talking to her and just seeing her smile in a funny situation made the best of me come out. 

After we won the tournaments, we practiced pool with Grace and Brian taking turns, I talked to Grace and continued to help her out while she laughed at me, but throughout the whole party I don‚Äôt know if she genuinely is interested in me the way I am to her. I know not to rush things from the way they are now, but then again nothing will happen if I ever do.

She is my best person. I ignore the butterflies in my stomach just to look at her and smile, to talk and to play Minecraft is the best with her.


She has a PC, Brian has a good enough gaming laptop, and my bro Aidan just built his PC. And I still learning of PCs (I‚Äôm getting there I know like 55-65%). Brian made a group chat with the four of us and he plans to make a Minecraft server with all of us to join and build together. 

I don‚Äôt have enough money yet to buy all the PC parts I need, I have listings on EBay, for a PS4 and other stuff and my saved money so I can buy a PC and play Minecraft (and other personal stuff). 

I know, why spend so much time on a PC, bc i enjoy games especially with her,

I don‚Äôt know what to say to her that I like her, or I should just remain in that position, I don‚Äôt want to rush something that‚Äôs not even there, but I hope it doesn‚Äôt leave me before hand.

WELP, my hands half asleep and so am I, thanks for all those who read through this, (u awesome) pls say some advice what I should do.

I really appreciate for everyone who read and answered, something awesome is in my life and I don‚Äôt want to mis-opportune it.

213,"A  really long backstory. please read everything. I'm pouring my heart out you, internet friends. Please. 

 I am a straight dude who's into chicks(I don't know how that helps this story but whatever)
 
- My best friend (Girl ) S

-A guy called P. 

-Their common friend M. girl. 

-Really really best friend of S who's a dude(they used to study in the same class in school for 2 years) named D, although who lives faraway from here, but D &amp; s talk everyday, they have been friends for the last 5-6 years.

-And everyone is a virgin,  sexually inexperienced person in this story(allegedly.......... I don't know why but i don't trust people, even if they told me something they swear they are telling the truth), except M. 

-And I am the most inexperienced guy here, even for talking to girls. Not the super shy guy, just that, I never tried much coz i felt weird, insecure, too potty mouth, or generally wasn't brave enough, or wasn't interested enough. Or maybe I thought trying too hard is also weird. I had some excuse. 
-Things like this story might be super common or trivial in some places around the world, or even my in own country, and not be worth of getting a headache, but still, I am in an emotionally painful uncharted-waters kind of  place.
-and also, I live in a place where people are quite old fashioned about relationships, male-female friendship. And the people involved in them also blur the line between the two often. India.




Me and other students thought they(s&amp;p) were a couple for at least 1 year. I am a student in a college. Everyone in the class(including me, although i didn't give a shit) thought of them as a couple, and I am the type of guy who only talks to girls if they are into shit/poop/dirty jokes. Basically I was a loner, backbencher kinda guy, who is only part of the group to make jokes. never had a gf. virgin.  21. if that makes things even more clear. 
Everyone thinks I have a dirty mouth but a real simpleton at heart. Like rreallll simple, to the point where they think I am not adult enough. That annoys me so much!!! I don't know what to do.

For the last 2 years of the college(not including our 6-8 months friendship after the 2 years, which started from sept 2018 i guess. so from April '16 to August '18 we were just 2 strangers), S and I talked like 4 sentences. 


But in the year 2018, sept, I started talking to her more(I don't know how, but i guess organically it started one day  as I was joking around in a small class) , and as I got to know more about her, I got to know that the guy P is not her bf, but actually a creepy friend(mild creep with obsessive habits). I was friends with P, and I was not aware of this habit of his.  He got so close to her because of a common friend between S &amp; P, she is M. She was like an elder sis to both of them, and she was a senior student.....they respected her a lot. 


So this M kind of persuaded S to talk to P, coz P's father passed away, he's a sad guy, he has a lot of emotional baggage at home, just talk to him as a friend. P is a really good guy at heart who takes care of everyone,real responsible guy. S said ok and started talking to him. But P had ulterior motives. By that I mean he was always Romantically interested in her, and also was physically attracted to her(he wanted sex basically....as S said to me about him, P only wanted her body, so he was going to extreme lengths of being humble, overly helpful friendship, although not an excuse, was kind of iffy, where you start talking to someone on the sole basis of getting them to like you by trying really hard.......   I mean he really crushed on her hard and tried to get closer to her sexually speaking, but also loved the emotional support as a friend she used to give, and let me tell you- S is kind of that girl who asks a lot of questions to people she thinks are ok, and you can imagine how it feels to be, if someone is interested in your life..... however it may be sad or happy life, you know, center of attention, and that too, from a girl P crushed on). I guess the frequency of the talks between the two were quite high.
 

 S said to me that although she got close to him as a friend, she told him about many things of her life, he told her every  fucking thing about his, she hated even if he touched her. Even on her hand/shoulder whatever. 


This continued till Oct 2018, when we were walking to our homes (its really close to the college. P thought of dropping S while blah blahing all the way till the home, and then coming back to his....me, 2 friends, S&amp; p were the people going together). I thought enough is enough. I calmly said to P, just let her go and leave her alone. This got into a fight which could have been a physical altercation but only got limited to a war of words and emotion, which was a lot to me, my first time. and it still is. This comes back to me again and again. its so bothersome.


Because of this incident, me and S got even more closer. add to that the fact that, one day(sometime in November) she had a fight with D, which somehow brought us even more close, as I was there for her on that day. and yet another fact that, one day she got so ill that she fainted, and i helped her to get to hospital, which she thought was very nice of me.... although i was just really confused and scared because I have never done such a thing.  that fight got resolved between s &amp; d. but i became one of her besties, she said this thing one day( she has total of 3 besties, and now i was another one). i don't know why, but maybe because of my kind-of-shy,kind-of-simple attitude, i thought this gesture from her, this very statement from S, really got me from the inside. Like really slowly it got inside me.  and i was happy. 


So we became besties who used to hang out and talk about shit to each other, swap stories, although a lot of times, the conversation went into the direction about P &amp; D. I guess i was insecure, jealous that how can she be so much attached to D, who is not here, with whom she promises that they never had any physical relationship. And what must I do to get closer too. I guess I was kinda jealous immature about this now that I think.  I never ever said that to her aloud, or in any way,  to not talk with him. But maybe, I think she could gauge that out of the conversation, although that is maybe unclear to me. And I was particularly more interested in a weirdly jealous way, of how P got this close to her. I used to repeat some of the same questions to her. 

I don't know, but I always had this nagging feeling at the back of my head that always comes forward when I'm talking to someone i adore/like/am  interested in(not just romantically speaking), that I am not funny enough, not entertaining enough, not interesting enough, not asking thought provoking questions, not asking CORRECTLY about something trivial yet something that shows that a person is interested in your life(like how's your brother's health, how's his gf, hows his dog, did you eat that leftover chicken from the morning or something).....After I ask the basic questions....like only 3 basic questions, and 2 jokes, 4 funny stories from my life, I start giving out philosophical advices about things I read from forums, that I have no experience about whatsoever,  only thing left inside me is everything I know  from the internet, from people who have done more fantastic things than me....or from more interesting &amp;  entertaining funnier classmates. The feeling that How can I be more engaging, and how can I make someone like me, or be interested in me more, how to be less jealous, more mature, eats me every day. I tend to act like a pseudointellectual i feel.  
And some days, talking to her felt liberating, entertaining, enjoyable, and exhausting also(especially wheN i Started rambling about my Internet learned philosophy).

So this continued till Jan '19, when P's sister passed away. This made S really very sad, coz she had talked to her a couple of times and she seemed really nice. Everyone from M, classmates started telling S to at least talk to P briefly but she did not, not because she is an unemotional rock, but because of P's nature, and she came to know about this 4-6 days later, which made S feel that, P might be in a depressed state, her coming back to his life at this sad moment will be too much. Something along that lines.  Even D adviced her to do so, and I also said to her, but only once. I don't know why, but maybe it was my jealousy and hatred towards P that was speaking, or was it something else, I didn't push her to do so. But S did message him, about a month after that. 3 lines. nothing more nothing less.


Fast forward some 2 months, S was going to visit her Mom-Dad's home. I stay with my family......And it was my dad's bday, me &amp; mom were celebrating it although  he was some place far from home, for his work. I was in a good mood. S went to the train station, P got to know about this, and reached the station. How he could do it? because he also lived with some of his buddies, miles away from his mom's home, more flexible timing to go out and do stuff.   Me and S were messaging each other when I got to know about this. I was super pissed, annoyed and upset.  Why I didn't go to drop her off myself? she insists that she can go herself. And my mom is the kind of person who gets really concerned if her only child will go to some place , at night, to drop a GIRL! Real old fashioned I know. 

So the next day I send her a really long message, akin to this post, about what attracted me to her, i mean why i liked to spend my time with her, and how  i warned her that if you give me just a iota of hope,just as an old friend, that shithead will irritate you more.  how I'm really tired of dealing with this bullshit, why do you even bother with him.

 and she says nothing happened,  he didn't do anything. And neither did she. But she said these words that ""maybe you don't understand me"". Because I guess my anger and pissines showed my immaturity or jealouy or something. That hit me. 

she comes back, i try to clarify....maybe justify, if you must..... that it was because of P that I got pissed, i was only caring &amp; thinking about  her. Like really try to be clear as much as possible. She says cool. but she can take care of herself . But during that time, she gets realllly into this game PUBG. now I must tell you she isn't a gamer at all. But D convinces her, and she also wants to connect with him, and I was being a moody guy but now better.......with a reason i already told her. 

But now here's the thing when it really started ....she starts replying to my messages in one words , my interactions with her which were previously more joky, now feel like she's closed from me, I can feel that. now P has also started trying to talk with her more often. I see, but don't say much, cause he will go away if she won't give him attention.  my interactions with her are reduced. 

She goes to her Parents home once again aftr 20 days. I'm really missing all the talking with her, as she has built a wall against me, and she's gaming all day. I only got to play with her a 2-3 times....just so I can connect with her when she was here.  Such a kid-like thought. 
So I message her a very small &amp; formal message of ""hey, hello have a nice day"" kind of thing in PUBG chat...... which her older sister saw. The thing is, whenever S went home, her sister was not with them as she was doing a job. super busy.  Here's the thing. Her sister is a BIIGG prude.  S had already gotten into trouble before, for talking with D , 3--4 Years back, because he's a boy. the sister really scolded the shit out of her. so much that she's still careful about it. I knew her sister was coming.....I didn't know about, if anyone really read those messages, but she did, when she was teaching her sister the game.


She came back really pissed. told me the reason. i say sorry. she says cool.  I think the matter has been cool.we can be back to being best friends

But now she seems even more distant &amp; cold. Doesn't reply much, you know. 
P starts trying to talk to her again. she doesn't care much.  

The college fest comes. The senior M, who knew about both of them, comes and talks to both of them. P tries. S reluctantly listens .I have never talked to M. and now that she has been so distant to me, I don't introduce myself to M, and also, she's visiting them after a long time, I don't wanna be the idiot. 

Pre-finals(theres this thing which is preparation for the final exams) are near, I get to talk to S, but only for 5-10 minutes, I ask about what you &amp; M  talked, how is she, and about some help for the exams. she tells everything matter of factly, as if I am conducting a formal interview. I feel the same way when me &amp; my dad talk.  So i mention this awkwardness 2-4 times. She says  yes. thats true. Then cuts the call. seems as if she has lost the interest. 

I ask her for some notes for a subject for exams, she helps but not much, coz she isn't writing it. But helps. 2 days later, I ask for the notes of another subject. She blocks me! I try to ask her the reason, in person, she ignores me when I call out her name! 

And now I find out, P is talking to her quite confidently and cheerfully, helping her buy some medicine, food stuff like that. Although S's attitude is still like ""ok ok..... I don't give a shit but whatever. he's helping where i can't, cool. But seriously I don't need your help"". And I can't do anything about it. This is just what happens in front of me. I don't know what happens behind my back.

There's a mutual friend between me and S, who talked with her recently. She gives half hearted replies to her also.  The mutual friend told me that S's health is not so good. 

There's a small vacation of 15 days the college gives,  to study for the Finals. I try to ignore. But everything comes back every day 

Now the Final exams start, where we see each other, but ignore the presence of each other. She talks to almost all the people quite happily and cheerfully, except me, especially to this  guy, who's nice......and cute in a justin Bieber kind of way......and kind of reminds me of myself (but he's more of an athlete....so I guess he's better than me :-\) who's designated seat is to sit behind her during the exams. It has been this way for the last 2 years.  She used to help him since  the last 2 years, but I don't know why, I feel real jealous now. 

I have a feeling that she's been fighting with D and has been like that since  the pre-finals. And P got the help of M to talk to her. And because I was being a difficult person and kind of troublesome, she started ignoring me real hard since the fight between her and D. And her own health. And  yes, her mom's health has also been slightly bad too(she underwent chemotherapy...she always complains about the pain quite frequently, and then there's her sister's arrange marriage that needs to be taken care of). And maybe, I think she has been chatting with P frequently too, and maybe also the Justin Bieber guy. I guess, THAT makes her happy now. But this entire thing is a big maybe. Everything is a  hunch here, depending on a probability. 



Everyone has some kind of problem in their life here, . And the Bieber boy . Even D, whos mother has been really really weak for a long time. P is like the creepy poor Bruce Wayne i guess. And she has her own problems. Except me,  who started out as a fun loving joky guy, but now has become a jealous creepy obsessive fool. 

I try to ignory everything. But I'm questioning everything everyday, how I can go back to that happy place, where both of us can talk happily, I make her happy. And talking to her and making her laugh makes me happy. 

Maybe she was my friend, so I may have given her a very positive light. Or some other person might have been shown more negatively. 

I don't know if this is emotionally cheating. Or just that she's bored and tired. 

It just hurts too much seeing her Happy, but not being part of her life. 

How can I redeem myself? How can everything be cleared? 

This is too much of a drama that I can handle in a single year.

219,"When I was in middle school I met a girl that really didn't have many friends but I still liked her. Anyways, we were really good friends for about 3 years or so and then we became boyfriends. I have to say that we didn't even last a week, all she did was talk to me on the phone ALL DAY (from 3 p.m. that we got out of school to about 11 p.m. when she went to sleep). I broke up with her and surprisingly she was ""cool"" with it and we continued as friends. About 2 and a half years ago  I moved to the U.S. (lived in Mexico previously) and became a bit more distant. Even though we broke up A LONG time ago, she gets super jealous when I talk about other girls but it's apparently fine when she talks about other boys (I really don't mind, since I wanted to break up and only see her as a friend). A few months ago she called me at 2 in the morning threatening to take her life and I effectively calmed her down (even though I don't want to talk to her, I don't want her to die either).
Since then all she wants is to talk with me and her jealousy has decreased but I'm no psychologist and I miss talking to her like we used to do, I don't feel comfortable talking with her anymore and I'm afraid she could kill herself if I just stop messaging her, what do I do?",14Jun2019,1

We both write, so had head worlds we liked to RP for fun when we had time. But we also just generally supported each other when we needed it. When I say literally talked everyday, it pretty much was that. We have never met in person, I guess that is important too. 

Then one day she just.... Vanishes for months. I was worried if she was ok. Stuff was being put on her IG, so I figured she needed some private time. Ok Fine. Take your time. My messages generally went unanswered, but things looked ok so I just... Backed off.

I find out after almost NO, barely any except a few words, contact for months that she got an SO around the time she stopped talking to me. This is where I am horribly conflicted. Through talking to her, they have been actively talking and doing whatever they do, (LDR) or so I understood it. 

What made it hurt was that I was severely depressed at the time. Was close to homelessness and had moved to a new state a few months prior and things were not working out for me. I had literally nobody to speak to. I had almost no family to talk to. No other friends who I trusted. I was all alone and to find out after the fact that she was chasing a relationship when I was contemplating suicide HURTS. I needed someone and she wasnt there or didnt know. I am unsure if she knew how mentally unsettled I was at that time. Over the last year I have struggled with my mental stability. I have someone else I can talk to now, but sometimes I wish I could talk to my previous friend. 

Maybe I was just a toxic person? Horribly depressed and suicidal but too toxic? Like fine but fucking tell me, dont ghost me? Dont ghost a suicidal person.

I know nothing of her new life. I am told nothing. So apparently I am not worth talking to anymore. I am NOT in love with this girl. I am Aro/Ace, however I feel like I got dumped. As if the last many years and talks and adventures in our headworlds and all the information we shared suddenly meant nothing to her because she has a tail to chase now. They are super happy, which is awesome. I want her happy, she deserves it, but I am so hurt inside too. I feel abandoned again. This is not the first time someone I knew, spent a lot of time being friends with, suddenly ghosted me for a new SO. It is worth noting that I do have abandonment issues. My family was NOT kind to me, and I do not get along with any of them due to some of the mental and physical stuff that happened as a kid.  I have PTSD and hide away from most people, so making friends is hard. I made friends with her and trusted her. She almost felt like a younger sister to me. 

Now we exchange a few words maybe once a week. I am torn because on one hand I am SO PISSED OFF that she is treating me like this. But on the other hand, she has a girlfriend now and she is happy. I want her to be happy. But I want my friend back and I know I will never have it back the way it was. 

I am angry.
I am sad. 
I am hurting, like how your heart feels like it is falling out of your chest. 
I am missing my friend so much. 

However

I want her happy. 
I want my friend back.
I want to just scream and yell at her and ask why she did this. Why suddenly our friendship doesnt matter. 

But that would chase her away. We did discuss the matter a little bit, but I was not 100% honest with her out of fear of chasing her away withnmy true honest feelings. I know how I feel is wrong because I have never met or talked to this other person. I have no right to keep her to myself.

But I have very very few friends and I hate losing them. Especially the ones who I felt closest to. 

Is it wrong to feel like I was treated unfairly?

Is it wrong that I have a simmering anger against her SO? Almost...blame her?

Is it wrong that I look at her profile and artwork and posts, a year after all this happened and STILL get angry or sad over this?

How can I move forward? I dont want her out of my life, we do still talk sometimes, though I feel like it is just shallow talks and usually her just showing me her artwork. I want her in my life but I dont? I feel like she moved on so easily from me, ghosting me, that she wouldnt miss me...

223,"So, here‚Äôs what happened. I moved into a two bedroom apartment paid my deposit and rent and signed up to mdu (Montana-Dakota Utilities Co) I unfortunately forgot to forward my mail to my new apartment and had some mailing issues for about 2-3 months and didn‚Äôt receive any mail. My mail would end up in random places such as my brother, sisters and even neighbors mailbox. So I didn‚Äôt really know if I had any bills coming in. To be honest and looking back I should‚Äôve called them to know if I was actually being billed for the power I was using. When I did call them, they told me I had an overdue bill of about 60 bucks. I agreed to pay the bill because again, it was my fault for letting the bill go overdue without paying it (Here‚Äôs where shit gets stupid though) After paying the bill in full, they decided to take my name off the account and put it under my landlords name. I figured it was a mistake, so I called them to put my name back on the account. They refused and demanded I pay a reinstatement fee plus a few other fees on top of that, adding up to a 2 -3 hundred dollar bill. After I refused to pay the bill they begin to bill my landlord monthly power bills. Which would‚Äôve been too bad if the company I rent though didn‚Äôt charge me a fine for every bill they pay for me. I personally think mdu knew this and was purposely sending bills to intentionally pressure me to pay the reinstatement fee. I paid the whole bill (while it was still in my name) so I don‚Äôt see why I should pay a reinstatement fee. Give me some advice reddit!",14Jun2019,1
224,"A  really long backstory. please read everything. I'm pouring my heart out you, internet friends. Please. 

 I am a straight dude who's into chicks(I don't know how that helps this story but whatever)
 
- My best friend (Girl ) S

-A guy called P. 

-Their common friend M. girl. 

-Really really best friend of S who's a dude(they used to study in the same class in school for 2 years) named D, although who lives faraway from here, but D &amp; s talk everyday, they have been friends for the last 5-6 years.

-And everyone is a virgin,  sexually inexperienced person in this story(allegedly.......... I don't know why but i don't trust people, even if they told me something they swear they are telling the truth), except M. 

-And I am the most inexperienced guy here, even for talking to girls. Not the super shy guy, just that, I never tried much coz i felt weird, insecure, too potty mouth, or generally wasn't brave enough, or wasn't interested enough. Or maybe I thought trying too hard is also weird. I had some excuse. 
-Things like this story might be super common or trivial in some places around the world, or even my in own country, and not be worth of getting a headache, but still, I am in an emotionally painful uncharted-waters kind of  place.
-and also, I live in a place where people are quite old fashioned about relationships, male-female friendship. And the people involved in them also blur the line between the two often. India.




Me and other students thought they(s&amp;p) were a couple for at least 1 year. I am a student in a college. Everyone in the class(including me, although i didn't give a shit) thought of them as a couple, and I am the type of guy who only talks to girls if they are into shit/poop/dirty jokes. Basically I was a loner, backbencher kinda guy, who is only part of the group to make jokes. never had a gf. virgin.  21. if that makes things even more clear. 
Everyone thinks I have a dirty mouth but a real simpleton at heart. Like rreallll simple, to the point where they think I am not adult enough. That annoys me so much!!! I don't know what to do.

For the last 2 years of the college(not including our 6-8 months friendship after the 2 years, which started from sept 2018 i guess. so from April '16 to August '18 we were just 2 strangers), S and I talked like 4 sentences. 


But in the year 2018, sept, I started talking to her more(I don't know how, but i guess organically it started one day  as I was joking around in a small class) , and as I got to know more about her, I got to know that the guy P is not her bf, but actually a creepy friend(mild creep with obsessive habits). I was friends with P, and I was not aware of this habit of his.  He got so close to her because of a common friend between S &amp; P, she is M. She was like an elder sis to both of them, and she was a senior student.....they respected her a lot. 


So this M kind of persuaded S to talk to P, coz P's father passed away, he's a sad guy, he has a lot of emotional baggage at home, just talk to him as a friend. P is a really good guy at heart who takes care of everyone,real responsible guy. S said ok and started talking to him. But P had ulterior motives. By that I mean he was always Romantically interested in her, and also was physically attracted to her(he wanted sex basically....as S said to me about him, P only wanted her body, so he was going to extreme lengths of being humble, overly helpful friendship, although not an excuse, was kind of iffy, where you start talking to someone on the sole basis of getting them to like you by trying really hard.......   I mean he really crushed on her hard and tried to get closer to her sexually speaking, but also loved the emotional support as a friend she used to give, and let me tell you- S is kind of that girl who asks a lot of questions to people she thinks are ok, and you can imagine how it feels to be, if someone is interested in your life..... however it may be sad or happy life, you know, center of attention, and that too, from a girl P crushed on). I guess the frequency of the talks between the two were quite high.
 

 S said to me that although she got close to him as a friend, she told him about many things of her life, he told her every  fucking thing about his, she hated even if he touched her. Even on her hand/shoulder whatever. 


This continued till Oct 2018, when we were walking to our homes (its really close to the college. P thought of dropping S while blah blahing all the way till the home, and then coming back to his....me, 2 friends, S&amp; p were the people going together). I thought enough is enough. I calmly said to P, just let her go and leave her alone. This got into a fight which could have been a physical altercation but only got limited to a war of words and emotion, which was a lot to me, my first time. and it still is. This comes back to me again and again. its so bothersome.


Because of this incident, me and S got even more closer. add to that the fact that, one day(sometime in November) she had a fight with D, which somehow brought us even more close, as I was there for her on that day. and yet another fact that, one day she got so ill that she fainted, and i helped her to get to hospital, which she thought was very nice of me.... although i was just really confused and scared because I have never done such a thing.  that fight got resolved between s &amp; d. but i became one of her besties, she said this thing one day( she has total of 3 besties, and now i was another one). i don't know why, but maybe because of my kind-of-shy,kind-of-simple attitude, i thought this gesture from her, this very statement from S, really got me from the inside. Like really slowly it got inside me.  and i was happy. 


So we became besties who used to hang out and talk about shit to each other, swap stories, although a lot of times, the conversation went into the direction about P &amp; D. I guess i was insecure, jealous that how can she be so much attached to D, who is not here, with whom she promises that they never had any physical relationship. And what must I do to get closer too. I guess I was kinda jealous immature about this now that I think.  I never ever said that to her aloud, or in any way,  to not talk with him. But maybe, I think she could gauge that out of the conversation, although that is maybe unclear to me. And I was particularly more interested in a weirdly jealous way, of how P got this close to her. I used to repeat some of the same questions to her. 

I don't know, but I always had this nagging feeling at the back of my head that always comes forward when I'm talking to someone i adore/like/am  interested in(not just romantically speaking), that I am not funny enough, not entertaining enough, not interesting enough, not asking thought provoking questions, not asking CORRECTLY about something trivial yet something that shows that a person is interested in your life(like how's your brother's health, how's his gf, hows his dog, did you eat that leftover chicken from the morning or something).....After I ask the basic questions....like only 3 basic questions, and 2 jokes, 4 funny stories from my life, I start giving out philosophical advices about things I read from forums, that I have no experience about whatsoever,  only thing left inside me is everything I know  from the internet, from people who have done more fantastic things than me....or from more interesting &amp;  entertaining funnier classmates. The feeling that How can I be more engaging, and how can I make someone like me, or be interested in me more, how to be less jealous, more mature, eats me every day. I tend to act like a pseudointellectual i feel.  
And some days, talking to her felt liberating, entertaining, enjoyable, and exhausting also(especially wheN i Started rambling about my Internet learned philosophy).

So this continued till Jan '19, when P's sister passed away. This made S really very sad, coz she had talked to her a couple of times and she seemed really nice. Everyone from M, classmates started telling S to at least talk to P briefly but she did not, not because she is an unemotional rock, but because of P's nature, and she came to know about this 4-6 days later, which made S feel that, P might be in a depressed state, her coming back to his life at this sad moment will be too much. Something along that lines.  Even D adviced her to do so, and I also said to her, but only once. I don't know why, but maybe it was my jealousy and hatred towards P that was speaking, or was it something else, I didn't push her to do so. But S did message him, about a month after that. 3 lines. nothing more nothing less.


Fast forward some 2 months, S was going to visit her Mom-Dad's home. I stay with my family......And it was my dad's bday, me &amp; mom were celebrating it although  he was some place far from home, for his work. I was in a good mood. S went to the train station, P got to know about this, and reached the station. How he could do it? because he also lived with some of his buddies, miles away from his mom's home, more flexible timing to go out and do stuff.   Me and S were messaging each other when I got to know about this. I was super pissed, annoyed and upset.  Why I didn't go to drop her off myself? she insists that she can go herself. And my mom is the kind of person who gets really concerned if her only child will go to some place , at night, to drop a GIRL! Real old fashioned I know. 

So the next day I send her a really long message, akin to this post, about what attracted me to her, i mean why i liked to spend my time with her, and how  i warned her that if you give me just a iota of hope,just as an old friend, that shithead will irritate you more.  how I'm really tired of dealing with this bullshit, why do you even bother with him.

 and she says nothing happened,  he didn't do anything. And neither did she. But she said these words that ""maybe you don't understand me"". Because I guess my anger and pissines showed my immaturity or jealouy or something. That hit me. 

she comes back, i try to clarify....maybe justify, if you must..... that it was because of P that I got pissed, i was only caring &amp; thinking about  her. Like really try to be clear as much as possible. She says cool. but she can take care of herself . But during that time, she gets realllly into this game PUBG. now I must tell you she isn't a gamer at all. But D convinces her, and she also wants to connect with him, and I was being a moody guy but now better.......with a reason i already told her. 

But now here's the thing when it really started ....she starts replying to my messages in one words , my interactions with her which were previously more joky, now feel like she's closed from me, I can feel that. now P has also started trying to talk with her more often. I see, but don't say much, cause he will go away if she won't give him attention.  my interactions with her are reduced. 

She goes to her Parents home once again aftr 20 days. I'm really missing all the talking with her, as she has built a wall against me, and she's gaming all day. I only got to play with her a 2-3 times....just so I can connect with her when she was here.  Such a kid-like thought. 
So I message her a very small &amp; formal message of ""hey, hello have a nice day"" kind of thing in PUBG chat...... which her older sister saw. The thing is, whenever S went home, her sister was not with them as she was doing a job. super busy.  Here's the thing. Her sister is a BIIGG prude.  S had already gotten into trouble before, for talking with D , 3--4 Years back, because he's a boy. the sister really scolded the shit out of her. so much that she's still careful about it. I knew her sister was coming.....I didn't know about, if anyone really read those messages, but she did, when she was teaching her sister the game.


She came back really pissed. told me the reason. i say sorry. she says cool.  I think the matter has been cool.we can be back to being best friends

But now she seems even more distant &amp; cold. Doesn't reply much, you know. 
P starts trying to talk to her again. she doesn't care much.  

The college fest comes. The senior M, who knew about both of them, comes and talks to both of them. P tries. S reluctantly listens .I have never talked to M. and now that she has been so distant to me, I don't introduce myself to M, and also, she's visiting them after a long time, I don't wanna be the idiot. 

Pre-finals(theres this thing which is preparation for the final exams) are near, I get to talk to S, but only for 5-10 minutes, I ask about what you &amp; M  talked, how is she, and about some help for the exams. she tells everything matter of factly, as if I am conducting a formal interview. I feel the same way when me &amp; my dad talk.  So i mention this awkwardness 2-4 times. She says  yes. thats true. Then cuts the call. seems as if she has lost the interest. 

I ask her for some notes for a subject for exams, she helps but not much, coz she isn't writing it. But helps. 2 days later, I ask for the notes of another subject. She blocks me! I try to ask her the reason, in person, she ignores me when I call out her name! 

And now I find out, P is talking to her quite confidently and cheerfully, helping her buy some medicine, food stuff like that. Although S's attitude is still like ""ok ok..... I don't give a shit but whatever. he's helping where i can't, cool. But seriously I don't need your help"". And I can't do anything about it. This is just what happens in front of me. I don't know what happens behind my back.

There's a mutual friend between me and S, who talked with her recently. She gives half hearted replies to her also.  The mutual friend told me that S's health is not so good. 

There's a small vacation of 15 days the college gives,  to study for the Finals. I try to ignore. But everything comes back every day 

Now the Final exams start, where we see each other, but ignore the presence of each other. She talks to almost all the people quite happily and cheerfully, except me, especially to this  guy, who's nice......and cute in a justin Bieber kind of way......and kind of reminds me of myself (but he's more of an athlete....so I guess he's better than me :-\) who's designated seat is to sit behind her during the exams. It has been this way for the last 2 years.  She used to help him since  the last 2 years, but I don't know why, I feel real jealous now. 

I have a feeling that she's been fighting with D and has been like that since  the pre-finals. And P got the help of M to talk to her. And because I was being a difficult person and kind of troublesome, she started ignoring me real hard since the fight between her and D. And her own health. And  yes, her mom's health has also been slightly bad too(she underwent chemotherapy...she always complains about the pain quite frequently, and then there's her sister's arrange marriage that needs to be taken care of). And maybe, I think she has been chatting with P frequently too, and maybe also the Justin Bieber guy. I guess, THAT makes her happy now. But this entire thing is a big maybe. Everything is a  hunch here, depending on a probability. 



Everyone has some kind of problem in their life here, . And the Bieber boy . Even D, whos mother has been really really weak for a long time. P is like the creepy poor Bruce Wayne i guess. And she has her own problems. Except me,  who started out as a fun loving joky guy, but now has become a jealous creepy obsessive fool. 

I try to ignory everything. But I'm questioning everything everyday, how I can go back to that happy place, where both of us can talk happily, I make her happy. And talking to her and making her laugh makes me happy. 

Maybe she was my friend, so I may have given her a very positive light. Or some other person might have been shown more negatively. 

I don't know if this is emotionally cheating. Or just that she's bored.

It just hurts too much seeing her Happy, but not being part of her life. 

How can I redeem myself?

I'm really sorry to have made you guys read this. maybe no one will answer this. But I don't have any friends here that I can trust, because all the boys &amp; some girls support P(he's the tragic guy who's really really helpful)who think that I was making a barrier between them. and remaining girls are with S. Some handful of girls mind their own business, who are not so close to me. I guess  Reddit is serving as a proxy therapist/advicer/friend for me now. 

This is too much of a drama that I can handle in a single year.

225,"im in a tough situation and would appreciate any help. Im in the process of choosing my undergraduate degree and deadlines to confirm my choices are really close. My main priority is money. yes i know money isnt everything but i would appreciate if you guys dont bother with the ""do what you love"" thing cuz i dont have the luxury of doing that....i am an international student and the stacks are already against you if you are a foreigner (unless in demand stem) let alone do a meme degree. It seems the most logical STEM field that would meet those demands is engineering and especially chemical engineering. My math skills are completely abysmal and laughable, granted i NEVER tried doing math or bothering. I am excellent in everything especially business/economics and the sciences (e.g biology). In this case i should go to the fields that i am most likely to excel in but because of my fucking luck the things that i excel in are the things that have close to comedic job prospects. An example is biomedical sciences. I would love to do that but after looking at all the research, my conclusion is its equivalent to a meme degree with no progress unless you slave away into a PHD. Engineering will theoretically result in the best rewards but my math skills, i just dont know bois. I just want to do STEM and know im going to get money. I dont have any of your privileges like loans and bla bla. My parents are paying for everything but its NOW OR NOTHING so my undergraduate MUST result in a success.Guys i just dont know what i need to do. I wish i was born in a country where i can pursue a meme degree whilst working but its either this or my shit hole of a country that has no value whatsoever and dont even know the language to.

My mom has always been sensitive to sound, and i dont know what is doing it, but its becoming worse by the day. Maybe its the chemo she had a couple years a go, her getting older and the ""fight"" she has with our neigbors wont help either.(made them a tat less considerate in playing music etc). Now were moving,  were trying to find a house just as big as we have now but farther away from highways, and people.

We have spotted some houses, but here comes our problem. My mom has spotted a ""house"" which is probably as far away from civilisation as possible that you can get in this area, 9km to nearest highway. But you probbably saw the quotes i put on the word house. Its stack of bricks. It has asbestos, a couple mest tanks (hope this is a good word in english, its a tank you store cow poop in to later spread over the land) a straw roof, and almost no isolation. And since my parents are both almost 65, me and my dad think this might be a big problem. But my mom is so set on it that she wont even realy look to other houses anymore. Even a house 7 km away from highways isnt far enough, while it has much more benefits. And its driving my parents apart, any help suggestions anything would be nice, thanks

228,"Hi , ever since I was a little kid I have loved participating in theatre and musicals. Acting has always been my greatest passion. After grade 12 , I went abroad to get a bachelor's degree in more ""realistic"" pursuits. However throughout my undergrad I have realized that the one thing that really brings me joy is acting , no matter the scale of the production. I promised myself that once I finish undergrad in 1 year , I shall save up for acting school and try my hand in the industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently back in the city I was born in for the summer and have moved to a new apartment there  and as luck would have it my neighbor is the most commercially successful director in the region.

&amp;#x200B;

I know , I must go talk to him! However I am nervous and don't wanna blow a pristine opportunity. I am thinking about just going over and introducing myself as their new neighbors but do not know how to navigate the conversation after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I should mention without blowing my own horn too much is that I am much better looking than the most of the people in our region. I have always been told this since a child and most people do not believe that I am from that part of the world and most people think I am a ""westerner"". Good looks is a huge advantage to break into the industry in this region.

&amp;#x200B;

However 2 downsides are that I have never professionally got any acting classes (though this really is not a requirement in the region and most actors do not) and though I speak my mother tongue at home all the time , I would say I have an intermediate grasp over it especially given my non native sounding accent. (However I believe this can be easily solved with some effort on my part). 

&amp;#x200B;

My therapist sent me home with a homework assignment to point out things that make me angry. Every time I try to start the homework, I completely shut down.

231,hi i‚Äôm 17f and my mom is 49 and the past few years our relationship has gone down the drain. i‚Äôve tried so hard to get her to like me and to be proud but nothing seems to work. she gets mad at me for no reason and is always yelling at me for things i didn‚Äôt do(such as my baby sister leaving a bowl out or something). i just want our relationship to be like how it was a few years ago. she always tells me how she doesn‚Äôt like me or that i‚Äôm annoying and things like that and i just want her to like me again? i‚Äôm in the closet and i know that if i were to come out it would ruin it even more but i don‚Äôt want to lose any chance that we could get better yknow?  does anyone know how to fix a broken relationship between a mom and a teenage daughter?,14Jun2019,1
232,"usually i‚Äôm pretty good at keeping a conversation going with friends and stuff, but every time i talk in person with my crush i get really nervous and i have nothing interesting to say. it‚Äôs also important to say that she told me she likes me back, and i feel even more anxious because i don‚Äôt want to mess up with her. So we‚Äôre supposed to go out this weekend with her friend and another mutual friend and i really want to be my full self and have fun but i‚Äôll always have potential failure at the back of my mind. when i hang out my close friends, we‚Äôve known each other for so long, there‚Äôs no real awkward moments or anything.

233,"I‚Äôve been talking to this girl for a long time, and we‚Äôve hung out a lot during the summer so far, we both flirt and call each other attractive, and have hit on each other a lot, but I‚Äôve never told her ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù or anything that basically screams ‚ÄúBe mine‚Äù. I‚Äôm going to be honest I‚Äôm afraid of ruining things between us so I haven‚Äôt leaned in for a kiss, she‚Äôs come basically face to face to me but I didn‚Äôt kiss her, which I feel stupid right now since that probably was a huge hint, but I feel like I‚Äôm running out of time to confess my feelings to her, but at the same time I‚Äôm afraid of things up because it‚Äôs more than just a ‚ÄúI find you attractive‚Äù type love, she‚Äôs genuinely funny and I love talking with her, she makes my day, every conversation we have makes me go to sleep feeling great, I love this girl, but I don‚Äôt want to potentially ruin something between us, because if she doesn‚Äôt like me back, I don‚Äôt want to ruin a friendship, because I value and appreciate her so much.",14Jun2019,1
234,"So I had a really shitty home life I mean not just alcoholic and drug addict parents also a brother like that. I experienced all types of abuse: sexual, emotional, verbal, mental, you name it. Anyway due to that abuse I never had the desire to date anyone. I became friends with a guy and knew him for 2 years then we started dating. We‚Äôve been together 7 years. He‚Äôs my first and only relationship. My first kiss, etc. he became a light at the end of the tunnel and a way out for me. Thanks to him and his family I‚Äôm able to live a real life and go back to school. I have a chance at a normal life.  We have very little in common but we still have a lot of fun together. He has his issues and me mine. I sometimes think about what if I dated someone else? I don‚Äôt want to just run out and fuck someone or anything like that but I wonder how life would be with someone else. My boyfriend used to watch porn and masturbate so much to the point that he had a hard time getting hard or him hard was not that hard. He would lie constantly to me about porn saying I didn‚Äôt watch it. Looked me in the eyes swore on my life, etc. Hid it for 2 years I only found it because I snooped.. I know wrong thing to do. He‚Äôs actually as far as I know actually have stopped for about a year. He feels a lot harder during sex and doesn‚Äôt have a hard time getting it up anymore. Him lying to me about that destroyed my self esteem. I literally hate my body. I can‚Äôt describe how ugly I feel. It honestly hurts so damn much. He yells whenever he gets angry but doesn‚Äôt hit me. I told him over a thousand times let‚Äôs talk calmly not yell due to my ptsd. Another thing is he will grab my arm really hard if I threaten to turn off his computer. He‚Äôs addicted to the thing. I honestly have felt scared of him in some situations. I tell myself all the time I owe my life to him. He gave me everything and I need to repay that. I definitely care about him and we are working on his and my issues. I can only orgasm during any kind of sexual act with him if I‚Äôm on drugs or drunk. I just don‚Äôt know what I truly want. Would I be happier with someone else? I definitely have feelings for my boyfriend but I‚Äôm confused....",14Jun2019,1
235,"So I drank some alcohol and I wasn‚Äôt supposed too , my family suspected me and they threatened to do a blood test, I drank one bottle (275ml-15%alc) last night and the day before that I drank a similar amount but two bottles, I know it‚Äôs not even enough to get drunk off but I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôll show up on a test, is there any food drink or meds I can take to flush or neutralize the alcohol so the tests are negative, or if the drinks weren‚Äôt that strong to show up anyways that would calm me down a lot.

236,"Yesterday in school, one of the girls who i recently bought for got caught smoking in the bathroom stalls. When she was taken in for questioning, she pointed at me for giving it to her. They brought me in for questioning and i explained that im not exactly the supplier.

My part in their business is I'm that friend who knows the people who sell juuls. A month and a half ago, my friend asked me for a favour to get him a juul since i knew the people. I agreed and thought that would be the end of it. The following week, he asked again. It kept going on like this where i'd do ""favors"". It only happened once or twice a week and not daily as i didn't wanna put too much heat on my back. This week i told them it was my last time doing it as its so close to the finals and i dont wanna get caught. 

The main suppliers who were taken in for questioning has denied every claim i made despite being known for dealing with juuls in school.

237,"Hey there. 

Interesting living situation here. I manage a 5 bedroom home that I reside in. One room is rented by my sister, one is my roommate Beth and her 18 year old son resides in the other room.

The sons father pays the rent for the son, but I usually get a check with Beth and sons rent combined.

No check arrived on the first and I was told it was going to be late. It didn‚Äôt show up 7 days later. I had to get tough and called the father and he shows up with the portion covering the son.

I‚Äôm promised the rest the next day.

No contact with me, no check.

I then take out my own money to cover her portion and make nice with landlord.

I am sick to my stomach getting ignored and dodged by her even though I enjoy living with her and her son. 

Should I evict them? I can‚Äôt live with this stress.

How should I approach this? Should I sit everyone down? I‚Äôm so upset and I need to separate emotion from this... maybe this is more a rant then advice but I‚Äôm sick of being burned by her and I don‚Äôt want to lose my home bc of her carelessness.

She also has a boyfriend that stays over regularly .... why couldn‚Äôt he help her pay?!

238,"Hi so, I'm about to start my third year of university &amp; my best friend just graduated high school &amp; will be attending the local community college. Currently, I am home from school &amp; my best friend lives at home.

My best friend bought festival tickets &amp; plane tickets &amp; is flying to a couple of different states alone, and meeting up with people there. She has never met these people but she's been in contact with them &amp; was planning on traveling &amp; camping with them at the festivals.

Her parents think that I am going to these festivals with her, because we have gone to festivals together in the past. Unfortunately, though I'd love to go, while living at home, my parents wouldn't let me fly to any festivals &amp; also I'm trying to save money up. She also told her mom that my parents don't know that I'm going, and that I'm leaving for the festival from my college town.

Her mom has been poking holes in the elaborate lie that my friend has told her &amp; wants to speak with me to confirm that I'm going. I personally don't think that I would feel comfortable straight up lying to her mom because if she is caught, her mom will think I'm a liar &amp; troublemaker, and I'm really good with parents. I'm that one good kid that parents love &amp; don't worry about their kids being friends with (despite me being kinda crazy on the inside lol).

But my best friend has been looking forward to this trip for the longest time &amp; I really don't want to be the one to ruin this for her. Her parents want my flight tickets &amp; she said she's considering photoshopping plane tickets with my name on it, but if she's caught after that, then she'll be in huge trouble.

I'm just not sure what to do. It's not like it's my mom that'll be getting mad at me, and I don't want to ruin this for my best friend.",14Jun2019,7
239,"Please bare with me, I know to most this will sound like I‚Äôm being too hard on myself, but this is truly how I feel. 

I won‚Äôt make this too long, so I will skim through most things. 

Have a really hard home life, extremely abusive parents in every way shape and form, that kept me really sheltered from others &amp; in other words I grew up VERY SHY AND VERY NAIVE. 

@ 14, I began dating someone, first love, we dated until I was 18-19. Not the best relationship, we were really on and off. When I was 15 we broke up for the first time and I sent nudes to other guys but it was via snap &amp;/or FaceTime. 

Fast forward, as I‚Äôm growing older, I‚Äôm maturing, I‚Äôm seeing where I can improve in life. I got VERY religious around 17 and I looked back on my life and it made me paranoid. 

I skipped a lot of info, but to conclude, I am so paranoid of my nudes ever leaking (the guys I sent the to were over 18 at that time) that even stepping outside my house gives me EXTEME anxiety. 

Here is the thing, in the least cocky way possible, I am an attractive female, and will model soon for a VERY big brand, given more attention will come. I am afraid this will make other talk about me and I will get exposed. 

It‚Äôs been 4 years. Yes some of them had my face in it. 
I feel like I been through SO MUCH in life that another thing will break the camels back.

I am so ashamed. I fear no one will want me. My ex is the only person I ever had sex with, but even when I was a virgin people made up rumours about me and I‚Äôm afraid if I ever get exposed it will make people think of me seem true( promiscuous) when it‚Äôs not true.

240,"Hey! So I was playing team sonic racing online and I got paired with a random kid who was super excited over the mic to be playing the game. Sweetest little thing, couldn't have been over 5 or 6. As I played him he talked about playing tomorrow and I agreed to a later time, but he said he was redboxing the game and wouldn't be able to play at that time so I agreed to an earlier time.

Thing is, summer just started for him and he was a really nice kid, and I'd love for him to be able to play the game he was waiting for so long for. I'm considering buying him psn gift cards so he can download the game (Sony doesn't let me gift games, and I can't find a digital copy from Amazon or gamestop, but that'd be my first choice); I know times are tough and he might not get the game at all based on his parents' livelihoods. 

That said, I'm guessing parents might not take too kindly to having their 5-6 year old kid get a game from a random early-20s stranger. I know my parents would not only have been very sussed out had this happened to me, but they likely wouldn't have appreciated their kid being gifted a game when they already struggled to rein me in. 

I want to get this kid the game, but I'm not quite sure how to approach it or if I even should. I'm considering asking him if he can let his parents talk to me for a second (without telling him what it's about) and I ask them for their permission before I go ahead with this, but even that seems like something that might be perceived as too shady. What would be a good way to go about this, or should I drop it entirely?",14Jun2019,1
241,"I‚Äôve been dating my girlfriend for the past year I really love her, she completes me in every aspect. Before her I was really in love with this other girl that I had dated when I was a high school senior. When we broke up she kind of just told me she was too focused on school to give me any attention and me being young and afraid of confrontation never confronted her about it, she told me everything through a text. When I started dating her I made a journal about her, writing about her and how she made me feel. I would write her letters on Christmas and on her birthday telling her how I feel about her but she would never mention it to me, whenever we‚Äôd talk it‚Äôs as if we were nothing. Don‚Äôt get me wrong we are very good friends and have a good relationship as friends. We even went to the same college and she just recently graduated. I will be graduating in a year. She already has a successful career and a boyfriend. I feel like now we will only see each other at parties and such, not so frequently like when we were in school. I want to confront her about why she really broke up with me, show her the journal I wrote about her and ask her what her thoughts were when I gave her those letters a couple years ago. Is there any point in doing so ? Should I just leave things as is ? Let it go ? Burn the book and just go on with my life ?

She said that if she were to date anyone, it‚Äôd be me, basically saying she feels the same. However, because we are going into our senior year of high school, she‚Äôs not trying to be in a relationship. Although, she said she loves being friends and doesn‚Äôt want to lose me as she loves hanging out and wants to still spend time with me, considering that is the best well both get. (Perhaps she‚Äôs scared to let her feelings manifest into something more out of fear of losing me in the future after high school?) All I want is closure. I feel lost and don‚Äôt know what to do. I really want to be with her. I‚Äôve always been selfless and helped others, putting them above me in just about every scenario. This time, I want something for me. I want my happy ending (I know this is just a girl in high school but just role with it.) I was thinking about talking to her about it.

1) Talk to her about it and tell her how I feel about the situation.
2) Continue being there for her and whatnot, showing her through my actions that I‚Äôm worth it for her to take that chance.

246,"I've noticed the following things lately:

-getting out of bed (or even my room) is starting to be really difficult to do. If I do, then getting out of the house is the new problem

-I keep finding myself asking ""does it really matter?"" or ""Am I really losing out if I don't do x or y"" over and over

- Feeling like nothing matters anymore, and that I'm just dragging out everything in general

-I try to exercise but start to feel down midway and give up

-I read books or play video games but have been losing interest in both

-Feelings of missing out time to grow (I'm 22) but saying ""it's ok, not like anyone will want to spend time""

-I don't really smoke or drink but am starting to feel the urge to  same with staying up well past 1 am regularly

-girlfriend spending less time with me. Initially with work, but now with her new guy friends that she met about 2 months ago. I'm starting to think she could be cheating on me any moment now, but lying and leaving it in the air (late nights hanging out, trips I was never told about, being told I'm boring). Don't know how to react, I just feel numb about it.

- I take things as they come; if something bad happens I just have an attitude of ""oh well, could have been worse"" and just take it as it is. Case in point, above

- Thinking about how everyone around me is MUCH better in their lives, having fun and doing new things and enjoying themselves. I feel like I don't deserve to spend time with such people (starting to think girlfriend is badically ditching me now)

I'm kind of hesitant to talk about this with my family, to them that kind of thing doesn't exist. When I was at school (still am, failed courses and will take extra year to graduate) we were always reminded about mental health services and I felt like I never jumped on it.

249,"I understand that neurotypical people can simply ignore politics, or are only mildly irritated/barely upset by politics. I am not. Due to my inability to understand the majority of logic others use to construct their value systems, nearly all humans feel like aliens to me. I generally cannot relate to other people simply because of just how vastly different our fundamental value systems are. As an example, the mere existence of more than one nation or culture is incomprehensible to me, since mutual cooperation is far more advantageous to survival (and everything else) than fighting one another... And yet we as a species have more than one singular group. You all think this is wonderful and good, I think this is horrible and terrible and we need to fix it and I cannot understand why everyone doesn't just mutually agree to stop doing their current cultures, agree on one singular one, and then we all proceed into the future as a united humanity with shared interests and goals related to the basic needs of us as a species.  


I am not trolling. I am not kidding. I am very serious. I honestly cannot understand why we don't do that. People have tried to explain it, it still makes no sense, your logic is alien to me.  


Naturally, being as I am, I am fully aware that none of what I think should be done will be done. Pretty much ever. This is the root of my hatred of politics. For me it serves exclusively as a reminder that I am not normal, never can be, will never be able to understand the systems by which the world I live in work and properly utilize them, and am effectively, well... You're not the aliens. I am.  


The mere reminder that politics exists has become something that makes me so mad, I have permanently ended relationships because people wouldn't stop talking about politics. I am too afraid to read, watch, or play new forms of entertainment because I know they will contain political content (The current trend to push politics into escapist fantasy is tortuous... And insane. It exists to escape that, why are you putting it in? Please stop.). I have refused to participate in social groups at all because (in addition to usually not having much in common with people, nor really any desire to discuss things I don't care about) it seems all anyone ever wants to talk about is the real world, politics, and activism.  


Activism is just more politics. It can burn in a vat of chlorine trifluoride alongside politics for all I care.  


I want to be able to be happy again. I want to feel like I can explore fiction (one of the few things I like) without being forced to experience politics and activism. I want to be less enraged all the time. To do this, the logical thing to do is to wall off politics form my life completely.  


I can filter the internet, blocking every known news site and political blog. I can avoid facebook, twitter, and almost all other social media. What I cannot do is get so called friends to stop stabbing me in the heart with reminders that I am an alien and no one cares what I think or how I feel by discussing political and politically charged topics.  


No. Really. I cannot. I have a small discord server for discussing fiction with a zero tolerance politics for politics and activist topics. It doesn't matter. People still talk about this stuff and get banned. Then they come back after the temp ban and will inevitably do it again.  


Even when those people know for a matter of fact that discussing politics nearly drove me to a hear attack via pure rage and stress from doing so a mere 3 months ago, they will discuss politics again.  


I have explained everything in this post to them. I believe the problem is just as I cannot understand your logic, you cannot understand my logic.  


How do I get people to understand that I find discussing politics in any way shape or form other than the fictional politics of fictional worlds EXCLUSIVELY as they related to those worlds not just unacceptable, but abhorrent, and anathema? Honestly, I finds politics to be as disgusting and evil as pedophilia, rape, and necrophilia. How do I make people understand this?  


I want to be able to have friends I can like again. I need them to understand they need to stop. I need people in general to understand that my Discord is a politics free zone and that politics is unacceptable there for any reason, even if they are simply trying to say that the United States just collapsed because Russians invaded and took over and that actually happened. I do not care. I will never care, because whatever happened, it will be biaazro alien logic and just piss me off, or have no impact on me at all.  


I need politics to leave my reality and never return.  


How do I achieve this?",14Jun2019,1
250,"Okay so my (was) tight friend consited two guys(lets say bob and henry) and girl (lets say claire) and me. We were all super tight best friends. I was kinda the new addition to the group but we became very close over 3 years. 
When i first joined the group i had feelings for the claire. I soon gave up and decided friendship would be healthier.
2 years later bob and claire hook up serious. I was happy for him he got a nice girl and they fit each other well i was happy for him. About 6 months into there relationship i started to get weird vibes when i hung out with them, like he didn't like my presence being around her. Then about anothers 3 months later he convinces claire we can't be friends. I think thats kinda messed up but okay dude cool guess i need to back off. I asked him whats up and he avoided it and straight up didn't answer the question.(btw this was right after they got in a big argument apparently found this out recently). So i backed off which i can't lie made me angry he was deciding if can be friends with her(probably my best friend)
Over a period of time I noticed i wasn't being invited to stuff anymore. Started getting ghosted. Cool whatever not that big of a deal. But i also noticed that henry wasn't really talking to me anymore and didn't want to hangout. Which as weird we were almost brothers
Later on i find out that bob did not like me being around claire what so ever( always got that vibe). So he decided to convince henry that i was messing around with claire behind his back. 
I got pissed I called him out and cut ties he proceeded to give me an ""apology"" that actually blamed henry. He claimed he didn't know why he did it and he doesn't know what im talking about and its henrys fault. I thought bullshit so i don't mess with them anymore for about 2 months 

Question 1) i can't tell if claire had her hand in situation manipulating it

Question 2) I don't know what i did wrong for him to hate me being around his girl we did not even talk outside of school besides when we were in a group and probably the only thing me and claire had was we both liked a certain group of music 

Question 3) does anything think that he was jealous or threatened of me or am i crazy

257,"I'm sorry for the way this is looks/posts - using my mobile.

An ex-colleague has sent an email to my manager, myself &amp; my colleagues that classes as defamation through an external email address to our work addresses.
This email was blocked &amp; it looks like it only went through to my manager.
My manager has forwarded this email to our HR &amp; had the external address blocked.
I have only found out recently about the email, because they told me assuming I had already seen it - when I said that I hadn't &amp; wanted a copy, they are refusing &amp; say I should forget about it.
When I have tried to push the issue, that I am worried about libel, that I want proof in case anything further happens or it affects me finding another job if there are other comments out there, my manager still refuses, that the matter has been dealt with.
The ex-colleague left under bad terms &amp; is very bitter towards us all.
By pushing this issue, I am causing tension between my manager &amp; myself that I feel will cause problems in the future.

Do I have any rights to see this email &amp; have a copy? Should I have been informed about this email formally? Or is the matter now dealt with by ignoring it? I would not have known about it unless my manager had mentioned it - should they have mentioned it at all?

Am I being unreasonable &amp; daft to worry about what is being said about me &amp; wanting to know? I feel like I'm back stuck in the playground &amp; the bad guy for pushing the issue.

Any advice would be appreciated. 
Sorry.

258,"Yeah, as the title says.  Whenever I get close to any sort of semblance of a relationship, I freak the fuck out and cut them off.  I‚Äôm about to do that again (tho I this one is for the best bc it‚Äôs illegal but irrelevant), just how do I prevent doing this with people that could genuinely be good for me?  I‚Äôve done it so many times and I hate myself for it",14Jun2019,1
259,"Ok so I know this may not seem as urgent or important as some who post on here but I feel like making this account and using it as a source to express how I feel at the moment would be a good idea so I‚Äôm a guy I‚Äôm 20 (hi lol) I graduated high school about 2 years ago and I completely cut myself off from almost about everyone I knew at the time and still a little to this day see it as me ‚Äúbranching off on my own and finding a better group of people to be around‚Äù and I‚Äôve honestly always wished for that to happen sometimes towards the end of high school I sort of just cut loose and ran. I don‚Äôt know if anyone has anything similar but that goes into my second part.

Currently I‚Äôm still living in the same town still with my family and although they are supportive and loving as ever I also have my older sister here I know they would be happier if I were to move out and start my own life (something I think a lot of parents would want for their child) but I recently made the mistake of dropping out of college, I was going to a nice community college a little bit out of town from where I am now (just to open myself up to fresh faces and in a weird way reinvent myself) but as time went on and I of course started working I just snapped and completely shut off from everything now I did go through a heavy (I would say) depressive episode which I really don‚Äôt want to go on here right now or I‚Äôll be here forever. So ever since I dropped out of college I‚Äôve of course have a job (which is great because I at least feel like me having money and helping my parents out is a huge part as to why I‚Äôm still here) but it‚Äôs a very mundane job and I do plan on leaving once I find something better possibly in the next few months.  

The one good thing that came out of my ‚Äúdepressive‚Äù episode......(and I mean that in the lightest way I‚Äôve never been diagnosed and I do have family members who have gone through it so I don‚Äôt mean to piss off people who deal with actual depression because that shits rough and I really don‚Äôt mean to offend anybody but that was the darkest time of my life and I still feel like I‚Äôm facing the tail end of that and I don‚Äôt know any other way to describe it).....was that I did find something that I am really passionate about or at-least think is a great direction for me and that has to do with art not necessarily physical art but more so graphic and animations etc (I really don‚Äôt want to say much because I want to say as anonymous as I can for now)

So that‚Äôs that

So.. that was a shit ton
I‚Äôm just going to simplify it into main points if anyone wasn‚Äôt  able to read through that if they can (I wouldn‚Äôt blame you if you can‚Äôt i sound very woe is me right now and I might regret this later )

‚Ä¢How do I push myself out there to be more sociable again, I‚Äôve always been the ‚Äúfriend of‚Äù or ‚Äú so and so‚Äôs friend‚Äù I want to create an identity for myself with a whole new group of people it‚Äôs gotten to a point where I can talk to someone but it‚Äôs sort of obvious I‚Äôm forcing myself to the point where I am either stuttering over my words or will just sit in complete silence if I don‚Äôt know what to say

‚Ä¢How do I find a good group of people to surround myself with and actually feel like I am worth something to them? (yikes I know that last part is a doozy and takes some internal shit I know)

‚Ä¢How do I stop reliving all the cringe-y or embarrassing things I‚Äôve done in the past when they were well over 2 (almost 3) years ago and I am a completely different person

‚Ä¢And lastly and I hope this doesn‚Äôt turn this whole post into a joke but I really need advice on this, how do I word a financial aid reinstatement letter in my case like I see all of these examples where they have valid reasons  a death in a family a accident but I don‚Äôt have any of those. I just snapped I shut down completely and just fell into a hole that I can‚Äôt seem to get out of.

So there it is this honestly just scratches the surface and I chose to gloss over a lot of stuff but if this does get some sort of response I will definitely try to talk about those issues and other things in depth. I really don‚Äôt want people to think I‚Äôm some ‚Äúsad boi‚Äù I love having discussions and love debating topics with people I love art and music and history and just so many things I‚Äôd love to use this reddit account as a way to show some of that stuff  and maybe make a few reddit buds but yeah 

P.S I do want to cover a few quick things I might possibly get in response 

1.) I don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking to my parents this deeply about stuff when it comes to this situation they are hard working people and are dealing with a lot when it comes to other family issues and I absolutely do not want to let them in on this as this time not only that it‚Äôs super uncomfortable for me to do so since I‚Äôve never been this open to anyone ever

2.) A therapist is something I‚Äôd likely do in the future but for now I‚Äôd like to do a little self reflection and sort myself out a bit more

P.S.S I‚Äôm a very self analyzing person so I‚Äôve had a lot of time to think about this and it‚Äôs something I do on a constant basis 

I don‚Äôt want this to be one big sad post I‚Äôm actually very hesitant but happy I‚Äôm posting this for the slight chance someone might see this and we could connect I don‚Äôt want to be compared to anyone else‚Äôs problems because I know there are others dealing with way worse but yeah yikes this is getting long !!

Sorry a bit of a rant a head but I need some help with this so hear it goes. 

I hurt my back up in January and since then I‚Äôve been kinda stuck with constant pain. My work is physically demanding and I‚Äôve been struggling to work my usual 50 hour work week. My boss can‚Äôt afford to let me go to 4 days a week, but occasionally I just need to call in and say my backs out. This is followed by guilt trips and a serious conversation with management. 

Last week I was planning on taking Saturday off and I told the only guy at work I trust that‚Äôs it‚Äôs been a hard week due to a tragedy and I need the day off to rest. It was also my girlfriend‚Äôs brother‚Äôs high school graduation and I figured it was a happy event that might help cheer me up. Saturday morning I wake up at like 630 to my boss calling saying he‚Äôs been informed I‚Äôm not coming in to work today and basically get my ass into work.

The guy I told I was taking the day off and I were super tight at work and have been for years. He said something in bad taste about a coworker that took his own life last week. When he asked what I thought I told him I don‚Äôt care to talk about the subject and I tried to just walk away, but he called me an asshole because I wasn‚Äôt willing to hear his opinion about why he did what he did. I‚Äôm grieving the loss of a good man and I feel I have every damn right to avoid that conversation if I so choose.
I asked him if he mentioned to the boss what I told him in confidence and he says ‚Äúyeah, what of it?‚Äù I just nodded and took off. 
A few days later (today) he came up to me and told me I wasn‚Äôt man enough to look him in the eyes and confront him... he was super confrontational and he was speaking to me like he wanted to start an argument. Without saying a word I hopped in my truck, rolled up my windows and casually drove away. 

I don‚Äôt want to be mad or retaliate or tell anyone at work about it because if I bring it up to management it will only make it worse and I don‚Äôt want to sink to his level or invest my emotions in it but it‚Äôs getting to me. It‚Äôs just so surreal that a good friend is treating me like this. I can‚Äôt look him in they eyes because I‚Äôm sad I‚Äôm losing such a good friend so suddenly.

So, I applied to San Francisco State in November 2018. I got early admission in mid December, applied for housing in March and got accepted in April.

Yesterday, I got an email that said my admission had been revoked because I had not completed my 3 years of required HS math. I would accept this if it was correct, but it isnt.

I have completed 2 semesters of Algebra, 2 semesters of personal finance, 2 semesters of ""our chemical environment"" and 1 semester of geometry. I was told by not one, not two, but *three* HS counselors that the chemistry class counted as a math course.

I called SFSU and explained the situation and the kinda rude lady on the other end would only call me kid and wouldn't explain anything to me.

I have spent almost $1000 (that I didnt have in the first place) on applying and being accepted and this school is my dream school. What can I do?

My current plan:
Call in the morning and speak with someone who was not the rude lady. Address the situation and the fact that 3 people ""in power"" told me that chemistry class counted as a math course.

Thanks to the advice of some redditors, I will request to be placed in a remedial math course (or something to satisfy what they want) and offer to meet with a counselor as often as they want me to in order to show that I am serious about this.

I really really hate being *that* person that ""asks to see a manager"" and goes over people's heads, but college is a big and expensive deal. I want to know that I've done everything I could to try and get back in.

278,"I don't really know where to start because all of this is so overwhelming, but I must admit that I am so, so lost right now. I don't know where my life is headed and I feel completely out of control. I""m a 21 year old female. Currently I live in Central California. I used to live in Los Angeles County, but I moved up here to help my family get through some rough times. My girlfriend of 2 and a half years is still down there and this move has been very hard on our relationship. 

 I went to community college on and off, but I had to stop because it became too much with work. I have always held academics as the most important thing in my life, but I'm overwhelmed as it is right now. I want to be a teacher, so I know I have to go to school. I just don't know how I'm going to get there.  Currently I am working 2 part-time retail jobs. I'm very unhappy at both places and I have been trying to land a job as a barista or a receptionist. 

  
I rent a room in my sister's apartment. I have two cats that I brought with me from the last place I lived. (Long story short my roommates weren't keeping them and I am attached to them. If I didn't have them, they'd go to a shelter.)    


My girlfriend and I had tentative plans to move out, but recently she shared with me that she thinks it will be too strenuous financially since rent is so high out there. (She is not willing to move up here, we have had this discussion multiple times. This isn't a huge deal to me, it just makes things more complicated.) 

She has suggested that I take out student loans and start going to school down there. My only issue with this is that it will mean that I have to re-home my cats, navigate through student loans, housing and the like, and then obviously the debt.    
Another option is that I just save up and start renting a room down there. I would have to transfer my job out there and I don't know when I'd be able to go to school. This allows me the possibility of keeping my cats, but will take a long time, and doesn't actually help further my career goals.    
My last idea is that I could go to school out here. I would most likely have to really cut down on work, but at least this way I could keep my cats. This would be the easiest route, but I hate only seeing my girlfriend twice a month. It really sucks and I feel like it prevents our relationship from growing. I can't meet her family, or be there for her when she needs someone. We can't go out on dates. It really sucks. I don't feel like this would make me happier.

I don't know where I am going in my life and I feel so, so hopeless. I wake up and go to work and I come home and sleep. I don't really have friends. I have tried to make friends but it's been a battle. I don't want to live here anymore. I feel like I would be happier if I were closer to her, I just honestly don't know how to make it work. I've also been seeing a therapist for depression/ anxiety.  

Have any of you ever been in a similar situation? How do I navigate it? I don't want to take out student loans and then end up in an insurmountable amount of debt, and I don't know if I could forgive myself for rehoming my cats, but at least I could be closer to my girlfriend and I could work on my actual life goals. I am open to any advice or guidance. If you need more information I'm definitely willing to clarify things or provide additional information.

i'm 16 and i don't know very much yet so i guess i came here for help because this is really messing with me. I cant stop crying and i cant stop thinking about it and i can't move on. This post is going to be all over the place but i will try my best to make it where people can understand it. This just happened so long ago that everything slowly comes to mind and skips around. 

There is going to be A LOT. A lot of backstory and a lot of things that probably aren't necessary but i want to tell as much as possible to get it off my chest and just so i can get the best and most accurate advice possible. 

I don't have any real life friends and i don't like real life relationships. Everyone in real life is just that way because there are consequences for your actions and everything matters so they hide their real selves. I don't want to spend half a year in a relationship or being someones best friend just to find out how they really are. I enjoy long distance friends and relationships because you cant really get in trouble and not very many bad temptations.

alrighty on with the story.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I enjoy going on discord and on different playstation communities to make new friends and meet new people. People are usually very rude, but every now and then i find some nice people. I was Asexual at the time and didn't like anyone at all. Anyways, I usually enjoy hanging out with girls because it seems like they are more understanding than most guys. With guys everything is always a competition on who can get the most attention especially when a girl is there so i try to stay away from most of them. 

While I was trying to make new friends doing my usual ""Hi welcome to the party nice to meet you. i hope you're having a great day/night"" thing (which most people think is weird). I met Emma, she's 12 years old and i'm 15 at the time, and we both have close to the same birthdays so around a 3 year gap. We became pretty good friends and played destiny together and hung out all the time. We exchanged discords and nonstop talked for a couple of days. After then she started opening up to me which she never did with anyone. It was about her relationship with her boyfriend. we'll call him Lucas. Lucas was british and was putting Emma in a really horrible situation. I'm pretty sure he was 13. He was doing drugs on the mic and pretending to pop pills to scare Emma to keep her with him (i didn't know this at the time but later she told me someone killed themselves because she left them before and was traumatized. He knew that and took advantage of it). 

Of course because of all the stress and horrible things that's happened to her she had severe depression and insomnia. No matter what i stayed up every single night, even on school nights where i had to get up at 5 in the morning, to 3 a.m. making sure she got to sleep okay. I spent every night comforting her and keeping her calm so she doesn't cut herself anymore. She already is seeing a therapist and getting as much help as possible, but she needed more than that. I guess she really just needed someone there for her because i really helped her. I put 100% time and effort trying to help her. As i said i was Asexual, I didn't know that i was growing feelings for her. I tried convincing her multiple times to break up with him, move on, and don't look back. I kept telling her he was 13 and stupid. He was just taking advantage of her and she should leave it as soon as possible. I told her that if he did do it that i promise it isn't her fault and she doesn't have to worry. ""Everything will be okay, its always will be. Time will heal all wounds, it's just yourself that changes the most. It may leave a scar, but you don't have to let that scar show in a bad way"" that's my motto and i told her it and finally got her to. Right before she did he pretended he got into a gang fight and died and it made her cut herself and pass out multiple times and hyperventilate. I was there the whole time and she was telling me everything and heard the whole conversation. She left him, broke up with him after. She hesitated a bit, but i got her to block him on everything. Even though I hated his guts I kept him added to check on him. Of course he's fine, and everything's okay.

(that whole part is just to show that i really helped her, I was like her eyes to see through stuff like that.)

Later on even with the age gap we got together. At first i only got with her to help her with her depression, but later started falling really hard for her. 

Her parents are really strict so the only time she can talk to me is on playstation, but every single chance she got she would download discord and message me as much as possible, delete it, repeat. She was home schooled and could barely have any friends and they had to be from school. Her parents isolated her basically. She told me another one of her problems which makes me believe that her parents are abusive. She told me a story that she went to california to live with her cousins and grandma or something like that. She loved it there. She got so much attention and she got more freedom. It was to the point where her and her grandmother planned to call child services to keep her there. She talked to her parents had a huge argument and she went back there to live with them. Her grandmother was completely taken out of the picture and she wasn't allowed to talk to any part of that side of the family again. She believed that her grandmother tricked her and her parents were keeping her safe. Her mother finally started showing her more attention and affection but after that got worse and her parents argued all the time. It was horrible. Her little brother got all the freedom he wanted and got everything, but because Emma was a girl she never got anything.

We started calling at night, she missed me and wanted to here my voice so badly that it comforted her. Even on school nights we would wait until 12 or 1 in the morning just to talk for a bit and go to sleep together. She cried every single night and she was so badly depressed and from the insomnia she started seeing things and hallucinating and having crazy thoughts but i was helping her. I got her to sleep earlier, at around 12 or 1 rather than 3 or 4 and she was getting so much better. 

She was also helping me so much. I was studying languages and programming, working out a lot more, happy, everything. I felt so much better. I had a reason and i was doing so well and amazing. We always wrote paragraphs to eachother every morning to welcome eachother to a new day and everything it was already so perfect.

This is where i start making horrible mistakes that i will never make again. This girl Amanda joins the picture. We were just going to be acquaintances, she became too much. She loved me and spent every second trying to get my attention. She also needed help and I love helping people. So i did. She relied on me too much and did everything for me and she was really good at cheering me on and comforting and everything. She made me really confused. I would never lie to Emma so i told her. A lot of fights happened and confusing arguments and conversation happened between the 3 of us and Emma wanted me to try a relationship with her. So i did and instantly regretted it. Broke up with her and tried getting back with Emma, she said no. She wanted to work on herself to be better than anyone before she got back with me. She wanted to be the best for me. So i did the same. Sooner or later we got back together and IT WAS BETTER THAN EVER. I mean the most perfect and best relationship you could imagine we had it. Amanda really helped the relationship. We spent so much time together it was amazing. It was the best last week with her...

Later... 

I think her parents seen her with her electronic on her bed with headphones in... Because her parents made her leave everything downstairs... After the second or third night of barley being able to talk... She needed me so badly that one night when she thought everyone was asleep she took it and ran... went in her room and called me... we talked for a bit but... her dad came up... and i heard some faint chatter... I fell asleep... Woke up... to see this ""Dont ever message me on discord about this i miss you and i love yiu iwont be able to talk for another year im sorry dont message me AT ALL tell madi im sorry"" That little faint sliver of hope... Is killing me... every single day her parents got on and checked her messages on discord. Every single day i cried until there was nothing left. every single day i messaged her with a paragraph to welcome her to a new day... and told her about my day... and gave her a paragraph for a goodnight... until all her accounts were deleted... on everything... and i found out from one of her real life friends that later blocked me... that she had to message all of them saying goodbye... but i couldnt even get a goodbye...

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

That's it, i might of forgot a good bit of it but i was getting sleepy. It's 3 in the morning right now.

Every night i still cry and still think about her. Im the one with insomnia and really depressed. Because of that little sliver of hope that she might come back means i cant move on. I tried. 

i have her parents names and social media accounts.

i want to message them so badly just to see and ask if she's okay... 

all i want is a proper goodbye, or to hear her voice one more time and know she's okay. I don't care if there's an age gap. I just want my motivation again. I want the crying to stop. I don't know what to do anymore. im going numb and cant feel hardly anything anymore. I've never told anyone the whole story i don't think so you all are a first.",14Jun2019,1
280,"Hello Reddit users, 

This is my throwaway account in case who I'm writing about finds this or my boyfriend. 

My boyfriend has two older brothers, both of whom have significant others. One of his older brothers is engaged a girl who is 24 years younger than him (he's 40ish and she's 25ish). His fiance and I are a year apart in age. She is nice, just has weird mannerisms that make it seem like she's not a genuine person. She comes off extremely fake. she acts overly polite to the point that it makes me uncomfortable and comes off as fake or like as if she has some ulterior motive for trying to be nice. That was the first thing that turned me off to liking her. Then once we began following each on Instagram that's when I really started to dislike her... Most of her photos are of her half naked ""modeling."" There was a point in time where I (childish as it was) decided that she just made me extremely uncomfortable and that I didn't want to acknowledge her presences at my boyfriend's family parties. Eventually I got over that and apologized and now we're sorta friends. We use to email often and we occasionally message each other on Instagram. 

I've gotten over her ""modeling"" and can find her sorta tolerable but something about her makes me strongly dislike her. I've never met anyone where I can't stand the fact that she exists (not that I want her dead, I just don't want her in my life). She's nice to me, she's never been mean... So I'm almost positive I'm extremely jealous of her but I can't really pin point what it is. My boyfriend's other brother is married and I love his wife. She's very down to earth and genuine. So I know I can be a normal human being. Just something about the fiance of his other brother bothers me. 

What makes matters worse is that she invited me to go to her bachelorette party. I said yes because I thought it would be good for me to go and try to be nice. Other brother's wife will be attending and so I'll have one friend there. Some of brother's fiance's  friends from work (they're all cocktail waitresses from a nightclub in Vegas where she works) will be attending and all of them look even more extra on Instagram than fiance does. And I keep dreading the fact that I'll be stuck with them for three days to the point that it makes me sorta nauseated.

I feel really terrible going. Knowing that I really don't like fiance. 

Is there anything I can do to get over this? Any tips on how I can train myself not to be so jealous? If it even is jealousy? I've never felt or dealt with anything like this before and am at a loss on how to mentally handle this.",14Jun2019,1

Last time I had a girlfriend, it was a few years ago and I lost her because of neediness/clinginess. To be fair I was going to a bout of depression and thought she was the angel that was here, to save me and inspire me.¬†

It sounds corny but I did fancy her in such a light.¬†I thought she was my muse and that she would change my life. She did change my life but in a very different way from what I had envisioned, at our beginning.

For a lot of my life I wasn't allowed to do much of the stuff that I wanted to do. I always wanted to get into sports however my parents didn't let me do so. I'm 17 and they won't let me do it until I'm on my own, and in university.

I feel like it's too late now to get into some of the sports I'd love to do like football (American football) or soccer. I do really also want to get into MMA as I have been a UFC fan for several years now, but I don't know if I can balance mechanical engineering with that (which is what I want to do as a career).

I also have insane troubles socializing etc. I plan on improving on it in uni but in high school I already have this thing ppl think of me as like being a total incel and loser etc. I feel like my absolute lack of experience and ability in sports contributes to this",14Jun2019,1

286,"To give some background to this, my currently 16 and so is my GF, we celebrated our year anniversary and are starting our Junior year after this Summer. The relationship is as strong as I would know, she is wonderful and supportive but incredibly timid and shy. Reason being is because since she was young her mother would bully her into just about everything. The father is too much of a coward to do anything and is often out of the house. She has an older sister that she still lives with, she has suffered a bad life as well, drugs, forced into bad schools, already has a 6 month old child. I've managed to know thos girl for quite a bit and have helped her away from that sort of path. I've done everything in my power to keep her happy and safe when I can but she can't always be over here. I've met her family multiple times and they're always so quiet and avoid eye contact. I myself am more or less that lives like an introvert nerd but with the personality of an outgoing person. Already a supervisor at my job for over a year. I'm sorry if the story isnt all that well explained but heres a few more tid bits of info. I have a learner's still, no car, she lives about 20 minutes away from my house. (I'm an out of district student) and lastly she has 0 friends. I've mostly been her only friend. I'm 5'11 and 220. So a little bit chunky but managing. Anything is useful, thank you.

We have 11 months since we are together, tomorrow we are doing 11 months actually, but that doesn't matter. Since a long time ago it was on and off, but actually, we broke up just 2 times.

&amp;#x200B;

So, 1 month ago, we broke up because of her anger issues. Believe me, in a fight, she would complain about everything I do, no matter what, and starts having lots of self-pride. So, I broke up with her, and she was ""Ok"", she wanted that too I felt it, because she tried to change herself into the better. I suffered, a lot, but the second day I made out with another girl from jealousy, because she was having so much fun with people, and she was full of laughs when I was dying outside, so I made out with another girl. When she found out, she was crying and she let her guard down. After a couple of days, she messaged me telling that she is sorry and blah blah blah. Of course, I accepted her so I came back for her. After 2 weeks she lied to my face, the bad thing was, that I knew the truth, but she was still hiding it. 1 week after the lie I was complaining about it a lot, because I was so fucking sad that she lied to me (it is the second time she did that) and she wanted to break up with me. I told her I have not been through 11 months to break up now because of her self-pride. Today, she wore a mini skirt and of course I was a bit stressed about it, but I told her it's okay and she can wear whatever she wants, she started complaining about it at home, telling me that I'm paranoid and other shit. Then I asked her if we will see each other tomorrow, she didn't even answer, she had that careless look and careless talk, and I hate it so much. What should I do? Am I right, or she is right?

Friend #1, we‚Äôll call her cherry, has always been a flake, never answers her phone (and when she does it‚Äôs 12 hours after the initial contact, sometime around 3 am) and friend #2, we will call her Indy, is always on her phone so like polar opposites, but anyways one day cherry, the flaker, actually surprisingly makes plans to go visit a museum that weekend, so I‚Äôm surprised because she never makes plans so we‚Äôre like ok cool,

The night before we go to the museum, which was to be on a Saturday, we‚Äôre texting around 11:00pm to finalize the details and we‚Äôre like ok we‚Äôll meet at 11 am at the museum separately and then we‚Äôll take the tour. Around 11:30 cherry  clocks out and she‚Äôs like gotta sleep guys and like that‚Äôs weird first of all because I know she stays up til like 3 am but whatever. I then realize that I forgot to ask for a ride to the museum because  my parents couldn‚Äôt take me, so around 11:45 I text cherry asking for a ride. She doesn‚Äôt answer and I stay up til like 1 am no answer, again, whatever. 

I fall asleep and I wake up around 10 am oops my bad, but it‚Äôs fine, and o check my phone and no messages, so I text cherry multiple times asking for a ride and I call her a bunch of times, no answer. I text my other friend Indy and no answer. It‚Äôs now 10: 40 am and I‚Äôm kinda freaking out cuz no ones answering, so I decide to take a shower for some reason, I guess I figured we could meet up a little later, whenever cherry decided to answer, so I get out of the shower and it‚Äôs like 11:15 and cherry finally answers, she says ‚Äúbro I‚Äôm already at the museum, you should‚Äôve let me know 24 hours in advance.‚Äù 

I was like are you kidding me, is this a rental car service, are you being serious, you didn‚Äôt check your phone from 11:30 pm to 11:00 am at all, not even to check the time or make sure everything was ok with the plans, apparently not right? I‚Äôm just like mad and annoyed because I‚Äôm sitting waiting like an idiot for these people to answer, and Indy answers at like 11:30 am and she‚Äôs like we‚Äôre both already here sorry so we‚Äôre just gonna do the tour and then we can meet after to eat, like she also hadn‚Äôt checked her phone for like a whole hour.

There's this girl I knew in high school (I'm currently in senior year of college), she's an absolute 11/10. Like I'm serious, she's the most beautiful girl I have ever seen, *ever*. Everyone at school knew this girl, and of course everybody wanted to date her. This girl can pretty much get any guy she's ever wanted if she tried, however she never had a boyfriend and she's tweeted out multiple times that she's a virgin. Let me remind you this was all in high school.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I tried talking to her one day in high school and I got her number and everything. We spoke a few times, nothing too crazy or interesting. I realized that she wasnt into me, or at least that's what I thought. So I'm a programmer and liked to make all sorts of things. There was one time where we got assigned this really lengthy homework assignment and I created a computer program to basically do most of the work. I shared it with her and she later tweeted (to her couple thousand followers) about me, basically praising me and expressing how happy she was. Let me note, her tweets almost never involved other people, it was usually just her thoughts (she even tagged me in the tweet).

&amp;#x200B;

Another time, I made a mobile app and she tweeted about it telling everybody to go download it. She even put a screenshot of the app lol. And right when we graduated, she messaged me saying that she wishes to see me do great things, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 3 years, out of the blue she messages me again:

&amp;#x200B;

""Hi! Was just thinking about you!! You‚Äôre probably doing great things, hope you‚Äôre doing well!""

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know what to think. I'm a 6.5/10 and I don't have any of the qualities that all the other dudes who hit on her have.

310,"Backstory/Relevant Info:
We broke up and stopped talking because well to be honest I wasn't exactly being that great. She lived in a state 6 hours away since thats where she went to college and truth be told I took her for granted a bit. Not like I was a bad guy or anything but mind you I(20 at the time) had just come off a battle with testicular cancer so I was drinking and smoking and being around friends to deal with shit rather than giving her all my time. At the same time we both had our flaws thats neither here nor there. I've come to accept that we'd never work out ever and maybe despite us being able to be really good friends at the time we weren't compatible. She moved on literally almost instantly.  Not even a week after our break-up she was already back on tinder, going on dates, fucking etc. She got into  two relationships since then, mind you this is over the span of 3 months since we cut each other off completely no contact. And she passive aggressively referenced me on social media after our break-up where she pretty much said I was a waste of her time and whatever we had was stupid and she's better than that. This all came about when I found her twitter about a month ago on coincidence, hence how I know all this info after doing some searching around. It doesn't matter anymore at this point. She's doing her life thing now with a new bf not thinking of me and I'm honestly working on my life with school and regular day-day life. Things are looking alright, they could be better but one day at a time. 

MY question now:
 
   I guess what I want to know is why the fuck do I keep creating this imaginary dialogue/scenario in my head in which we talk and I apologize for how I treated her and ask her how she's doing. Literally she hates my guts and no longer thinks of me because well I'm not on social media anymore and I just kind of disappeared from her life. I know I can't message her or even call her because it'd just do neither of us any good and I don't want to re-open any woulds by trying to get some closure through a phone call. If anything her twitter solidified that I'm in her past now and all in all I don't even want to talk to her if it came down to it in reality. I just wish I could fucking get my brain to stop thinking about her and whatever the fuck it was that we shared for our short period of time. I no longer want that fucking person on my mind every day. I just want to move the fuck on and go forward with my life but I catch myself fucking thinking of her or that dialogue everyday when I'm not occupied with school, work, social life and it really is starting to get to me. I can't even think about moving on with someone else really because I'm not looking for a relationship anymore yet I'm stuck in this loop of maladaptive daydreaming about her. I have no more love for her but my head has yet to shred her files metaphorically up there and I'm caught constantly looking through it. 

What can I do to stop this from happening and just move forward with my life already? Why is this even happening in the first place? I don't even know anymore why this is on my mind. She was their emotionally when I was getting my surgeries and healing up but all in all we knew eachother for a year and half and only dated on and off for like 6 months. It wasn't even that serious yet I'm stressing this mentally at this point for no reason WTF.",14Jun2019,2

313,"I live in China, and work teaching English.

On the same corridor as my office, there is the back of a kitchen which serves a posh restaurant- well I mean there is a backdoor to the restaurant that opens up onto the corridor.

Anyway, right beside the door there is a janitors closet type thing, and often the door is open. Inside are two small dogs, in two equally small cages one on top of the other. 

I have been here for three weeks and am becoming extremely concerned that the two dogs are being kept in these boxes in the room 24 hours a day and just being fed and watered in there. 

I hear backing twice during the day, presumably when the owner arrives and leaves. 

I can not be 100% sure that the dog is kept in the cage all the time as sometimes if I come late then the door to the janitors office thing is locked and I cannot tell of the dogs are there or not.

It is possible, and I am praying , that the owner is just keeping the dogs there while working and taking them home after but my gut feels like they are being kept in there. 

This makes me feel sick and I cannot work here knowing the poor animals are being kept in tiny cages right next to me.

What should my course of action be? It is not an option for me to just ignore it as I will end up breaking them out of there if it goes of for too long. Being in China, I don't think just calling animal welfare is an option either. 

What should I do?",14Jun2019,1
314,"I‚Äôm on mobile so sorry in advance.

So today i visited my sister who is almost done with college and we both went out for dinner nearby her condo. She lives in a very hot city which is well known in our country to be one of the hottest places. It‚Äôs kinda like Arizona; a fucking oven. So me, not wanting to sweat bullets, decided to wear shorts with a blouse.

Before we left the restaurant, I sent a picture of my sister and I to my boyfriend of two years. He saw my outfit and was instantly ‚Äúfrustrated‚Äù (his words not mine‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt a surprise to me. He always told me never to go out wearing anything like shorts out in public even when I‚Äôm with my family unless I‚Äôm with him.

This bothered me for a long time but I just agreed, most of the time at least. Whenever I would go out wearing shorts or anything sleeveless or crop top or even ripped jeans, he would be pissed. He‚Äôd roll his eyes and just be a big sour lemon until I change or something.

Today, I explained to him AGAIN that it‚Äôs my fucking body and I told him how much he‚Äôs upsetting me by restricting me that way and that it‚Äôs his problem if he has problems with what I wear. He kept on saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never understand my worries anyways‚Äù and usually that gets me pissed but I just replied with ‚ÄúAnd you can never understand the fact that just because you have worries doesnt make it enough for me to not wear what the fuck i want‚Äù.

In the end he said that he won‚Äôt bother me anymore with whatever I wear and apologized for not being one of those boyfriends who can‚Äôt support their girlfriends with what they‚Äôre wearing. I felt bad because I just have a huge soft spot for him.

What do I do? I‚Äôm worried that this can ruin our relationship. I know he sounds like an ass but really this is the only major thing about him that spells out ‚ÄúDUMP HIM‚Äù. Did I do the right thing? If you were in his position, would you still be upset?

tl;dr my boyfriend and i always gets in arguments when i wear something revealing and i put my foot down and he caved in but i‚Äôm worried it will fuck our relationship up",14Jun2019,1

316,"So this problem has been going on for quite a while, but it seems it's just worse than ever now. My dad's hearing has been getting worse and worse over the past few years. It's so bad that we have to really speak up for him to be able to hear us. And when we don't he get's frustrated and angry.
A few months ago one of these instances resulted¬† in a heated fight between my dad and my sister and me, and in a moment of anger I yelled at him to 'just get a hearing aid already.' I regret the way I yelled at him, for it clearly hurt him, but I still stand by what I said. His lack of hearing is restricting his functionality and enjoyment of life in general, and besides, I don't think it's fair of him to expect us to constantly take him into account when there's a possible solution just around the corner. Ever since that argument his hearing has become a non-debatable topic. And the tension within our household has just become unbearable.
I believe that the cause of my dad's denial is him having trouble accepting that he's getting older and overcoming his insecurities. And I completely understand why that's a hard thing to do. I love my dad and watching him struggle so much with this is painful.

(P.S. We live in the Netherlands and someone can get their hearing checked out for free and all other possible measures like a hearing aid for example, are completely covered by our insurance)",14Jun2019,2

318,"So when I was around 14 if get these random things that would freak me out. A certain song, someone who like familiar, rooms that looked familiar. It would throw me into a full panic attack and I didn't know why. Everytime I'd try to think about it it's like my brain would just shut that shit down. Until last summer.

Last summer I started having these types of things 5 times a day. That was because after being ""triggered"" or whatever again, I decided to get to the bottom of what all of this was about. And it wasn't hard to figure out. I had all these fragments of memories laying around. They made sense, I just didn't want to look at them before. So when I did, it kind of broke me all over again.

I was about eight y/o (9 years ago) when it happened. It was a stranger (to me at least, it was a friend of a friend of a friend) who was about 15. It was at this party and I walked in on him crying. He was super pissed off at the world and decided to take it out on me.

But long story short, I hadn't thought about it in a while. I started going to therapy and it pretty much put an end to the panic attacks and constantly thinking about it. But the other day I was at work (cashiering), and this guy came in. I say him and immediately went to check him out when his face dropped. He just froze there. Once he did that, I knew exactly who he was. We both just froze there staring at each other when the other cashier asked if she could help him and he checked out.

I left the room and freaked out for a minute. Then everything started to feel like it did before. Like it was happening all over again. And I realized what I had to do. I had to forgive him. If I didn't this would keep happening. So I did. He was a kid. What he did was wrong, but I forgive him for it. I can't hang on to it and let it destroy my life anymore. Since I've done that, I feel a thousand pounds lighter. I feel like in forgiving him, I forgave myself too. I'm not sure why I felt guilty about the whole thing, but I strangely did.

320," 

I hope it's alright to post this. I really need answers. If you check my profile, you'll probably see my post about my emotionally abusive partner. I've come to the conclusion that I cannot change him but rather, I need to change myself.

I know, I know. ""Acceptance, meditation, letting go of the past, making yourself busy etc""

but that's not what I'm here for. I am incapable of doing all those if my mind is occupied by thoughts 24/7 coupled with separation anxiety and all uninvited negative emotions. I feel like losing myself. I can feel insanity coming.

I would just like to see if there are pills I could ask my psychiatrist if I could have it and if there's none, pls recommend me a way of getting through this. I just visited a psychiatrist. I was feeling worried about asking the same questions to her because she might say those ""You have to let go"" advice and then if I don't accept it, she would enforce her statements towards me because it just happened with a certain subject I had discussed with her.

""The thing in psychology, we don't know about dynamics. You might have the heroic syndrome(? I'm sorry, I forgot the word she used) that you feel as if you need to ""heal"" him because of your past.(Physically abusive father to my mother)""

I told her It's not the case because I don't have the urge to heal him because I feel like I need to but I only wish for him and actively try to make him change(which might be wrong of me) because it was simply \*hurting\* me. Of course, I love him and I want to be with him.

Much like how you'll ask your friend to not call you names(jokingly) because it hurts you.

Her point was that I MAY have it. The possibility. But in the same vein, I MAY NOT have it. But she kept enforcing that it ""MAY.""

326,"Over the past several weeks I started a ""FWB"" relationship with someone I dated in the past. We stopped dating because he realized he wasn't ready for a relationship, wasn't over his ex, and wasn't prepared for anything romantic.

It was a mutual understanding, and we left it at that.

We didn't talk for several months, until I reached out to him and asked if we could be friends and then, soon enough, friends with benefits. He said he was flattered, and that he'd be open to trying it out. He reiterated that he wasn't looking for anything romantic and just wanted to be friends.

Fast forward to our first hookup. We talk, hang out like usual friends, have sex, get burgers for dinner and play video games. It was a nice time and I really enjoyed myself. It felt like the first time we ever hung out that there wasn't this awkward feeling of miscommunication or expectations between us and it was a nice change of pace. We talked about his life, my life, etc. and overall, had a great time.

He offered that I could either go home or spend the night, and so I spent the night. We cuddled and slept together and just had a relaxing time.

A week goes by and I get a text from him asking if I'd like to hang out again. Surprised at his reaching out, I agreed and we figured out another day. The reason this caught me by surprise is that, even when we were dating he rarely reached out an initiated anything. It was always me.

Eventually, two days before us hanging out again, he shoots me a text late at night and asks if I want to have a phone call. I say sure and we just talk like normal, ask how each other is doing, etc. Again, this catches me by surprise. He didn't usually text me outside of us going on dates in the past. But now, he's being more responsive.

Our second hookup comes around, and here's where things get interesting. We hang out, talk like usual, and then he gets a text from his ex. He's surprised because he hadn't heard from her in awhile, and briefly told me about their relationship and about how things ended (but, in hien-sight shouldn't have because their disagreement was fixable and wasn't really even a major problem at all).

He then talks to me about how having friendships can be hard and difficult because of communication, but that he was really glad I reached out to him eventually and that he didn't end up losing another friend and that we're still talking even after we stopped dating. We start holding hands and he tells me that he was just afraid that all I wanted was something romantic and nothing else.

I then tell him that I still have feelings for him and that I still like him but that I'm not really expecting much out of it. I then asked him how he felt.

He surprises me when he says, ""I like you too.""

Taken aback I look over and say, ""Wait, really?""

He says, ""Yeah. I mean, we kiss and we do things too, so, I'm not really sure what that's supposed to say/mean but... Yeah, I do.""

And we just kind of lay there in silence for a bit before we both agree that it was getting late and that I should head home. Before I leave, I walk over to give him a hug and he places his head on my chest and hugs me and we stay there for awhile, hugging each other, until I leave.

And now I'm sitting here confused about where this is going. Because, really. Where is this going? Is this really just a ""friends with benefits"" situation? Or is there something more going on?",14Jun2019,2

337,"Hi,
Before I begin, i‚Äôd like to start off by saying i‚Äôm a 19 year old who has had experience with drinking alcohol and I am 100% aware of what it can do to you. I started drinking around the age of 17-18.
My brother is a 13 year old who has recently asked my mother if she can buy him a ‚Äúcrate‚Äù of alcohol. My parents are not exactly that strict, well not anymore. With my upbringing, my parents were tough and made sure I did my best in everything and stayed out of trouble. My brother on the other hand has had a more calming or should I say ‚Äúspoilt‚Äù upbringing. My parents would give in to his manipulation and buy him whatever, like a ¬£400 smartphone, a ¬£700 pc etc. My brother had had issues before, for example, last year we caught him with vape pens. My parents weren‚Äôt happy of this and we discussed how bad of an influence it is.
My brother has been invited to a party this Saturday, and has asked my Mother for a crate of beer. We (me and my parents) have tried discussing him why he shouldn‚Äôt do it and that it‚Äôs against the law. But I noticed one thing, my mother seems to have given up in terms of strictness. She believes it‚Äôs best to just let him do it because ‚Äúit‚Äôll make him realise there‚Äôs nothing exciting‚Äù to it. I hugely disagree with this. My argument is that it, for all we know, might make him like it and try other drugs. I have tried talking to him and warned the consequences but he doesn‚Äôt listen! He‚Äôs just so spoilt that all he cares about is getting what he wants. Also, I forgot to say that he also drank a whole glass of beer before and he didn‚Äôt give a crap about it. I‚Äôm extremely worried he‚Äôs gonna take it far, especially since his ego is as big as it is.
So what do you guys think? He won‚Äôt listen at all and my parents are literally useless at this rate. He is clearly manipulating them again. Is there something I could tell him? Even though I‚Äôve said enough to him yet he won‚Äôt care.",14Jun2019,5

341,"So backstory: my roommate and a rly good friend of mine liked this guy, let‚Äôs call him X.

During this time my friend developed a lil crush on X which I knew but she wasn‚Äôt really doing anything about it so other than some kisses not much else happened between them. 
Fast forward to now, I broke up with my boyfriend which led to me hanging out with these girls a little more and obviously with X as well. We were both big GOT fans and NBA fans so we would watch the games and the episodes together. It was all friendly until slowly I started to feel things for this guy. I didn‚Äôt want to act upon it because 1. I didn‚Äôt know if I was just lonely and 2. I didn‚Äôt want to potentially fuck up my friendship for nothing.

342,"Glossing over a LOT here to prevent a wall of text as best I can.


Growing up, my father was physically, mentally and verbally abusive to me. At 16 years old I left home and was homeless with my now husband of 7 years, who has seen first hand how horrible my father can be. Now, my son is seeing and hearing the way my father verbally attacks myself and my mother, and I don‚Äôt know how to handle this.


After the birth of my son, we moved into my parents home temporarily until we found a place of our own. 3 months later, that ended in the police helping escort myself, my husband and our son off the property after my father threw me into a wall (I chose not to press charges against the advice of the cops), threatened my and my husbands lives, pushed my mother into my sons play pen and charged up the stairs yelling that he was going to kill my husband. All because my father didn‚Äôt agree with our parenting tactics of our infant child (coming from the man with 3 kids who detest him for being heartless and abusive), and after my mother refused to let us leave, my husband threatened to call the police, which sent my father off.


We slowly repaired our relationship over the last almost 6 years, with a lot of space between us. However, my son is 6 now and  absolutely adores his grandfather, much to my discontent. My father still verbally abuses myself and my mother, and recently began doing so in front of my son. My father has gone so far as to look at my son and say ‚Äúyour mother is a fucking idiot‚Äù after he gave me incorrect instructions on something and I couldn‚Äôt figure out some insignificant thing.


I‚Äôve gotten to a point that I can‚Äôt have him around my son, constantly cursing myself and my mother out and calling us down, all in front of my child. He tears us down and too many times to count, I‚Äôm left crying in bed and feeling worthless and stupid because of him. Communication is impossible, as it resulted in him telling me I need professional help and threatening to call CPS because I‚Äôm ‚Äúemotionally unstable‚Äù and ‚Äúfucked in the head.‚Äù


I know it should be easy to just give him two middle fingers and walk away, but I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll forever lose my mother since she‚Äôs made it clear she will stand by him over me.

On Saturday night the 1 of June me and my gf were at a friends house for a party and well, being the first time we could sleep together and stuff we took complete advantage of that. Started off with some hand stuff from me to her then got to oral. When she was done I got a hand job in return (at the time I was just like HELL YEAH). Now here's the thing. We didn't have sex. No penis in or anywhere near a vagina. Mainly because I didn't have a condom and because it wasn't really on our mind. I didn't touch her down there after I was done and neither did she. When she was getting me off I had my hand down there But again I'm pretty sure I didn't even have pre cum on my hand but I cant be sure. We did some stuff to her in the morning But 1) we both washed out hands (2) you cabt get pregnant from dried Cum.

Here's the problem. She got some cramps a few days later like period cramps but no period. Looked up what they were and they can be cramps for an early pregnancy. Then we started talking about how it probably wasn't as safe as we thought. She's almost about to get her period if its on time or uno...she's not pregnant. She should get it around now to Tuesday. When it's nearly bleed out time she gets symptoms which she's been getting but there like the same as early pregnancy symptoms. Our deal is if she doesn't get it buy Sunday I get her a test and we see. 
Another problem her parents can't know. Mine can and will help because they love us and whatever. But I just need help on 1) how to stop stressing (2) what do you guys think pregnant or no (3) HOW THE SHIT DO WE GET AN ABORTION WITHOUT HER PARENTS KNOWING.

anyway I'm done. If this is wrong for this sub I'm sorry Just tell me where to post it. Also We're Obviusly just teens. Sorry for the rant. üíì",14Jun2019,2

350,"So, I am gay and I have a crush on a guy in my class and I don't know if he likes me. He gives mixed signals and at this point, I'm really confused.

 So, I noticed that I had a crush on him on February of this month. He was the sweetest person I've ever met. I don't want to bore you with the details but in the end, I ended up falling for him. Ever since then, I started observing him and his behavior towards me. I noticed that he would come up to me and just talk about stuff (Mostly about the exams, the lessons etc.) even though I hadn't engaged in conversation before. He would come up to me in lunch break and we would chat. Then, he started texting me. It was usually about homework and stuff but he would text me very often. Once, he even said that ""I belonged to him"" after I agreed to help him study for an exam. 

 Then, after a month or two, he started calling me nearly 5 times a week. He would ask about the usual school things, things that he could've easily asked someone else.

 Now, this is where it all gets a little bit confusing: When he would approach me, we would only chat for a short period of time and he would leave after a couple of minutes. We never talked about our lives or our feelings. Never. He was kinda distant. Also, he gave the vibe that we were just friends.

 Should I tell him that I like him?

P. S. This guy never said that he was straight nor gay. However, a friend of mine who knew him for a long time told me that he never talked about girls and stuff. But he also didn't show any interest in boys.",14Jun2019,5

I had to beg my father to spend a lot of money on a good sports bra. Yesterday when changing into my uniform, the zipper in front BROKE. I couldn't just drop practice so I went without a bra. It was incredibly uncomfortable and embarrassing and a bit painful with all the bouncing. At the end I was exhausted and felt quite bad. When my brother picked me up he noticed something was wrong and I explained to him what had happened. He said it's my fault for trying to do a sport that I am not built for and that instead of wasting money on expensive bras I should just stop wearing them altogether.

I remember also that when I was in middle school we were talking about the Holocaust and my friend didn't understand a thing and asked me to repeat it for her. I explained it, it was a really sad and horrible thing but I started smiling. My friend noticed and called me insensitive.

363,"Earlier this week, a woman that works for a billion dollar insurance broker placed her hand on my back in very demeaning/strange/uncomfortable while at a mutual client's meeting that I was presenting in front of 70+ people. I work for a billion dollar carrier, and this woman is the broker between us and a billion dollar client. 

After the presentation, while employees lined up to ask personal questions, this person grabbed onto my hand (and gripped my pinky finger) asking to pinky promise her about sharing some irrelevant information. I've had multiple phone conversations that were unprofessional with this person, making me feel uncomfortable meeting her for the first time at our mutual (billion dollar) client. After she placed her hand on me the first time, I was shaken. After she grabbed for the pinky swear, I was completely shocked. Throughout the previous days of phone calls, she was a bully. With the inappropriate touching, I dont know whether it was a power trip, or she was trying to display affection.

I told my (dir) VP about the touching and bullying behavior the day following the meeting. I realize we live in 2019 and we are gender equals, but I did not escalate the issue further. I also told the internal sales rep that was also assigned to this insurance broker, and this person warned me that he felt she was bipolar, and to watch out (prior to the incident)

Yesterday morning, I received a very early email from the external woman to urgently call her, which I did (my first work item of the day). She asked a work question that I answered correctly, then she repeated back my words, but they were entirely different. It was a peculiar conversation. At that moment, i could not prevent myself from confessing to her how uncomfortable I felt with her touching me (both times). She flipped out, said that this isnt working out, and I simply repeated the words back to her that it obviously wasnt working out. 

I immediately sent an email to my VP about the situation, asking to be removed from the case. I repeated the details that were discussed in office 3 days prior, which he remembered. He mentioned that he just recieved an email from the external broker asking for me to be removed from the case, and am now the 2nd person in the department that he had to take off her clients (the first was a woman). 

I don't know what to do at this time. I love my company, and have been on the fast track to upper management with great yearly reviews. As a Male in today's world, I truly feel humiliated, and feel as a victim. I can now empathize with all of the woman that had to endure such BS at work. 

What should I do?? Do I jeopardize my career by escalating this to HR? Call a lawyer? I didn't sleep for multiple days, and I'm carrying this burden alone. I had multiple days of presentations for this client, and bailed on the last day, asking my coworker to cover the meetings at the last moment. 

Quick bio: I've been working for major insurance carriers approximately 11 years, specifically with insurance brokers. Currently, I hold a middle management position, and considered by some to be a rising star. Currently in this position for 5 years, and assigned to our most important accounts. I've also been a confident, kind person-- but this had me shook. I'm not in any trouble internally, but I feel this should not happen to any MAN or WOMAN in 2019. I mentioned the billion dollar comments, as I am up against the machine at every corner",14Jun2019,2
365,"Hello everyone,

So recently an issue has popped up where some weirdo 6th grader in our school has started to become attracted to her. That wasn‚Äôt a problem by itself because he asked her out and she said no, as we are dating (we have been together for a little Ofer a year). On the last day of school, to celebrate graduation (we had both graduated 8th grade this year), we were going to go out for dinner, and spend some nice time at a local park, with the nice weather. The kid freaking followed us out of the school, into the restaurant, and back to the park. He took videos of us cuddling and kissing, and posted them on Instagram. He said to us after that the only way he would take them down is if he got to date MY girlfriend, or that he got to kiss her and have sex with her, which is WILDLY inappropriate, especially for a 6th grader. I threatened I‚Äôm with the school principal, and he took them down out of fear. 
Recently he has been harassing her over text with spams, and saying things like ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and ‚Äúyour so sexy‚Äù and ‚ÄúI wanna touch your boobs‚Äù, that kinda shit. She has been telling me about this, but she doesn‚Äôt wanna tell any adult, because if I or she does, she will get into trouble with her mother for ‚Äúlying‚Äù and ‚Äúnot telling her sooner‚Äù (her mom is very strict, and hard to work with). So we have no body to tell really, and this 6th grader is lying straight to my face when I talk to him about it, and my girlfriend hates his guts. She is being pressured into making out with him, and some other weird shit, so she can be left alone. 
She has tried blocking him on all the different platforms that she receives messages from him on, but somehow he always finds another way. 
Do any of you have any advice???? 
Any would be greatly appreciated, as I have no idea where to go next.
Thanks!",14Jun2019,6

375,I‚Äôm a 19 year old female that goes to school at a relatively small college at the moments that‚Äôs a bit far from home. Last year I had an ‚Äúincident‚Äù involving a football player. Eventually after five months I reported it to the school but Hadn‚Äôt told my parents. One day my mom was going through my emails ( I have no problem with this as most of my emails are spam from the school and she helps me clear this) and she read through my entire report that the investigator had sent me. In hindsight I should‚Äôve given them a different email but I knew at one point or another my parents would have to find out. When my parents found out they were pretty upset that I didn‚Äôt go to the school or police right after it happened. They kept telling me that because I waited there isn‚Äôt anything I could do and that he was probably going to get away with what he had done. I can deal with this it‚Äôs whatever. The problem is that once I had gotten home from college for the summer I started working at this restaurant my parents and their friends go to a lot. After my first day one of my parents friends stopped me (he was heavily intoxicated) saying that he knew what happened to me and was going to ‚Äúbeat the dude who did this to me‚Äù.  I left very soon after that to go home. Once I got home I started yelling at my parents which I‚Äôve never really had the courage or rage to do it before but I guess I did now. I asked them why they would tell all their friends and said that it was crossing the line. My father just yelled back and said I was trying to protect the football player by not telling anyone and that they were trying to protect me because I am a ‚Äútarget‚Äù for the football player and his friends when I go back to college. Honestly I don‚Äôt think I am but his words are starting to make me weary to go back even if I am truly happy there.

378,"I'm a 31 year old male and only child.  A pretty quiet person.  Live on the East coast of the US my entire life.  Parents are 71 and 66.  I lived at home in the East Coast until I was 26.  At age 28, my parents retired and moved out to the West coast to be with my mom's side of the family.

Because of the distance, I was never close with the rest of my family.  Being far apart is the only thing I knew.  Couple with the fact that I'm an only child, family was never super important.

My parents want me to move out West *bad*.  My mom even admitted she ""just sort of assumed I would follow them.""  But I currently have a great job, and a small group of great friends who are forever child-free for their own reasons.  I read how hard it is for adults to find good friends so I am eternally grateful I have a supportive group of close friends.  I know how unique this is.

But as my parents get older, I want to spend more time with them.  My job also has an HQ in the same city as my parents and they said they could probably allow me to move there and keep my job.  So I have this amazing situation where I'm wanted into two cities separated by 2000 miles and have the option to move if I want and have nothing but my social life really take a hit.

However, the reason I moved out is because my mom suffers from pretty bad depression a lot and I just couldn't handle the yelling and screaming that would happen for almost no reason every week or two.  I still love my mom but I could not be around her 24/7.  Plus I was 26 so you know...

I want a family.  I want kids.  I just feel currently like I'm stuck where I'm at and I need to move on.  But who knows if moving will change that?  I heard the city I would be moving to has lots of city events and places to meet people.  More than in the small town I live in now.  But I don't know how to take advantage of that since, as I said, I'm just a quiet person in general.  Plus, if I moved, chances are I would be working from home and therefore wouldn't even meet people in the office often, if at all.  So I would lose my cherished social life and would have to rebuild which is daunting...  I don't know if it would be possible.

My friends give great advice but holy shit, they were way more hurt than I thought they would be when I told them I was thinking of moving.  Talking to them to get advice on this particular subject is just impossible.

So to prevent rambling on and on...  what should I do?  I'm sure there are more details I could give, so ask away.  I just don't know what to do...",14Jun2019,1

She‚Äôs in my bed right now sleeping and I‚Äôm in the kitchen sitting here writing this out. I‚Äôm just so shook by the whole situation. What if he finds out and he isn‚Äôt me nice guy anymore?! Should I just tell her husband this?

381,"I'm a 20 year old college student who has been unemployed since December. But because I'm in school I only worked that last job during my breaks from school. I've blown through 12,000 dollars of savings because of school and other bills. I should've been working during school but since I still had enough money to pay for things I didn't worry about it. School is out and I'm completely broke. I just got hired as a waitress and plan to work this job during the next school as well but I'm  currently not making enough money to get by. I have less than a hundred dollars to my name and an almost 200 dollar car payment due in a week. I'm living with family for the summer that has cut down on my costs quite a bit but I'm still renting an apartment in the town I go to school in because the lease isn't up yet. It's also cheaper to live off campus than on so I will continue to live there when school starts and my financial aid refund will cover it. My current situation sucks and I'm sorry if I wrote it in a confusing way. Basically, I have no money, am not making much money at my new job and would like any advice anyone can give me. I need to get out of this situation. I've never been in this kind of financial bind before and it's really stressful.",14Jun2019,3
382,"Hey Reddit. So this is bit of a confusing story, but I need help on how to deal with.

It started around a months time ago, I was at my cousin's confirmation (it's a thing in Denmark). With him (14) being a younger guy, and all the other guests from family being mostly his age I (21) wasn't doing much other than talking to family and family friends at the reception.


Later on during the evening I fell into conversation with an absolutely gorgeous and amazing and funny girl, a few years younger than me. She is the daughter of a friend of our family, and her brothers were there too, but that's not the point.
Her and I immediately connected. Our conversation was insanely smooth going, there was smiling, laughing, we were drinking bottles upon bottles of wine and smoking, just really enjoying each other's company.


Now, during this time we got a bit closer to each other, talking about relationships and what not. I told her how I had been in a long term which had ended peacefully, but that the reason for spotting was mostly maturing and feelings no longer being mutual.
She stated to me indirectly that she was in a bad relationship with a  guy, who wasn't treating her very well etc. I told her to really think about it, and her situation and well being with this guy, if it made her unhappy. She told me he was her first boyfriend. She even told me her parents resented him, for being a huge dick to her.


Anyway, we exchange Instagram's and the night ends, she gives me a huge long hug and we go home with our families.

Next day I texted her how I would have loved for the night to have continued with her. During our conversation I had stated how I recently moved into a new apartment, and we joked about her coming over to help me renovate and style it up. We started texting on and off for a bit, but she assured me that she was still in  relationship over text; which I had no problem with. I said I had misinterpreted it, to which she responded that she was sorry because she really liked me.

A week or so passes where we text slightly, until a brief period with no communication whatsoever. I get a text out of the blue from her asking what I would be doing the coming weekend, which she follows up with saying that her and her bf had broken up.
Now, I obviously was concerned about her , but admit to being happy about hearing that.
I offered her some bad jokes and good company to get her mind off of things, so we settled on meeting Friday.



Now my stomach was turning. Every day and hour I was excited until Friday. I bought wine, candles, and made food, and when she came, the magic just continued. She even brought a bottle herself. It just went on trainrails; everything was just perfect. We danced to her favourite song, cuddled to a movie and overall got closer to each other.

When it became late, I asked her if I could kiss her. She just went in for it, and we continued. It became more intimate, and we went to have sex in my bedroom, some time after. Before doing so, however I asked her

""I only want to do this if you do.""

Her respond still echoes in my head, when  she said ""so do what we both want to do"".

Afterwards we were laying cuddling, I told her that she was a fantastic girl, despite what she had been led to believe by her ex. I told her that she is smart and funny, and listened to her. She cried, and I comforted her. Afterwards we took a shower together, with a bit of kissing still and good mood, as we spat water at each other.


However after we were done she wanted to go for another smoke. She told me she suddenly felt weird about everything, and that I was the only other guy shes been with after her ex. Now, I reassured her that if anything is wrong, she can just tell me, and that communication is important. I told her that if she needed space, I would happily give it to her.
She then said she wanted to go home. We stood in my living room for a while, just hugging.

 She then told me ""it's not you. I really dont want you to feel like a rebound. You're doing all the right things""

I followed her to the bus stop, where we waited for her bus. She gave me a small wristband, she had been carrying. When the bus came, we kissed and she went home. Her phone hadn't had much battery left, so I told her to text me when she was home, which she did.

The next day I texted her, saying that I really enjoyed our time, and that im sorry she felt weird toward the end. Then she told me she was happy about the things I said. I tried to carry on the conversation, but it died shortly after.


After that, we didn't talk for days, until last Wednesday, where I tried to call her. Mind you, my stomach and head has been unbelievable during this time. I could not stop thinking about her.
She responded with asking what I wanted with a few kissing emojis, I told her I wanted to know how she was doing because I thought of her, etc. She said that what sweet but that she couldn't talk atm.



Now I'm here. I'm desperate for this girl, but I promised to give her time, which I will. She is even going to a festival near the end of the month, and I immediately bought tickets for it, after I knew she was gonna go. I would do everything to be with her.


But what am I supposed to do? Her last few messages has been slightly cold toward me, but I try to keep my head up.",14Jun2019,3
383,"I‚Äôm 19. My first year of college I lived in a single by myself because I have a history of mental health issues which made it difficult for me to be okay sharing a space like the bedroom. I also have an emotional support cat that helps me cope that has lived with me. My best friend at college, Rachel, has met the cat before and understands her purpose. Last November we decided to look into off campus housing for the following year (it‚Äôs cheaper). We found a cute house that I could afford with a single, which would be perfect for me and my cat, she was fine with being in a shared room again. I soon found out through a misunderstanding that the single room wasn‚Äôt available because a 23 year old girl who was in the house previously was staying the following year and wanted it. Because of my age, I let it be. Fast forward we end up signing the lease and it‚Äôs June and I move in. Rachel has a job back home so she hasn‚Äôt come to stay yet aside from moving some stuff in. Rachel now starts worrying about the possibility of a cat issue and I told her not to preemptively worry about it, and instead wait to see what happens and we deal with if it it‚Äôs the case. My one housemate is a very sweet girl with a mild cat allergy, but she deals with it because she loves cats and occasionally comes in my room to play with my cat. My other housemate is intolerant of people who aren‚Äôt super environmentally friendly, don‚Äôt live her exact lifestyle (she‚Äôs a neat freak and repeatedly tells us things we do wouldn‚Äôt fly in her house). She‚Äôs around 20/21, is against drinking, smoking, and overall is making me miserable to be around her. She makes it clear she doesn‚Äôt like animals (everyone knew a cat would be living with us for me for medical purposes before even signing the lease) and doesn‚Äôt want to cat to wander the house. I feel terrible about keeping a cat restricted to a room so we compromise and the cat can go wherever when I am home to supervise her. Last night was Rachel‚Äôs first night sleeping in my room with the cat. during the day, as the one girl with the mild allergy loves cats, she let her wonder in the room that is shared with the one that doesn‚Äôt like cats. This night everything goes to shit. I‚Äôm trying to sleep because I have to wake up early for work. Rachel is going on and on about how she‚Äôs nervous the cat will go on her bed and bother her. I tell her if you ignore her she‚Äôll leave you alone (which is true). She wakes me up like 30 minutes into the night and is like your cat is on my bed. I take the cat off, try to bring her to my area of the room, and end up falling asleep. I wake up the next morning to a long text from Rachel saying that she was having a panic attack last night and was having bad allergies from the cat so she had to sleep on the couch and go home in the morning. I also wake up to a text from the bitchy girl saying she‚Äôs also allergic (which she found out because the other girl was playing with the cat in her room for a bit), followed by a webmd article about cat allergies (lol). Rachel has repeatedly suggested things such as locking the cat out of the room, crating her during the night, or keeping her in the living room. She‚Äôs an emotional support cat so all of these defeat her purpose. Cats are also nocturnal and sleep during the day so I think it‚Äôs borderline abusive to lock a cat in a tiny crate for 7-9 hours during the night. I also want to mention I have medium cat allergies (genetic) but I manage them through allergy medicine and such. I feel like everyone is ganging up on me. I talked to the 23 year old in the single and she thinks it‚Äôs unfair to me since everyone knew a head of time about the cat, and we need to compromise rather than give everything their 100%. I don‚Äôt want anyone unhappy but I also can‚Äôt treat my own cat badly. I literally don‚Äôt know how to handle this or what to do.",14Jun2019,2

387,"I‚Äôm born catholic and grew up with my orthodox mother. 

I am in a secular school where 99% of the teachers and students are non religious or atheists, so I am not growing up in any sort of Christian influence and therefore I believe in the scientific proofs taught at school and such, and I am also getting attached to people who are atheists. I appreciate everyone no matter what  their beliefs are !  

I and my mother recently had a discussion about christianism  where I told her that I never really had a  strong connection with god and Jesus and Christianity in general , but was ( and  maybe still am  believing??)  just because I‚Äôm scared of what will happen after I die and whether I‚Äôll go to hell or not or if I‚Äôm considered an impure person by not believing. 

I personally don‚Äôt like the idea of heaven and hell  because that would mean that if you have any atheist or non christian close friends (in my case) , they would go and suffer in the pits of hell when they die while you stay alone in solitude and pray to the lord and savior in heaven. 

I like to think that after spending your life on earth, your soul will still sort of  connect with those whom you got along with in your life and that your energy will still be there somewhere, I  think I do have some faith in this hypothesis,  but it‚Äôs just mostly because I‚Äôm extremely scared of death, getting older and losing the people I love.

 My mom always tells me that life will be tough at some point and praying on something will make you go through it, but isn‚Äôt that just having faith in yourself? Wouldn‚Äôt it be egoist if you would just go to god whenever you need help and ignore your faith completely when you‚Äôre in good state? 

I told her that I personally do not agree with some of the rules in the Bible and that we should tolerate people equally no matter what their gender, biological sex, sexuality, race or religion is, just as how I got taught to behave at school ever since I was little , to which she got very mad and offended and told me that I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about and that I should study the bible and  books more before making such idiotic claims , but this is not about knowledge it‚Äôs just being a good person?? She told me that the gays are mentally ill and atheists have no life here on earth and after death and I just can‚Äôt seem to agree with this..

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I do like my mother as she is very nice , cares a lot about me and lets me pursue my dreams but this conversation really made me lose my faith, as well as that one priest who told me I can only find happiness in Jesus and nothing else and that people who don‚Äôt have this close minded idea don‚Äôt deserve to be the ‚Äòchildren of god‚Äô and shall meet in the underground.

My (atheist) history teacher also made some really good points on the purpose of religion in the medieval era , he‚Äôs a very good person and really inspires me a lot, he‚Äôs the proof that atheists are not lifeless creatures who shall suffer for their beliefs and I would like to follow his kind of life as well, yet I‚Äôm not sure if I should consider myself agnostic or atheist after all.. 

I would just like to live a happy life and enjoy the most of it with the people I like, focusing on my passions and ideas and do my own thing.

I would appreciate some advice from all of you and I‚Äôm sorry for making this text so long , I am very grateful you read this nevertheless ! Thank you so much.

( I will also post this on the atheist and agnostic forum just in case  so I can get a broader perspective from all of you, thank you very much again !! )‚≠êÔ∏è",14Jun2019,8

The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt got a boyfriend you know, Darren‚Äô and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.

392,"So, I‚Äôm a raging bisexual who loves science math and stuff (I‚Äôm actually planning on majoring in aerospace engineering if that says anything) and I‚Äôve been planning on how to come out to my family for quite a while, but never really planned on when. This plan I‚Äôve come up with recently is probably my favorite and involves me subtly saying I‚Äôm bi with small science and math jokes and whoever gets it will know I‚Äôm bi. I‚Äôm friends with most of my family members on social media so this will probably work.


For example, I post:

‚ÄúSimplify the equation: 3m+4e=3b+4‚Äù
It would probably be a bit more complicated than that but that‚Äôs just to get the picture. The point is to simplify it to me=bi.


Or alternatively:

‚ÄúI have 83 electrons‚Äù


The only problem is that I don‚Äôt know whether or not I should go through with this plan. My family is pretty religious, save for this most recent generation (me, my brother, and most of my cousins), and they probably wouldn‚Äôt take it well. But I‚Äôm also pretty done with hiding it, even though I really don‚Äôt. I hit on women in front of my family and they pay pretty much no heed.

397,"Hello everyone. For one and a half year I have been working at a local store in my hometown. It started as a seasonal job because during the winter the owners do not need a lot of employees. However they asked me to stay and continue working for them. I didn't have anything else to do so I said yes. Since then, everything started going South. Lack of interest from the owners and discrimination among employees were the main reasons. They started to favor their friends who also worked as employees and the rest of us, in some cases, were treated like secondaries. Personally I couldn't leave because I am in dire need of the money. Currently we are midway through the summer season (more or less) and these problems still exists. I intend to leave in a couple of months but I was considering having another conversation with the owners about these issues. There were a couple of times before which I argued with them, with one conversation being extremely heated, and as a result they branded me as 'the bad guy' to the rest of the people who work there. What do you think? Should I go at it again? Or should I say 'screw it' and leave them to the mess they've made?

402,"So here is the backstory - I am 28, born and living in eastern Europe, I have been working in a big international corporation's sales department for past 5 years. Last year I decided I wanted a change and I applied to med school and got accepted. I have informed my employer and asked them for shorter hours contract (25hrs/week). They said OK, but also that they cannot promise that this will work indefinitely. Today our director has called me in his office, telling me that this arrangement no longer works for them and they need a full time employee for my position (which is understandable, no hard feelings there). I should have up to 3 month to decide what I do next, before my job is terminated.

I would like to avoid quitting school, I really enjoy my time there - it is the hardest shit I have ever tried, but I am constantly surrounded by really smart, really ambitious kids and I just don't wanna give it up. The problem is I also need to sustain myself somehow.

Now for the financial breakdown of my situation:

(All the figures will seem really low, this is eastern europe though, the median salary in my country is about 1000 USD a month after tax and insurance.)

My living expenses are about 700USD/month, if I am rather frugal (way more than I have usually been so far).

My current salary for the 25hr weeks is about 1 200 USD/month. I have got some savings, however a deadline for a college debt is around the corner and that will wipe all of it and then some. (This is from my previous college years ago. Colleges are free in my country, I studied abroad though.)

Salaries for part time jobs such as bar-tending or receptionist are about 5-7USD/hour and I cannot really work more than 20-30 hours a week alongside the school, so that does not really add up to cover my living expenses. 

I will appreciate any ideas, about what might be good next step(s), maybe what jobs could I consider, that have flexible hours etc., ways to cut down living expenses, any other considerations, etc... Thank you :)",14Jun2019,1
403,"Long story short, I met a girl and we had a one night stand. This was on May 23. She told me she was on the depo shot, so we had sex unprotected. I know, it was stupid. Then 2 weeks later on June 7, she messages me saying that she's pregnant. Now I know this story is one sided, but this girl seemed to have a chaotic lifestyle from the stories she was telling me. Things like she hit a deer and lost her job because she couldn't drive to work, her brother committing suicide, going homeless, spending a night in jail for truancy, coughing up blood and going to the hospital, etc. She told me lots of these things after we hung out. I wasn't sure what to believe was true. I told her that I don't think we should keep talking, so I try to cut contact. I wake up the next day to several messages from her calling me names. Apparently she got really drunk. Then she starts apologizing and texting me lots of messages. I call her to tell her to stop contacting me. She doesnt answer for a few times, but then she does and says for me to stop blowing her up. I then decide to block her number. Then on June 10th, she sends me a voicemail and a picture of an ultrasound from a different number with a gestational sac and saying the baby is mine. She said she missed me. I then told her to leave alone and she called me a monster/asshole. Now I know she had sex with her ex prior to hanging out with me. My question is there anything to worry about? I don't want this drama. I explained the story to family and friends with stories she told me. They said that it doesn't seem true. Any advice would be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

GF of 3 years cut things off with me maybe this time around last year. Told me I made her feel miserable  even though we both know that I always tried my best in terms of being there for her in our relationship. She was just a miserable person.  I had known what she did with someone else after we were not a thing anymore. This hurt my feelings so much. I felt betrayed and I still feel betrayed to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

I never thought to move on because I missed her so much that anything said to me to hurt my feelings I did not process in the moment at all. She told me plenty of things to get me off her back I'd presume and she deeply regrets it, but I still feel like I should hold it against her. Even now that we are back together and now she lives with my family and I an hour away from where she lived with her family. While we were apart I never told her about my struggle with my self-worth or what I endured. Crying every night in the dark. I'd go out with different women and I just felt like I could not trust anyone at all. I feel like betrayal is inevitable now. I've told her up and down how I felt/feel and she deeply regrets anything, but she understands that she can't do anything now to change the past. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I just really want to try my best to move on. I've listened to a hand full of podcast and watched plenty of youtube videos on not feeling hurt and being able to not let the past define you, but refine you. I'm just tired of feeling like a victim and not being able to trust my SO. I do wish sometimes that I would have just moved on. That it was stupid of me to hold on for so long. I could have enjoyed so much more instead of being depressed all the time, but I feel like it is too late for that now lol. I have a lot of pride, confidence, and quite the ego. I'm not one to forgive people and if I did it would take me years.

She decided to change her diet habits and change her workout and as a result, she was renewed. The problem is, in my opinion, she lost too much weight. She looks skinny and muscular but she now has baggy skin, it's not too apparent until she bends and her body goes from being 50 years old to 150. This takes a bit of getting used to but the bigger problem is she had implants and had them taken out. I respect this decision, they were older implants and she wanted them removed, The big problem here is now her bust is a disaster, the girls have deflated terribly and a total turn off. I find myself sexually repulsed and it's reflecting in the bedroom. I LOVE my wife dearly and hate myself for being so shallow but I would love for my wife to see someone about reconstructive surgery. Nothing drastic, just a clean up to reflect the new body she has built. I should mention that she recognizes the issue and has made several comments but I have kept my mouth shut. If I say anything about this or any criticism for that matter she will think she is a hideous mess and attack me for saying my mind. My question is how should I approach her about this and not sounds like a self-interested jerk?",14Jun2019,0

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Darren‚Äô and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt got a boyfriend you know, Darren‚Äô and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

408,"Hi Everyone. Please take your time to read this and give you any input that you can.

I am a 21 year old HHA (Home Health Aide) working on obtaining my RN. While I‚Äôm in school, I‚Äôve been working full time (41 hours) as an in-home caregiver for a young man with a severe seizure disorder. 

He is on a VDMAS program waiver. I‚Äôm not sure if you are all familiar, but these programs require caregivers and the family members to obtain background checks and fill out very in-depth employment packages. In order for me (the attendant) to get payed through the program, the employment package and everyone‚Äôs background checks have to go through. I submitted my package about three weeks ago. Since then, my background check has gone through smoothly and without issue, however the fathers is still being checked. 

I‚Äôve been working here since May 13th and the family has payed me out of pocket (weekly at $11/hr) with hopes that the company will backpay them for these hours I have worked. Last Monday (the 3rd) was the last weekly check I have received from the family. The program hasn‚Äôt even approved us yet, and they said they aren‚Äôt paying any more out of pocket and I‚Äôll have to wait until the 28th to MAYBE get a check from the care company. I just had my car break down and I‚Äôm so financially stressed that I can literally not afford a day late on my pay, let alone three and a half weeks.

How do I do this? What do I tell them? I can‚Äôt really just say ‚Äúpay me out of pocket or I‚Äôm not working anymore‚Äù. I feel like I‚Äôm working all of these hours for nothing. I need consistency in my pay.. I‚Äôm so upset and I‚Äôm at a loss for words.",14Jun2019,1
409,"(TLDR at the bottom)
This happened maybe 5 months ago. I‚Äôll briefly mention how it happened. My parents were away and I was watching my siblings for a couple of weeks. My brother was supposed to be at school but he ditched and stayed home. 

I‚Äôve had journals since I was in 8th grade. I have OCD, ADD, and psychotic depression. You can imagine the type of dark, personal things I have written down over the years. I‚Äôve always been careful about where I keep them. That day, I left an old journal on my bed. I picked it up the night before to find out which date a specific traumatic incident occurred. No one in my house has ever snuck into my room. I know that for a fact. I‚Äôm a paranoid person (again I‚Äôm psychotic) and I have ways to know when my room has been entered. 

I found out he skipped school and I checked my room. Although he put the journal back to where it was, I could tell he entered. The page i was on the night before wasn‚Äôt the one opened when I picked it up. 

I‚Äôll spare you the details but the journal he read is by far the most personal. It was the darkest. It was the one I kept when I was suicidal, delusional, and sometimes even not in touch with reality. 

I haven‚Äôt talked to him in months. I gave him a note that day telling him that I can‚Äôt even look at him, and that giving him this note was the only way I know I won‚Äôt beat the shit out of him. 

For the past few weeks I‚Äôve dreamt about him frequently. I think it‚Äôs time for me to finally acknowledge him. But here‚Äôs the thing:
He now knows things I never wanted anyone to know. Aside from personal stuff, there are things in there that could get me in trouble with my parents. I‚Äôve always been close to my brother; sometimes covering up for him cause I know how my dads like. But it still gives me anxiety knowing he knows my deepest darkest thoughts. 

How in the world can I go back to having my brother as a brother again? 

TL;DR: brother read an old journal of a time I was suicidal and psychotic months ago. I have been ignoring him since. He knows things that could get me in trouble and not to mention very dark thoughts. How can I move on and still have a relationship with him",14Jun2019,1

My motivation, which is almost non-existant, has been degrading over the past couple of years and so has, what I suppose is, my mental state.

I‚Äôve stopped playing handball (which I had been playing for 10 years) 2 years prior, reason being ""don‚Äôt like the people"", which is only partly true. I‚Äôve had no prior summer jobs nor the willingness to do anything like that. I‚Äôm bound to this computer I‚Äôm writing this on. When I was a kid I had no friends. When I started being a teenager I had no friends.  Still have no friends, just some colleagues from high school. My high school performance was mediocre but when looking back, I fell like my potential was not that low. When somebody asks me what I want to become or want to do in the future I bullshit my way out of the question hoping that they stop asking me that question. I don‚Äôt know what I like nor dislike. I don‚Äôt have a personality nor a spine. I almost always miss deadlines for basically everything.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do nor how I can get myself out of this pit of nothingness.

412,"There are people in my life who see me as a friend whereas I only see them as acquaintances. I am a very private, independent and emotionally stable person who does not like to air my private thoughts and problems to those I work or casually socialise with. This makes me a good listener and wherever I go, this attracts needy people to hang off my shoulder and just spill all their emotional turmoil and private life dramas to me without any prompting from my part. Then they just keep coming back, contacting me when I'm at work or at home with new dramas, stressing out over insignificant things, having emotional meltdowns and asking for advice which quite honestly can be solved with a little common sense. 

My gripe is that they bring all this unnecessary and unwanted drama into my life and then they want me to think for them by offering solutions to their problems. I find it very irritating as I don't really care for these people and I am not indebted to them in any way. They are just my peers and they know very little about me, as they are always too busy talking about themselves.

414," I am a teenage girl living with my mother, my sister and my two grandparents.
 My father left us when I was 10 and thankfully we've always lived with grandma and grandpa. I haven't really paid attention to it before, but for me and my sister, grandma and grandpa are like our mother and father and I am really thankful for having them in my life. I am not close with my mother, I hardly ever tell her what's going on in my life other than things like my grades. She is jobless now, but  tries and searches for jobs. Most of the time she is in her room, which is so messy and dirty and instead of talking to us she is mostly talking to her friends on her phone. She drinks, but I am not sure how much and she is a smoker also. My mother has some health issues, but she discusses vere little in front of me and my sister. Last week I don't know what happened to her, maybe it was from the stress, but she couldn't stop yelling at me, my sister and grandma- she was calling us names, arguing with us and we didn't do anything to her. And this happened on several days. And each time, the day after there has been a scandal she acted like nothing ever happened. That's one of the reasons I hardly ever share anything with her- she changes her mood fast sometimes. My mother doesn't clean, at all. She leaves the leftovers from the things she eats on the table, doesn't bother to wash the dishes and just she doesn't do anything for the apartment- grandma is the one that cleans our home. 
  I haven't been influenced by my mother's behaviour and I think I am a happy person  and that's why I don't what to see her like this- living so miserably, out of hope. But also because I am afraid that when me and my sister leave our home to start our own lives, my grandparents will have to deal with their daughter and they will be already so old.

416,"If you read some of my old posts you'll see I talk about some of the times I was raped or sexually assaulted. Note to remember, some reasons those things happened to me was because I was in really bad places and on a lot of drugs- I feel the need to say that because when it happens so many times to a person less people believe it.  I kind of dealt with it on my own, I've been raped once by a stranger, one by my cousin, and one by a really close friend. My brother coerced me into doing things at a young age, and my step dad touched me when I was little once. all of these things I repressed as I always felt like it wasn't my fault. I prostituted myself for some time when I was on a a lot of drugs and it was almost like my own way of coping with all the pain. I never thought of the rapes and abuse except when I talked about it with my therapists- therapy was never something I was consistent with though. For some reason it surfaced again and I've been feeling really sad and guilty lately. I have no one to talk to about them. I don't know why it's surfacing again if it hasn't all these years.

But instead of being out partying with my friends, I stayed at home to scrutinize over how I still won't be good enough to get a job in my field.

im very intrested in art (paintings) and im also a painter and i love painting abstract stuff and doing that for a living  would be a dream i also like fashion and body modification and i would much rater start my own buisness than working for someone else. 

for the past 3 years i've been planning on getting a face tattoo no one in my family likes it and almost everyone i know is against it but i absolutley love everything about it and i really want it bad but everyone is telling me that with face tattoo i will not be able to find a job which is true to some point but these are jobs i absolutley hate and i would be miserable if i worked at a job like that for the rest of my life.

i know im young and all that but i have one life and at any point in my life if i die i want to die a happy man. the one thing i really really want now is a face tattoo (small text under my eye) and for the past 3 years i've been thinking about it and my mind hasn't changed i still want it.

Having said them, I find it very very difficult to even start a small change. To routines, to decisions, daily choices, good or bad healthy habits. Until now I started to feel exhausted just from dealing with it.

Work been affected severely. From way way back. Actually this was the first signs of issues surfacing up. I have already tried, working part time, no pay leave, reduced responsibilities, etc.

429,"Let me preface this by saying that I do know that the ""you are an adult you can do what you want"" case is true.


I recently graduated college with a business degree. I've worked as a server/bartender ever since starting college. Currently, a family member lined up a $15/hr full time admin assistant job for me after applying to jobs online led to nothing/ a bunch of sales jobs. I am currently working that job, and still serving on Saturdays. 


Here's my situation. I have a boyfriend that lives about five hours away, we were together for a little over a year, broke up because of distance for a few months. He came to my graduation and we decided to give it another shot. He's great, supportive, and has made it clear that he has no issue with me getting a job here and doing whatever I need to do as long as it takes, even though the eventual plan is for me to move there with him (he lives in a much nicer city than I do, plus I hate where I am from.)

I owe my parents $9800. My car broke down last year so my mom gave me her old car for $4300, I also agreed to pay for the last semester of college that she paid upfront for me (she was trying to buy a house at the time and didn't want her credit affected by cosigning a loan for me so she just paid for it and told me to pay her back.)


For some background, I am 23, my parents (mother specifically) are very protective and worry about me and my brother as though we were little. She's eased up on me a bit because I've never really had any issues, I've flown across the country to visit friends and only had to do the usual checking in calls before bed. However, when I mentioned I was applying for jobs all over the state because nothing in my area was working out, she basically dismissed it and asked ""you're not moving are you? Then why waste your time applying?""


My mother is very content with me living with her as long as possible. She only expects $500 a month from me which she calls ""rent"" but it goes towards the $9800 interest free debt I owe her. I plan on paying at least twice that to clear the debt as fast as possible, but I'm conflicted.


My mother has been great to me, and has given me opportunities that many people don't get, it's obvious she doesn't want me to move away, and I can't help but feel a little guilty if I up and leave. She also doesn't know I have a boyfriend that lives five hours away (major Republican fox news consumer, a bit worried at the potential repercussions at the moment even though my dad and brother know.)



So as it stands, I technically don't own my own vehicle, because I haven't paid my mother back for it, I make $15/hr plus about $350 a month from serving, which I use on gas and food and things like that to avoid touching my paycheck. My plan as it stands is to pay off the $9800 ASAP, get a nestegg of about $2500 saved up. And then find a job where I plan to move.


I've recently started looking at jobs in that area, and I think I could potentially find a job paying $20+ there (my degree is specialized and I have a year relevant experience, plus my current job is not very fulfilling, I basically do paperwork for people all day.) I don't know if I should stick to my current plan, try to find a better paying job and play it off as simply a ""great opportunity"" in hopes my mother doesn't hold the vehicle ransom to keep me from moving, or something else. Because I genuinely think my mother expects me to live around this area until she passes, because she's cited ""I just hope you take care of me like I've taken care of you all these years when I need it"" multiple times.



TLDR; Recent college graduate. Making $15/hr plus waiting tables once a week. Owe parents $9800 interest free for a car and tuition. They are very protective, only expect $500/mo.  I'm unhappy in my environment, have a boyfriend I've known for years five hours away that I want to move in with, and think my earning potential is higher than $15/hr.",14Jun2019,2

Pet:
I‚Äôd like to consider myself a responsible person. I might not have anyone to take care of directly, but I can take care of whoever is dependent on me. So my stand on a pet pretty much comes down to this:

The pet will keep me busy and not make me lazy. I will have an immensely nice workout partner and to share my laughter with all the time. Not to mention it will love me back unconditionally. 

The only drawback I‚Äôm thinking right now is initial training and giving it enough time due to work schedule.

434,"I got quite screwed over, didnt get my degree when i should have, resulting in submitting false resumes and consuming my school loan grace period. 
Im thinking about sending this email, but the degree issue is resolved, and i will officially graduate soon, so im worried they could change their mind and decide i shouldnt graduate

Here is the email:

Hello [chair],


I have an issue and the registrar directed me to you.

To make a long story short ill use bullets:


- In November 2018, i applied for graduation after fulfilling all requirements

- I've been receiving ""congrats grad"" emails and never received rejection emails

- I applied to jobs for about 7 months

- I found out i did not graduate, so many of those companies have likely blacklisted me for accidentally having a false resume

- I raised the graduation concern to Professor [X], [old academic advisor], and Professor [Y] (during a point of advisor transition)

- It was found that I indeed fulfilled the requirement, so now paperwork is being filled to process my degree


However, now my grace period for my student loans is expired because i dropped full time status back in December 2018, despite only receiving my degree soon. I contacted FedLoan servicing, and they said if i can provide written proof of enrollment or proof of a special circumstance, then they can adjust my grace period. Could you perhaps do me the world of a favor and write such a document outlining this circumstance?

End email


 (Would they really want to admit fault??)
The only ammunition they have is that i asked my advisor if i graduated several times and never heard a reply. She did tell me that i have not graduated, but not in a reply, rather in a separate email amidst a ton of spam, so i did not see it

Would i risk them to stop processing my degree by sending this email? I dont want to get on their bad side and risk my degree, but i do want more of a grace period or perhaps compensation if possible",14Jun2019,1

436,"My brothers own a business and I help them with it daily. It is long hours and hard work, which I'm not afraid of. I originally agreed to come help full time when being there was fun and I could see myself doing it forever. 
But recently things have taken a toxic turn. One of my brothers constantly belittles me and the help I provide, and the other brother makes excuses for his behavior.  The first brother, lets call him Jerry, drinks and get aggressive with everyone but especially me. When he's drunk (always) he tells me  that any other job would have fired me by now and that I'm really under qualified for the position (I'm not).  My response is usually, ""If any other job would have treated me this way I wouldnt be working here anymore and I wouldve called HR already. "" When hes sober( or pretenting to be, I cant tell anymore), he says im the best person there, he respects my opinions above others and that he would want to include me in the business side of things.  Ive learned to just ignore all feedback, good or bad because in the end, its all bullshit ramblings.
The second brother, lets call him Steve, when Ive told him about Jerrys insufferable attitude and comments, he makes excuses saying that I know how to press his buttons and that he has to believe Jerry because hes ""his business partner"". 
Lately ive been getting sick of this treatment, and have been thinking about making a life change: attending a local college.
 I went to this school, part time, when I graduated high school, mostly because my parents forced me and stopped going after a few semesters because I wasnt interested in college. 
Its been about 3 maybe 4 years since then and now that ive seen what could be my life forever if I dont go to college, I feel I have to go. Ive also seen that if I'm going to go, I think I would be most successful if I went Full-time, which means I cant work full time. I think I would have a better shot at this if I made it my only priority and maybe only work like 20 hours a week or so( a lot less than my current 40-50). 
The only issue is : How am I going to tell my brothers? I know they will be angry because despite what they say, they rely on me a lot. I think they will feel I'm abandoning them and and will be angry and think that I'm just going to go fuck around again like I did before. I know I dont have to prove anything to them or really explain myself, but I wish that they would support me and root for me. I'm feeling so torn and like I cant talk to anyone about this, I'm starting to doubt if I should even go to college at all.

So what should I do? Should I go to college or stay and work things out with my brothers? And how should I discuss these things with them?",14Jun2019,1

Hi, I'm a 19 year old from England. It's going to be my 20th birthday in a few months and I'm still in the same situation I've been in since leaving school. I've been unemployed for a while now, my last (and only) job lasted three months and really wasn't for me. It was in a busy retail store, dealing with a bunch of customers and I really wasn't up to the challenge of that. My days consist of me being in my bedroom, no regular routine, no fixed sleep schedule. I've been a massive computer addict since a young age. I'm really into programming and development, but I lack the motivation to do anything with it really. I play a bunch of games, and have some really good friends online... I've known these guys for the past 6(ish) years and haven spent pretty much every day in the last 4 years playing games and chatting with them. I live at home with my dad and my brother, my parents are sepeerated. I don't have any friends outside my bedroom really, and I don't have any real reason or ambition to change that. I'm a recluse, I know it but I somewhat like being alone. My parents want me to get a job, and I do apply from time to time but I just lack any effort to even consider getting a job or starting a life. I'm at a loss really, I just don't really know what to do. I don't like social situations, I love being alone and spending 16 hours a day on my computer, and I'm unsure what's the point really.

Self explanatory title, here‚Äôs some background:

Been with my SO for 5 years, parents are narcissists and are going through a divorce. 

SO is on her mom‚Äôs (we‚Äôll call her W) side in all this, and is all that W has through this time.

What I can‚Äôt seem to do is forgive W for how she has treated my SO/me. (But mainly my SO)

Whenever W is mentioned, I get anxious and worried that I can‚Äôt ‚Äúhide my feelings‚Äù and my face gives away how I feel. Sometimes I mildly shut down emotionally. 

W is one of those people you have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù for or your general demeanor will be taken the wrong way. So me just sitting there and chillin can be taken as anti social, etc.

Well, per W‚Äôs last visit, she now feels unwelcome in our home because of me and the fact I can‚Äôt be ‚Äúoverly nice‚Äù (for me) in my demeanor because I can‚Äôt seem to forgive/get over her behavior. 

How can I combat this?",14Jun2019,2
440,"I was in a relationship with this girl for 2 years then I dumped her about a year ago. She has a boyfriend now. I believe she is still mad at me bc she trusted me like hell (I really liked her too but yk teenage mistakes). I was out today with a mutual friend and her topic came up. I asked how's she doing and that's when I heard about the horrible stuff that happened to her. 

Her mom is somewhat famous in the entertainment industry and has a lot of connection with important people. It was her birthday. They planned a party at her mother's boyfriend's house. Everything went fairly decent but later that night they started bringing in alcohol. Now she was a minor, but still her mom forced her to drink bc otherwise it would seem 'disrespectful'. So, they're all having a drink. Her mom basically passed out and she was feeling sick so she went to the restroom. But before she could come out, her mom's boyfriend came barging in and held a gun to her belly and and told her not to move or scream. She, being able to do nothing just froze there while that monster started making out with her, then undress and eventually rape her. She couldn't do anything. Her mom was really happy with this person. She didn't want to ruin that. She kept quiet. Until one day she bursts out and tells her everything. Her mom, being abusive as always, told her that it was her fault bc she wore short clothes (which the mother also forces her to wear). They broke up about a week ago. 

The worst part about this is that the friend who was telling me this didn't seem to care something horrible happened to her as if it was her fault. She can't file a case about it bc the person is very powerful and has a lot of links inside the government. I couldn't think of anything else since I heard this. I believe that my ex's current boyfriend is enough to support her but i can't help but try to talk to her. We mostly burnt all the bridges between us. I feel terrible, reddit. What should I do ?

443,"Where I live there is the front house and the back house, both of which are rental properties.  I stay in the back house, which is 525 ft\^2.  My total cost a month, for rent/utilities, is around $565.  My place is also located in a nice/safe neighborhood.  It also allows big dogs (which a lot of places don't allow) and it has a fenced in backyard for my dog.  The cons of my place would be window AC units instead of central cooling, no dish washer, and it is not much to look at.  I also decided to get back into the dating scene again and I am not going to impressive anyone I take back to my place. 

  

A little background on me.  I am a 25 year old single male, I have no debt, I have a good job, and I have managed to save around $66,000 living a modest life style.  So I can stay in a nicer place if I want.  From looking at what is available the past month, for a nicer place I would be spending around $1000-$1200 a month.

My train of thought to stay is that financially it makes no sense to leave, it is a safe place, and it does have everything I need.  My train thought to leave is I am an adult and not a college kid anymore, I can afford a nicer place, and I would like to impress someone I take home.

Honestly my gut is telling me to go for job nr. 2 but I am somewhat afraid that I might eventually hit a wall which says 'no phd, no access' later in life. I don't need to have alot of money right now, so I could take the financial hit of earning little money as Phd student.

459,"This is a bit of a long story, so please stick with me here... 
Okay, so my partner and I wake up in our little apartment early in the morning and we decide to play Advanced Warfare on our Ps4s. Its about 8am or so, not too early not too late. After about an hour, we decide to get up and get ready to leave the complex. A few days before we had ordered a fathers day gift and had it shipped to my father-in-laws so we planned to head over there and surprise him with it when it came in. Later on that night my parents took me and the partner out to the casinos for my birthday. Long story short we didn't get back until around 9pm and it was roughly 9:30pm when we finally walked inside. I had gotten some gifts so the first thing I did was toss them in the room. 

Now this is where it gets interesting. I open the door and when i step in I hear talking from my Ps4. I ended up leaving it on before we left, because usually it just powers off after an hour because of the Power Savings option. Come to find out I had been in an infected lobby on the game and I immediately backed out, not thinking too much about it. I leave the room and take care of my dog and do whatever else i had to do to finish up my night. Fast forward an hour later (about 10:40pm), and my partner and I decide to play a few rounds before bed. She goes to invite me and notices I had 2 new messages. We open then and we see messages along the lines of ""Why are you following me?"" ""Do you have a crush on me or something?"" from one person. The messages were about 6 minutes apart and were sent around 9:30- the time I most likely went in there and left the party. Come to find out it was her talking and we exchanged a few more messages and whatever had been on my game joined and followed this person around in ""5 or 6 lobbies,"" they claimed. My partner and I thought this was BEYOND weird so we looked more into it. I checked the recent players and there were people that said from ""15 hours ago"" which was when I physically last played to ""11 hours ago"" and then to ""6 hours ago"" and it continued after every hour after that (so like 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 hour(s) ago). 

Now recently we've been experiencing paranormal activity in our apartment. For instance, some walking and running and thumps around the place, yk little shit like that. But for the past week and a half its been almost everyday something happens. But why would something supernatural use a damn ps4, you know?? 
Our next thought was that maybe someone had broken into our apartment and was hiding out somewhere, so we called my father-in-law and he came over and checked every crack in our apartment. But that didn't make sense either because we have a few items that are obviously worth stealing and nothing seemed out of place?? 
We're clueless and so stumped on why this even happened, but we can't come up with a single explanation. 

TL;DR :: Went out for my birthday all day and came back to having something mess with my PS4- they were in a game lobby 5 or 6 different times ""following"" someone around and said person was on the mic. Fiance√© and I are freaked out. Is there someone or something in our apartment? 

‚Ä¢ The PS4 should have been cut off from Power Savings Mode in the first place. (I have it to where it goes off after an *hour*. 
‚Ä¢ It was in an Infected game lobby 5 or 6 times following some girl, and if you play the game you know you can't just throw your remote down and it click into that server because you have to go through specific tabs. 
‚Ä¢ Checked recent game players and it dated it from 11 hours ago to 6 hours ago to 5 hours ago, and so forth. 
‚Ä¢ I also heard about a Playstation outage??, so maybe that had something to do with it, but I wasn't effected at all??? Idk.

I feel cracking in my ear for about 4 years now and it has been worse since I was misdiagnosed with a ruptured ear drum where my ear was gushing blood and I was later diagnosed with a broken blood vessel then later found out I had a ear infection in both ears one for 6 months. But what should I do. My doctor said nothing is wrong and he said I may need new tubes but I‚Äôm scared of surgery so why would I need new tubes if I have some already locked in by scar tissue.

465,"So my daughters cheered for 3 years and loved it, this past year they wanted to do dance instead so we did and they competed with it and seemed to like it. A few weeks ago when discussing what they wanted to do for next year they decided they were going to cheer again. Their previous coach recently left the previous organization we were on and went to a new one so we were going to follow her. I signed the girls up but the season does not start till the end of July. Now the other day was their dance recital and at the end they lost it crying that they do not want to stop dancing now. My daughter was even given a small scholarship for next year. Now my dilemma is we have already signed up and committed to the cheer team and they cant do both. I don't want to let the coach of the cheer team down as she was really counting on my kids to be on the team since they can tumble and they need a certain number of kids that can tumble to compete in the level they want. I want my kids to be happy but i don't want to be a jerk by backing out of the cheer team. I don't know what to do. If I back out I think the cheer team will have to drop down to a less difficult level of competition.

470,"I need some help with this upcoming conversation I need to have. 

So I'm 20 years old and currently living at home. I work part time and go to school part time. I drive a spare car of theirs and am attached to their phone plan (but I pay them for my line). I just bought a new phone and they want me to re-install a tracking app we all use. I tell them I don't want to but I feel they are guilting me into re-downloading it. 

My parents points are:
-they feel safe knowing they can find me if something ever ""happens to me"". They read a lot of articles on kids being saved by parents thanks to the app. 
-im not allowed to set my own boundaries since I love in their house (I do pay a very small rent to then however $200 a month)
-my sister no longer talks to my mom (who I live with) and since I am her only other kid she feels the need to safe guard me so she doesn't lose me or push her away.
-they never check the app (supposedly) but they still give examples of finding out where I am but for the sake of innocent reasons.

My points
-i want privacy, I'm 20 and just want to be able to not be worried about them knowing where I am just because they feel like it
-i pay for my line and bought my own phone. They aren't allowed to track it.
-years ago they told me that when I own my phone and pay my bill I can delete the app (guess not)

I'm worried that I'm either in the wrong here or maybe I'm just being guilted into this because they both use previous sad experiences or parental fear on me as reasons to download the app and not make them sad. 

Another fear I have is that it was hinted at that if I don't download the app I'll need my own cellphone plan and to buy my own car. 

I'm just really shaken by all this. Anyone have some good advice?",14Jun2019,1

It really hurt me but after talking about it on my throwaway account, I accepted that it's just something kids ask.

484,"My boss really struggles to write the schedule for my department (as many bosses do.) The schedule she makes often comes out wrong and has to be edited multiple times, and people don't get notified of the changes so we end up with a LOT of frustration from her end and ours. 

Just for kicks, I decided to see if I could make up an Excel spreadsheet that would automatically create a schedule that takes into account everyone's availability and requested days off, and it turned out to be easier than I thought. It's almost finished, and it's been fun creating it.  It turns a hour-long process into a 5 minute process, with little-to-no human error to complicate things. 

I mentioned it to a co-worker, and she was horrified at the idea that I would give it to my boss to actually use when it's finished. It would save my boss (and the department) multiple hours of headache every week, so I can't really see how it would be a bad idea. Co-worker says it's the equivalent of telling my boss that I can do her job blindfolded with one hand tied behind my back (which I basically can, but that's not the point.)

489,"Hi. I'm going to add a disclaimer that I'm actually the worst for saying this out loud, but I'm struggling.

I met my friend May (obviously not her real name) a few years ago. We attend the same college and were in the same program. I appreciated her input in class and she always gave me good feedback on my writing. As we took more courses together, we got closer. I was moving off campus and May was graduating and starting a grad program, so we decided to live together. Cue the best friendship of my life, for about a year.

Since we moved in together, things have really turned around, starting with another roommate. May would complain to me for hours about how this girl treated her and how bad it made her feel, but when I confronted the other roommate about her behaviour, May would front like she had never said any of that and there were no problems at all. It was a rift that solved itself because the other girl moved out, but it still bugs me a lot.

And things have just been increasingly getting hard for me to deal with. I thought we were best friends and she didn't say happy birthday to me, and didn't come to my graduation. But on May's birthday I made a big deal out of it, etc. It just feels really one sided; like I don't matter to her. 

Not to mention we have totally different lifestyles. I've basically had to teach her how to live on her own. I handle bills and do most of the chores (she washes dishes once in a while). May is kind of a pig; trashes everything, doesnt bathe regularly, stuff like that. That's not my business as a friend but as a roommate it is, and it makes cohabitating hard. It's been a year and she still hasn't learned to clean up after herself or chip in for groceries.

I woke up this morning on my day off to find May home as well. I've been in bed for the past two hours because I don't want to go downstairs and be around her. This avoiding her has started to become regular practice.

I guess I'm just asking for advice. I'm not sure what I should do. May hates confrontation and just runs away crying if there's any danger of a disagreement. I think that's why she denied everything to the other roommate. I don't know if I should just live here for the next year with my feelings hurt and resenting her or ask her to move, or move out myself, or attempt a weird conversation that ends up with her feelings hurt anyway.

492,"Okay, so here it goes.

I used to know this girl a few years ago, and we used to actually be relatively close friends. We used to stay up all night and talk about all kinds of things. But as time went on, I guess we sort of just moved a part. I don't know if it was the result of an argument or something, we just kind of stopped talking to each other. And the thing is, used to be really into her. Like really into her. For a while, she was all I thought about. At the time I didn't really care about much else except for her, and maybe my guitar. She was kind of also one of my only friends at the time, so maybe that also had something to do with it. I don't know if she ever knew, though I feel she probably did. I think I told her one time because she asked, or something like that. But nothing ever came of it. I honestly don't know whether I should feel glad, or sad about that. I don't actually know if it was love I was feeling either. She was the only person of the opposite sex to ever really show some what of an interest in me and give me the time of day and see what I had to say. So I guess l thought that actually meant something? I hadn't, and still haven't, ever really been in an official relationship before, so I'm not really good at these sort of things. Like, I remember when I first had to sit next to her and I couldn't even keep eye contact. I had to force myself. My confidence is that low. Maybe that's why I was interested in her in the first place. 


Recently, for some reason, I have had the sudden urge to start talking (well texting now) to her again. Mostly because, ""what the hell? I'm bored. It's not like anything is going to go terribly wrong."" I miss having her as a friend. She was a good person to talk to, at least for me. The main thing that is messing with my mind though is I don't exactly know what my goals should be here. Like, what kind of relationship should I be looking to build. Unlike how I used to be, I don't know if I am into her anymore (leaning towards not). First, she probably isn't exactly the same person, and second, I think a part of me has moved on from that. But since I had those past feelings, every time I talk to her, I have the immense pressure to not fuck it up. She is the only person I have ever really done this with. Every time she texts me I always think ""oh shit, better say the right thing so she doesn't leave me on read,"" because that's a thing that happens. I actually sort of got the ball rolling with her recently. We got into a relatively long (lasted a couple days but replies were sporadic. Not very sporadic, but a fair bit) conversation about music and what sort of things we are currently listening to. But now a week has passed (I guess I just choked?) and I'm left wondering where I should go from here. 


I don't know, I'm perfectly happy with just being friends with her, I just don't know how I can go about it without being a nervous wreck. Like what is wrong with me? It's like talking to any other person. She's just a girl I used to know. Why do I have this issue? Even when I first met her I had this issue (but I think that's just because a girl was talking to me and that wasn't a usual occurrence). Am I just this bad at conversing with girls in general?

They own adjacent parts of the property that they've subdivided and sold, but I'm only really interested in this one plot so I'm forced to have to deal with the one somewhat estranged relative.

497,"  

I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years a few months ago. She was on birth control. I haven‚Äôt used condoms since college and never really experienced this problem, although all in all, my experience using them is pretty limited (I‚Äôm 24, never had a health class in high school, and played a lot of videogames in college). About a month and a half ago, I had a one-night stand, and the condom broke without me realizing. I did the responsible thing in the morning and went to a pharmacy to buy Plan B. We agreed to part ways after, as it just so happened that she had just come off a long-term break up as well. We weren‚Äôt looking to pursue things further (I‚Äôm also a 12-year-old trapped in a 24-year old‚Äôs body). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, this woman (let‚Äôs call her Jane) still got pregnant (Plan B is 95% effective) and was thinking about keeping it (Jane is 29 years old, has her shit sort of together, and given the unlikely nature of it all, thought that there was some sort of ‚Äúforce‚Äù at play). However, she ended up going back home (Chicago) to be with her family and ultimately decided to get an abortion a couple weeks ago. This was very difficult for her and very difficult for me trying to be this supportive stranger from a distance (I live in New York). All in all, it was a terrifying experience.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after Jane and I had that one-night stand, I met someone new (let‚Äôs call her Sarah). I really like Sarah. So much so that I didn‚Äôt tell her about Jane (I found out Jane was pregnant after Sarah and I had already gone on a few dates. Still feel sleazy about it. Not too sure what‚Äôs the right move.) Anyway, to get back to what this post was originally about, condoms with Sarah have broken upwards of 6 times. I‚Äôve noticed the majority of the time, but we‚Äôve had to buy Plan B twice now (I had never bought Plan B before any of this and didn‚Äôt realize how gnarly the side effects can be, so I‚Äôve felt quite guilty about that. Also, my confidence in Plan B is at an all-time low, so THAT WAS NERVERACKING). It‚Äôs getting to the point where it‚Äôs getting in both of our heads and really affecting our sex life. Its been in the back of my mind every time we have sex, and I haven‚Äôt been able to cum at all lately. I can tell it‚Äôs affecting her as well, as it would with anyone in this situation. 

I‚Äôve used a wide range of different condoms and think I‚Äôm kind of na√Øve to the whole thing (Remembering the fishbowl of all sorts of different condoms in the common area of my college dorm, I thought it didn‚Äôt really matter.) When the condom broke with Jane, I bought Trojan Fire and Ice at a bodega for a laugh (don‚Äôt recommend at all, unless you like the feeling of Icey Hot on your dick). I‚Äôve used Skyn condoms, some NYC government ones that were free at a bar, and most recently, Magnums. I have a close to 8-inch penis and thought the others might have been breaking because the they were too small, but the magnums have broken on me twice now (even though, they‚Äôve seemed to fit great‚Äînot too tight and not loose).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I read online a couple weeks ago that condoms can break due to friction. I discussed this with Sarah, and she said she didn‚Äôt think that during the times in which they broke, she wasn‚Äôt wet enough. That being said, I did extra groundwork the last time we had sex and there really wasn‚Äôt any friction. Still‚Äîit fucking broke, and I‚Äôm really at a loss with how and so is she. I guess the next thing to do is by lube (?), but I‚Äôm not very hopeful it‚Äôs going to change anything.

I‚Äôve read online all about this and the conclusion I‚Äôve come to is, essentially, this should not be happening. Condoms are pretty fucking durable. The ones I‚Äôve used weren‚Äôt expired. I‚Äôm putting them on the right way, I think?!?! (I‚Äôve def put a condom on inside out before when I was younger and it usually just folds back the way it‚Äôs supposed to go, which is pretty evident after you feel it start to ascend up your shaft and the overall discomfort when you realize its inside out??). They also keep breaking towards the top (don‚Äôt know what that could mean). Please help me. I‚Äôm too poor to be a father and would really like to avoid putting another woman/myself through the horrid experiences and difficult decisions that come with pregnancy. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To cap off this ‚Äúseeking advice‚Äù turned diary entry at this point, it‚Äôs so important that we give young people a thorough sex ed education and lift the taboo attached to talking about things like this. This whole clusterfuck of an experience has made me realize that however maybe simple it is to practice safe sex in theory, there are plenty people like me that are just going off the knowledge gained from experience, and it shouldn‚Äôt be that way given the enormous consequences. I‚Äôm actually kind of surprised something like this hasn‚Äôt happened to me before. Anyway, if you got through this whole thing, thanks for listening and I‚Äôm welcoming any advice, answers, or questions so we can maybe get to the bottom of this.

499,"Hi, 

Thank you for your time! 

I have a very dear friend that has been through so much with me. We have supported each other through some of our darkest hours. Emotionally, financially, etc. If I was short on rent one month I could ask her for help and she would help no questions asked and I would pay her back immediately. And vice versa. We each had each other's bank account numbers and we continued this even when she moved out of state. We were both really poor at the time, but honestly she was always a bit better about managing her money and she has a really strong work ethic. We both partied quite a bit, but again, she was always the more responsible one on that end too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a couple years and a few things happened. I ended the last abusive relationship that I will ever allow myself to be in. I read a million books about how I ended up in these situations repeatedly, got myself into therapy, quit doing drugs and mostly quit drinking , and started staying in every night teaching myself to program as it has always been a passion of mine I just didn't believe in myself and was self medicating my life away. I'm actually starting a job as a developer in July and plan on going back to school to finish my degree as soon as those big tech checks start rolling in!! Yay!

&amp;#x200B;

While I was doing this she had gotten injured at work and workman's comp was running her in circles, so she couldn't get a job and they weren't paying her out while this dragged on and on and on. She tried to find under the table jobs but it just wasn't hitting. She started cracking. She was just hanging out on the streets because she didn't have any money or anything to do. She ended up moving half way across the country suddenly and ended up living on the streets and developing (awakening? I don't know) her latent bipolar disorder. She's been in an out of the police station and mental hospitals and I have been too broke to go to her or do pretty much anything about it. She disappears for months on end and I'm always so relieved when she shows back up. She stopped saying thank you when I'd loan her money and stopped even attempting to pay me back, which I stopped even caring about that, but I also am poor for now. 

&amp;#x200B;

So,  to the question.... I will be starting that new job next month and my income will jump about 50k. Whoa! Right? So, I've never made this kind of money before, but it will allow me to not need a roommate in my two bedroom apartment. Which also means I have the luxury of offering that room for free to my friend. The only thing is that my life is different now. If she were to move in here I wouldn't want her drinking a bunch or doing any hard drugs in the house or coming home off her face. I'd want her to start going to therapy and to either get a job or go to school. The thing is, I learned in therapy about boundaries and control and I feel like requiring these things of her is jacked up. Like, you could have a roof over your head and not have to sleep on the streets, but you have to do it the way I want you to. It feels a bit dirty and coercive. Is it?  I've never been in this kind of power position and don't want to be abusive to my friend. I want to help and I want her to have a safe place to live and I want to help minimize the chances of her ending up back on the street, but I can't live with someone who is partying, aimless, or not taking care of their mental health. I think it weirds me out because this is similar to how I imagine others viewed me when I was in her position though not yet on the streets. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, what do you think, Reddit? Should I offer the room and if yes, is it ok to have those requirements about living in the room? And if yes to that, is there a way to make sure that I'm not crossing any lines or holding the room and her subsequent safety over her head?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - longtime best friend who has been there for me emotionally and financially through dark times has a lost her mind a bit and ended up on the streets. I want to offer her a room, but feel like in order to protect myself and the life I'm building for myself I would want her to conform to certain things. (example: I'm usually in bed at ten and apartment would have to be quiet then). I'm wondering if making requirements on the help I'm giving is approaching or actually is coercive/abusive in my attempt to ""help"" her.

500,I work at a bar and me and a friend went out after work and stopped to queue up at a petrol station to get cigarettes. I was at the back of the queue and there was a BMW car behind me parked waiting for someone in the queue.

I  just turned away abruptly and didn‚Äôt say anything. Then the driver went back In the car and as they started driving off she leaned out the window and shouted ‚Äòso your saying no then yea‚Äô and threw some tiny paper ball by me but not at me. She wasn‚Äôt beautiful she was small and fat. She wasn‚Äôt nice looking she was a chubby girl who was a bit skanky,14Jun2019,0
501,"I started my 3-year education studying biotechnology (primarily), 2 years ago. My social anxiety and depression gotten so bad throughout the first year that I had 43% missed attendance when the year was over. half way through it I changed classes which helped a lot. I was able to go to school at least 3-4 days a week and be somewhat happy. Huge improvement from the 1-2 days. 

What happened is that I got called down to the student counselor (assigned to me) to talk about my attendance. I broke down crying, trying to explain the situation. She told me she could call me in the morning to wake me up. I declined, and told her my grandma was already doing that. Later I had a meeting with 3 teachers (mandatory for all students). One suggested ‚Äúyou should just walk more and eat healthier.‚Äù Im not even chubby. This was the mentality when it came to psychological issues.

One thing my student counselor did for me the first year was to give me a number to a free psychologist. I have a very bad past experience so I was reluctant but my friends and family eventually convinced me to go. This lady was the nicest I had ever met. She turned my life around. I kept going for about a year, until halfway through my second year. At this point I told her with a big smile that I didn‚Äôt need to see her anymore. She was very proud and supportive.

I go to school every single day, although sometimes I slept in due to insomnia. My grades had never been as bad as at that point. I got a warning from my student counselor, one out three before I get thrown out. I REALLY pull myself together and no more missed attendance. Then I fall ill for 2 weeks. Second warning, with the message ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to take your student money from you if this continues.‚Äù In my country you get paid to go to school. I freaked the fuck out because it was my only income. She had just straight up lied, she couldn‚Äôt do that.

I continue to receive no support, and my grades drop LOWER even though I tried SO hard. My teachers praised me, said I had gotten better, then put me down a grade. I was devastated. Well my student counselor was also my English teacher. I had always gotten straight A‚Äôs in English. She gave me C‚Äôs. My essays had 1-3 minor grammatical errors in them, otherwise perfect. B.

The second half year of the second year, I go to school every day, never late, never missed a class. I ask her how I can improve. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt say enough in my class.‚Äù

Challenge accepted. I always do to my homework, I raise my hand to EVERY single question, never got one wrong. I get my final grades from her. B and C. The exact same. But 4 of my other grades got raised, so I was too happy to pay it any mind.

Skip forward to today. I‚Äôm talking to 2 classmates that I previously hated, which is why I didn‚Äôt talk to them before. But we all grew mentally. We had such a nice time preparing for exams. They tell me they both got A and B. My jaw literally dropped. 

Guy: ‚ÄúI mean my dad is English, so obviously I speak very well. But my grammar? Yikes.‚Äù He never did any homework and was very upfront about it. Always texted during class

Her: ‚ÄúI worry she gave me too high grades.‚Äù To be fair so always did the homework, but my essays were better than hers and she made more mistakes. (She told me).

Here I am with a B and a C, after trying so hard. It could keep me from getting into the university I want to. I‚Äôm so devastated and angry, especially because it‚Äôs too late to complain. I didn‚Äôt know there was a time line.

I would never go to this woman (SC) with any of my problems if I should have any. She always looked down upon me and disregarded my serious mental health issues. I told her ‚ÄúI am so scared I can‚Äôt even go grocery shopping. What if they see me looking at the candy and think I‚Äôm fat? I can‚Äôt sleep. I can‚Äôt see any meaning to even waking up. I can‚Äôt see any meaning in breathing.‚Äù I told her this and I meant every word at that time. She told me to man up and pull myself together.

I don‚Äôt wanna go into too much detail with her but she is: old, always keeps her nose far into the air and bullies students, especially the boys because of their gender. Her name is literally Karen. She didn‚Äôt teach us English the whole first year, instead she bragged about her husband and kids. For a full 45 minutes. 

I‚Äôve been thinking of asking the school for a new student counselor. I‚Äôm seriously worried my grand grandma is going to die within the next 6 months, and I have been in the hospital with my asthma twice. Both of these things cause missed attendance. I‚Äôm too scared to ask Karen if the warnings carry over to the third year. What if she lies to scare me again? I‚Äôm only allowed to have 8% of missed attendance. For reference, if I missed the very first day of school I would have 100% missed attendance. But I don‚Äôt wanna start up some big drama at the school.

Reddit what can I do? I‚Äôm supposed to discuss university plans with this woman, next year. She controls my warnings and watches my attendance like a hawk. My two best friends got asked ‚Äúare you doing okay?‚Äù By Karen, after 16% missed attendance.

Bff 1 ‚Äúoh yeah I‚Äôve been sick‚Äù COMPLETELY lying. 

Karen ‚Äúoh dear you look very sick as well. Don‚Äôt worry, no warning.‚Äù

Bff 2 ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôve just, been taking my drivers license during school hours (we have to, but no excuse) and been... sick.‚Äù The sick part was a lie. She practically got a blessing from her.

This is obviously not fair. I don‚Äôt think I can do much about the grades, should I ask for a new SC? I‚Äôm torn. Reddit, what do I do?",14Jun2019,1
502,"I‚Äôll get straight into the story. My best friend (let‚Äôs call her Bella) is a catfish. I‚Äôve just learnt this and I am really, really disgusted.

Basically, Bella is bi. She is in love with this girl (let‚Äôs call this girl Holly), and Holly means the literal world to Bella, or at least I thought that. I‚Äôm sure if you asked Bella who her best friend was she‚Äôd say Holly (or at least she would a month ago.)

Holly and Bella were in a little squad with three other girls. They were best friends, I was the outsider. I feel I considered Bella my best friend but Bella didn‚Äôt consider me hers.

Now. Holly got a bit drunk and a boy asked her to send nudes, and she did. Bella learnt, and flipped, apparently. This was when Bella decided to pretend to be a boy by stuffing things in her pants and asking Holly (and I think the other girls too) for nudes. She nearly got nudes of Holly.

Bella now has basically ran back to me and her other friends she‚Äôd forget when her and her squad were still good friends. I learnt all this off another girl (who is a really good friend of mine and I totally trust her), and Bella hasn‚Äôt been telling me because she knew I‚Äôd flip, and she doesn‚Äôt want to lose me.

And I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends. And in a way I feel like (I know it‚Äôs stupid) but ‚Äúaww she doesn‚Äôt want to lose me I must mean something to someone‚Äù but my head is like, ‚Äúfor fuck‚Äôs same she doesn‚Äôt want to lose you because she doesn‚Äôt want to be totally alone and hated by literally everyone.‚Äù

I learnt she was a catfish this Wednesday. On Tuesday, we were laughing our heads off, being best friends, basically.

We have a really good friendship, honestly, I know I don‚Äôt mean as much as her other friends to her. I don‚Äôt want to lose that but do I really want to be friends with someone who literally pulled a James Charles on her supposed best friend?

503,"Let me start off by saying I‚Äôm 18 and I just got my license about two weeks ago and my first car earlier this week. 

I got off of work very early today and on the way home I got to a stoplight so I started braking, and I wasn‚Äôt slowing down so I started braking even more, but I still wasn‚Äôt slowing down enough. Still braking, I lightly tapped the car in front of me by accident, and I pushed down the brake all the way but I still kept moving forward. The other car moved up a bit, and tried stop but I somehow kept going forward even though my foot was all the way on the brake. I think I might have somehow been hitting the brake and the gas at the same time, it definitely didn‚Äôt feel like it. I was wearing thick boots that are a bit to big for me so it‚Äôs possible. I didn‚Äôt see any visible scratches or dents on the car in front of me, thankfully. 

This happened pretty quick, and we didn‚Äôt exchange any info or even get out of our cars. There were a decent amount of witnesses though, and a bunch of people probably saw my face and at least 1 car could clearly see my license plate. 

This all happened in about a 15-second time span so I then made a split second decision to go home a different way. I‚Äôve been home since and I‚Äôve been really paranoid that someone wrote down my license plate or something and is gonna call the police. 

I‚Äôm pissed at myself because I JUST got my license and car and I feel like I‚Äôve already fucked everything up for myself. I understand things like this happen to lots of people, but I might have been able to prevent it and I probably handled it in the worst way possible.

507,"I‚Äôm going to give you all the details, and I‚Äôm not looking for pity or sympathy. I just need to hear what you guys think.

Today I got fired from a local grocery store where I was a cashier. 

I‚Äôve been on time and showed up for all my shifts. I have only called in around 4-5 times due to either sickness or I was scheduled during a time I was supposed to be at school and couldn‚Äôt find someone to cover it. (Yes, my manager had a written, dated, and signed by my school advisor copy of my school schedule). Any other shift I couldn‚Äôt make was switched with another employee, but only on a handful of occasions since I‚Äôm a broke college student and I need money. 

I had a pretty good relationship with most of my managers, even the ones I didn‚Äôt like I was polite and did what they asked. I thought I had good relationships with my peers but not I can‚Äôt tell.

I was always polite and nice to customers, I was even friends with a few regulars and they recognize and talk to me even out of work around town (it‚Äôs a small city). I even was told by a peer that a customer had approached them to mention to the owner how ‚Äúnice and attentive‚Äù I was. (Granted all I did was double paper bag his heavy groceries and put his wine in different bags so they wouldn‚Äôt clank against each other.) 

I only had one incident 3 months ago when a older women customer handed me a 50 dollar bill to pay for her groceries and when I gave her her change back she accused me of stealing and saying she had given me a hundred. I politely offered to grab my manager so she can count down my drawer and show her she had in fact handed me a 50. I opened my drawer and pulled out the exact 50 she gave me. (I only had one 100 dollar bill but we‚Äôre required to put them under the till box so that we can‚Äôt get them unless we take out out entire register.) she got angry and cursed at me before leaving. The customer behind told me she saw the lady hand me a 50, then told me I handled it very well even though I was shaky because it was the first time a customer had yelled and swore at me. After I finished with her groceries I had turned my light off and immediately went to my manager (the same one who fired me today) and explained the situation. I told her I swore I didn‚Äôt have anything, I emptied my apron pockets and told her the only thing I have one me is my debit card. She pulled my drawer, counted it back and said I came up even. She checked the security cameras and told me she didn‚Äôt see my put anything in my pockets or around my register. 

I have never been short on my register, in fact I was always a couple cents over for customers who didn‚Äôt want their 2 pennies back. 

So this brings me to today‚Äôs meeting. They‚Äôre referencing a problem I had back in February, roughly 6 months into my employment. They told me they had saw I was using my customer rewards card on other customers orders and that was against the rules. I explained that no one ever told me, and I was only using it when a customer asked because they didn‚Äôt have a rewards card. She told me I was only allowed to use it on myself, coworkers, and my family. 

I swear I had only used it for those people, and those people only. 

My manager pulled up only transaction records and point by point went through every time I used my rewards card when I was on m register number. There was about 6-7 of them. I told her most of those were mine. ‚ÄúCan you prove it?‚Äù She asks me. So I pulled out my debit card and showed her that the last 4 numbers were me. Then she shows another number from an old card before mine changed. ‚ÄúAnd you can prove that too?‚Äù So I opened my paypal and showed her the old card number. Then it came down to one, a card number that wasn‚Äôt mine and I couldn‚Äôt remember but after sitting down and thinking I think it was my aunt or uncle. 

But my manager said that that wasn‚Äôt good enough for her and that they have to let me go. I was sad and upset, clearly, i had truly loved working there. I loved my coworkers and my customers and the environment felt friendly. 

Then she went on to say how lucky I was that the owner wasn‚Äôt coming after me for all these charges and that the police wasn‚Äôt involved and that I should be grateful. 

They had me sign a termination notice and made me a copy, on it the official termination reason was ‚Äúmisuse of employee rewards card‚Äù and ‚Äúdisregarding company policy‚Äù. I hung up my apron and thanked them and apologized and bid them a good day before booking it to my car before any of my peers saw me.

Please don‚Äôt try to spare my feelings, just give me the truth. Am I just being emotional or does this seem odd?",14Jun2019,2

What questions, if any, did you either ask yourself or have posed to you? What experience(s) firmed up your mind? What would you recommend to someone feeling torn and whom doesn‚Äôt really have or want the luxury of a few more years spent deciding?

Basic background: I am a 25 year old female with a lot of things I can see myself doing (sorry that this part is repetitive). I started school late, at 22‚ÄîI began at a community college under a Criminal Justice major, thinking I wanted to be a lawyer. Then I switched to Communications, because I really love to write and it‚Äôs something I know that I‚Äôm talented at.

511,"  I (F 17) recently realized how many of my friends are actually going through a lot and they're having mental issues that seem serious now. Some of them are having mental breakdowns,  others have problems coping with OCD, school and family problems, and of course depression and anxiety.  These seem pretty common and often underestimated. At some point even I thought that I had mental illnesses, but it was pretty minor and turned out I was a bit too dramatic about it. 
I thought the case was kind of similar with my friends. Of course I am fully aware that everyone has their problems and  different ways of understanding and coping with them. But  it got different.  This year some of my friends told me that they'd tried committing suicide. The same people that I see smiling and laughing with me are those who struggle with themselves almost if not everyday.  Each and every one of them is different. 
 So what can I do about it? I've tried talking to them (there are 4 or 5 people I know about). When we talk i try focusing more on what they have to say and constructing my speach carefully.  Listening to people opening up and sharing their problems really isn't easy and if you actually want to help them you have to have the right reaction.

512,"Been texting this girl I met out for a few weeks now, we've been on a date which went really well and met up a few times while we've been out.

We then continued texting as normal that day. Now I haven't heard from her in almost 2 days even though she's just told me she wants to keep talking to and dating me. Just wondering if I should leave her and move on, wait for a reply and chase her up if I here nothing soon as I do like her and want to get to know her more.

513,"New condo, bought some ikea stuff online and having it delivered, a good amount of stuff (700+lbs, 20+ boxes).

There's a few steps on the concrete path leading to my door, about half a flight's worth, and they're just going to leave the boxes in the living room just inside said door.

How much should I plan to tip the delivery guys? $10 each?",14Jun2019,2
514,"I share a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 other people, and we split our utility bills three ways.

One of the roommates has lived in this apartment 16 years, the other about a year. I've lived there 2 months now.

For the last two weeks, and for another week ahead, the roommate who has been there a year has had a friend visiting from out of town and staying on the couch.

Normally each share of utilities is about 60 a month, and today we got a bill that split 3 ways is 85 a month.

I am conflicted about paying more, especially considering I use significantly less of each utility than the others. For example, I turn off lights when leaving a room and they don't, I take 3 minute showers vs their 30 minute showers, I don't leave the water running the whole time I do dishes, I don't use the stereo system or television etc.

I'm serious about handling my money responsibly because I spent the better part of the last year living in a tent in the woods.

I have accepted that paying more than I use just comes with the territory of being the frugal roommate, and I'm budgeting to move in with a friend who is also mindful of utilities, and I think would be a better fit overall. So in the long term I know and am moving toward the solution and ***I'm not feeling bitter about the regular month to month discrepancy between my share of usage and my share of payment.***

I guess it's worth saying also that I've realized I generally don't fit in with these roommates. I don't judge them or feel any kind of way about it, just factually we're not super compatible. We're still totally friendly and I like them, just as roommates I'm not a great fit. 

However, this month's bills are a bit above my comfort zone, and I'm wondering if the right move is to bite my tongue, pay it, and keep working to move out, or if it's fair to ask the roommate with the guest to cover some or all of the difference.

It's not a huge amount, but it is enough of a difference that it affects my overall budget, which is pretty tight to begin with. I wouldn't just be cutting into my discretionary budget. I eat mostly lentils, rice, beans, etc, that I buy dry in bulk. The only ""discretionary"" part of my budget is my savings to move into a more affordable place. If I pay the whole 1/3rd share, the difference will come from my bus pass, and I'll spend a week walking an hour each way to work instead of bussing. Which is doable and I've considered it to cut costs, but I'd rather not.

I'm expecting to hear ""if $25 breaks your budget you should find a cheaper place to live"" - I'm trying. But obviously saving that money takes time.

In the meantime, what is an appropriate way to handle this situation? Is this entitlement and cheapness on my part that I should just swallow, or is it fair to ask that my roommate pay for his own guest's utility use?",14Jun2019,2

She always jokes about suicide and depression and anxiety to everybody but shes serious when she says shes gonna kill herself.

I tried telling our school counsler for an appointment, but she DIDNT and forgot. Honestly, she doesnt even like me. She only talks to me when nobody is there. She abandoned me with OUR project to talk to her friends. Needless to say, she wont really let me sit at her table or run with her in gym. Its kinda awful, really.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Darren‚Äô and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt got a boyfriend you know, Darren‚Äô and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

517,"Hello all, pretty much everything in the title. I (19M) am living in my mother's basement at the moment while I attend Uni. Previously, my brother (15M) lived upstairs until my mother moved him next to my room downstairs because his room always stinks. 

In her mind, since she owns the house she would prefer to move the problem instead of fixing it. I do agree that this IS her home and she can do what she pleases, but it brings more problems than it fixes. I try to voice my concerns in the most polite way but it always ends with her blowing up in my face.

Why is this such a problem for me you may ask? I also have a girlfriend, and with my brother in the room right next to us, we can't have sex. Me and her can't have sex anywhere else except illegally or without cashing out at a hotel. We depended on that privacy that I previously had in the basement for our sex life to work.

Some other info that may be important: I don't pay rent. I have offered to pay rent on multiple occasions, but they refuse to accept it. This gives my mother the upper hand when it comes to anything about the house. Also, my mother knows I have sex, we just haven't openly talked about it unless she was drunk for obvious reasons. It almost seems as if she's purposefully trying to do this. There is also an alternative room upstairs that would be far enough from their room to smell, but they still choose to put him next to me.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks.

520," Hey I‚Äôm a male (17), I‚Äòm good friends with a girl, she has a bf, I‚Äòve grown to be totally ok with being her friend, her bf is a great guy too. The friendship crashed really hard at one point, our communication and the way we treated eachother took a loop, I‚Äòm an analytical guy, thought about what might have gone wrong. I came up with the idea of texting her, saying that I noticed our friendship has changed drasticly and if there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs changed and that I noticed how I‚Äòm making her  possibly feel akward and I don‚Äòt want that (It was a really long,nice text,but that‚Äòs the core) I did that because I basically wanted an update, I knew things are going downhill but I wanted to show her that I wanna make it better at least, maybe some of you are into psychology and can tell another reasoning behind this?

So what‚Äòs the problem? Well I texted her about that topic specificly because our communication is bad, so i didn‚Äòt think it was smart to walk up to her when there has been a trend in recent weeks of her not really being present when talking to me.

Yeah, she did not answer in the end because she probably laughs at the way I‚Äòm hanging onto her... And I found out that I might have been a bitch again. I do loads of things like this and I have not gone to understand where the problem is. It‚Äòs not self worth either, I did not want to be rude to her just because the friendship isn‚Äòt as great, so I came up with this unmanly way of doing things. I probably shoulda just crossed her out? But I thought you should try to solve problems before forcing yourself to ignore her back out of anger?

So summarizing the problem: I‚Äòve had this huge problem with making decissions of how to deal with girls in these situations, I found that I can‚Äòt deal with this case in particular, because she‚Äòs still not screaming in my face that she doesn‚Äòt want none of that friendship shit, and because I actually do value her, I wanted to try and fix the problem before being all childish and absent even though I don‚Äòt even want that. It ended up being a way too important topic in my life

Besides, how would you react to the texting situation now? Or how would you want a guy to react now? Say nothing,let it slide, just keep being friends? Doesn‚Äòt that make me even more of a pussy because I didn‚Äòt even  fix the problem?  Man I don‚Äòt fucking know why girls can‚Äòt handle that stuff simpler. A guy would‚Äòve told me to fuck off if he doesn‚Äòt wanna deal with me and there it is, I‚Äòm not even scared of her being rude, just can‚Äòt deal with the way she thinks

523,"OK so I live in a house with three roommates one of which is the landlord son. That makes four of us. I came downstairs the other day to find a sign on the oven saying ‚Äúto whoever you are, stop eating my food‚Äù. I also got some text messages from the landlords son (who handles logistical stuff for the landlord) in our group chat saying that this is totally unacceptable, and if this continues, he will find out who it is. Basically, the one roommate who lives with me upstairs literally opened the oven and ate the downstairs roommates' food as it was cooking. And apparently this has happened multiple times. Now the problem is, the person who ate the food didn‚Äôt come forward in the group chat or say anything, and now when I run into my downstairs roommate, who I have previously been cool with, he is very cold, obviously because he figures there‚Äôs a 50% chance that I was the one that ate his food. The roommate who ate the food is an older man (the rest of us are mid 20s to early 30s, he is 45) Who is behind on rent and recently got his hours cut at work. So I‚Äôm thinking the only possible explanations for this behavior or either he is low on money and can‚Äôt afford food, or he was blackout drunk and doesn‚Äôt remember it. Because there is no way a 45-year-old man can possibly be this lacking in common courtesy. I texted the landlord son asking him to speak to the older guy and ask him to apologize to the person who‚Äôs food was eaten but he said that he cannot get involved and we should handle it ourselves. My position is, the whole atmosphere in the house is Strained, awkward, and uncomfortable since this incident. As roommates, there should be a good atmosphere and trust. And of course, I do not want to have my food eaten either. How would you guys go about this? I am thinking that I don‚Äôt want to embarrass the older guy in the group chat or anything, I want to just knock on his door one night and have a one on one conversation with him and ask him to admit and apologize to eating the food so we can all move forward and the house can be a chill place again. What would you guys do? Any advice? Also, worst case scenario, what would you do if the older guy denies it? (I mean, he has proven to be totally insane by doing this, so I wouldn't put it past him to be totally insane in denying it) I would really appreciate your help on this unique and weird situation.

530,"I have been in a new job in the public sector for about a year and have recently took a test to get a promotion. This was a standardized only multiple choices test administered to anyone trying to be promoted.

I failed the test. Yet it did not seem difficult to me at the moment.

That means I'll have to wait two to three years before I can try again. And I immediately lose a promotional opportunity that I could have had.

Yet, I have 6 years of experience in this field in the private sector. I was recognized in my old job.

My colleagues question me about the results of my test. To my closest friends I discussed my failure but it is humiliating because some have succeeded this same test. Nobody understands why I failed the test, and neither do I.

And probably the worst thing is that my father (who is now retired but had a GREAT career in this sector) had passed the same test at the same age as me.

Obviously I will try again in a few years but frankly I do not see how the results could be different. There is no study to do for this test, and it is impossible to obtain the results to know my mistakes.

535,"Good day, Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a potential - a very good potential, mind - that my middle daughter might be gay. She has come partially out to her mother and her sisters, and I know the girl with whom she holds interest. Frankly, I approve of her choice, the young woman is quite smart and takes good care of herself.

&amp;#x200B;

The concern is not that my daughter is very likely gay. The concern is, rather, that she's afraid to approach me and tell me she's gay. My spouse and the children who revealed this to me have asked me in all sincerity to not approach this with my usual lack of tact - which is to simply get it out in the open and done with - but, rather, wait for her to approach me. I'm not certain why she's afraid to tell me, I'm certain I've done nothing to give her the impression I'll be upset about it. I'd always thought of myself as a rather open fellow in that regards despite my own rigorous upbringing.

&amp;#x200B;

However, it's been months now, and quite frankly I'm getting a little tired pretending I'm blind when they hold hands *in secret* or try to be near each other all the time and so forth. It's to the point I'd rather just sit her down, take her by the hands, simply say 'I know you're gay and I'm just dandy with it, now quit poking around and ask me if you can go out on a date with her'.  Neither my spouse nor the sister who revealed this to me will tell me why my daughter is afraid of ""revealing"" this to me, or why it's so important I let her do it at her own pace. She's already come out to her aunt, and her sister in law as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts? Do I continue to pretend I know nothing when my ignorance won't be alleviated, or do I go my usual route and '[Koolaid Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmKYrxzOTC4)' through the issue? Has anyone else been in this rather bizarre situation, on either side?",14Jun2019,1
536,"Warning: I'm gonna be talking about Endgame and Game of Thrones spoilers. 

TL;DR at the bottom.

Long story short, I was playing TF2 and someone's username was literally (Endgame Spoiler) ""&gt;!Iron Man Dies!&lt;"".

I was going to see Endgame the day before I played TF2, but the movie was full, so I went the day after. I was really trying my best to not believe it and think it's a troll, but alas, it happened. I wanted to be emotional, but since I kinda already knew what would happen, I didn't get the full effect.

Same situation with Game of Thrones. I had only started watching after the final season was announced, and I ended up watching the whole show in the span of, like, a month. Apparently even a month was too long, though, because after the final episode dropped, I was playing Path of Exile and people were spamming ""HODOR!"" I only had around a season or two left, so obviously, this reference didn't bug me, since Hodor is introduced early on. I suppose I'm at my own fault for not immediately hiding the chat, but I didn't think it would escalate any further. Just then, out of the blue, someone types in the chat (Game of Thrones Spoiler): ""&gt;!RIP Daenerys Targaryen, killed by Jon Snow!&lt;"". Again, though, this is my fault for not hiding the chat.

Another situation with Game of Thrones is also my own fault. I wanted to look up a scene from the show to show to my friends, so I Google the scene (even closed my eyes in case the search terms had spoilers). I found the YouTube clip, but I looked around to see if there was one in better quality, and then, in the middle of the specific clips, was a clip called (GoT Spoiler Again) ""&gt;!Jon and Daenerys have sex and Jon's real name is revealed!&lt;"". Something like that, anyway.

Spoilers really piss me off because when I'm watching something, even if it's sad, I want the full emotional effect. I want to experience it for myself. 

**TL;DR** Now, I know that anyone can say and do almost anything on the internet, and that, by playing public games and being on public sites where anyone can play, post, talk, etc., I'm really just putting myself at risk of spoilers. I admit that I'm at fault for being exposed to certain spoilers, but I just want to know how to be more cautious. I don't wanna shut out the internet completely since I have no other hobbies (I'm sad, I know). What can I do?",14Jun2019,0
538,"I am a pretty calm and collected individual. But last few week have been the most exhausting for my mental health. I'm really lost and don't know what to do. I never think anything negative or self harm. But recently I have been having suicidal thoughts. It is all because of my dad. This will be a bit long as I need to explain how things got worse. My dad moved to US about ten years ago and I  came to US six years ago with my mom and younger sister. As a kid I always had a great image of my dad and called him my hero. Although I still remember my mom and dad always used to fight a lot. It was like a routine and it got physical quite a few times. Now as I am 21 years old things have only gotten worse. It is really heartbreaking to see the truth beacause now I can't escape it. My dad drinks whiskey everynight at home. But he also drinks in the day, at work and we have found many bottles filled with alcohol around the house. He never admits and is very stubborn. Beacause of his alcoholism our immigration just went out of status. Our visa extension got denied as he applied late. He just keeps drinking and makes excuses about work. If alcohol couldn't get worse I found that for a decade he has been using another email to send dirty messages to craigslist, hookers, erotic message etc. We found he was also talking to a women at his previous work. He was also fired from Domino's because he was extremely drunk and I had to go to help him. I still work part time at the same Domino's and go to university now. I'm a sophomore who is barely able to afford the tuition. My mom works as a babysitter and also makes food for people. She works really hard and is responsible. My dad just complains and brags all day. Always pointing out small things and making himself appear like a god. He would say that he did a favor to us by bringing us to the US. Like Wtf? You are the dad and you have responsibilities towards your family. Some days he would act nice and force us to all go out together like everything is normal.  Now also he drinks and owes people money which I never understand. My mom is right that he lies to us and I'm not sure what he is upto. How fucked up it is when you don't know to trust your dad? Recently he broke some household items and glass plates on his head. Whenever we confront him about alcohol. He would talk about other random things that don't matter. He will try to justify like ""hey look I cleaned the house"" that doesn't mean you can drink all day and mess up everything. He doesn't oay bills on time and one time came home so drunk tha his car's tire, rim and literally the engine fell down. I don't know how he drove. I hate being at home and dealing with him. We have compromised a lot and he still doesn't learn. I don't what to do as we ars out of status now in USA because of him. I can't take legal action because we could get deported. My license will expire next year. I live in Boston with family and it feels like home. I can't imagine going back to India now because I have no one there. I love this country and have made great friends. I'm so scared and depressed. What am I gonna do when I graduate? I won't be able to work and live in fear. I also have to take care of my young sister and my mom always talks her problems with me. I can't even share all this with my friends. It's too much and killing me.

539,"So I'm a dude. As you can tell by my name. And my best friend is a girl. Yes I'm in the friendzone, but it really doesn't matter to me anymore as I really enjoy being friends with her and the crush I had on her at first is years behind and I have since had other crushes and what not. So here's the thing; She's been having a lot of trouble adapting to her moving to a different city because she went to college and lives with her boyfriend after a year of being in a long distance relationship with him.

It's been really difficult for her and there's a lot of whining and complaining and a bunch of other drama on top, like the fact that she sort of lost her feelings for her BF of 5 years because of everything that's been going on. They broke up like a month ago. So of course she's miserable and all. And I'm there for her, but I've been having a bunch of shit thrown at me as well.

I'm like 19 now and haven't even kissed a girl at this point. (Side note: I'm not some socially awkward dude who doesn't even know how to talk to a girl or pees his pants when he's in a room with more than 10 people) But I can talk to her about anything and so recently I began opening up about things (one of which I've mentioned in the previous sentence) that trouble me or depress me at times. Something I rarely ever do talk about it because well I'm a dude and you're not supposed to talk about your feelings right?

lol, anyhow, I rarely actually ever talk about myself because the topic of me tends to get pushed under the rug when me and her are having a one on one conversation. And we wind up talking about her again after like 2 minutes. That is when I'm talking about something I enjoy doing or things that I've been doing lately. Which used to be fine with me because I thought it was in fact more interesting to talk about her, but things have changed.

But when it's negative stuff (btw: Sharing it with someone makes it a lot easier to process and handle the situation) and we're talking in person she gives advice and actually really shows that she does care for me quite a bit. But again as I've mentioned; The topic of me gets pushed under the rug and it's at a point where I think; If she thinks I'm so boring and if she doesn't start taking more of an interest, like just the tiniest bit, she can go fuck off because I've had it.

Today I told her that I actually feel down because of a meme she tagged me in which was ""Flirting back when you're bored can lead to some unwanted situations"". She started talking to me about it, saying I shouldn't put myself down because if I wanted to I could be confident af and all. Then I said that random stuff like that has often ruined a good 3 hours for the past 1 1/2 year. She read the text and hasn't responded. I sent some follow ups which where delivered a little later because of shit cell service and she hasn't even opened them. It's been like 10 hours and nothing. If she had told me something like this I simply would have replied when I got the chance to, even if it means sitting in my car for 5 minute before actually driving home or whatever. And so I'm just left hurt, because I opened up about something quite deep TO ME, which is the point. And she just ignored it and treated it as if I was exaggerating everything. btw she constantly exaggerates and I just calm her down with reason.

Really? She SAYS she cares but then she SHOWS that she couldn't care less? What kinda friendship is this where she can open up, but when I do it for once, I barely even talk about myself, I get ignored. Not to mention the fact that she ALWAYS tells me I can open up to her and WHY I don't do it more often. Well...maybe because I get ignored and feel hurt and left more alone than before whenever she ignores these things??

Now;

She's a 10/10 chick who can have any guy she wants, right. She always tries to hide that she only really sorta cares about looks of guys she likes, but hey. So I've never really flirted with a girl or have been flirted with (if so I didn't picked up on it) and well I told her that it's crazy to me that there are two separate world's out there; One world, where people find dating, flirting and so on just extremely easy and it's all natural to them. That includes the fact that it's natural to them that other people find them attractive and that ""things just happen"". Which is a no brainer because if you're attractive, then you've never experienced otherwise.

And of course world #2, my kinda world, where getting girlfriends, dating and asking girls out are things to be ACHIEVED and are not so easy to obtain. I workout 3 times a week and I'm in pretty good shape, but my acne just ruins my confidence completely where I say that I'm not ready for dating as long as I have it. But I'm seeing a dermatologist next week let's just fucking hope I can make something happen with a girl this year. I told her of this concept and she pretends to understand as if she was like me and had trouble with dating. Guys hit on her a lot. She can name at least 3 guys she knows are into her. And her ex-boyfriends friend group consisting of guys and girls are exactly like her, they're attractive and dating is a natural thing to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary; I really like spending time with her, and overall enjoy being friends with her. But things like that have hurt my feelings and gotten me down to the point where I thought; Hey I'll post the story on the internet and ask some redditors for advice or tips. I guess I'm looking to confront her about it in a way where the friendship doesn't end, but gets better because she becomes a better friend? Because the problem is her. When confronted with something I think: What would a good friend say, and then I respond in such a manner. But ignoring me while i share something deep is so damn hurtful and I don't know why I'm being ignored right now either, but it's happened a few times now and it needs to stop. It makes me feel like not opening up anymore and also makes me hold a grudge against her for making me open up but shitting on what I said.

If any of you guys have any tips or advice on how i should best confront her, I'd really appreciate your help!",14Jun2019,3

542,"So recently my female friend broke up with her boyfriend (this is like their second ""break""). That's nothing new and I've been trying to help her get through that (personally from what i know i think they should break up but i digress). What's different is that this time her being emotional brought to light a lot of issues I didn't know existed. First off she admitted to me that almost all of her self-worth is based on feeling lonely and needing approval from a significant other. On top of that she has a lot of things like the depression and anxiety that are completely untreated because both of her parents don't believe she needs it.

Apparently they're incredibly religious, dont believe in medication/therapy, and believe that she's perfectly fine. This mindset of pushing down emotions and dismissing problems has continued on with her as well as she refuses to see any of this as a problem. She has no coping skills for stress and i think has a history of self harm.

I'm not good with giving advice. As mature as my friends think i am i constantly second guess any help i offer and I'm genuinely worried for my friends safety and mental health but feel powerless to do anything. How do i at least try and help someone who doesn't want to help themselves? Even i she did want help how does she get it with (what I'd consider) abusive parents? Im stuck.

545,"Hi Reddit, in advance this might be a long and confusing read but any response or advice would be so soothing right now. 
If this is too long please read some of this and the questions at the bottom. 
I‚Äôm literally losing my mind because of this. 
I‚Äôm so sorry. 
So..
My father died of cancer a few years ago and my mother was diagnosed that same year of his passing. Since his death her other daughter (Kitty) from a previous marriage moved into our home after her own biological father wanted nothing more to do with her. 
Kitty is now 30 years old and has disorders my mother only got diagnosed back in the early 90‚Äôs which she says are Schizophrenic, Anger issues, Aspergers, Bipolar, and Depression. Apart from her disabilities she is a shitty person who abused me growing up, my mother, threatens suicide if she doesn‚Äôt get what she wants, drowns my mom into debt, and has had my mother buy her about five vehicles because she‚Äôs been drunk and high and crashed all of them. She doesn‚Äôt want to work despite convincing my mom that she can be a Lyft driver and needed a $15k car after failing out of her first semester of Art School due to drugs and her laziness. All she does is play games, bring home trash to hoard in my moms apartment, leave burned messy dishes, and requires my mom to support her and pay for everything: rent, utilities, car, insurance, gas, legal pot, everything. Kitty won‚Äôt let my mom have friends, will go through her phone, and will not allow my mom to visit me except a few times a year despite only living 1 hour away from them. 
My mom will not cut her off, abandon her, or relinquish her financial support despite being into horrible debt, having terrible credit, and asks me for money despite me living off of scholarship money from college until I can graduate. 
My father would be so ashamed and angry if he were alive and knew how much my mother and I have gone without because of the extreme burden my sister is. 
I literally wish my sister would die because she‚Äôs the worst person, extremely rude, she‚Äôs ruined any job she‚Äôs had that my moms got for her because she KNOWS my mom will always support her. 
My mom had a car accident recently and might be receiving a small settlement and somehow my sister has convinced her that she should buy a cheap $25k home in PA and my mom is too far into her disease, chemo, medication, and depression herself to actually realize how manipulative Kitty is and that she‚Äôs not as stupid as she pretends to be. She just doesn‚Äôt WANT to do things and is very entitled: why? I have NO IDEA. 
Being in college on limited funds, having one surviving parent that‚Äôs decreasing the quality and longevity of her own life for someone not worth it, that asks me for money, and doesn‚Äôt spend enough time with me is incredibly hurtful. I have begged my mom, cried to her, but she‚Äôs so fearful that when she dies Kitty will not have anything, anyone, and will be homeless. She wouldn‚Äôt be homeless if she hadn‚Äôt literally rotted the RV my mom bought her with SELLING MY FATHERS HOME for her. I‚Äôm going insane, I fucking hate Kitty, and I really hate my mother‚Äôs emotions and judgement in the situation that makes up our family life, but I don‚Äôt hate my mother. I feel like my sister found a cheap house in Camden and is goin to convince my mom to move there and my moms very vulnerable, easily manipulated, horrible with money, and she speaks her mind. I could see her getting shot, robbed, everything. She‚Äôs been living in the slums with Kitty because my moms budget is so low with supporting Kitty since losing my fathers home and blowing through $40k in one year. (She sold a $120,000 house for $40,000 to emergency help Kitty in another state after she broke her foot moving to said state to date her 19 year old boyfriend on the internet who broke up with her, and moving so she can smoke pot all the time.) 
What do I do? I don‚Äôt want to imagine the last few years of my moms life being this way, her dying before I graduate Med School, or ruining everything father left for me for Kitty of all people. I don‚Äôt even have my phone on service, I live on $200 a month for food, and I‚Äôve worn the same clothes for three years because my mother has consistently put her resources into Kitty and stripped me of mine in order to support her. 
I don‚Äôt care about struggling financially for a few years until I graduate and can start my practice, helping others, and never have a situation like this in my own future family. 
But I feel so angry, lost, confused, and guilty because my mom doesn‚Äôt deserve this at her age, health, and she forgets how she was an amazing, successful person before my dad died. 


How can I convince her to take care of herself? 

Are there any resources for Kitty like any community she can live at or anything? 

How can I make my moms life better? (She‚Äôs literally abusing her health and treatment in her efforts to make Kitty‚Äôs life better in fear that she‚Äôs going to have nothing and no one after my mom dies. 

Please help me.  This is destroying me and I‚Äôve told my mom that but she just outweighs my sisters wants and needs. 

Note: 

I‚Äôm getting married soon as well, and my mom might not even see that because her health is so bad, and I‚Äôm scared that I won‚Äôt even have either parent at my wedding or graduation, or see my own children. This is the WORST thing. I feel like I have no one but I guess because I‚Äôm not ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù (But I physically almost died from a friend wrecking a car after my high school graduation around 5 years ago, like coma, learning to walk again, and going to school &amp; work three jobs to save for Med school at the same time as going to full time classes seven months after my accident when I still couldn‚Äôt walk properly.) But those things don‚Äôt matter. I feel crazy. I cry so much. I can‚Äôt eat. I don‚Äôt want to bring my fianc√© down by this situation constantly because he has been so supportive of me emotionally and our schooling is both advancing now.

I tried to make her smile but I failed. Then I asked her why is she so sad and she just said that she had a headache. This was here excuse for a week but I got tired of it and asked her why she was faking it which resulted in her not talking to me .

I told her I'm sorry for thinking she was faking her headache and she said it's cool but since then she ignores me entirely. I texted her to tell her how sorry I was and she said that she forgives but the next day she acts like we don't know each other. Plz help me.

The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt got a boyfriend you know, Darren‚Äô and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

551,"Context:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I started working as a sales associate (part time) at Zara last week and during the online pre interview screening I said that I wanted to work 20-25 hours a week. I was hired and I've been scheduled for 35-37 hours a week. It seems like they are understaffed and that may be why I'm working so much; Its also possible that my managers didn't get the info about the number of hours I said I wanted to work. I am a student on summer break and I wanted to enjoy summer, pursue some interests, etc, but I feel like I'm spending all my time inside a mall. How do I tell my managers that I want less hours?

552,"I don‚Äôt know this for sure but every time I see him he always talks about women, like he will joke around at a restaurant be like ‚Äúhey I got that girls number she says she wants to show her your tits in the restroom‚Äù I usually respond saying ‚Äúoh alright‚Äù with a slight laugh, I‚Äôm not gay, I don‚Äôt ‚Äúlook gay‚Äù or ‚Äúsound gay‚Äù it‚Äôs just I never talk about women in front of my uncles or dad, they‚Äôre usually all together, do they have any idea how awkward it is to talk about girls around them?

He‚Äôs always asking these questions to me trying to see if I show a reaction. I talk about girls all the time with my friends. He never asked if I‚Äôm gay (I wish he just would since it‚Äôs getting kinda annoying with him constantly asking me if I think this girl is hot) but I can just tell he‚Äôs trying to find out.

553,"I have two job interviews next week-ish and I am extremely grateful but it has become a dilemma for my personally..

Degree in Biology Forensics

To make short: ""Dream job"" would be forensics or science-related.

(This is all based on the possibility of both offering me the job)

Some points:
Job one (supreme court):
-an hour drive (I don't mind commuting but I'd obviously love to not have to)
-mediocre pay
-may help with getting further in dream career
-weekends and holidays off

Job two (police dispatcher):
-same town I live in (so around 10 minute commute)
-high paying
-12 hour shifts (no holiday/weekends off)

I would rather a position that is close to home and high pay but also I can't help but feel that job one would help further my career more than job two. I'm not sure how to choose and what would be more important.

Also I have no clue how to successfully interview for two jobs and juggle them according..
Ex: Let's say I'd rather job two but job one contacts me and offers the job to me before I know whether or not the one I'd rather will even offer it to me.

562,"For as long as I remember, I've always had problems with being jealous - even over tiny and unimportant things. I hate it about myself. It makes me feel like a nasty, selfish person and I would consider it to be one of my biggest flaws.

Right now my boyfriend is on holiday with his friends at a log cabin and will be going out every night and partying lots. I feel very secure in our relationship, and have no fears that he will cheat on me or anything like that. However, I just feel almost debilitatingly jealous (sorry for being so dramatic haha) that he's away exploring and partying and with lots of friends. I really wish I was there with him and joining in with everyone. 

Honestly, I feel like it would help me in loads of other aspects of my life if I could get this jealousy thing under control and would really love any advice.

But I have never had an interest in moving to the States. Nevertheless a rust belt city. Hes always implied that its temporary, sometimes asking how long I'd like to live there. But the time line keeps increasing. First 7 years, then 10. Then last week he told me it would be indefinitely( hes known this all along). I feel manipulated because that's not the circumstance I agreed to. Hes never been upfront about the timeline. Hes only give  me enough information to get the response he wanted. I don't want to live in the states forever. I'm unsure if I'm being dramatic or I'm justified in feeling manipulated.",14Jun2019,1
565,"My brother graduated college over a year ago and has made no effort to find a job. He's severely underweight, doesn't shower or eat, and plays on the computer for 14 hours or more a day. My mother is mentally unwell, is disabled. If my brother doesn't get a job soon she'll no longer get disability. If I try to mention any of the issues she starts screaming and talking very strangely, almost threatening. She keeps saying she'll get him help but then says she can't do anything as my father won't help. I said that he never will. She knows this but has no answers. 

She uses a lot of past stuff I dealt with years ago while I had my own breakdown as a weapon. I'm not an angel by any means.

My father is an abusive alcoholic and does not care about anyone. He's a non-factor here. 

Oh yeah, and our cat is slowly dying and the place smells like cat shit. 

I'm moving out soon and likely won't ever make an effort to talk to my parents again. But how do I help my brother? Or should I just back off and let him deal with it, I've tried asking to help with a resume. I've tried referring him to my current job. I've tried being firm with him.

In the last few days, I've noticed a drastic change in my personality. 

I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder back in January 2019, and I guess I was somewhat anxious for years, but due to an event in my past (July 2018) I had to go to the doctors to get diagnosed. I couldn't take the anxiety anymore. 

I started taking 20mg Prozac during around March, but I stopped in early May because I didn't care anymore. 

The side effects have worn off (The only ones I noticed was a considerable lower sex drive and it took me longer to cum). 

So in the last few days I don't feel anxious, or at least in the same way. When something comes up such as me doing something embarrassing then I used to just ruminate like hell. Now I just don't care, but I make sure to learn from my mistakes. 

I used to be told I'm the most polite person ever (something everyone said about me in my year book and throughout university), but now I just don't feel so polite. I'm not rude, I just don't care about trying to please people. I just get on with my life. 

If someone tries to be rude to me then I just try to be rude back to the same degree. In the past I would stay calm and polite. It happened yesterday at a supermarket. The lady was really rude to me and so just behaved almost the same until she got the hint. 

I'm significantly more confident. I don't stutter or say ""umm"". I can go out and talk to anyone, doesn't matter whom they are. Before I used to just shy away as much as possible and even my family noticed. 

Although I care to what happens to me in the future and I try to work as hard as possible, I just don't care about what people have to say about me (unless it's someone like a boss or professor meaning someone who has power over me) where as in the past I would micro manage every interaction to make sure it's perfect and I come across as nice and polite. 

The last thing is a little strange. I just feel odd looking at myself in the mirror. I just can't explain what it is. I just feels odd. I know it's me, but it's just strange to see myself, even though I have the same haircut, wear the same clothes etc.

My father and I recently decided to get our walkway in our front lawn redone.  We hired some guys from a flyer we saw and they said they could do it for 1500 dollars.  We decided to take them up on the offer and not only did they start the job a week later than they should have, they spent only an hour and 15 minutes doing it.  I looks genuinely terrible.  We have a camera at the front of our house and saw they were only working for this amount of time.  For some parts of the walkway, they only picked up some of the bricks and just put them right back where they were without any changes, and some places they didn't touch at all.  I feel as though we definitely shouldn't pay them, but they didn't seem as though they were the most friendly of people, so with them feeling we owe them 1500 dollars and them having the address to our house I feel very conflicted as to what to do and would really appreciate any advice anyone can give as to what to do.",14Jun2019,1
570,"I've been good friends with this girl for 6 years.  She even set me up with one of her family members who I'm now engaged to. The problem is she's been acting different the past year or so. I think she's jealous.

 She's been with her boyfriend for 10 years and he won't get her an engagement ring so she's upset about that. My fiance and I just bought a new house together and not to sound snobby but it is a lot nicer than her trailer. She always has snarky comments about our house or our engagement. 

Years ago she told me when she got engaged I'd be the first to know. So when I got engaged I told her first and her response was ""why are you telling me?""

I don't know what her problem is. I think maybe she's just unhappy with her life. I've stopped hanging out with her and inviting her to do things . It's hard though because I still have to see her at family gatherings since her and fiance are related. His family keeps pushing for us to work things out but I feel like I've outgrown the friendship and it's just not worth the hassle anymore. Their family comes up with excuses for her behavior all the time either blaming it on her unhappiness or blaming her boyfriend.  There just always seems to be a problem. I'm usually the one who says hello first otherwise I think she would just ignore me.  Do you think it's worth it to try to work things out?

Obviously I was chocked at this behaviour and felt sorry for the cat,  but the kids mother wasn't surprised at all , and carried on to tell me proudly about the story where he gutted a bird alive (I think it's a small parrot) he opened his huts with his bare hands and took out his organs , again I was chocked but his mom seemed proud of him , I told her that this is not a normal behaviour at all and that she should take him to a doctor or something , I saw that she got upset so I dropped it , and then I saw him throwing the cat around ,the poor thing was so scared I almost cried and I threatened him that I'll take the cat away next time

579,"Hey there, r/family, sad story today that has been weighing on my heart for years but have been afraid to reach out to anyone and ask for advice. I'm not exactly asking for *help*, but rather, if anyone has been in a similar situation or at least how to proceed. 

My grandma used to be my best friend. I would escape to her and my grandpa's home regularly as a child, because my relationship with my mother was not super great. As I child, I didn't understand the issues of our family dynamic, so blissfully unaware I would always stay the night and play at their home. 

(I'm going to bullet out these points to try and piece everything together, also so my mind doesn't see a wall of text and go crazy)

- To begin, I know a lot of what has caused the mental side of illness in my grandma comes from an abusive relationship with my grandpa when they were both young, continuing into present day in their relationship. Only about 10 years ago did he stop drinking and getting violent towards her (both in their late 60s). 

- My grandma also had an abusive relationship with her mother, which manifested in my grandma's daughter (my mother) having a rocky relationship. Whether or not things I have heard are true or not, I know my grandma has accused my mom of seducing my grandpa, of stealing from her, of selling her things while she was in the hospital, of brainwashing me, etc. A lot of paranoia. I didn't know this as a child, so I was sort of raised to believe my mom was the bad guy.

- About 12 years ago, my uncle passed away, and I know since then she has shut herself in isolation. She used to drive places with me, go to malls, teach me about thrift stores, etc. But since he passed away, all of that has gradually fallen apart. 

- Within the last 5 years, I know she has suffered a stroke, which adds on the myriad of health issues she has. However, because so many of the things she has faced have gone untreated while under care of physicians - hernia, diverticulitis, Bells palsy, COPD, arthritis - she has a phobia of doctors, physicians, NPs, nurses. Refuses to see them and has taken herself off all medications except weed, which she smokes to alleviate stress and pain.

- In the last 5 years as well, amidst isolation and my grandpa working away from home for weeks at a time, she has this complex to buy things from QVC, which is a television channel that sells stuff. To put it nicely, she has more than she needs. I guess in the era she grew up in, they were told to hold on to everything they had because they didn't know when or if they could get more. But she has stacks of boxes 5-feet tall full of unopened (to me) junk. 

- On top of too much stuff that she is too ill to use or put away, the kitchen is full of (get ready for the fetid bit in the title) literally decaying materials. I can't even call it food. Black mold, smokey mold when you open up tupperware. Stacks of dishes on every possible surface of the counter. Bags of unopened groceries that are rotting on the floors. Sink grimed shut with decay. The house reeks of death. 

- On top of on top of on top of that, she eats so poorly, which exacerbates her diverticulitis: Burger King, White Castle, pizza, soda, smokes a pack of Marlboro's a day. I have tried to cook things for her, only to get my uncleaned, uneaten tupperware container back a month later full of moldy disgusting food. 

- This isolation also has her playing little word games. She'll take apart words of my sentence and turn my words against me. I can't exactly articulate it, but she turns everything I say into an insult or a hit on her in some way. For example, I was baking earlier when I told her how I was doing something. She said I was wrong for doing it that way and I should listen to her, to which I said that I appreciate her advice but I want to do things my way. Then I become the bad guy. The last few years of our ""relationship"" have been her inserting unwarranted ruminations and advice over my life and I have asked her to stop. I get that she is family, and she (should, hopefully) want to help, but the prophesying over me and giving all this advice is hard. I can't take it any more. 

- The hardest part is that she potentially has some sort of Alzheimer's. She never remembers the things that I tell her, and when I tell her ""I told you this last week!"" in even a light tone, I, once again, become the bad guy. Of course, she hasn't been to a doctor in at least 4 years, so this is all hypothesis.

This breaks my heart so heavily. As an empathic person, when she calls wheezing from her COPD, I feel that pain in my chest. When she hurts me with words that might not make a cohesive sentence, I do take it to heart. This was someone who used to be my best friend, but is no longer someone I can have in my life. And to make this all worse, because she is so vile and hateful towards everyone when we offer her help, everyone is so scared to call 911 when she is vomitting uncontrollably from eating rancid food, to call landlords to condemn the house, to call police when she gets hostile and threatens to hurt someone or herself (this last part hasn't happened in awhile, but when it did, I called the suicide hotline). 

Any advice for someone who has completely closed themselves off from the world, and can no longer see things clearly? For someone who is so sickly but so paranoid to receive help? For someone who has been traumatically hurt but refuses to get care because they think they are doing the right thing by being hateful back to the person who caused them so much pain? 

The weight on my shoulders is too heavy to carry.

580,"After years of toiling away writing, creating music, and having basically nothing to show for it, I finally realized what my issue is. I do work hard and I do produce a lot of content, but i never actually finish anything. I do a ton of work - like write multiple drafts of a TV pilot or write the music and lyrics to the song, but then I don't do the last revision/fill in the last plot gap, or record the song properly so I can send it to people, etc. 

I've always just thought it's because I'm ADD and bounce from project to project but I'm realizing that's not the truth. It's not that I lose interest, because I find myself going back and re-reading the work all the time and making tiny tweaks. And it's not that I can't focus because (with meds) I can.

586,"There was this local group of cyberbullies I met back when I was 17 in 2017 and I actively participated in their discord server.

I chatted actively in the forum and gave out too much of my personal information as I was a naive teenager. No use criticising me for it now as the damage is done. They doxxed me on almost all my social media accounts as they weren't difficult to find, from my personal blog to my Instagram account to my Reddit account to my phone number.

As it was a local forum, some of them begun stalking me in real life and posted online things like ""guess how I know you did this and this today?"" or ""nice dress you were wearing"" and even ""have fun guessing which of your friend is me"". I begun to realise some of them were from my college and I began to become scared. Yet back then I still didn't know what they were doing was breaching my privacy so I did not do anything about it.

Some of them really went overboard and sent me hundreds of words of love letters professing their love for me and some of them told me to kill myself and other threatening things.

Fast forward to late 2017 I decided this was toxic (still not realising it was illegal) and deleted all my social media accounts and changed my phone number. I disappeared into thin air and left no traces. They were for once gone.

Fast forward again to these few months, I recreated social media accounts to be up to date with close friends and kept a very small following. Yet I realise for example on my Instagram story occasionally they view my stories, which weirds me out because I've changed my number and everything and the only way they could have gained access to my account is by adding my circle of friends and browsing through their following / follower list. Furthermore, whenever I join *any* local public forum or chatroom, if I even have a hint of my identity they will immediately recognise me and begin insulting me or sending me creepy lovey dovey messages. Including on Telegram, Instagram, Discord and even my Reddit. They literally collect every little trace of information I give out to dox me and remind me that they exist.

I'm not sure if this is the right avenue to seek advice as I have lost most if not all of the evidence that can prove the cyberbullies have been cyberbullying me as it has been such a long time since it was ongoing. I changed phone multiple times and lost all the weird obsessive love letters and death threats that I screenshotted throughout the years. I'm not sure reporting this to the police will even help. I do have recent screenshots of them communicating with me but without context they just look like normal and random text people send, it is hard to prove it is actually from the same people. How else can I help myself then?

I feel fearful of them even though I know they are harmless as long as I stay off the internet. It is hard staying away from social media sites being in the connected world I'm in right now. Keeping my for example Instagram followers a small circle makes me look like a weirdo with no social life. Having no profile pic on WhatsApp gets me questions. Having my every move online watched makes me paranoid and stressed.

And when they ask for my advice I can't help but smile or laugh and it really pissing me off that i can't even control my emotions but when i'm alone I'll get angry or cry.

I also think my last relationship ended because he always told me I cant be serious for one second and everything is a joke to me, and he was going through a really bad time.

The age of consent is 16 in their state, so her minor status is not illegal . Their sexual relationship was illegal due to his being an authority figure in her life. 

The student graduated in June 2018.  A few days after she turned 18, in October 2018, it's likely that the school administration learned of (or decided to take action with) the relationship as he was escorted out of the school, barred re-entry, and put on administrative leave.  After a few weeks, he resigned so that he could keep his teaching license. In October/November 2018, an investigation was made by the county.  A sexual relationship couldn't be proven and the student refused to communicate with investigators, so no criminal charges were made.  The case has been sealed, but the statute of limitations for the illegal relationship has 6 more years until they expire.


After he was escorted out of school, my sister-in-law was willing to work through things and remain married until she discovered in November 2018 that he was still talking and taking the student on dates.  At that point she filed for divorce.  Last week the divorce was finalized and my SIL has given me the green light to communicate with the student's family and county investigators if I want. 

I have emails written by the student to my brother and detail the sexual nature of their relationship. The emails are dated from June-October 2018 (when she was 17). I obtained these emails legally and were included in their divorce paperwork (which can be accessed through the court system). Do I share these emails with the county? 

It's unlikely that her parents are aware of her relationship with her former high school teacher. It seems to be happening in secret as there are no pictures of the two of them together on social media and he didn't participate in her family holiday celebrations or vacations. 

My relationship with my brother has been strained for years and even more so after this broke in October 2018. I'm disgusted at his behavior and want him to face consequences for his actions. (This is not his first time taking advantage of young women, and two weeks ago he denied ever having had a relationship with a teenager during a phone call with me.) My opinion is that he groomed this student and manipulated her into a relationship. I'm disgusted that the school district swept his actions under the rug...his name wasn't released during the investigations and he was offered to quietly resign. He's bros with his principal and VP, and he was a football and basketball coach. He is teaching at another high school in another county, tutoring students one-on-one, and currently applying to school districts adjacent to the one where he used to work. I find his continued interaction with high school students alarming. 

The relationship with the student continues today and it's clear his influence over her is strong. She un-enrolled in the university 3 hours away from him (she had a full ride soccer scholarship) and will be attending a university 5 miles from his apartment (no longer playing soccer) . (I know information about her because her mom has an unsecured Facebook account and posts family updates frequently.) The student babysits my niece and nephew on my brother's parenting days, and they tell me about her and how she spends the night and makes pancakes for them.  I don't fault her... I think she is naive and doesn't realize that she's in a fucked up relationship.  However, I find it inappropriate and think it should stop, but I'm not sure if the strained relationship with my brother clouding my perception.

His injury has required multiple surgeries over the years and for about the last four years he's been unable to work.  About year ago, his only other sibling died, which caused a lot of issues for his family, who he lives with.


We haven't communicated a lot over the years though I did visit him about six to seven months ago.  He has never been easy to talk to about feelings or anything remotely emotional unless we are both pretty messed up on alcohol.


Present: He was supposed to call me Saturday to catch up but didnt. He was also supposed to send me something to read, which I thought was just going to be some random thought about something, and he didn't. 


Today, I called him and he didn't answer, but a few hours later said that he couldn't talk right now but sent me what he'd been writing. It was about 32 lines of poetry and it was dark. I would be it at a 7 out of 10 on the darkness scale.


I didn't address the poem but asked when a good time to talk would be and he said that he would try to call today or this weekend. I said tonight worked great and that I would call him on Saturday if he didnt call me, which he said thanks for.

597,"I currently work at a job where I am paid $14.08 /hr. I get a 2% raise every year. I have the summer and most of December off every year. I have paid sick days and paid holidays. I have a 401k plan and I have health insurance. However, there are things I hate about this job. 

Recently, I was given four brand new duties at that job: website admin, Inventory, retail supervisor, and menu graphic designer. Four big and time consuming duties. So I asked for a raise. I thought that was fair since I just got 4 new duties on top of everything else I do. Then, long story short, we got audited. All of my co-supervisors jobs got posted online. My raise that my boss promised me got thrown out the window for something I didn‚Äôt even do.  It left a very bitter taste in my mouth since I‚Äôve worked there for 5 years. Also, I should say, this company I work for is in the Top 20 best companies to work for on Earth according to Forbes. 

So, before I had that job, I worked at a local Mom &amp; Pop restaurant. I worked there for 6 years. I was a manager there for 5 years. I loved the owners. Owners loved me. I was literally the only manager there never to get fired during my time. During the summer and Christmas months, when my other job is basically shut down, the owners let me return every summer and Christmas to wait tables to make money. I like waiting tables. I love that place. I‚Äôve made lifelong friends by working there. I actually look forward going to work there. 

Recently, they called me into the office unexpectedly. They want me to return to them, and return to management. The quote their GM told me was, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre being paid at your other job but I‚Äôm sure the owners would pay you time and a half    of what you make there if you return here.‚Äù Time and a half would be $21.00/hr. Thats a $6.00 raise! That‚Äôs the most amount of money I‚Äôve ever been offered. They promised a 2 week vacation once per year. They said I could wait tables on busy nights if I wanted. I‚Äôd get Christmas bonuses. Their pitch was they needed someone who above all else knows customer service and satisfaction, due to recent incidents I won‚Äôt go into. 

I‚Äôm torn. 

If I return to manage that restaurant, I lose my 401k, I lose my insurance, I lose paid vacations and paid sick days. I‚Äôd lose these big breaks during the summer and Christmas, which I love. 

But, I love working at that restaurant. I‚Äôve never felt screwed by them. And it‚Äôs $21.00 an hour! Due to the breaks at my current job, I only make roughly $19,000 a year. If I take them on their restaurant GM offer, I‚Äôd be making roughly $40,000 a year. I‚Äôm 36 years old, I feel like I should‚Äôve already been making at least $25,000 by now. 

Maybe the answer is obvious. I‚Äôve asked two of my best friends. I asked my mom. All of them agreed I should take the restaurant job. I meet with the owners next week to discuss exactly what I‚Äôm getting if I return. What if they offer lower? I think if they offered $15-$17 an hour, I wouldn‚Äôt be interested. I could make that in a few years at my current plus keep all my benefits. But if they offered $19-$21 /hr I would put in my 2 weeks notice so fast and never look back.",14Jun2019,1

I tried to make her smile but I failed. Then I asked her why is she so sad and she just said that she had a headache. This was here excuse for a week but I got tired of it and asked her why she was faking it which resulted in her not talking to me . Since the last 2 weeks she stopped talking to me and when I ask her something she answers with only yes or no. When I talk with someone else she just stares at us and acts annoyed.  I told her I'm sorry for thinking she was faking her headache and she said it's cool but since then she ignores me entirely. I texted her to tell her how sorry I was and she said that she forgives me but the next day she acts like we don't know each other. Plz help me.

601,"My boyfriend and I are leaving our current place to move an hour away closer to my school. We have a very good relationship with our landlord and she has no problem with us leaving early. She even told us she can find someone to take over our lease for us and will miss us. We were approved on the spot for our current appartment w/o a co signer. Until we leave our rent is about $1100 a month which we have paid every month. Moving to the city my school is in saves us about $500 a month since the average apartments we are looking at are only $650-700 a month and gas going back and forth to school with the hour commute there &amp; back has added up to $200 every two weeks. 

We met with a leasing agent for an apartment unit in the area last week. She gave us all the information we needed. Application fees were $40 each and they absolutely approve co signers. Me &amp; my boyfriend counted as 1 application, and my dad if we needed to use him as a co signer would be a separate application, an additional $40. She informed us they'd run our application first in order to save the extra $40 if we didnt need my dad to co sign. She emphasized on this that she didnt want us wasting an extra $40 if we didnt need to. We called her yesterday to confirm all the information she gave us to make sure everything was correct &amp; understood. She confirmed we were one application and my dads was separate and they would run ours first to save the extra $40 if we didnt need it but if our application was denied they would run his.

Our appointment to turn the applications in was today. My boyfriend had to work so it was just me and my dad. She was appearently off and we met with a different leasing agent. He took our first application and said we were denied. And that we couldn't use a co signer? Took my two money orders for $40 each and didnt even look at or run my dads application, I still have it here with me. It even says on the front page $40 app fee and applicant + co applicant are on one application. 

I asked him why we were denied, we met all the qualifications she gave us besides credit which is why my dad would've co signed since our credit was hit by our student loans, which she already knew about and my dads credit is excellent. My boyfriend makes 3x the rent alone, neither of us have convictions, evictions, money owed, and I mean appearance wise we are a typical nice looking family. Me, him, our 2 yr old, and one on the way.

The only reason we even put in the application for this place today was because she told us they would approve of my dad co signing for us, she knew our situation, and I know we met all other qualifications. We are in a situation where we need to find a place asap. $200 in gas every two weeks is killing us, our rent we meet but we have a child on the way and even though we make it we have no extra money to save up living out here.

She never once said OUR application needed to be approved IN ORDER to use a co signer, I mean never once said or implied that and this is my first time using a co signer.

When I asked him why we were denied he said a combination of criminal history and leasing history. Neither me or my boyfriend have any criminal convictions in our history, only traffic tickets from years ago. I lived at my previous apartment for two years, paid every month, was never evicted or had a broken lease. I told him this and all he could say was the leasing agent we spoke to knew more than him and to speak to her on Monday about it and that was it.

I just cant wrap my mind around it we paid $80 for one application she told us twice was only $40. He told us we couldn't use a co signer and she told us twice we could. He didnt even look at my dads application or run it when she told us twice if we were denied they would. The situation we are in we could not afford to lose $80 just to be denied. I instantly broke down crying because we just spent $100 on an application fee for a different apartment last week that we were denied. Except we know why we were denied because credit and they are refunding us in 30 days. My boyfriend called his dad for advice after I told him what happen. His dad is in law enforcement and he told him it could possibly be some type of fraud. We are going to call and speak to her Monday but we dont need this situation at all on top of trying to find a place for us an hour away from where we currently live while still paying on our current rent, and the extra gas to make appointments out here. 

We're serious about finding a place. We aren't just throwing money at applications with the possibility of being denied which is why I confirmed the information she gave us twice. I'm afraid she's going to tell us something different when we call her on Monday. I just need advice from people who are familiar with a situation like this, maybe know how we can go about it from here if she does in fact try to tell us something different on Monday. Or maybe was this guy wrong for not going by what she told us? 

Also from past experience asking for advice on reddit, I dont want any asinine comments on my post ""you should've done this"" ""you played yourself"" or focusing on little details that have nothing to do with what I'm asking advice for and questioning me about them like ""why do you have an hour commute to school"".

I ordered some stuff off Amazon, nothing major, just some natural skincare products, about $35, and the package was stolen after delivery. Wha' ha' happened wuz....

\-saw the email on Sat around 4pm that the package had been delivered at 2:31pm and left by the door (usps)

\-(I was at home all day and never heard a knock on the door like the postal worker usually does. I do remember there being people hanging around outside that afternoon though. Lots of suspicious ppl hanging around lately. Some live in the apts, some I think are homeless, but they know each other.) Soooo... i looked outside and there was nothing. Looked at the next apartments down, looked at the mailbox, nothing. Checked amazon and they said wait, it might come later. Also saw some other things saying deliveries sometimes come after being marked delivered. I didn't think that was the case so I decided to call usps asap on monday.

\-Monday morning I made a report with usps online, cos it would have been an hour long wait on hold. 

\-Monday evening I cam home to the empty box my husband had found outside that afternoon. So whoever stole it, went to the trouble of bringing back the empty box, just to be an asshole I presume.

Is there a way to get a seller to ship with signature confirmation in the future?

621,"Hey guys, tonight I‚Äôm hanging out with a friend I haven‚Äôt seen in a while. She‚Äôs been feeling really down and specifically said she was looking forward to seeing because I tend to elevate her spirits. But I know that, when we usually get together, at some point or another, we end up talking about deep feelings/emotions or whatever. It‚Äôs sort of just the energy of the relationship. We have a lot of fun too, but it always gets ‚Äúheavier‚Äù at some point. 

My question is, what are some ways to help her from averting the dark or deep thoughts/conversation without coming across as totally shallow? I know she specifically wants to have a good time and I can help with that, but also I feel a little pressured, and don‚Äôt want to come across as disingenuous, cause I tend to feed off another person‚Äôs energy.

622,"One of my childhood best friends is in a pretty toxic long distance relationship. Her and her boyfriend had broken up right before he had moved out of state for his job, and things ended in very poor terms. A little while after he moved, he texted her begging her to come back to him and to visit him. My friend spent over $1000 to fly across the country to see him and to give him another chance. Now she's back in our hometown and the ldr is not going great. On his social media, he is reposting pictures of other girls in their underwear and he doesn't acknowledge their relationship, which bothers her. He never posts about her or likes when she post pictures of them together. It's like he's hiding that they are together. Whenever she brings this up and her dislike of his pictures of other girls on his Twitter, he just deflects and says she brings up ""the same shit."" Everyone is telling her that he's being disrespectful and that he's not giving her the time of day. She has lost her self confidence and has gained more anxiety and sadness being with him, yet she wants to be with him. She will text me almost everyday upset about something he has done and she says she is going to break up with him but then she backs out if the decision because she thinks he can work out his ""issues."" I think she is scared because she is used to the familiarity of the relationship and she has never broken up with someone herself. She knows that it's a bad relationship but she will take the advice she gets and throws it out the window. It's getting really hard for me to bite my tongue anymore. I want what will be healthy for her and I've tried to tell her this but I'm getting to the point that I don't think she will understand unless I'm brutally honest with her. I don't want to hurt her but I can't keep being dragged into her vicious cycle of a bad relationship. I was in a toxic and abusive relationship where I felt all the things she's feeling now. I don't need to be dragged into hers just to feel those things again when it isn't even my relationship. How do I tell her that her toxic relationship is making our friendship toxic too, without hurting her so bad that I lose her?",14Jun2019,1
623,"This is my first time writing this out in my entire life - I‚Äôm bisexual. I‚Äôve always known my entire life that I am attracted to both women and men. My first crush was my female substitute teacher in 1st grade. And my first kiss was with a girl. As I grew older I knew I had to suppress my feelings for women if I wanted to have friends because sadly being a lesbian was always considered to be ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù at my schools. And so I hid. I hid in the closet as bisexual all through out my school years and all through out college despite having crushes and minor under the radar flings with women that no one knew about.

Flash forward to now, I have attempted to be open about my sexuality and have attempted to take the step towards coming out but I feel like no one has taken me seriously and that‚Äôs because of this...

I have been in a relationship with a man for 5 years and believe he is my soulmate and life partner. I want to marry him and spend the rest of my life with him. My love for him is so deep.

This is why I feel like a fraud.

- Am I even allowed to say that I‚Äôm bisexual even though I have never openly dated a woman?

- Am I even allowed to ‚Äúcome out‚Äù as bisexual even though I plan to marry my boyfriend of 5 years?

- Am I even allowed to say that I‚Äôm bisexual if I haven‚Äôt even been with a woman in terms of having sex?

I feel like a fraud and it hurts me so deep in my soul. 

I have talked to my boyfriend briefly about being attracted to both women and men. It was very brief and he was worried that I feel as though I‚Äôm missing out on experiencing half of my sexuality and he feared that down the line I would realize I want to be with a woman. In my heart I know he is my soulmate and I don‚Äôt feel as though I have ‚Äúmissed out‚Äù on anything because of brief relations I have had with women in college. He was very supportive in me being open about my true self and that made me feel so accepted and at peace - yet still, I kept it extremely brief and still feel as though I cannot talk with him about being part of the LGBTQ+ community even though he expressed support.

I want so much to say that I am part of the LGBTQ+ community because in my heart and soul I know that I am and always have been. 

I want to be able to come out as bisexual without people thinking I‚Äôm planning on leaving my boyfriend for a woman. I fear that people will say that I‚Äôm in the wrong for saying I‚Äôm bisexual when I plan on marrying a man and that there was no point in my causing a ‚Äústir‚Äù since I‚Äôm marrying a man anyway.

Is there even a point in me coming out? I don‚Äôt want to be selfish but I really want to be able to celebrate myself and my sexuality. But then I loop back around to feeling like a fraud because I have only ever been in heterosexual relationships (aside from the under the radar flings I mentioned before).

If you can‚Äôt tell, I‚Äôm deeply confused and lost and I want to come out but feel as though I can‚Äôt.

The reason this is all coming to the surface today is because I saw an LGBTQ+ tote that said ‚ÄúLove Is Love‚Äù in rainbow colors and I felt the urge to purchase it, but my feelings of being a ‚Äúfraud‚Äù member of the community came rushing in. But I took a huge personal step, I bought the bag. May not seem like a lot to most, but to me it was a massive accomplishment. 

And that propelled me to write this entire post and write out for the very first time ever - I am bisexual.

625,"to summarize the past few years, my mom has been in and out of mental facilities and rehab facilities for depression, bipolar, and substance abuse issues. 

every time she is sober, she moves to a new apartment by herself that is not close to my sister or myself, and it goes well at first. then the phone calls start 

now present day: every morning she calls me to talk, and pretty often it turns into her asking me to drive an hour to come see her, asks me to uber her down to see me (has a suspended license) an hour away ($100 total even though i do get reimbursed in the following weeks by her attorney/guardian), her crying about how lonely she is and making me upset because i can‚Äôt always be there for her, talk about how much she misses my dad (divorced due to above reasons) or her talking poorly about my grandma that is her closest relative location wise because she won‚Äôt drive her everywhere or let her stay at her house all the time. 

it‚Äôs a constant cycle and i‚Äôm hoping this time she stays sober, but i don‚Äôt understand how to help her. every time i hear her get upset, bring up my dad, or talk badly about my grandma, it really ruins my day and makes me very upset. i don‚Äôt want to upset her further, but i can‚Äôt constantly be called to sobbing and depressing things and then have to go to work with it weighing on my conscience that she is sitting alone in her apartment probably thinking i don‚Äôt care enough to skip work and drive the hour to come see her 

so i guess what i‚Äôm asking is: am i being inconsiderate and should be doing more for my mom? should she not lean on me as much as she does and i need to tell her that somehow? anything else helpful?

626,"So I go to this camp every day and there are lots of people I would love to talk to. But everyone there has their own group of friends and I don't have any friends there. There are a few people I previously knew, but whenever I try to talk to any of them, it just goes nowhere. I say something like, ""I like your shirt!"" And they just say thanks and walk away and start talking to someone else. Everyone there is pretty outgoing and it seems like everyone's friends with everyone else except for me. Sometimes people compliment me but in the moment I have no idea what to say apart from thanks. 

I'm kind of in the middle of extroversion and introversion. I love socializing when I can actually do it. I'd usually rather be talking to people than being by myself, but I have no idea how to make friends.

This is risky, it will require a lot of hard work and moving 3 hours away into the city (neither of which I am opposed to).  This is my dream, and it's what I want to pursue.  

Now, my dad has supported me following my dreams, and even has openly supported me going into tattooing, supported me through me coming out as trans and going on hormones, and honestly everything I have done! But when it comes to this he says things like ""I hope you plan on finishing school, you're going to throw away your opportunities, you are taking a big risk"", and I just don't get it.

632,"For the past couple months we‚Äôve had a certain individual who lives down the street from us come walking up to our house. He does so shirtless and in gym shorts. He just comes up to our house, staring at us the entire time, stands in front of our driveway for a bit, then walks back to his house, never taking his eyes off of us. We‚Äôve been told he even does this in the middle of the night when everyone is sleeping. We had no idea why he did that. Until today. The neighbors across the street from us saw him and stopped him. Asked what his deal was. The reason he hates us? ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre Republicans. And so is the woman who lives next to them‚Äù. 

Granted, the woman who lives next to us does like to have Pro-Trump signs on her yard. My father is indeed a Republican, but we don‚Äôt make it known. No signs, flags, or bumper stickers. We keep our opinions to ourselves. For me, I‚Äôm a bit on the liberal side of things, but I follow in the idea of keeping my opinion to myself. So apparently this guy told the neighbor across the street that he wishes death on anyone who voted Trump or those who support Trump-supporters. He‚Äôs not a Liberal whackjob. He‚Äôs a whackjob who uses political discourse to justify his hatred. It just so happens he stands on the correct side of history. But militant extremism isn‚Äôt going to bring any good. 

Luckily we found out he‚Äôs also extremely anti-gun. I guess it‚Äôs a good thing? He doesn‚Äôt own any. Probably doesn‚Äôt carry. Probably won‚Äôt ever want to lay hands on one.  The last thing a person who wishes death on anyone needs is a gun. 

Anyways, I just don‚Äôt know what to do here. He does his stalkerish walk-by‚Äôs every evening and possibly early in the morning for whatever reason. We called the cops on him with video evidence, but the cops say he‚Äôs not doing anything wrong.

635,"Okay so for context my parents are conservative old fashioned christians. There's nothing wrong with it to be very honest as I'm quite conservative myself and am a Christian, but this context is important.

So I went to college far away in Alabama. My parents were very particulate about what I can wear or put on. They have these rules like no tattoos, no rings, minimal jewelry, and a neat hairstyle. I'll be clear here, they aren't forcing me, they're just advising me based on what they feel is required to be an upright Christian. They feel all of the above is the prerequisite to a life of drugs and crime.

So when I went to college, I got a lot of jewelry and got dreads in my hair. I didn't think about what my parents would think at the moment. So for the summer I'm staying with my cousins in Texas. Today my parents video called me and I remembered they would be disappointed and upset to see my hair like this. So I hid in the bathroom and told them I would talk to them later. This really upset them and they were on the phone for almost an hour, waiting for me to come out, but I didn't.

I know that video calling them with my hair like this would destroy them and make them very upset, and I just can't do that. I don't want my parents to feel like I'm disappointing them or I'm not taking all the hard work they put into my life seriously. I can't let them see me like this, but I have to video call them.

648,"Hi. I'll take any sort of response to this situation. I'm just desperate and it's weighing down on me.  
I'm a teenage female who just began working shift at the city zoo today. I'm bored, sitting at one of my shifts before a cute guy walks past me with a sketchbook in hand. To me, he looked nerdy but cute. Curly blonde hair, glasses, etc. I felt attracted to him naturally, so I struck up a convo with him easily about drawing (I'm also an artist). He liked drawing tanks, and so did I. However, I got so wound up in the scene I didn't even give him my number before he left.  
A few hours later, I spot him again. This time he was by the food court, with his mom and younger sibling. I saw this as a 'now or never' moment as I walked over and tapped his shoulder. Asked to see his sketchbook and a pencil, and I wrote down my number with an ""I'll show you all my drawings :)"". Though, I got so nervous that I walked away before I could say anything else. I didn't see his reaction, but after a while, I could feel him looking at me as I showed some kids an artifact. He and his mom left without seeing me again, and that was how it ended.  
I keep overthinking to myself about what's going to happen; mostly that, worst case scenario, he doesn't respond at all. That maybe I wrote my number down wrong, that I was too upfront and scared him, that he doesn't have a phone, yadda yadda. My friends keep telling me 'he's just shy', 'maybe he's thinking of a way to respond' and things like that, but I just don't believe them.

651,"My friend (we'll call her Sara) and I have been friends for 3 years now. We've always been there for each other and have helped one another in hard times. 

Sara has been with her boyfriend (he'll be called Jack) for about a year and a half. When Sara started dating Jack, it caused our coworker to quit her job of 8 years. Our coworker has a child with him and is absolutely terrified of him so she felt she had to leave the place she once felt safe and free from him. She has a restraining order and he has no custody of their daughter due to abuse and meth use.

Jack moved into Sara's apartment almost immediately because he had no where to live. He also had his 13 year old son movie in with him. He did not help financially or around the house. Fast forward five months and all of a sudden Jack takes his things and his son and leaves. He didnt say anything to Sara, no explanation. Just up and left. I went over to her place and talked with her a few days after this happened. She said she had been calling and texting and on the second night she got a message from him saying he loved her and he'd call her. However, he never got ahold of her. Eventually after about a week Jack came back and she forgave him and everything was back to ""normal"".

A few months after that happened, they decided to move into his mother's basement together. Things were going ok for a bit while they lived there, I think mostly due to Jack's disabled mother living above them. But Sara still pays for pretty much everything. The only thing he pays for is the child support for his 4 kids. 

About 2 months ago, I got a call from Sara to come over because shit went down. Turns out Jack had some friends over and about 5-7 of them (incl. Jack) were arrested due to finding meth in one of their cars and it being on Jack's property. While Jack was in jail for a few days, his 2nd oldest kid was cleaning out the garage while I was there and found a meth pipe as well as lil meth baggies. Jack claimed to be 2 years sober at this time. 

Now just on Monday, I get a call from Sara found meth in his pockets and thenJack admitted to using ""only 5 times"". she said she needed to get out. She said he told her that he would ""beat the fuck out of her"" and that he could give her two black eyes for when her aunt visits. I immediately went over and we got her cats out and packed the important things. During this he was messaging her saying he loved her and then saying that how horrible she is and that she should ""make a scene"" for his mom. He was posting all these ""self love"" Facebook posts during this and just being completely manipulative.

Now today he is posting on Facebook that he loves and misses her. He wants to take her out to dinner. She doesnt know if she wants to go or not. I do not think she should go. I know this is her life and I don't know the whole story. But based on my old coworker's history with him and what has happened between him and Sara, I just am so worried for her. Is there anything that i can do or say to help her? Do I just support her? Our other coworkers want to call a welfare check on Jack due to the amount of meth Sara has found. I want my friend to be safe. What do I do?

(I apologize if this is messy. I'm on mobile and very anxious about this)

TL:DR - My very good friend is dating a meth user with a history of abuse. He has done many things to hurt her (emotionally, I'm not sure if he has been physical with her but has with others in the past) and I'm scared for her life. I want to help her but I don't know what to say or do. Do I have any place to say or do anything?",14Jun2019,0

653,"She is facing felony charge for her 12th OVI , a combination high concentration OVI. She caught charge 11/18, was offered $40,000 bail ($4,000 bond) which was paid. She then violated the terms of her bond drinking and was arrested and hospitalized. When released from hospital she was released home but told to go sign papers at sheriff's office, which was just a way to get her there, where she was put into custody again. Her court dates kept getting continued, she requested her 9th rehab and was put into a facility for 70 days and told it didnt count towards time served. The same hearing where they said she could seek out a rehab to attend they offered another $10,000 bail ($1000 bond) which was NOT paid. She was released from rehab to home somehow, without paying her bond and told to call probation. She didnt enter rehab from probation, she was incarcerated. She has a status hearing in July, but it isnt even her actual grand jury trial. I live in Ohio. She is a danger, if shes going to get to stay home I would like to move my kids to a safer place. Will probation arrest her when she goes to report where she owes a bond? There was no agreement that rehab negated her bond, the judge didnt even want to grant it for the almost 10th time on the states dollar. I need help!",14Jun2019,1

As soon as I saw some kind of cold crept into me. I don't know what. Saddness , anger a very different emotion.

655,"It's been three years since I've worked as a Medical Laboratory Scientist, and I have been contemplating on going for a career shift as a Specialty Coffee Barista.

I never knew what I really wanted to do for a job, but as far as I can recall I just wanted to travel and go abroad as a child.  I feel indifferent with my current job - I don't love it nor necessarily hate it.  It just feels monotonous and confined.  Also, being a licensed professional requires earning CPD (Continuous Programme Development) units for renewing my licence, attend several workshops/seminars, and this means spending around US$77\~150/seminar.  My monthly salary averages at $250, only a few slots are available and are quickly filled, plus it's really overpriced.

I've been into coffee early, since grade school, intrigued as to why my parents drink this brown-coloured liquid.  Found myself trying it out back in high school, and even drank it straight black in college to cope up with studying late at night.  Fast forward to 2018 and that was when I learned there's more to the world of coffee, and I jumped down the rabbit hole of specialty coffee: invested in some equipment, bought some beans.

It was also last year when I realised that sense of accomplishment when people compliment about things you make, in this case, a cup of filtered coffee.  In my line of work I've noticed this means the results, but the doctors usually read and interpret it; with the case of coffee I directly received feedback, the most striking of all came from a Q grader, and it was:

""When are you opening a coffee shop?""

That was when it dawned on me: I can create something that can be visibly appreciated, and I was just a home brewer at that! What more can the possibilities be if I make this as an occupation?

Now here's the catch:  I've made several friends in the coffee circle, and one of them is willing to take me in and train as a barista.  The pay is higher compared to being a Lab Scientist.  I'm looking for advice for the following:

1- should I take the risk and become a Specialty Coffee Barista?

2- If I (do) become a barista, should I opt to undertake to renew my professional licence for this year, or let it expire?  (Signing an undertaking oath would then require me to double my CPD units earning for the next three years)

3- how do I inform my parents of my decision to career shift?  I have this vague feeling they will disagree with this decision

Apologies for a lengthy text, many thanks for reading this far. Really will appreciate all advice :D",14Jun2019,1

660,"Alright so I live in a legal state (California) and am 21, but still live at home with my parents. My mom recently found my oil pen, but didn‚Äôt take it away and doesn‚Äôt know about my bong. 

Since then she‚Äôs been really awkward about it and seems a little disappointed that I smoke, but hasn‚Äôt explicitly said that she doesn‚Äôt want me smoking. Also almost every single time I go out with friends, she‚Äôll ask if I‚Äôm going to buy or do drugs. For these reasons I feel sort of like I‚Äôm stuck in limbo, as I don‚Äôt know how to move forward. I don‚Äôt really want to keep it like this as it‚Äôs very awkward, but don‚Äôt know exactly what to do as I don‚Äôt want to exacerbate the situation. 

I‚Äôve thought of a couple strategies I could try to lessen her aversion to cannabis, but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôll work. One idea is to slowly bring it up more and more every day, so I can sort of desensitize her to it. I‚Äôm thinking of something kind of like exposure therapy lol. Another idea is to just dive straight into the deep end and show her my bong and actual weed to see how she‚Äôll react. This one is a little scary as I‚Äôm not sure how she‚Äôll react to seeing actual weed as she‚Äôs only seen my oil pen. 

Also before anyone says anything, I only smoke outside when my parents are gone. I would never smoke inside the house (unless she was okay with it) and fully understand that this is her house and she‚Äôs allowing me to live here. I know that her rules are her rules and if she ultimately doesn‚Äôt want me smoking here than I‚Äôm ok with that.

664,"I'm 20 years old (girl if that makes a difference lol). Reddit's always felt like a great place to get advice for me, and I need some perspective from people who've lived longer than I have. 

I've just gotten out of this pretty toxic on/off thing with a guy around my age, which lasted about 1.5 years. To give you an idea, I've only had 2 relationships but have experienced 4 breakups. 3 of those breakups came from this one guy. My first relationship ended pretty badly too, since it was long distance and the first dude I dated started getting feelings for one of his friends.

I'm in a weird place right now. I'm not sad about losing the most recent guy or anything, but instead I'm sad that all this happened to me. I'm sad that I was treated that way and sad that I acted so pathetic as to literally beg someone to stay with me. It felt like my whole brain shut off in that moment and I was chasing something truly terrible, like an addiction I couldn't fight off. I cared so much for someone who didn't mind cutting me off 3 times...and yet I was still clinging on! I cringe every time I think of that.

So here I am. I'm not in love and haven't been in love for a while...I'm just hurt. It feels like things around me are changing so quickly and I have to change too, because I desperately want to grow. I look at all those Keanu Reeves posts and want to be as confident and kind as he is. I want to feel comfortable being alone and not keep longing about finding ""the one"" or any of that. I'm a romantic at heart, but I want to put myself first again. I know I suffered this long because I cared for others more than myself, which is a bad thing.

When I read advice from people older than me, they always mention how your 20s are a time for lots of growing and how things might seem like the end of the world when you're young, but they're really not. Deep down I know it's not the end of the world, but I still feel like it. I want to be a better person. I want to be a better me. I can't do that when I'm stuck like this.

So to anyone older than me on this sub: can you give me advice on moving on? On feeling independent and working towards it? Maybe even a look into the grand scheme of things? Any of your best advice for us young'uns flailing around on here.

667," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn‚Äôt look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‚Äòexcuse me....excuse me‚Äô and then asked me ‚Äòhow do you get a job in here‚Äô and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‚Äòyea we don‚Äôt know her that well‚Äô and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‚Äòawww no don‚Äôt say that‚Äô then the brunette said ‚Äòwell not weird just a bit...you know...‚Äô and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you‚Äô quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

 -My monthly bills leave me with almost nothing left. I have been managing paycheck to paycheck. I filed for bankruptcy 2 years ago and this is the repayment plan. 

3. I am 8 weeks pregnant

What happened was this: when i was young, like 6 years old or so, I really loved sleeping together with my brother so every night I would ask my parents if i could sleep in his bed. However, one night something happened. I think I was around 6 years old at the time so he must have been either 13 or 14, I'm not sure. Anyways, one night I was half asleep when I felt that my brother pulled down my underwear, and I felt that he slowly pressed his penis up against my butt. Of course this freaked me out so I ""woke up"" (I think he thought I was already asleep) and I pulled my underwear back up. He immediatly said: I'm sorry, I was just joking around, I will not do it again. Well, that was that. I don't think there was any penetration or whatever. We never talked about it again and I never really thought about it either. Like I said, our relationship is really good but lately this popped into my head and I'm just so confused by this incident. It doesn't seem like something he would do and I just don't know what to think about it. Apart from this, I don't think any other weird things ever happened so yea...Was this sexual abuse?

672,"Okay so first some simple background. 

A few months ago my sister and I got into a fight so was asking her if she was using my shampoo 

(I am the only one who has curly hair and it is really pricey to pay for it) 

She told me no I said okay (just in a annoyed voice) , for some reason my reaction wasn‚Äôt respectful and I should have respect for her cause she is 8 years older. I was that day already mad as fuck cause she was literally screaming, cursing at me for the past days. 

So out of anger I said:‚ÄùI have already lost my respect for you.‚Äù She became mad and screamed and asked me why I said that so I said that I was really irritated that day and it was a mistake (I don‚Äôt think I even apologized but still explained myself) 

She began crying and left my room, I didn‚Äôt bother  her and she began ignoring me for the past months. 

(I didn‚Äôt apologize cause I was scared of the scolding and shaming she would give me)

But now she is slowly forgiving me and today she was scolding me and said I shouldn‚Äôt say such a things to person and that she never curses(?) to me cause she loves me and she said a complete bullshit story from that day. For some reason I said:‚ÄùI lost my hope in you‚Äù. No I did not, I told her I was sorry for the ‚ÄòI have lost my respect‚Äô, yeah I know I shouldn‚Äôt say such a things but I learned from it. 

But I have NEVER said that sentence ‚ÄòI lost my hope in you‚Äô. I don‚Äôt even see myself capable of using that sentence, I became mad again and told her wtf she was talking about and became really confused and felt dumb.

(My other sister was with us that day when that shampoo fight happened and said that she was only mad about the sentence ‚ÄòI have lost my respect‚Äô)

She said that I wasn‚Äôt capable of reminding what happened that day cause she didn‚Äôt forgot anything, like I WOULD forget it. You ignored me for the past months so it is logical that I can remember my actions. But no, I am not capable but stupid and she knows what I said and even myself can not know what literally came out of my mouthüôÑ. 

She then says that she didn‚Äôt expect me to be such a person? She was literally a few minutes ago preaching me why I shouldn‚Äôt judge or say such a things to a person and then she does the SAME. She literally judged of me one action, I became quiet cause I was hurt and knew whatever I said she would just shut me off. That person then says:‚ÄùYou know that I am right that is why you are quiet.‚Äù

675,"Ok this will be a long one. 

I‚Äôll start from the beginning. I‚Äôve known CB for about 7 years at this point. We were friends in primary school but we became good friends at the beginning of high school. I am Australian so our schooling is different. Primary school goes from kindergarten to year 6 and high school goes from 7-12. 

When we started high school a bunch of people from other schools got mixed in with our own. CB met a girl named LG. They were really good friends and CB asked to go out with her. When they started dating every thing immediately went awkward. They ended up breaking up and instead just being friends. CB told me and our other friend CG that he still likes her. 

Skip ahead and it‚Äôs 2016 and we just started Yr 8. One of our friends comes out as Bi and CB tells us that we should stop hanging out with him because he is gay. Our friend group that was a little fucked up of him. It was around this time as well CB and CG both got diagnosed with depression and CG tried hanging himself. Eventually CB ended up asking LG out again but she said no. About a month later she started dating LJ who is one of my closest mates. 

Skip ahead again and CB and LJ are friends and CB tells us he doesn‚Äôt like LG anymore. It is now 2017 and we have started Yr 9. CB has started to become increasingly aggressive. For example he hit me in the shin with a shovel because I was telling him to be careful because he was flicking it around in the air and narrowly missing our heads. CG and I have hangouts where we get drunk together and play video games or watch movies and we invite CB to come along. He tells us he still likes LG and that he hates himself because he is good friends with LJ. 

Now we skip ahead again to 2018 and we are in Yr 10. CB is clearly still in love with her and CG and I have become worried because CB has been doing some creepy stuff like screen shotting her Instagram, running up and hugging her or just texting her messages about sex and stuff. It is LGs 16th birthday and she invited CB unaware he is still in love with her. CG and I are talking to CB who shows us he bought a condom along because he is going to try and sleep with LG tonight. Keep in mind LG and LJ are still dating. CG at the time is dating a girl, EH. 
Now I‚Äôm not normally one to judge but she is a psycho bitch. 
CG tells EH about this. CG and EH then get into a fight. CG does not like EH but she tells him if they break up she will kill herself. I‚Äôm not usually one to throw around the term attention seeker but that is entirely what EH is. They end up getting drunk and making out. 

Skip ahead and it is the end of the year. Our Yr 10 formal approaches. CB doesn‚Äôt have a date. CG is going with EH. LG and LJ are still dating. CB tells CG that he tried to kill himself because he is in love with LG. LJ at this point thinks that CB likes LG. I try to assure him it‚Äôs ok. Everything goes tits up. 
LJ and LG start fighting because LJ doesn‚Äôt want her hanging out with CB. She says they are only friends and CB doesn‚Äôt like her but LJ doesn‚Äôt believe that. 
CG and EH break up and in a fit of pure jealousy and rage tells LG everything about CB. Afterwards she said it was to get everything off her chest before she killed herself. 
LJ is pissed and goes to find CB who approaches LJ and gives him a handshake saying he can‚Äôt help his emotions. LJ is fucking livid. At this point LG goes to ask CB if it‚Äôs true and CB comes over to me CG and a few other friend and tells us that she said she feels the same way. We later found out...

That was a lie. 

That‚Äôs what hurt the most really. That he would lie. In an attempt to manipulate everyone to get what he wanted. Let‚Äôs keep going with the story. 
LJ and LG stay together. No one talks to CB and he drops out of school. LJ also drops out of school to do concreting full time. EH also stops going to school as her mental health can‚Äôt handle it. 
One day LJ texts me saying he has a recording of CB on a bus going to TAFE talking about LG. I see a video of CB on Instagram telling a girl that he slept with LG the whole time that LJ and LG were dating. Keep in my mind... CB is the embodiment of a virgin. LJ is pissed and goes to his house. CB isn‚Äôt there but his mum is and tells her that CB said he was sleeping with LG. CB‚Äôs Mum tells LJ that he is a piece of shit and to get off her lawn. It wasn‚Äôt until later on that I found out she was also telling people that LG and CB were sleeping together. 
I know this isn‚Äôt true. 
Skip ahead to yesterday and I am at work and I work with CB‚Äôs mum and she is talking to my boss who is gay that CB came out as gay to her. 

Now a lot of emotions are going through my head. Why would CB then create this big drama if he was gay? Would he really stir so much shit just to hide his own sexuality? I‚Äôm pissed off. I really want to talk to him because I have just been ignoring him since the formal but I‚Äôm scared that it will end in a fight. CG is the most hurt. He bonded with CB over mental health and recently he found out CB doesn‚Äôt actually go to a therapist like he said he did to CG. He never almost died after trying to commit suicide like he said he did to CG. 

I am really pissed and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

My last relationship was 5 or so years ago, it was not a healthy relationship at all. It ended with me just being insulted daily, cheated on etc which I had to find out about and being led on for a while. I ended up just literally having no confidence in myself and hating myself. I resorted to becoming a hermit and just gaming all the time and I guess I‚Äôve just always been in that cycle.

I‚Äôve had the odd thing with someone but as soon as I get close to them I panic and push them away, I don‚Äôt want someone to get close because I hate the thought of everything happening again, It‚Äôs a low I never want to be at, I used to sit in my room cutting myself because I found it was the only way to forget about things as weirdly messed up that sounds. 

This has been happening since the relationship ended, the cycle just repeats and I shut everyone out. 

Then maybe a year or so ago I matched with someone on tinder, as clich√© as it sounds I was amazed by her instantly even though we were just talking over text. We spoke off and on for a while until we decided to meet and holy shit I found her absolutely perfect, literally everything about her and I cannot get her out of my head. We stopped talking for a little bit again as she had some stuff going on but I just constantly wanted to spend more time with her.

Which brings me to the past few months, we‚Äôve been seeing each other and dating, I‚Äôm still absolutely crazy about her and I feel it more everytime I see her but I‚Äôm reaching that stage where I just panic and start pushing her away, I feel like I already have done.

I get maybe 4 hours of sleep a night, I don‚Äôt eat, my chest is pounding constantly, some nights I‚Äôm having panic attacks because I‚Äôm just terrified that the closer I get to her the more fucked I‚Äôm going to be when I get messed around again. I hate myself, I don‚Äôt feel good enough for her and i know worrying/confidence annoys her...

I‚Äôm pushing her away and I don‚Äôt know what to do.. help? Any questions please just ask, I‚Äôve missed details out because it‚Äôs a long ass post sorry",14Jun2019,1

682,"My wife is driving with our two kids from Texas to Washington and back. Both cars are Toyotas, so they're reliable as far as I can tell.

However, the SUV is a 2006, has 150,000~ miles on it and gets 18~ MPG. It would definitely need to get checked out and have some repairs done first.

The sedan is a 2017, has 40,000~ miles on it and gets 30 MPG. Oil change and everything else is good to go.

SUV pros:

* More space.

* Safer in the event of a collision.

Corolla pros:

* Much newer vehicle with less mileage on it.

* Better MPG/cheaper.

* Potentially more reliable due to age

* Already good to go mechanically.

Just a direct one-way trip is 2,300 miles. They'll be there for two months and will be driving around a lot while there as well. The extra space in the SUV would be nice, but at a much more expensive cost and I'm uneasy about them going on such a long trip without me in an older vehicle with so many miles on it.

683,"I'm 18, and 3 days ago I started my first real job at Customer Service for a bank. First three days and a half went really smoothly, I had some doubts but always someone to help me out. But this afternoon has been a terrible mess and I think I might be in trouble, and I am terrified.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I work from 10am to 6pm every day (not weekends), and from 4pm to 6pm there are only two more girls at the office. Well, it so happened that the two hardest operations I have had to manage so far were at 5pm, and one followed by the other. I was very confused as to how to do the operations, and both girls were busy getting calls, so they could barely help me. I started getting anxious, because yesterday my team leader yelled at a girl because a call lasted 18 minutes (they shouldn't last more than 10). Well, both of my calls ended up lasting longer than 20 minutes. And they were literally minutes apart. To make matters even worse, I don't even think I did them properly because I had little to no help. The second client asked for an important document's copy and turns out they still haven't enabled that option on my computer yet (I didn't know), so after he hunged up I realized it hadn't been saved on my computer because I simply couldn't. Both girls told me not to worry, but of course I am. We are in charge of very delicate information, and pressing the wrong number can mean ruining a client.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so terribly scared of being publicly humiliated due to social anxiety, and I know the team leader is going to scream at me when I go back on Monday. I want Earth to swallow me whole. Have any of you ever been in a similar situation? And if so, how did you face the terror of showing up to work next day? It's Friday and I should finally be relaxing, but nope.",14Jun2019,1

If I see a pregnant woman, I feel like I'm going to gag and pass out. Seeing a baby kick inside of a pregnant stomach makes me break out in a cold sweat. Even the sight of a pregnant stomach makes me feel dizzy. 

I have an unhealthy fear of getting pregnant myself. I cried for hours, had panic attacks, and spent days imagining scenarios in my head of how to abort after the first time I had sex (and the only time so far because I'm that freaked out about it).

When I ask myself what I would do if I became pregnant, my immediate thought is ""I would kill myself."" Not even an abortion. I'd be so horrified of being pregnant that living, even for a few weeks until an abortion, would be too unbearable. I think about this every day. Pregnancy is all around me, too. I see pregnant women, babies, and the media focusing around sex.

691,"I was recently promoted but had to move 4 hours away from my partner for it. I only really took the job because my partner and I are planning on moving to the place at the end of the year so I figured I would jump the gun and get a good job there.
The problem is that I'm hating my promotion. It's super stressful and my mind doesn't ever slow down from it. I spoke to my boss and explained my concerns and he said it would only be for another 2 months then he and I would be moving into another division of the business that's less stressful. The company is kind of dodgy though and upper management will try and force people to quit that they don't like or just want to get rid of the position (that's how the job I'm in now came about). I honestly don't know whether I will still have a job in 2 months when we move divisions with how they treat employees.
The company shut down the place they moved me from, and only gave the workers 2 hours notice. Not exactly ethical. I was pissed obviously that they would do it like that.

I was offered a job back where my partner is, but I could only work there until December before we moved. It's doing something that I love though and I know the boss personally and he runs the business really well and looks after his employees. Finding a similar job where where I am now and partner is moving to would be super hard/next to impossible.

What I'm saying is that I don't know whether to stick out where I am to get experience or move to a job I love doing but it would only be for short term then I would have to find work where we're moving to?

694,"Two months ago we got new neighbors, a black woman, her 5 children, and her white bf. Pretty early on we began to hear them fighting, he drops the N word almost constantly and it soon became clear he was physically hurting her as well. She told me that during one of the arguments he choked her until she passed out, he's punched her in her chest. He's broken their back door, their side door, smashed windows in her car. Cops have been called but he gaslights her, plays the victim to them. I don't think she has told them he hurts her, they just respond to the yelling. I've tried to listen when she is up to talk. I've encouraged her to seek help, connected her to the local domestic violence shelter. I've taken to video taping when their arguments get particularly volatile, hoping I'll get something actionable on tape but so far I haven'tcaught the physicaldamage.  She's clearly not ready to leave. I don't know that we have enough evidence to get the children removed. I don't want them separated from their mother but I'm afraid and I'm not in the house with this shit. My heart breaks for them. But I don't know how much I can do for them beyond keeping communication ooen with their mother and watching for something concrete to give to the authorities. Any ideas on what I can do would be appreciated. 

So now the selfish part: our houses are about 12 feet a part separated by a shared driveway that opens up behind our homes where our garages are. Our backyards run alongside each other with a small wire fence as the barrier. I have two small children. The kids all get along, they're right around my kids' ages and so sweet. The setup makes it almost communal space. But I don't want this man near my kids. My son has heard some of the arguments and he is afraid as well. 
We have told him the bf is not safe and to come straight to is if he is outside, not that we're letting him out in the backyard by himself anymore. 
We wanted to move before this but had a 5 yr plan to get repairs made on the house but have had setbacks already.  And now this. How do I protect my family? How do I make my son feel safe and happy? How do I not feel like a prisoner in my home?",14Jun2019,1

For MDW I asked her to go to the beach and at first she as like I have to catch up on things for school (this was the day before the first day of summer classes). I looked at her kinda funny since eI'm in the same program and there is never assignments due on the first day regardless. C goes- oh wait it's the first day, never mind I was thinking of something else. Which was extremely strange to me but I never mentioned it. We went to the beach together and she told me she wants to go every other week but isn't good with making plans. I thought it was strange since she's out at least a couple times a week.

I invited her out to the city last week and we had a good time, saw her mom a few days after and she told me that). While we were in the city I told her that next time she has to text me since I always ask her first and C said she's ""always home and never goes out"" which is avoiding the question and not true. 

We were going home from the city and this fake acquaintance I've known for years who always asks me to go out then cancels, messaged me. I told C how the acquaintance gives me a hard time and that I never invite her out but if I have absolutely nothing to do, I'll accept and grab food or something. So C says ""you basically don't go out of your way to see her"" and it was then I realized that C knows she never goes out of her way to see me. We would see each other at least once a week regardless because we volunteer together. 

C is a bit insecure because she had a liposuction surgery a few years back...she wears fake eye-lashes and hair extensions every single day so I can't tell if she really is shy or enjoys the ego boost of being asked to go out. I don't know what to make of this; even if she is shy, why can't she message me since she knows I will say yes. C also doesn't work and goes to the same part-time grad school program as myself.

704,"I gave a general explanation to my bf which will be the tldr but

In the past year, I put down my dog, about 8 months later (which was last December) my great grandma died and I did not get the chance to say goodbye or even attend her memorial. And yesterday, we put down my other dog. I also broke up with my long term boyfriend at the time about a month after we put down the first dog. About a week ago, I realized that my best friend doesn't value our friendship and chose someone awful over me, my boyfriend has an ""I told you so"" stance on it. Now I only have my current boyfriend or I guess I should say ""boyfriend"" and there are a lot of issues with him too.

Any way, the other night we were having sex and even though I had my period for about 10 days at this point and I even checked before we had sex, I bled on him. He seemed grossed out and frustrated. It was the last straw, he went to take a shower and I just left without saying goodbye. This was the night before we put my dog down. So I left and had a mental breakdown in my car, called a suicide hotline and decided that I was going to break up with him and take all my stuff while he was sleeping. This was the stupid thing. I woke him up a few times moving shit and he didn't know what I was doing until the following morning. I ended up calling the hotline a second time because I felt like I was going to hurt myself and then I decided to chill out and I went to sleep.

I'm fairly confident what I experienced was mania (this was not the first time I have done things like this when my anxiety spirals out of control). I have spoken to a doctor about it and he said it seemed like bipolar depression but I had not explored it beyond that. I feel like he thinks I'm unstable now and I'm very embarrassed. He also seems to think that I should use weed more frequently to chill out and to get over how paranoid it makes me when I'm upset and become like him with weed (everyday, multiple times a day user).

Tldr; got close to killing/cutting myself, tried to move out of my boyfriend's without telling him and I explained to him that I was on the verge of killing myself and that my anxiety/mania makes me do crazy things and it happened because I had been managing my emotions very poorly because of 2 pets and someone I loved dearly passed away consecutively.

705,"So I have a very specific pathway I have for my life and this pathway has a lot of possible situations and I just thought up this one.

For some background: 

I am a high school student in the United States. I have for a very long time wanted to study abroad in Germany for university. I will soon be going through training to become a CNA. 

My plan is:

Drop out of high school and get my GED. For the next couple years I‚Äôd be taking useful classes at community colleges and also spend more time focusing on the things i need to learn for success. These include the German language and others I learn for fun, technical skills for my personal career pathway and other essential life skills.

Once I‚Äôm ready I‚Äôd like to apply for a university in Germany and because I‚Äôll be out of school I‚Äôd have a lot more to work and save up money as a CNA. 

Socially, I have a good bit of friends at school and can still do sports at my school because they are really nice and let kids do that.

And finally, a lot of you would probably say my parents might not like the idea of this but that isn‚Äôt a concern. If I can present good reasons for why this would be good for my future my father would let me.

On my first day I did a 4 hour trial and the first warning was when I was called in to the boss‚Äô office (reported by my 2 managers who I work alongside with) who then asked me if I liked it. When I said I‚Äôd stay he basically tried to subtly tell me to be more productive and work faster. He didn‚Äôt directly say to work faster but the way he kept elaborating it over and over in lighter terms made it seem like he wanted to be friendly since it was my first day.

Well, today it‚Äôs been a week and he said the same things and how I should try to communicate with my managers better so I can work faster, and to ask questions a lot if I don‚Äôt understand the instructions given to me. 

I feel like I‚Äôm going to get fired anyway since my managers have to explain things to me several times to the point where I‚Äôll frustrate them and if I don‚Äôt show signs of improvement next week I‚Äôm most likely going to be let go.

713,"Hi

I work as a social media manager, that means I work almost 24/7 a day

I have separated phones &amp; laptops, which I bring home because that‚Äôs in my work description 

The thing is not the work, it‚Äôs me, I can‚Äôt enjoy it. I have been dreaming about it for a long time but now I find it very stressful to the level of crying in front of my coworkers +3 times in one week!

My job is easy, just take the approval of the client before posting
We have a visuals team and graphics team
I was late to deliver something to one of my clients because the visual team were late to handle the photos to me, therefore the graphics were late to deliver the designs to me

What happened is that I sent the designs to the client on the last day of the work week and he declined it!! Now we didn‚Äôt post anything on his account for a week because of the mess mentioned above 

What made things worse is the absent of the team leaders

There were no one to ask, I asked my coworker and she helped me a little and then we delivered it to him and he said no, it was the end of the day and everyone was leaving 

Why the situation is bad? Because we have a meeting with him on first day of the week which is Sunday 

Now I‚Äôm so anxious and I feel sick, the lateness was from our side because we only have 3 photographers and there‚Äôs so much stress on them, also the graphics team are very small, they‚Äôre only 4 and we have 30+ clients

And I don‚Äôt know how to explain this to the client on Sunday üíî

The team leaders are 2, one of them was on her annual holiday and the other was sick but she said that she‚Äôs available anytime but closed her phone!!

I told ALL that to one of my coworker -the one who helped fix something and he declined it again- and she said it‚Äôs not my fault, that‚Äôs management problems, they know we need more photographers and graphic designers and they didn‚Äôt hire anyone 

But I feel guilty! I don‚Äôt know why, I did my part but yet I worry about other people‚Äôs jobs because I‚Äôm the one in the front. I‚Äôm the one who will get all the yelling on Sunday

I don‚Äôt know how to handle this, I want to escape and cry all the time. I don‚Äôt want to go to that meeting 
And I don‚Äôt know what to do, I have been here for almost 4 months and it‚Äôs ridiculous to break down on every issue I face in the work place

Also I feel like this job has taken all over my daily routine even if 90% of the time at home I‚Äôm not working, but it‚Äôs stressful to expect a phone call at any minute! You know when you‚Äôre at a pool and you try to move? You know how slow you are? You know how your brain feels underwater? 
That‚Äôs how I feel except I‚Äôm on land

I don‚Äôt have any friends, that‚Äôs why I came here

The job is amazing, my coworker are helpful and ready to answer any questions, and the team leaders are like superheroes. They can solve anything for me

I‚Äôm not sure about the management because I have one of my clients earlier -maybe 2 months ago- walking in and yelling at us and threatening us to bad mouth our names-mine and the team-
And they didn‚Äôt do anything about him!
I didn‚Äôt want to go to them and tell them I don‚Äôt want to handle him because I didn‚Äôt want to be that person, the one where he says ‚Äúno‚Äù to work in his first month

I was under so much stress, and still am

My coworkers are happy, they look alive and healthy and well and clearly they have a life outside of the job

I don‚Äôt, I only have this job and that‚Äôs why I take it TOO seriously, because it‚Äôs the only thing I have

What I want is to find solutions for the following:

- how can worry less? Because I know there‚Äôs nothing as 0% worry free, my coworker said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, the team leaders will be back on Sunday and we‚Äôll fix everything up‚Äù but I CAN‚ÄôT STOP WORRYING!

- how can I have my life back? Given the fact that I must have the work‚Äôs phone &amp; laptop with me. How can I have a routine? Sometimes I take my lunch with me to work and I forget about it because of the so much work I have


- I know the clients don‚Äôt know about the pressure we face at work, the worrying and the tears and anxiety I have at this job, I know they don‚Äôt appreciate it. But still, how can stop clients‚Äô comments getting into me and affecting me? Because that client we met in the first month of my job gave a shock! He was very scary and terrifying, and the threats were horrible, I wanted to talk the management about this but as I said I was scared, I didn‚Äôt want to be that person who refuse to do work in the first month of the job.
We met with him earlier this week and I told the HR that I don‚Äôt want to handle him and they said we need to wait for the team leaders. So that‚Äôs good I guess, 
How can I stop worrying about work to the point I don‚Äôt sleep/eat? 

- how can I handle stress without crying? I see people don‚Äôt give a single f about their jobs and they suck at it and sometimes they don‚Äôt do their jobs, and yet they‚Äôre fine with that! How can they do that? I don‚Äôt want to be like them I just want to be care-free like them",14Jun2019,1

So a few months ago I started my current job. I love the atmosphere and don‚Äôt mind the work and the pay is the best I‚Äôve had. (Used to do just temp manufacturers positions.)

When I asked why he was doing this he said he was biting himself because he was thinking ‚Äúviolent thoughts‚Äù and was trying to get them to stop. He refused to elaborate on what exactly these thoughts were.

722,"I am a manager of a team of 13 (middle management as have three seniors above me). I'm pretty fair and flexible but I expect everyone to do their bit as if one doesn't, everyone else has to pick up the slack. Feedback from my team (anonymous staff surveys) about my management style is generally positive and I am quick to deal with any problems when I'm made aware of them. 

One person in the team doesn't like me - that's okay in itself, but she's taken to eye rolling/sniggering/tutting when I speak. We have vastly different approaches to policy decisions, which, again is okay as I like a bit of critical thinking, but her reactions are unprofessional and undermining, and I can't allow it to continue unchecked. She also leaves things to the last minute and seems generally unperturbed by deadlines - I have to nudge her to get her to do things, which I shouldn't have to. 

This is her first job since college, so I'm willing to give her a chance to stop being a wanker and do her job. I've handled and deflected criticisms of her work from the higher-ups, and, honestly, right now, I'm not sure I‚Äôd do that again. 

If you've had a similar situation or any experience of how best to manage this co worker, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. My plan is to ask her why she's behaving this unprofessionally during our next (joyous) 1-1, but I think she‚Äôll deny it as there's nothing tangible about an eye roll.

About a week later, I get a call from the guy who did my first hand option that there was room for an additional studen and asked me if I was interested in joined, but since I already had ''made friends'' with the class and thought that the program I was something I would love and have fun with, I declined his offer. (mistake)

Time jump 3 years, I just graduated in a program I lost interest in about 1 year ago, and I only chose to finish it in order to get a degree in something. The class I was in pretty much halved because they got bored with the program, while the other half of the class were just ''the guys and girls you know from school'' kind of friends. So no contact outside of school was really made. 

And now I'm in this position where I have no real interest in doing anything than just sitting on my ass at the computer, and sleeping all day. I have bare minimum contact with my family (say hey to them when they come home, eat dinner, say goodnight), and I have no contact with my school friends.

Jill has just asked me if I would like to have another child, and after a few hours of serious consideration and a couple neat whiskys, my thoughts are that to have another baby is not the best idea (Jill has had some pelvic complications over the last 2 pregnancies, and has been advised not to have anorher) althoigh we are in a very good head space and financial space just now.

I am moving into an apartment with two of my friends in 2 weeks. One of the old tenants is leaving about 5 pieces of furniture for my two roommates, but none of it will be mine.

My issue is that all of the furniture that is being left behind is from one person, who currently occupies the room that will be mine. All of the furniture for my roommates is being stored in my future room, meaning that when the cleaning crew that the landlord has hired to come between tenants shows up, they most likely won't be able to clean my room, because of all the furniture inside it. The apartment is in a city in New England, and the rooms aren't super big to begin with, so these 5 pieces of furniture take up a lot of real estate in my room. It's not like they would be able to clean most of the room and just avoid the furniture.

There's also the issue of, what if they leave other things they don't want to get rid of, or trash, and they just tell the landlord that we asked them to leave it?

I recently managed to get a local job, but it's blue collar and pretty low-paying, as are a strong majority of the job openings around here.

I have major concerns about being trapped in this area. I have white collar skills that are in much greater demand in the surrounding cities. However, I don't own a car and public transit options are almost nonexistent (even if I had transportation, my parents are pretty unenthusiastic about the idea of me commuting far, which I disagree with, but I digress). With the looming threat of student loan payments, I'm honestly not even sure how I'm going to afford moving out of my parents' house, let alone move completely out of town.

736,"I also posted this to/legaladvice but here as well because I haven‚Äôt gotten any reads or response yet. 

Hi all, I‚Äôm a student having leased at an apartment complex in Arizona. This was my first apartment and I blindly moved in not checking the horrible reviews they had, after being recommended by my college to go to this apartment next to campus. The Management is very unprofessional, rude, insulting, and shady. They have switched companies a few times since I have started living here, but keep many of the same staff. 

Since living here they have moved me multiple times and waived the transfer fee to every unit with whatever excuse they have for moving me in the first place within the complex. They violate 16 of the 18 Arizona renters laws, and have personally caused me so much emotional and financial damage. 

At one point they knowingly moved me into a unit with tenants that were aggressive, slobs with cat/piss/shit/dogs/roaches/mold/broken appliances, and I had to advocate and involve the police in order for me to live elsewhere in the complex as they won‚Äôt let me break lease for less than $2,000. 

A list of things they‚Äôve done apart from that: 

Charge me $25 extra on my security deposit when I moved in and I didn‚Äôt realize until now and have the bank statement to prove it. On record they have the $25 extra not there, and the flat amount they charge everyone.

They later claimed that I never paid for my security deposit and made me bring my statement in as proof. 

Literally a month after the deposit issue was resolved they email me again saying that they audited my deposit to me and credited it for rent when I switched units, and then say that I owe them another full deposit amount because of this audit but it could be a system error that they look into over the weekend for me. 

Tell me replacement keys are 7X the amount they tell other residents. (Confirmed by other students who rent here as well) 

Threaten to evict me when they found a piece of my mail outside the trash when an animal broke into the trash. 

Place eviction notice on my door when I dried a towel on my balcony once. 

Cut the shuttle service to the school which I mainly signed with this place for during finals weeks, resulting in hundreds to Lyft. 

As stated earlier willingly/knowingly moved me into the health hazard unit, and then try to charge me for the animals that my ex random roommates had as well as the damages to the apartment unit itself. 

Lie about unit availability, rates, and roommate matching. 

Are extremely rude anytime I‚Äôm in the office, on the phone, or anything despite me being really polite and courteous to them. 

Important Note: 
As hard as it is to believe I HONESTLY know they are discriminatory as well, they cater to their own ethnicity and to people explicitly from the same town as them. They cheat other races like myself, and especially target International Students. 

What can or should I do? This has tanked my GPA which I had to build back up, given me renting PTSD, anxiety and panic attacks, and immense stress, as well as emotional damages. I feel so lost, confused, and powerless about this entire situation. 

My lease ends this year and I have signed with a better apartment and will be giving a legal, email and printed copy of my 60 day in advance notice of relinquishing the premises because they changed their policy about moving out: without the 60+ day notice they will continue to charge you for rent and utilities.

737,hey i live in georgia and really messed up my life. i just graduated high school and was making college plans and getting ready for life. i‚Äôm 18 and i went to a friends house Tuesday and took some Xanax (1 and half bar) and it wasn‚Äôt my first time. anyways i blacked out and woke up two days later in my bed and had no idea what happened. apparently i decided to drive and was speeding and swerving so bad that multiple people called me in to the police. i crashed and got arrested. i remember none of this and would‚Äôve never gotten behind the wheel if i was conscious. My record was clean prior to this. i have a misdemeanor DUI charge and another for failing to maintain lanes. i got a court date set for later in the year.  i feel like i ruined my life and my future. what should i do to get my life back on track? Anything helps.,14Jun2019,2
738,"Hello. I'm starting university in october (law), but I'm yet to decide where.

I'm from Italy, staying in your hometown for university is the norm here. The thing is, I've always hated my hometown for a number of reasons.

Now, with university I could have the chance to start over somewhere else, but something's not making this decision an easy one for me: I know that moving to a different city would put a strain on my family's economy. We're not poor, but it still wouldn't be a joke for my parents. I'm afraid I'd feel like depending too much on them.

So what do I do: do I spend 5 more years (at least) in a place I loathe but more easily on my family, or do I do something for my own sake like going away, no matter what?",14Jun2019,1
