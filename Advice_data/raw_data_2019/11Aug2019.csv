0,"I was in an abusive relationship that I dated in for way too long just because I was 18, wanted to have sex, and was so dumbfounded that a guy liked me back. It ended really poorly and several months later I found out he attempted to cheat on me more than 4 times. As you can imagine I have a lot of trust and commitment issues.

Fast forward 2 years to now. There’s this one guy I’ve been hitting it off with a little bit and I think I’m attracted to him, but he has a few personality traits that I don’t like (he pops Adderall and Xanax every once in a while) so I don’t know that I’d want to date him.

My intuition tells me that I shouldn’t pursue it because sex always changes relationships and he’s a nice guy that I get along with and I don’t want to ruin that. So I don’t think I’ll go for it and now I’m restless again and want so desperately to have a relationship where I can finally have something healthy.

My intuition is also telling me that I can’t force love and I can’t chase after it because it’s inorganic. So reddit, what do I do?",11Aug2019,2

3,"Throwaway. Yay!

I don't know my dad. My fam refuses to help because he's a bad person and they're ""protecting me."" Curiosity has gotten the best of me. I just want to see the person whose DNA contributed to mine in the flesh. Idk if I'm an asshole, but that's a story for another day.

All I know is his name, which is super common and not helpful, his nickname - not too helpful either, that he's Cuban but was raised in Puerto Rico and that he worked as a director of a national cemetery with the VA a bit before I was born. And, of course, that he was married to my mom briefly. I was the result of a fling between Mom and him after they divorced, but I don't even know that he knows I exist. Quite frankly, I don't want a relationship with the guy. I just want to satisfy a curiosity that has been growing more quickly as of late. It's hard to explain.

Anyhow. I've tried searching for him on Facebook. I've tried googling his name with his occupation. I have no clue where to go from here and I don't even know what he looks like to attempt to scroll through hundreds of pages of Google images. Any suggestions?",11Aug2019,1
5,"Hello! I earned my Masters in English with a focus on creative writing earlier this year. Since then, I’ve been applying for clerical/administrative jobs, but since I have no experience, I haven’t gotten any calls back. I’m a little disappointed since I believe I have all the necessary skills to work well in the position (I can type nearly 70 words per minute, I have several years of customer service experience, I’m organized, I work well independently and as part of a team, I’m comfortable answering calls, etc).

I got my degree with a focus on creative writing because writing is my passion. However, for the time being, it’s just a hobby. I’m currently working on a book of stories and I want to find a full-time job that will support myself and my creative endeavors. 

I’ve considered applying for something like a emergency call taker, but seeing as I can’t even seem to get a clerical position, I don’t know how realistic that would be. I recently got letters of recommendation from former professors and I have three good references on my resume. What other kinds of jobs could I apply for? I’m not even sure what I want to do.

6,"Sorry this is hella long I just wanted to give every detail

So there's this girl I like and we've known each other for a long time but never really talked much and our families are really close. I just started liking her like 3 weeks ago and started a streak with her. (As a joke) me and a couple of my friends found out how to change our snap maps location and we set them to area 51😂. She doesn't have any of them added and so it looked like I was there only for her. Our families are close enough for her to tell her mom I was there and her mom texted mine it was fine just funny so I messaged her ""your mom thought I was actually at area 51"" or something like that. She responded saying lol and stuff and that was pretty much it which raised the question to me how tf did she see that we live in nh and area 51 is in Nevada. could have just been zoomed out but whatever.

 Anyways the next time we talked was when she randomly said why do you never said full face pics for streaks. I said idk no point and she said yeah there is and I said what then she said ""idk😂😂"" and then we had a pretty short conversation (I just don't bother sending full face I do now that she said that tho.

How should I try to start a conversation now though doesn't post that much on story so I can't message through that. And I'm not 100% if she likes me so idk",11Aug2019,1

I went into work today, they got mad at me because they said I was scheduled for 6am, but thankfully another manager stood up for me. She said ""Of course she didn't show up, she's only able to work nights"" so they let me off. Fast forward to later, the same manager got mad at me because I didn't tell her there was a line, but I wasn't able to tell her because I'm bagging orders for customers and listening to them to make sure I don't screw up how they want it. After that, she walks away with a coworker and tells me that I need to make sure I'm taking customers and bagging, too. At that time, I was told by another manager to dust off some fridges since they ""looked gross."" I didn't say anything and I just went to go ring someone up and I'll admit I had an attitude, and I was so stupid. They've been treating me like shit since day one and I just got sick of it. So I snapped and told her that she's sitting here walking around and talking to her friends like we don't all have work to do, and I'm not here to remind her to do a job she gets paid to do. After that, she told me she doesn't need my attitude and that I can clock out.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

I just spent twenty minutes typing out a long post about how I can't find a hobby to sink my time into. After I actually typed out my brief history and list of interests, about a dozen fun ideas popped into my head for hobbies I can try out.

So I'm going to try rock climbing (indoor and outdoor), hiking, camping, graffiti/art, basketball, woodworking, and get back into learning piano.

So I don't actually need any advice, I guess... but thanks for being there for me when I needed you.

14,"Hey. Not a parent but a child. I'm 17, a senior in high school. Basically I am super upset by the parents I have. They are super narcissistic and cant ever apologize for any reason. They yell at me for little to no reason, get angry at stuff I dont do, they have unrealistic expectations of me (like being able to know what they expect in every situation), they interrogate me about every little thing, and threaten me (not life or death) but stuff like kicking me out and calling the cops when I dont even do anything. They never really are there for me emotionally when I need. I'm well off physically, I have a good house, have a good amount of possessions, and live in a decent area, but I really dont care about that if i dont have decent emotional support. Anytime I confront them about this, they try to make me feel guilty and will change their whole demeanor when I'm with people. It feels like a constant weight or shadow is hanging over me and I really dont feel like doing anything I like. I really dont even much friends at this point so it's not like I have someone to run to.

17,"Sat in bed crying my eyes out. Two years ago I had a boyfriend I was head over heels with ( I was 24 ). It was my first boyfriend and I was like a puppy always after his attention/love. I have always been someone who believes in sex after marriage but for some reason I was obsessed with this dude ( maybe because he was my first boyfriend and the first guy to give me the  time of day ). One night we got really drunk and had sex. It just happened so fast. I used to get drunk quite often throughout my early twenties and had a bunch of opportunities to have sex but I’m not usually that stupid while drunk. So now fast forward two years and everyday I wake up thinking about it and I literally tear up. I keep thinking how stupid I could be to lose my virginity drunk and I just feel sooooo bad about the whole thing.

We have sex and it’s so loving &amp; caring and although I’m still new to it I wish he was my first. It hurts me so much and I don’t know how to say it to my current boyfriend.

18,"Hi. I just need to clear my mind, I guess, and also seek advice. 

This probably seems illogical to even seek advice on, but maybe some may understand my conflicting feelings.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

I am a 22 year old female with type 2 bipolar disorder. I was not properly medicated until July 2018, and only now have reached healthiness in my mindset and lifestyle. I was bullied all throughout my school years, molested by my dad, and overall never had any friends. I felt pretty much isolated my entire life until I met my boyfriend, now fiance, who literally seems to be the only one who truly gets me (which is why I'm marrying him among other reasons! :) ).

This all being said, I've never understood how boundaries in friendships, and friendship dynamics, should look like. I'm also overly empathetic, which has resulted in me being a doormat in many different relationships. 

In 2015, I met my fiance's college friends, all guys. I connected with each one and truly felt loved and accepted, and so excited to have real friends **for the first time in my life.** However, I connected very quickly and deeply with one of them in particular, who will now be referred to as M.

M and I became fast friends, and actually proclaimed each other as siblings. I looked up to him in particular as a big brother figure, something I had wanted for years. In the midst of my parents' fights and ugly divorce (I was six), I prayed for a big brother to protect me. It was just me and my little sister, who was too young at the time to be as effected emotionally as I was. I considered killing myself when I was 9, and my dad molested me at 13. I wanted male protection, I guess because my dad obviously did not protect me. 

Thus, M became my go-to, besides my fiance. But...it developed. I will state very clearly: I never once viewed M romantically. However, I think he did towards me, but not in healthy ways.

I did not find out until much later that, like my dad, M had a severe porn addiction and viewed women in...very objectifying manners. I was horrified when I found this out, which was about 2, almost 3, years into our friendship. Up until that point, M had been very handsy, but I saw it as protectiveness and loved it. He tickled me, kissed my cheek, hugged a lot, and sometimes held my hand (again, I was unmedicated and suffered extreme depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. Physical touch meant the world to me). 

I actually became M's accountability person for his porn addiction, which in hindsight, was a mistake. I begged him to tell his mom so she could keep him accountable, but he wouldn't. He wanted me to be the one. In exchange, he said he would help me through my depression and suicidal thoughts, which he never once did. In fact, I almost killed myself onc because he refused to respond when I told him I felt suicidal, and I felt like because he didn't seem to care, no one did. I put way too much worth into the relationship, I guess because I thought if my big brother figure didn't care, why did anything matter? I know, such a horrible and dangerous way of thinking. But again, I did not realize until now that I was being manipulated. 

I always felt M was full of himself and whatnot, but wanted to look past all his flaws. I viewed him as perfect, and told him so. In return, he said he loved me, but if a disagreement occurred, the blame would go back on me, and he told me my feelings were irrational and petty, because I was unmedicated. Because I already struggled with self-worth, I took this from him as truth. 

So our friendship went on...until this past April.

I caught him in another lie, which was the umpteenth time, and he also made a move on me while we were alone at his house. 

It started as innocent tickling, but then he grabbed me and pulled me on the floor. I got scared, got up, and asked him to stop. He didn't, kept insisting it was okay. I was firm and repeated in telling him to stop, but he wouldn't. Thankfully, his dad walked in, and M literally lept away from me like I was on fire.  

Thus, I called him out on the lie and for that move on me the next day over text, and he blew up at me. I cut him off and blocked his number and him on social media after calmly saying my peace. This, unfortunately, caused a different friendship to be ended (his girlfriend, who I introduced him to and her to him), and his mom and aunt removed me off Facebook over 2 months after the incident. His mom was a mentor to me, and it broke my heart she never reached out to me. 

Anyway, it's been well over 3 months since the ending of the friendship, April 14th to today. 

But every day, I experience heartache. At first, it was easy to be motivated by anger and feeling free from his manipulation and narcissism, but now...I just ache. I keep replaying the events, wishing I could have changed some things - I'm more than willing to admit that I made mistakes. 

I miss him. I do. I struggle every day wondering if that is good or bad, me still being manipulated or me genuinely caring about him. 

Thankfully, he moved away, which I knew he had wanted to do for years. He is now in a completely different state, which helps with the pain and anxiety of seeing him again.

I've had vivid dreams of him and his mom for weeks now, seeing them again, being able to explain my side. One dream was his mom actually reaching out to me, meeting up with me, and letting me explain what happened. She understood, but told me I couldn't come back into their lives, but told me she still loved me. I woke up crying. 

I had another vivid dream last night, and I wake up feeling empty. 

I want to write him a letter, just saying I miss him and I'm happy he got the job he wanted and moved to where he wanted. I want him to know I don't hate him, and miss him. That's it. I, however, will not write an apology, because I really do not have anything to apologize for, and due to our previous fights, I know that if I apologize, he will think he won and was never wrong. This is another behavior my fiance and I noticed over the 4+ years he was in my life. He could never be wrong, or apologize. He would say sorry, but never elaborate, and would still point the finger back at me.

Anyway...that's it, I guess. My fiance never got mad at me over the friendship I had with M. He was forgiving and has helped me through the pain. M and my fiance were friends before I even came into the picture, and M even told my fiance early on that he would never try to steal me away from my fiance, and there was nothing more than big brother and little sister. Additionally, the three of us shared a strong bond and did almost everything together for 3 years. M began dwindling in his friendship with my fiance near the end, really only talking to and hanging out with me (the hangouts due to my fiance's work schedule). I would go up every Sunday, ride horses with M's mom, and hang out with M and his family. It was a ritual that was relaxing and freeing for me - M's mom loved riding with me. That's another reason it broke my heart she never even reached out to me. I have no idea what she believes or thinks. All I know is that she probably questioned why I no longer was coming on Sundays, and then she unfriended me on Facebook nearly 2 months later. I was shattered. 

I miss him, but feel like I should not reach out, or be the one to reach out. I feel so conflicted. I still care about him, but know we should never be friends again. Again, I know this seems illogical to even ask advice over, since it seems so obvious that the answer should be no, don't talk to him again. I guess I need advice on how to cope. 

Thank you.",11Aug2019,2

22,"Ths post might be a bit unorganized, but I'll do my best to make it as clear as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I just really need to rant what I've been feeling for the past couple of years, and especially this year

&amp;#x200B;

So for a backstory, I am the oldest of 3 girls. I'm gonna be a sophomore in Higschool, one of my sisters is almost 2 years younger (we'll call her S#1) and will be a Freshman, and my youngest sister is gonna be in 6th grade (S#2)

Because I was the oldest, I've always had my sisters tag along with me while hanging with my friends because they couldn't make friends themselves. It was pretty annoying to me as I would never get time with JUST my friends, and so I never really had a friend I could just tell all my secrets to because my sisters were ALWAYS there. Plus, we were homeschooled for the majority of our life, so we ended up going to a lot of events and things where a wide variety of ages were allowed, meaning if I went with my friend you could bet my sisters would be there too.

One of these friends I had met at a family camp. I ended up getting really close to her, but then of course my sisters HAD to tag along.  Thankfully she had a younger sister who was similar to S#1's age, so they would hang out together and then S#2 would switch between mine and their group.

We've known each other for around 6-7 years,  and they became a family friend now basically. However, both my sisters have learned to make her own friends, and S#1 would now for the majority of the time hang out with my friend's younger sister, and S#2 would made other friends more her age. We would still hang out as a group a lot of the times, though. However, about 2 years ago the whole group decided to download ""Houseparty"", an app where you could group facetime people. At first it seemed innocent enough, everyone would call each other at once, and everyone was obsessed. I didn't download the app right away, but eventually did. The excitment woreoff quickly, but then about a year ago S#1 kept facetiming my friend. Not her friend, but my friend. To be fair, my friend's younger sister had some problems where she could be manipulative and annoying, but now instead of making new friends she was hanging out with MY friend. Yes, she was also friends with my sister, but it has gotten to the point where they facetime each other almost everyday, and now it's my friend always asking to do it. S#1 has ALWAYS known that I prefer if she gets close with her own friends, but obviously she didn't care. She face times her all the time now, heck, she's doing it right now. They've even started making plans without me, and nobody even tells me until the day my sister leaves to go to the plans they've made. Also, I found out that my friend shares all her boy problems and life with my sister, never with me. There's this boy that she's liked for a long time that I never even heard of until my sister causually mentioned it in conversation, assuming I would know. I just really suck s because this has been a friendship I;ve been bulding for years, and now my younger freakin' sister is closer to her. My sister is more social than me, not gonna lie, and I don't use facetime in general as much as she does with her and her other friends, but I just can't belive how close they've gotten to the point where I don't think I can even consider her my best friend anymore. She will still talk to me, but we just talk about boring stuff and I feel like I sepnd more energy on her and that she would rather hang out with me just to be with my sister. She rarely asks to facetime me, maybe once every 2 months. Once I invited her over to just have the two of us hang out, and then my sisters joined in when we were on a walk and S#1 basically talked with my friend the whole time I barely had a chance to speak, and if I did they would ignore me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I'm overeacting or what, But I've been mega depressed about it lately. Especially since I don't even have that many friends and she was is one of the closest ones I have. Meanwhile S#1 has her own best friend and friends group outside of my camp friend, so my camp friend is probably just a ""2nd best friend"" to her. Sometimes I feel like blocking my friend orto  just stop talking to her, but then I remeber we are still good friends. But my younger sisters better friends with her so who cares at this pont? I'm just so frustrated, I never got a true child best friend to stick with because my sisters prevented us from getting closer, but now THEY are becoming the best friend. Is this my fault? Should I have talked to my friend more? Am I just lame? I don't know who to be upset with, right now.

I love math and I love computer science, but I feel like I'm too stupid to do it. I've been failing a lot of courses and if I don't stop this trend like NOW, I'm gonna be out of time to finish my degree.

I've been to counseling and I had some emotional support from my girlfriend. My parents think everything is going well (haven't been talking to them a lot recently).

For EVERY exam I'm so terrified of failing. With every failed test, I'm at a risk of losing another semester. My friends seem to be able to rush through new concepts no problem, while I'm the slowpoke that has to ask them like 3 times.

Recently, I've got a small job to support myself financially while studying and it's the first time I earn money with programming and similar to my studies, I'm terrified of just sucking at it.

Have any of you ever experienced something similar? How can I stay motivated, even if exam results are discouraging?
How can I cope with stress? I'm spending way too much time with my phone, I'm having trouble sleeping, I'm assuming this correlates with all my doubts.

She knew from childhood that he were an abusive man. Physically and verbally. He would cause physical fights between her older brother, he had hit her mother and hit her as well. He was very OCD, yet undiagnosed so it’s unsure if this was truly one of his problems and would have full on angry tantrums at her when she was no older than 10 over things such as “the curtains being closed on windows” and other odly specific things as well. She was a bit afraid of him because of this but unfortunately, her mother showed her an example of putting up with his bullshit and letting things slide. Even going as far as taking his side or lying to ensure he wouldn’t get upset. So she would do the same, and would let his actions slide when he would be angry. Mostly because there was not much she felt she was sure he could do. The physical abuse was not everyday. There would be really good days with him and very bad days..

As she got older and reached the age of 13-14, he began to act different towards her. He would look at her in different ways, as if he were checking her out. As a child he would slap her butt as a joke or a” loving gesture”, which was fine as a kid but as she began to develop into a teenager, he should have stopped. It made her very uncomfortable. She didn’t want to believe he was going this in a sexual way when he’d slap her butt, she tried believing he still saw her as a child and excused the actions. However, it started to become more than “friendly taps” and he almost stared to reach the point of crossing the line of groping. At the early age of 13-14 she felt uncomfortable wearing tight clothes in her own home because she noticed this was when he did it the most. She’d avoid walking past him if he were sitting somewhere in order to avoid him touching her. This was what happened most often but there were other occurrences.

One day she came home from shopping with her mom for bathing suits. She were around 15 at this time. She was going out that day to swim so she had the swimsuit on under her clothes. Her dad asked to see what it looked like because he was curious. She noticed he never took much notice in other times when she came back from shopping for clothes and was upset that he was interested in seeing the swim suit. She said she didn’t want to take off her clothes and he kept pushing her to do it and he actually pulled down her pants. This happened while him her and her mother were all standing in the kitchen together. Her mother did nothing but scold him jokingly by saying “you embarrassed her” in laugh. 

Another occurrence that happened was when they were standing in an elevator together when she was around 18 and he asked her if he got lip injections ... she answered with a confused no because it hadn’t happened he pushed the conversation further saying her lips were “more plump” than him and her mother and he wondered where she “got it from”. He kept staring at her lips making her uncomfortable before saying “you have kissing lips”. She was extremely upset and walked around for the rest of that year pretending to itch her nose whenever she’d walk past him just to cover her lips. He eventually accused her of doing coke because of it and laughed at the fact that there were a chance she were in hard drugs, even tho that was never the case.

Those situations have stuck out the most as inappropriate. The other occasions have been minor but seemed bigger because of those problems. Such as the uncomfortable stares from him at her behind, cleavage or just staring in general at her face while she would be doing something in the kitchen for example.

Basically, this man is very obviously creepy. He has gotten away with it all because she grew up excusing his other abusive patterns and had already gone through enough. Once she realized sexual abuse may be happening (she couldn’t understand or read his intention for a long time until she was absolutely sure) and so she suppressed and excused a lot of these behaves until she broke down around the age of 18. It hit her one day that this has been so wrong and there can no longer be excuses for him. She avoided him for a long time and was barely home and her relationship with her mother and the rest of the family has decayed a lot since they have not been able to see ANY of his behaviour as a problem that needs addressing.

She feels very alone in this, she’s moving out very soon but her father still feels the need to have control over her. He tries to dictate who she dates as he detests her boyfriend before he has even tried to get to know him and has a desperate need to control what career and university she chooses.
She is not listening to him at all but they are paying for her school expenses which includes moving out and away from them so she’s sort of pretending to go along with the initial goal she had with university. She’s moving in with the boyfriend he doesn’t like and she may lose the funds because of it from him but that’s uncertain ...

How should she go about this situation? What would you do or suggest? Either way she will move out and chose her own path in life no matter what especially after realizing how abusive he truly has been. But what can she do to heal? She has not tried therapy yet nor has she spoken to her mother about sexual abuse or anyone else in her family. Is it worth bringing up or should she just abandon him and her mother. She resents her mother despite how much she loves her because her mother staying with him has put her through so much pain when she should have left him for his abuse. How can she fix this for herself and what options Does she really have to heal? This situation has caused her a huge fear of deception from all friends/partners in life and is the root of her own toxic traits.

Again, what can she do? General advice, words of kindness, similar experiences and what you did etc is helpful for me to show her this post later.

Thanks again",11Aug2019,1

My relationship with my dad has always been difficult. Ive never felt close to him as I do my mother. When I turned 6 or 7 he went to Dominica to attend medical school. He did this at a later stage in his life because he wanted to provide a better life for us. Well this resluted in me having to be with out a dad for several years. I dont remeber a whole lot about that time, but I did notice one thing, he had become alot easier to piss off. He used to be very slow to anger, but now he gets Well had continued for several years and I feel like his irritabily has peaked. He yells alot more over trivial matters. He loves to dish out insults but if I say anyting back, he flips out. I have just recently started to learn to ignore his name calling. Recently he has started to play the victim card. If is food isnt ready as soon as he walks in the door he says he is the last priority to everyone in the family, just alot of self pitty over stupid matters. He has recently stared to finacially threaten me when I express I dont want to be spoken to like that.

Im not shure if im comming off as compling by stating my grivences, that is not my attention. The thing is I know that my dad sounds like a real piece of work,  but I know he loves his family. He works 36 hour shifts comes home and sleep for 4 hours and then does a 24 hour shift. He works himself into the ground to support us, which is why i believe he is acting this way. Ive already asked him to take time off work, but he refuses. He really doesnt know how to relax.  My question is how do I deal with my father.",11Aug2019,1

43,"Just a few days ago, my mum and my sister swapped bedrooms. 

My house is fairly small. The rooms upstairs are very close together and the walls are very thin. So when my sister first told me that my mum had started expressing interest in swapping rooms with her, I was really dreading it. 

Noises I can tolerate when I’m trying to get to sleep are mostly sounds from outside my house: wind, rain, cars etc. but I don’t mind complete silence at all. What I can’t deal with is when I can hear voices inside my house - if my mum and her boyfriend are downstairs talking, I can hear them quite clearly - and much less: snoring. 

Unfortunately, my mum’s boyfriend’s snoring can be extremely unbearable. I could hear it before their bedrooms were swapped so I knew, since my sister’s ex-bedroom is right next to mine, I’d definitely be able to hear it now. What doesn’t help either is that that room’s door can’t be closed all the way. 

This isn’t a matter I can complain about to my mum. She can’t do anything about it. Plus, she’s the one who sleeps right beside him, I’ve tried and it was to no avail. 

I’ve thought about just getting earplugs but I don’t know how effective they’d be but then I thought, would soundproofing work?

His main reason for this is that he says if I leave I will ""leave him behind"" and not speak to them anymore. They have never been bad parents but the fact that they can't support what I want to do with my future is really shit, I hate living in New Zealand and have not been happy here for a long time, a couple of months ago when I went overseas to visit family in Europe was the happiest I'd been in years.

50,"Long story short, I met her a year ago. She’s a chill person you can hang out with, but she’s been in an abusive relationship this entire time. In fact, she has four irl friends and some not irl friends (one being me).

I’m going to off myself.” I then said “It’s okay, you’ll get through this somehow. You have so much to live for.” And she said “I just need me time. I can’t be friends with you anymore.” I said “If you need anyone to talk to, I’m always free.” That was the last conversation I had with her. I can’t confirm anything that’s happened to her. The last time I met her irl was a month ago. I’m not just gonna abandon her. I can’t. She needs help, but I don’t know how to help. Advice needed asap, thank you.",11Aug2019,1
52,"I'm the type of person that, no matter when or where, if you got problem's I'll listen to them and hope that I can help. I'm like the First-Texter, the guy that makes sure we stay in contact, and the guy that makes sure you're okay. And no, I'm not a r/NiceGuys guy, I'm just someone who cares about the people around me. 

Latest example: Yesterday I contacted an old friend of mine, whom I haven't talked to in like 3 years. I ask him what's up, and he says that he doesn't feel good: long story short I spend 3 hours listening to him and his problems. Today, we planned to meet up and do something together. He cancelled around the time we were supposed to meet. 

Another example: My ""Best friend"". A girl from my old school, we've always used to be cool with each other. There are countless nights in which she called me for whatever reason, I could call 1000 examples. Last week I asked her if we wanted to do something together, like going out and eating something. She told me that unfortunately she couldn't, as she got a lot of things to do and her mother wouldn't allow that. For the past 3 days, she had uploaded videos of her and friends drinking and partying together. 

Same with all the other friends, nobody really wants to get to know me, nobody wants to know what things I like and what maybe makes me sad.

I feel like I'm just someone to fill a hole with, someone you hang out with if no one else can. 

I basically have no one to talk about my problems, how I really feel about certain emotional things or just someone to ask me how my day was. I'm just always choking it, thinking for myself that it won't be too bad. Mostly I'll just lay in play room for a few hours in complete darkness and listen to music. 

And I'm somehow ALWAYS happy. I'm never in a bad mood, I always laugh and smile a lot, I'm always friendly and respectful. But then, if my friends are in a bad mood they'll be total assholes to me, saying that I'm annoying and that I should shut up.

Even though everyone says I'm such a funny and caring person. I literally have tears running down my face, as I just realised this when looking at my friends storys who, as always, didn't invite me. 

I'm 16, why do I suddenly feel this way ? I've already thought about this for over a year now, nothing has changed and I'm slowly on the way of just completely isolating myself and completely losing contact with everyone, as no one seems to care about me anyways. I'm desperately trying not to sound like a drama queen or whatever, but I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I feel like I'm faking myself to make me fit into my life. 

I'm sorry this got so long but it's the first time I've ever talked about this to anyone at all.

55,"I’ve posted this before but I’m just trying to get a good variety of sources before I make a decision. This is copy pasted from another post I made with some minor additions and adjustments but still, any help would be appreciated.

———————————————————————

Hi all, I don't usually post about stuff like this (hence the throwaway) but this is an issue that's been leering over me for a long time now and if nothing else I'd like to let it out. I’m sorry if the whole situation is childish or even cringey.

Like the title says, I've caught feelings for a girl in a relationship. She's currently dating another close friend of mine, and I  have to admit they're a very cute couple and have a lot of chemistry. I'm very happy for them but at the same time, it's hurting me.

She and I are Juniors in HS, and my feelings only really bloomed early sophomore year. I'm 17, she's 16 and her BF is 18 soon to be 19. Her Boyfriend graduated last year.

I'd think me and her are very close and she's one of the only people I feel comfortable around. There's really not much point in gushing about her but I really, really do love her and I think she values me a lot too. 

I've been having a hard time coming to grips with these feelings because it feels like I'm trapped in a Catch 22 with no real good answer.

I really want to confess my feelings as I'm a huge honesty supporter and it would feel incredibly good to let her know how much I value her, but I don't want to harm this friendship I've cultivated with her. She's really the best friend I've ever had. 

And what if I confess my feelings and she feels the same way, what then? I don't want her to just drop him that would be awful. He's a really good friend and honestly, he's told me she's the best thing to ever happen to him and I don't ever want to destroy that. 

So should I just grit my teeth and hold it in forever? It's not good at all for my mental state and I don't know what to do. It's really ripping apart my self-esteem and moral outlook. I’m constantly hit with waves of loneliness and guilt

Like I said, He's a senior. Should I just bank on the relationship falling through because of the age difference? When I think about that I feel so shitty and selfish. 

It just hurts and I don't know what to do. I want to be with her but I want closure just as much if not more, but I'm not sure if I want to pay the price of harming our friendship. And sometimes telling her feels like a no win situation.

I’m sorry if this is a ranty mess there’s just a lot of pent up frustration.

58,"My father cheated on my mother and left me and my siblings. This was over twenty years ago. He rarely paid child support and if he did, it was about $90 for four children. In all this time, no phone calls, letters, birthday cards, visits etc... My mother never shit talked him, I just grew up accepting that he wasn't there. 

Up until about five years or so ago, he called because there was an issue with us being on his health insurance and my siblings and I already having it. He mentioned child support told him not to contact my mom? My mom asked us if anyone wanted to talk to him. No one said anything. Who could? 1. It was unexpected and 2. It feels like a slap in the face to call about a certain subject, then ask to talk out of convenience. 

More silence went by and as I grew up I learned how to use google and found him. I knew where he lived, my aunt and uncle on his side...I knew a lot of things from google searches. I found their facebooks even. 

I knew all this information and didn't reach out. I have questions that needed answers, but I also felt that asking them would get me no where. That he wouldn't tell me what I needed to hear. Another big issue was that I felt since he abandoned me, he should be the one to reach out. I felt that even if what child support said was true (which I doubt), he still could've reached out when I was an adult. Nope, it was me that found him instead. I put forth the mild effort of internet searching and found him. 

I looked at his facebook yesterday. No new updates, looked at his sister's and brother's. He died a few days ago unexpectedly. I don't think his siblings will even bother to try and notify his own children of his death to be honest. I again, had to do the looking to find that out. 

I feel weird about it. I keep seeing posts how he was such a great guy and blah blah blah and I can't agree. Then I also feel guilty for not reaching out? Then I feel pissed because I feel that I shouldn't have had to? I feel jealous people got to experience what a ""great guy"" he was, when I have nothing? I'm upset that i will now definitely never get an apology or explanation, even though I never thought I would get one in the first place? Stupid hope. I don't know...

He's dead. I have memories of him from when I was younger. I feel robbed in some way, but also like I should've gave something? I don't know what that is though...

I was bullied and almost killed by a couple of family members (long story) and I took it out on my dog.

65,"Sorry this is hella long I just wanted to give every detail

So there's this girl I like and we've known each other for a long time but never really talked much and our families are really close. I just started liking her like 3 weeks ago and started a streak with her. (As a joke) me and a couple of my friends found out how to change our snap maps location and we set them to area 51😂. She doesn't have any of them added and so it looked like I was there only for her. Our families are close enough for her to tell her mom I was there and her mom texted mine it was fine just funny so I messaged her ""your mom thought I was actually at area 51"" or something like that. She responded saying lol and stuff and that was pretty much it which raised the question to me how tf did she see that we live in nh and area 51 is in Nevada. could have just been zoomed out but whatever.

 Anyways the next time we talked was when she randomly said why do you never said full face pics for streaks. I said idk no point and she said yeah there is and I said what then she said ""idk😂😂"" and then we had a pretty short conversation (I just don't bother sending full face I do now that she said that tho.

How should I try to start a conversation now though doesn't post that much on story so I can't message through that. And I'm not 100% if she likes me so idk",11Aug2019,1
67,"Title basically saids it all. Whenever we are outside, he always looks excessively at women. Its so noticeable and annoying when I walk with him because if theres a young woman in front of him, he literally walks next to her looks at her for a good 2 seconds then continues past her. Since its the summer time it has gotten worse because when they are exposed he seems to look at even more women. My dad is divorced if that matters. Will it be awkard if I tell him to stop looking at women? Help.",11Aug2019,1

70,"First things first, I’m not a n00b, I just lost my password to my old account (goddamn it). Also, for some context I’m an 18yr old girl.

Throughout my life my father has been... an interesting character to figure out. For a long few years I was convinced he was abusive, and as a result our relationship is now very broken. We don’t talk much, and when we do it feels strained and honestly, I wouldn’t be upset if we never spoke again (although that will never happen as my mother and I are like best friends). 

Now we’ve gotten to the stage where we interact so little that nothing bad has happened for a while but I often think of the past and wonder if the problems we had were my fault? I went through a rocky phase of depression that I hid from everyone around me, and that definitely wore down some of my personal relationships with friends and family... 

There were times when he would get so angry and smash cups against walls, he threw hot tea a few times, climb over tables to chase me in rage and just yell and yell at either me or my mother (let’s be real though, it was usually me). I’m very stubborn when it comes to standing up for myself so I definitely poked the bear and made things worse for myself. I remember one time being held on the floor in the kitchen with his fist above me and him saying “I want to beat the shit out of you right now”. He also once told me “why would I ever want to be friends with someone like you? Why would anyone ever want to be friends with someone like you?”. You can imagine how my self deprecating brain handled that comment...

One time I particularly remember was when we were having breakfast. He decided it would be a fun game to flick my ear, and I pretended to play back because pretending to be his friend was easier than outwardly hating him. (He’s extremely petty, once ignored my existence for a week straight and I don’t even remember why) Basically, I batted his hand away, might I add LIGHTLY, and he went berserk and hit me over the head hard enough that I had a headache instantly. That was a shock to me though, because after all the shouting, throwing things and threats he had never once touched me. I refused to say a word and got up from the table, I was silently seething but I knew from past experience not to say anything. My mother said something along the lines of “come on, make friends” and I replied “never.” I was asking for it, and he delivered. He stood up, ran at me,  climbed over a sofa that was in his way and chased me into my brothers room where he cornered me. He berated me in that room for about 10 minutes and I just refused to reply to him the whole time. 

That whole experience convinced me he was delusional and I was absolutely livid for a long time. But each one of these explosions were so few and far between that I convinced myself he wasn’t a problem. I believed I was the problem and I still do believe it to an extent. Each time something happened I’d cry and cry and cry and wish he wasn’t my father, wish we weren’t related, and hope that I didn’t inherit any of it. Eventually I wouldn’t allow myself to cry so I’d just sit for hours staring in silent anger at my wall. On top of all his outbursts (tantrums, as I like to call them), he’s just horrible in day to day life which is infinitely more difficult to explain. I feel as though no one would understand how infuriating he is unless you experience it. Constantly at a low level of anger, petty, and genuinely believes he is so high and mighty. He constantly mentions how he’s allowed to not do anything (Not an exaggeration, I’m talking computer games 24/7. It’s either food, sleep, shouting, or games. He doesn’t contribute to the household in any capacity), because he did so much in the past for the family. Not to burst his bubble but the whole family worked for what we have and we still continue living our lives! 


So to sum it up:

-Father is *borderline* physically abusive but has never hurt me (except for one time but I feel it doesn’t count); this is a twice-thrice a year occurrence

-He is extremely difficult to live with, lots of mood swings, complaining, has no compassion, helps no one at home and says some pretty horrible stuff to me; this is a daily occurrence

-I held a grudge and hated his existence for a long time, wishing he’d just leave home. 

Now our broken relationship means he doesn’t have the opportunity to lash out at me anymore and I find myself feeling extremely guilty, and blaming myself. The advice I need is this: has he been a bad father or is this normal teenager-raising? We’re my mood swings and stubborn nature the cause of this and should I stop feeling such resentment towards him? I feel like I can never forgive him, I cried so much over some of the things he’s done and he’s scared me one too many times, and yet I don’t trust my own judgement; hence here I am. Thanks in advance x",11Aug2019,0
71,"Now, I’m not saying this in a way in which I think they are less than. I’ve certainly had my fair share of health issues but none have been chronic, and I am technically mentally and physically “healthy”. I would definitely describe myself as someone who does care deeply for those who are ill or disabled or disadvantaged etc. and I always have been. It’s something my parents have told me has been engrained in my personality since I was a young girl.

Anyways, the men that have pursued me in the past 10 or so years (I am now 25) always turn out to have some sort of disability. They are not obvious to me at all. All men were undiagnosed before I would eventually figure out something was different and I would tell them to see a professional where they would ALWAYS receive the diagnosis that I had suspected. All four men are men I have been really attracted to, and two of them, I loved and currently do love. Now it’s hard to say that it’s “like attracts like” because I am neither bipolar, histrionic, borderline personality disordered, or autistic (the current man I love has been suspected by his doctors to be autistic but is yet to receive an official diagnosis). These men are considered “successful” in society with no physical impairment. They are all doctors and dentists (I am a dentist myself), so it’s not like they clearly struggle in life either. 

The question is why? How does this happen and why?",11Aug2019,1

74,"I have a mental disability (, that has caused me hatred my entire life.   I utterly got treated like utter trash, my entire life.   My mother, told me recently that my neighbors when I was a child, compared me to an animal.   It wasn't to the age of 38, that I was diagnosed with autism and bi-polar, and started to get some help.   But the only people who have ever helped me, were paid professionals.

In the apartment building where I live, the first 2 or 3 weeks that I moved in, the toilet didn't even work.   I put my hand in the toilet tank (the tank at the back) and flushed it manually.     I changed the door knob on one of the doors inside the apartment, because it had a handle sticking out, that my cat would jump at, all night, and I was concerned about waking the neighbors.   I went to a local dollar store, and bought foam tabs to put on the kitchen cabinets, because the last apartment I lived in, they had them, and it helped to prevent the neighbor from being disturbed.   I spent 2.5 hours on the telephone, reporting a gas leak, because I am sensitive to smells  (your nervous system is effected as an autistic).    I did this right in front of the neighbors face.   This neighbor, utterly treats me like garbage, barely even talks to me.   I spent almost 50 hours, doing things, the first 6 months when I moved into my current apartment trying to be considerate to the neighbors, and it accomplished nothing.   

I have been treated like garbage my whole life.   The very symptom of autism is that you have no social skills, inability to communicate, you offend everyone.    And yes, offending everyone, is also part of it.   You can do a search on google for the words ""autism"" and ""rude"", and you get 8.5 million  (yes in the millions) search results, saying its a symptom.

Doesn't matter if you try to be considerate, doesn't matter if you try even spend dozens of hours trying to be nice to people, you get treated like garbage because you have no social skills.

On this Reddit, I posted for advice for help where to go if my pet gets injured, because I am unable to drive myself due to my disability.   And I need my pet because of suicidal depression.    My pet is my only company and comfort, that helps relieve my symptoms of depression in times of need.    The only person who bothers to respond, trolls the thread, and I even post a legal document from my doctor with personal information.   Not one person even just gives a word of support.   After deleting that thread, I see an almost identical thread, typed by someone who doesn't suffer a severe disability like mine that prevents normal communication and he gets 372 responses from caring people.   The autistic, who has no social skills, only has a troll on his thread.    

Maybe it is true, I am an animal, but what does that make the people who act this way to a disabled person?",11Aug2019,1

To our neighbor,   
 

I’m sorry about the scare you were given by our dogs. It was an unnecessary problem for both of us, and It’s clear that you are not to blame. The issue stems from my parents not properly securing the dogs, and simple lack of proper caution. This is not to imply I am completely free of responsibility, I am not. It’s an ongoing issue I have been trying to deal with for quite sometime. While this is not the first time this has come to be a problem, it is thankfully a rare occurrence. The issue has been exasperated by a lack of confrontation on my part, but I will be changing that. The lax attitude, and unearned trust afforded these animals is not a problem I possess. That being said, in the past I have enabled it in my parents with my inaction. I have often not even protested what I felt, (even at the time) to be bad decisions. This was simply because the animals in question are not my pets in any legal sense, and while I care for them deeply, I have always felt that I did not have the right or authority to intercede on this issue. While this is still the case, I understand that I must intervene regardless of any friction it may cause with my parents as this whole thing has gotten to the point of being ridiculous. I hope you understand that the last thing I want is for any real harm to result from issues caused by these animals, lack of responsibility of my parents on this issue, or my own inaction. 

Once more, you have my sincere apology about my own meek, weak inaction. On behalf of all of us living here I offer our regret and apology as well.",11Aug2019,1
77,"I will never really be able to detail the depth and complexity of the situation I’m in right now, but I need advice on how to structure what I want to say to my step mother.

Context:
My stepmother for the past four years has without a doubt been emotionally abusive and manipulative towards my 18 year old sister, less so to me. To name a few large incidents that I will sum up, but again it can not do justice the effect it did have on us. on a vacation in front of others my step mother made my sister cry after saying how she does more for us than our mother and that she is our real mom not her. Came into my room screaming crying because I texted with my mother about My step mother, and while I forget what it was about, I find it extremely inappropriate that she came into my room (14 years old at the time) screaming crying. She once spread a rumor about me to my other family members that I was gay(which I am, closeted) forcing me to assure them I was not because I was to ready to tell anyone. She had an argument with me about me throwing my sister a surprise party because my sister gave her an attitude, and then refused to help or pay for any part of it. Stepmother also brought me into a separate room and told me I didn’t include enough pictures of my dad in a slide show I made for my sisters party and she said she knew it hurt him, my sister was furious about this and texted my dad we confirmed that he never said or thought this because the slide show was for my sister not him. Most recently, I came home and my sister was going out with a friend and my step mother was on the phone trash talking her. She also three days ago, which lead to where I am now, started asking Sarah if her friend hated her, and then she went on to text my sisters friends mother if her daughter was mad at her. This is inappropriate in my opinion because her text was very victimizing herself instead of being actually confused and she also had no reason to think this. Me, my sister and my sisters friends, friends parents are all on the same page regarding my sister

Current Situation:
My sister is leaving for college and is trying to solve this and called my dad, and after a long talk we are all going to talk tomorrow morning and he told us to have what we want to say ready. I know I wrote this all out but I just don’t know what to say. I have one so far....

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

84,"When I was around 14 years old and had just started exploring porn, my older sister went through my iPad without my permission and found my search history. She then decided to show our parents and confiscated it even though they did not give a single fuck. I later got it back after causing such a ruckus that they forced her to give it up. I had to reset it to get rid of the parental control. 

Later when I was about 15 years old and had been using a messaging app to chat with strangers, a random dude began talking to me and giving me compliments on a daily basis. I was really insecure and found the unyielding flow of positive attention very flattering. He eventually began asking for nudes, and I, the affection-starved middle child, obliged. 

One day I decided to go Mac Donald’s with a friend and left my iPad at home. She went through it yet again and showed her visiting friends my nudes. She went on to confiscate it  and showed our parents, who again did not give any fucks. 

I eventually got it back after a lot of arguing and had to reset it. She went on to monitor my usage for at least a year. I began using really long and complicated locks on my devices and she hasn’t done it since. 

While I get that the nudes thing could have ended badly she didn’t need to show the pictures to anyone. 


I’m now almost 18 years old and I’m still not over it, anything remotely sexual makes me very uncomfortable and ashamed. I never let anyone use my phone and I delete all messages and “deep clean” my phone every day.

Woke up two hours late and would've started my shift close to an hour late. I thought after delivering for Uber Eats for close to two years that my tardiness (in addition to slow work pace) were in the past. Unfortunately, my tardiness the day before and what would've been yesterday, in addition to my co-workers' and manager's complaints about my work pace on my third (and last) day of work, showed otherwise. Even when I did start working faster and made an effort to show up on time for my previous jobs, I'd eventually go back to being tardy for them and doing them at a slower pace than desired.

88,"So, I am 30. Recently I’ve been feeling like the only way forward (out of minimum wage and tips) is to return to college. I truly want to make a better life for myself and my child. 

I live in Nevada, it’s not uncommon for people here to spend their lives in entertainment (casinos/bar/you get it). 
I’ve found it more difficult to maintain these positions as I’ve gotten older and less functional on limited sleep. The most lucrative hours being at night and weekends, which has forced me to spend far less time with my child than I’d like.  I’d honestly trade in $300 tip nights for a weekend with my child. 

I left my first semester of college when I was put on bed rest while pregnant. (I know, a common tale.) I’ve always circled back to the idea of returning to school. But the only people I know who’ve actually used their degrees are two nurses and a lawyer. Everyone else claims they’ll leave the bar, and maybe they do but it’s always for some menial job that has noting to do with their degree, like bud tending or a call center. I really don’t want to be in debt for no reason like so many coworkers and friends.

She also doesnt want me to ""do anything"" by myself so I have to wait 3 to 4 weeks at a time for her to finally feel ready to do anything.

95,"I'm sorry if this is more relevant for another subreddit. I'm still learning which subreddits are best for topic-relevancy and what-not. 

I was raised by an only child of a single codependent parent with drug addiction (that parent is now sober and has been for a while now). She raised me outside a small city where the only means to socialization were the church and strange for me (positive for her) AA meetings. I rarely attended the elementary school I went to, mainly because I wasn't supervised much and could miss going to school if I wanted to. 

Middle school wasn't much different. Towards the end of 6th grade my mom, now sobering up, connected me with a kid who was the child of a friend from AA. Needless to say, this friend was older and had friends of his own that I did not, friends that were also older and confident and with access to drugs. 

(I don't want to overdo this post or seem self-pitying, so I'll try keeping things brief).

For the next 4 years, I used substances, occasionally went to school, and was the funny young character that hung out with the older crowd. I, of course, latched onto the friend that introduced me to everyone else and did everything he said. I conflated my affection for him with love. The usual spiral. 

For those 4 years, that friend beat me, publicly shamed me, and defeated my sense of self-worth. I don't want to give any specific details for obvious reasons. 

Eventually, through a weird course of events, I replaced our relationship with a girl I met and many confusing pieces of advice from my mother's friends from AA. Still with me? I know this is more typing than I first intended. 

I got an internship with our cities paper and ""cleaned up"". Quotation marks. It was nice for a time and after the relationship, I had with the girl previously mentioned went sour, I jumped to another, and another, and the saga continued. Not unusual, I know, but I had one friend during the rest of high school. During this time I moved out of my mothers home, found couches to sleep on, and somehow graduated through small but nice acts of charity. 

At some point during this stage of self-development, the friend I described earlier killed himself by jumping in front of oncoming traffic. I'm still unsure what to make of that. 

Okay, cut to *the typical pre-college phase.* I panicked, didn't think I deserved to attend university, and after throwing away several scholarships decided to live in an apartment with a new friend I met at work. 

This friend ended up being the last friend I'd make for 3 years. I repeated the old cycle. I was enamored by the friend (who was much older), I was dependent on the friend. There were many promises I made to myself about starting companies, proving people wrong through unconventional means, you name it. Eventually, I had cut off everyone I knew and moved with that same friend across the country. 

*Cut to now.*   


So, we ended up in Virginia. The one place where nobody could find me? I did something uncharacteristic recently and cut ties with my friend of 3 years. We're still on speaking terms but I recognize too many similar dynamics that I've let keep me from living life and building self-esteem. 

So here are am, 21 years old, moving to my hometown because I have nowhere else to go (insufficient funds, etc, etc). All I have to ask Reddit is: how do you try making friends after experiences like this? 

I have not had the worst life. I have not had anything close to what others describe in daily life. Still, I am terrified of meeting new people. I'm scared that I am incapable of even having the simplest friendships? I am worried that I am going to remain this way. 

What suggestions do you have? 

PS: Thank you if you made it this far. I know this was a lot to read in one sitting, but I really appreciate it if you did. So yeah.",11Aug2019,3

Using t online on WiFi still uses data... on my iPad with no data. I don’t fucking understand it.  But the thing is that my parents let me watch some tv if it’s on my iPad.

99,"Hey everyone. So me and my ol lady were watching our niece and nephew for a week and after they went home my ol lady told me she wanted kids. I'm not totally opposed to it, but I am because I don't want to share her. As bad as that might sound, me and her do everything together. I love spending time with her and doing things with her. She's literally my best friend. I see all the horror stories of people having kids and it tearing marriages apart, and I don't even want it to come close to that. Plus I'd more than likely have to give up my hobbies and probably my job too. I love my job, it's literally what I have always dreamed of doing and my family career. It would be cool to have a kid, but I guess I'm too selfish to give up my life and the things I enjoy for 18 years. I love my niece and nephews, and I love kids, but I don't want my own.

Truth is it’s a love hate relationship. He’s funny and and I sometimes enjoy hanging out with him but the cons totally way out the pros.
He’s a really manipulative guy, he’ll make someone feel bad about something they did to keep them in their place. Or he’ll say something to hurt you. Or he’ll get close with someone to get to their friend.

But we have hung out before, and during those hangouts we always get along really well and I never leave feeling any doubt about our friendship.

She knows it's my birthday too due to people posting things about it and me posting about it on story (that I know she's seen) but she still hasn't said anything? It's confusing to me since I thought we we're doing good and I at least expected a text? In the past she thought my birthday was in April even though she's been told repeated times that my birthday is in August. I don't know if I'm being too petty about this whole thing?

So, I have worked at the same café for almost a year and i have one regular customer, we will call him G. He works at the bar next door to my café. We’ve always seen each other in passing  and I’ve always thought he was really cute but haven’t ever gotten the chance to talk to him until recently, when I went into his bar to have a drink after one of my shifts.

111,"Me, my boyfriend, our friend, and his girlfriend, all moved out of our last apartment into a much better one. We all agreed there was going to be no smoking weed in the house, because that was the only thing the landlord really pointed out.

We've been here 3 months, and the last 2 have been my roommate trying to convince me to let him and his friends smoke in the house. I've told him I don't know how many times that we can get kicked out if the landlord finds out (to which he comes back with we can cover up the smell, but I know his friends and they will make 0 effort to do so no matter who or how many times we ask). It feels like every week for the last 2 months one of them complains about not being able to smoke in the house. One of them just told my roommate that he's not smoking outside because he's wearing flip flops (I'm sorry???? you don't live here??????? you don't assume the risk of getting kicked out???????????). All they do is disrespect me (and him and he doesn't even notice??) why would I want to allow them to? And why can't they all go over to someone else's house to smoke? They went behind my back and smoked in our living room, and when I asked he lied to me about it and told me later that he did. I've been just getting angrier and angrier about this and I don't know how to make them understand why they can't. I don't even understand why they don't??? It's such a simple concept I really just don't understand this. Am I just an asshole? Because I made a rule that ruins peoples fun?? When we all agreed on it before we moved????

114,"I went to the same school as this guy in London who was kind of a friend but not that close. He was relatively friendly but I could see he was a bit selfish and self obsessed. He claimed he has some condition from birth which meant he couldn’t do exercise in p.e and got mitigation for exams and other stuff using it. 

Yet he used to tell me that he went to the gym regularly and come in saying his legs ached. I had a belief that he may be getting his way out of p.e because he couldn’t be asked and went to the gym. Anyways this was none of my business and frankly I didn’t really care  I was inclined to believe him at the start because my initial thoughts is never that someone is lying. 

Anyways, he ended up going to the same uni as me. We become relatively good friends and I introduced him to some of mine. He then asked if I wanted to go the gym and he was completely fine running on the treadmill. He also went for runs etc and lifted occasionally. He’s a relatively nice guy and fairly inclusive. 

Anyways me and a few other people decided to live together second year of uni. So he sends a message saying that he is going to collect the keys from our estate agent or whatever so that when it’s time to move in we can all move in. No ones yet responded.
This obviously means he will have to be their first to let us in. Now I’ve known this guy for several years and think he has an ulterior motive. He’s doing this so he can pick his favourite/ best room by being the first person to move in. 

I think we all talked about it briefly last year and said we would draw straws etc or something but it was never properly discussed. The problem is that everyone is gonna move in at slightly different times and if has the keys no one else can get in. So how do I not let this guy control the situation and how do I kindly say in our group how we are going to decide which rooms people get?

I know that shes in pain and worry. Who really wants to die? I just don't know what to do. I have to live. I have a chance and I don't want my kids weighed down by it too. Im emotionally exhausted.

She seemed very happy about this and other times we've talked. But then she went back to acting like I dont exist. She's tried flirting with me but it only confused me as I didn't understand why she was doing it when she doesn't seem to care about me otherwise.

She keeps going from nothing to flirting without ever stopping at trying to befriend me, and it seems standard with all the women who find me attractive, and that seems like a large pool (that isn't a brag, its just a fact). Women, and some guys, either ignore me or they flirt but not one has ever said hello or asked my name or anything.

Hell, one of my co-couriers seems more friendly and caring my existence than any girl I've ever met. He says hello. He asks how I'm doing.

Unlike my younger sister of two years, I F21 dont like to share every detail of my day or life or thoughts with my mum or step dad. Neither do i like it when they overshare their life stories With me. To start off with, im just not the type of person to share alot. And i feel uncomfortable when others do(?) I just feel like i want a sort of barrier between my parents and i where there are aspects of our lives that we do not share. My younger sister tells my mum EVERYTHING and vice versa. They both like it i guess? 

There’s also another reason why i dont like sharing with my mum. Idk if she realizes it or if it’s just me but when i tell her how i feel, she tends to make it seem...not invalid but...wrong...idk. What usually happens is after the conversation (with a few digressions) i feel like i should not have shared it. Over time i just dont even try to.

126,"This is my post copied and pasted from another sub with more added that was not relevant to the initial sub I posted it in 

My grandpa:  Vietnam veteran, retired mailman

His living conditions are unacceptable. He cannot safely move throughout his house because the stairs/floor is rotting. Has not had running water since his pipes burst last winter. He turned off the electric/gas as well. His car is no longer running so he can no longer make it to doctors appointments. 

I go to school two states away (in AR), but every time I have a break that is long enough I drive up to see him. The house is so bad he no longer allows me inside and we stay at a hotel nearby. 

I feel like I’m running out of options. I have looked for apartments near him, absolutely nothing is available (in WI). 

I found him an apartment at the same complex as my mom and brother or an assisted living community behind the apartment but he said he doesn’t can’t pay that much and doesn’t want to. This would require him to move to Illinois from Wisconsin 

I have already called the Homeless Veterans hotline (I needed a starting point I have no idea what else to do) and she was able to start making me a referral on his behalf but because he will not give me his information and I do not have all of it I was not able to get the referral 

I spent the last few days with him in Wisconsin and convinced him  to come back with me to Illinois for a few days, he wants me to bring him to my aunts house but I know she will just bring him back up to Wisconsin in a few weeks because he will want to go back 

I feel like everybody has given up on him except me. I can’t let him live in that house and I don’t want to take him away from the area that he loves but there is nothing available for him within a 50+ mile radius. I offered to clean out the entire house for him and help him get the water and electric back on but he won’t let me. 

Has anybody else dealt with this? I’m so scared that one day I’m going to call him in the morning and he won’t answer and I’ll be 12 hours away and unable to rush and help him I don’t know what to do

My dad died in that house in 2017 and I carry so much guilt because I wish I would’ve have done more to help them sooner. This has gone on too long and I don’t want this to be the last time I see my grandpa because I didn’t help him. I don’t want to force him into an apartment lease in Illinois because morally I could never force anyone into a financial obligation but I don’t know what else to do",11Aug2019,1

128,"ever since I was a kid my sister has been my best friend, and really my only friend. As a kid I was always quiet and sensitive, and because of that my sister has been the only person I could talk to. When she hit her teens she really started hating how clingy I was. She started locking herself in her room more and just acted like she was too cool for me. And it kinda just made me want to hangout with her more. But I was always just kicked out and I just had this state where I thought something was wrong with me? She started having friends over, and she dressed different, and they’d make fun of me. But I still thought she was so cool, that it was my fault they did that and she ignored me. After that I’ve always just compared myself to my sister. She’s prettier, she’s skinnier, she’s more likeable, she has more friends, she has a better sense of style, she’s more talented, and I’ve always felt like she’s the favorite among my parents. At this point I don’t know if this is my fault for being so clingy and emotional. Maybe it was just teen angst but I seriously believe that me being so clingy played a huge part in this as well. I’m just not sure how to deal with this either, I seriously don’t know how to cope with this. Please someone tell me what’s wrong with me.

129," She works at a pet hotel, and was holding a small dog. To clarify, she did not just drop it, it literally leaped out of her arms as she was setting it down. She took it to the in house vet and the vet said that it had a punctured lung. Her manager told her ""don't ever hold dogs again"" and ordered her to finish her shift. Now she's blaming herself and worried about the dig

I'm of the opinion that the dog's injury was not the fault of my girlfriend. It's also pretty gross for her manager to speak to her like that if the goal was to make sure the dog would be okay.

How do I assure her that it's not her fault? How should she talk to her managers about this at work tomorrow?",11Aug2019,2

131,"Hello all, throwaway because I'm scared of consequences.


So, I'm 19, I live in New York, and I work for the state. I have been stealing money from my job in an attempt to get free gas money and free spending money. I know I'm stupid, I know I'm dumb, inconsiderate, etc I'm beating myself up over all of that right now. I'm a fucking moron. I considered stopping at one point because morally it is wrong and I felt wrong about doing it but my friends told me it was fine since the state takes so much from us already. Regardless, it was still my choice to continue. I am an idiot.


Today, I stole $20 and my supervisors pulled me aside to let me know they caught me, and they tried to get a confession out of me. I held my ground, said I didn't do it, despite them having solid evidence of me doing it (no video, no confession, just a sheet designed to catch people like me.). At one point they mentioned the police, still stuck to my guns. One of them said whatever happens happens, and that I might lose my position. Later he confronted me and said that no matter what happens, its not personal and he's just doing his job. He was very emotional.


I don't care about losing this job. I do care about jail time, or any long term consequences. I probably can't avoid the latter. I love my life right now and I did fuck up big time. I did a stupid thing, stealing from my job. Most people are telling me to stick to my guns, others are telling me to come clean. Honestly, I don't really know what to do. I just don't want to lose my life over this. I feel horrible about betraying everyones trust like that. What do you guys think?",11Aug2019,2
132,"Ok to start things off I just want to say that both my parents are amazing people, this post might paint them both in a bad light respectively but I have nothing but love and respect for both of them.

Now for the problem

So, my parents have been married happily (for the most part) for 17 years. They both work but my dad is mostly the money bringer in the family and by that I mean he earns 5× as much as my mom and that's not considering the assets that he is set to inherit.
This has afforded our family a decent life wich I'm grateful for.

Now let me provide you a with a bit of context,
My dad is a really kind and caring man he doesn't mind putting himself in uncomfortable situations so that the rest of us are happy and he doesn't let anyone be mad at him he's always apologetic and constantly tries to work things out even if he's in the right (at least with his family).

The problems started to arise fairly receently when my mom started to ask for things that were unnecessary like a second car when our family didn't need it at all our car is only 4 years old and my dad doesn't use it so it's pretty much available whenever she needs it. My parents would argue about it often my sister would take my mother's side mostly because she's 12 and doesn't really understand the importance of money so she just sees the car as nice thing that she would have with no drawbacks, as for me I stayed away from the argument.

Now a couple of nights ago I wanted to go out with some friends, I told my mom and went to get dressed as I was about to leave my dad stopped and told me not to go out, we got into an argument and it got heated but it eneded with me having to stay.
A few minutes later he came to talk with me and try to make things right between us so we talked for a while, I could see that he was visibly upset while talking so I asked what was wrong, he tried to avoid the question but I insisted he answers so eventually he told me that him and mom have getting into alot of arguements recently and that most of the arguments were about me, you see my mom feels that I don't spend enough time with the family (they travel every week to a small beach house with my grandparents and spend the weekend) these trips got boring for me as there is really nothing to do so I just stopped going with them since I was 12, apparently this really upset my mom but instead of talking to me she decided to let my dad deal with me. And apparently my dad have been the buffer to every argument in the house so for the last 7 years my dads days consisted of him waking up to go to work at 8 am, coming back from work at 8 pm, having to listen to a new arguement and resolve it then going to sleep to repeat the cycle everyday. However that wasn't the worst part my mom has been spending an obscene amount of money each month, me and my sister weren't much better either it got to the point where between the 3 of us we were spending double sometimes triple what my parents earned every month ,if all of that weren't enough apparently my mom has been demanding that my dad sell our current house (which is large enough and in a good neighbourhood and is very close to were they both work) to buy a slightly larger one in a very expensive part of the city which is not necessarily a better part of the city. This move would put our family in a large amount of debt and would not be beneficial at all but no matter how many times my dad tried to explain that she would just shrug him off or give him the silent treatment.

A combination of every thing I've mentioned has led my father into a depression for the last couple of months, he truly believes that a divorce would make him a happier man but he doesn't want to do it as he still loves my mom and doesn't want to break our family apart.

I really don't know what to do with this information I feel the reason my mom has gotten more unrealistic with her demands is because my father never could say no to her and every argument they got in he made sure that she wasn't mad at him even if she clearly was in the wrong which gave her the idea that she was always right and that she would win every arguement.

I really want to help my dad out so any advice would be greatly appreciated.",11Aug2019,1

They had complete disappeared and after a few years, recently contacted me and acted as nothing had happened. (We were best friends who liked each other but weren’t actually together - talked nearly every minute of every day, even when I switched schools, that’s why the disappearance was so strange and painful)

While we were messaging, I had to bring it up.. I was angry and began venting and she was kind of acting like she unaware of what they did. 

Now, she is starting to do the same shit she did before the falling out, as if we were just picking up where we left off - asking for advice, venting to me, saying things like “you’re the only person I trust”.. after 4 years.

She will always have a place in my heart but I’ve been considering just cutting all ties with her as I don’t want to end up in that kind of scenario again. But I’m 21. I’m not sure if I’m being dramatic or immature about it and I don’t know what to do..

142,I am 21 years old and ever since I was little I have been addicted to masturbation and porn. It's too much to get in detail as to how it started but I just wish the things I went through would have never happened. It all started when I was 5 years old if that is even possible. When I was in 6 the grade I let a guy touch my butt and when I was in 8th grade I got my first bf. Our whole relationship pretty much revolver around sexting. I feel so bad and I wish I could take it back but it was all I knew since I was little. No one knows about both my addictions but I just wish that things could be different. I have had to live with these addictions for 16 years and I have no one to talk to about. If I do people will just judge me. I feel like these addictions had enabled me to do much in the word and I think of myself as someone who is not worth of anything or anyone. I haven't had a bf since 8th grade and I am scared to open up myself to anyone. I always settle for less and never go for more. I don't know how to change and I feel lonely. I regret having done what I did and I know I'm young but I feel like there is not much in the world for me and that good things will not come to me. I feel like no guy is ever going to love me.

146,"TL;DR 

I'm sure that I'll fail an exam horribly and if my parents see that they'll destroy/get rid of my laptop. I am now under a lot of stress and feelings of hopelessness and worry. (see last part)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a lazy student when it comes to studying who spends most of the time on a laptop, which is my most valuable possession as of now. My grades last year were above average, but the opposite is now happening for one of my subjects. The test scores I have aren't good. I wanted to make up for it through the exam, but I was in for a shock. Despite my efforts to study, I was not able to finish the test (which almost guaranteed a highest possible score of 75% which is the passing grade), and if I recall correctly, I left a few items blank on the first part of the test which will be checked by a machine, and that might screw with my score.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, I have been experiencing feelings of hopelessness, depression, and anxiety NOT because I feel that I will fail the subject, but because of what my parents will do once they see my grade. My dad is willing to permanently remove my laptop, the object that I value the most, if he sees that I am failing and that I'm spending most of my time on it. By ""permanently remove,"" I mean destroy in front of your face. It's that easy for him to decide and do something. I don't want that. I am legitimately afraid of having that to happen to me. I have told him before that ""I'll make up for it,"" but I doubt that he will listen now, despite actually making up for my bad grades in the past. He also thinks only of the present. He doesn't care if I can still get a good grade at the end, if he sees me with a (temporary) failing grade, in his point of view I already failed the subject for the whole semester, and there's nothing I can do to change that. He rarely listens to me and always thinks that he is right.

&amp;#x200B;

If that happens, I'll lose friends, entertainment, motivation, and happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

It might be impossible to change the outcome of this, but here I am on Reddit, asking for advice. Is there a way to convince my (narrow-minded and has problems understanding how grades work) dad to not get rid of my laptop? What do I do in the event that I actually lose it permanently? How do I cope with that loss, and how can I find motivation? I feel that once I lose my laptop I'll lose all hope and stay mad at my parents for a while.",11Aug2019,1

149,"Background is that my mum has been emotionally abusive toward me my whole life. Very luckily I am able to enjoy a relationship with her since I have moved away, and we do love each other very much.

However, she likes to spend time with me and recently this has been in the form of road trips in her campervan for maybe a week or so at a time.
And while i appreciate that she wants to take me places, the abuse becomes a lot in such a confined space for long periods of time. My mental health seriously suffers.

And now she wants to do a last minute trip somewhere since summer is ending etcetc and not only do i not want to go, i really never ever want to take another trip with her again. Her actions have been too severe. 

But if i tell her that I know she will be really hurt, and likely blame me. The best case scenario is that it would lead her to seek help for her mental health that she sorely needs, and generally acknowledge my feelings and understand that they are valid, but that i also love her very much. 
Worst case is the opposite and she becomes upset and defensive and our relationship becomes tumultuous again. 

It seems like a risk, and if it goes badly i know she doesn't have any kind of support network, which is a concern. 
On the other hand is there any point at all or will it just result in nothing if I try. 

Should I approach the issue of telling her she is abusive, and that it needs to change if she wants me to be a bigger part of her life?? Is there a gentle method of doing so?

But I feel like I can’t talk with her about how nervous it makes me or that I’m worried if she doesn’t come (I have roughly 2 years until the move) then being together until then is just going to make moving more difficult and heartbreaking because I feel like it will totally unnerve her.

153,"I’m an artist and recently did collaborative work with my friend’s local small business. To preserve my privacy (I’m paranoid) I won’t disclose all the details, but essentially my friend gave me a piece of wood that her boyfriend cut out in the shape of our state (that’s what their company does), and I painted it. I prepped the surface myself, sanding and priming it, and then created a hyperrealistic landscape. It took many hours to paint and it came out very nice. Long story short I shared the final art online and it blew up, got tons of attention and had quite a few buyers lined up. We sold it quickly and they offered me 2/3 profit. I was totally fine with that. Whereas they normally would sell that size wood piece for maybe 50 dollars, we sold it for 300, so it makes sense that they want to keep doing business together. 

So, I had the idea it would be lovely to make prints of my painting and sell them at local events where I sell my work regularly. The problem is I don’t know what percentage, if any really, I owe my friends company. They cut out the wood for me but had no part at all in the painting. When I mocked up an image of how the art would look on prints, I had to draw out the path of the state myself and make everything look crisp and clean. I feel like between painting, processing the image, and handling all packaging/printing/selling logistics, I should be coming out with 90 percent profit and they can have 10. But they want 30 percent per the original deal. It makes me basically not even want to sell it because I don’t like sharing profit on something I poured my entire soul into.

168,"Hi

I was recently internally promoted to an on-site manager. I work for a large, multi-national corporation that contracts staff to hospitals.

I go to a small college with only about 250 students in my graduating class. A friend of mine is applying to work under me because of her interest in medicine. We talked about my job on the phone the other day because she was asking if she should apply. 

I would love to hire her, she is so smart, learns things the right way, and is very pleasant. However, she seems to be expecting the special treatment I got from this company. Let me explain-

I was hired at a good time for personell. Being 19, a freshman in college, and unable to rent my own apartment, the company allowed me to transfer to my home state and work for the summer.  (school requires me to live in the dorms, I go to school out-of-state, thus no apartment) I was very fortunate that this was possible, but it will not happen again now that I am manager. I would not want to appear to the company that I am not grateful for their sacrifice of personell by allowing everyone to leave when they want. Another reason it won't happen again is because the site is currently very low staffed. Even if I were to grant that privilege to someone, it would be an excellent freshman employee who was in my shoes.

On the phone my friend asked about school vacations. I explained that with rotating days off, everyone who wants to can typically go home for the ""big"" breaks, but smaller holidays are sometimes sacrificed. I explained that my situation was not the normal for the company and that I couldn't give her the entire summer and winter breaks off. She didn't seem to catch that and essentially hung up with the premise of ""I'll apply because I can still go home on break."" 

Obviously, an application doesn't mean she will be hired and my superior and I can repeat the staffing expectation in her interview, should she get one. 

I was just wondering if you guys had a better way to phrase this to her? Thanks a bunch",11Aug2019,1

171,"My husband wasn't raised to be religious, we are both atheists. My father-in-law has decided, with the help of his new (5yrs) wife, he wanted to start ""finding jesus"" and getting involved with church. He has been attending and active in his church for roughly the last 4 years. Every time we talk to him, he uses his religion as a way out. If we ask him for help with something, he refuses to help and tells us ""if it is meant to be, jesus will provide"" or ""pray for it"".  This is all fine and well, we are providing for ourselves and surviving as functioning adults should.  

The issue is that he has become the type of Christian who will shove his beliefs down your throat and if you don't believe, then fuck you. He invites us to church every other week and when we tell him we are working (not a lie) he tells us we need to ask for a Sunday off. This week was kindof the last straw for me, and fortunately I wasn't the one talking to him this time. My husband is recovering from jaw surgery, and was once again invited to church, with dad KNOWING we are both off this Sunday. Hubs responded with ""It depends on how I'm feeling."" Dad responded with ""You'll feel fine in the grace of God.""

We don't want to break the old man's heart, or listen to the avalanche of bitching that it would cause, by telling him we don't believe in his religion. We are extremely tolerant of his practices, we aren't rude or dismissive about it by any means - we will even say grace with him at the dinner table. 

Is there a right way to get him to stop inviting us to church, or to get the point across that we will never be interested in going?",11Aug2019,1

I’ve had this problem which has been in and out of the background for some time, however it has come back in full force recently and I don’t want it to come into conflict with the relationships I have made.
 
It seems that whoever someone tells me something about their personal lives that they seem genuinely interested about, I just... don’t care, I guess. This isn’t to say that I wouldn’t like to care, but the deeper feelings within me are just general unpleasant apathy.

I feel as though I am to critical of others and I hyper analyze all of their flaws to the point were I can even view them as inferior to the stupid standard which I can’t seem to wipe from my brain.
 
I am still only in high school, so I know there is much time before my mind has matured, but I am tired of feeling as though no one else matters, and constantly finding others’ attempts at humor as forced and stale or there problems as unimportant.

I’d just like to feel like my thoughts are normal and not those of a sociopath.

175,"Im am 20 and my boyfriend is 23. 

I’m in a fairly new relationship (6 months) but my boyfriend and I have an amazing relationship. We trust each other fully and I’m sure that he is the one because I’ve not felt like this with anyone else, even my ex who I was with for 4 years. Before me, my boyfriend had slept with A LOT of women, these were all one night stands or friends with benefits, I am his first proper girlfriend. He’s reassured me that this phase in his life is over and he is now ready to settle down. 
The number didn’t really bother me because he is good looking and I was expecting it when I started seeing him. He is very open about it if I ever wanted to know which made me even less bothered.
However, this was until I found out that one of the women was someone I hated with a passion, someone I went to school with and still despise to this day, which made me incredibly jealous. I also found out another one was one of his friends that he is still friends with to this day. I’m not sure if I should tell him how I feel or to just leave it because I know it’s the past and there’s nothing that can be done now, but it’s now an issue that I’ve created from the insecurity of it, especially when we go out together and he starts talking to a girl he knows, I just wonder “is she was one of the girls he slept with?” Which then also makes me wonder if I should ask him who he has actually slept with so I stop trying to guess who all the time. I’m not sure what to do and I don’t want this to affect our relationship. Just to add, I’m not worried about him cheating on me or anything like that because like I said we are both very happy, I just feel that I need to address it somehow because it is bothering me, but I don’t want to do it in a way where he feels as if I’m blaming him for something because I know he’s done nothing wrong. Is it right for me to ask him to not speak to these girls if he sees them? Because I know he would be upset if I had spoken to someone I had a past with while he’s stood next to me.",11Aug2019,1
176,"This post isn’t about whether are not you agree with Marxist or far left ideology so please don’t argue with me about it in the comments.

Ever since 8~9th grade I’ve had an interest in the USSR. I was the school’s “meme communist” but once I delved into actual theory I found my self agreeing with it. Sense then I’ve amassed a small collection of soviet/communist things pins, maps, books, flags, and hats. I’m fortunate that my parents have let me freely explore and not restricted what I can be interested in, but they haven’t been excepting with everything. Ex: two years ago I stumbled upon Satanism and was curious in what it was about. After discovering it was an atheistic religion I wanted to read the satanic bible. I bought the book but never got to read it sense my mom found it pretty quickly and I was in questioned out what I had learned. Even though I exclaimed what it was my mother was still convinced it was going to send me into somewhere dark or other bad things. I was grounded for a few months and I stopped my interest.

177,"Okay, Reddit. I've never been more conflicted in my life about anything, so I'm looking for some advice.

Two years ago, I moved from the east coast to the midwest. 1500 miles away. At the time, I was moving in with an allergic roommate, and could not bring my cat, Shadow, with me. So he stayed with my parents on the east coast.

Now, the allergic roommate has finally moved out, and I find myself faced with a dilemma. Do I bring him here? I love him more than anything, I want him here. When I lived with my parents, he slept with me each and every night. When I met him, a total stranger, he immediately nuzzled into me, purring a storm. But is it fair to him? Shadow panics and cries just going for a ride in the car. I can't imagine the experience for him driving, or flying 1500 miles. I couldn't bear the thought of him being put in a plane's cargo hold, whether it's supposedly safe or not. And with all the news stories of pets dying in cargo, I would only trust him in the passengers area with someone. Currently, I'm not in a position to fly out and get him, and my father can't bring him to me. Even then, I fear Shadow would yowl worse than any crying baby. I'd have to sedate him to spare him and the rest of the passengers such grief. Or whatever pet transportation company I hired would have to--but could I really trust them not to just put him in cargo and say they did otherwise?

Even through the hardship, I'd like to bring him here. He was my best friend in the latter years of my childhood, and now my parents have a dog that traps him downstairs. (He's not aggressive, just excitable, so the cats stay downstairs to avoid him.) But I wouldn't just be rescuing him from a spazzy dog. I'd be pulling him away from everything he's ever known. He's lived in that house since he was eight weeks old, and now he's some twelve or fourteen years old. He has two other cats he's lived with for most of his life, along with the rest of my family.

There were three other cats.. but one died not too long ago. I was crushed--it was actually Shadow's son. I felt this horrible guilt for not being there for him. Maybe I could've prevented it, I'll never know. But this cat had a bad habit of eating plastic and other things he shouldn't have, and we assume that's how he died. But now, I am terrified, absolutely petrified that Shadow will die and I won't be there for him. I'll miss his last years, days, hours.  I don't know how to deal with that and just typing it has me on the verge of tears. I only get to see him once a year when I visit for the holidays and last year, it felt like he'd forgotten who I was.

I don't know if he'd be happier here, with me. I can't know. I wish, I *wish* I could ask him. I have the financial ability to take good care of him, but is it fair of me to throw him into a wildly new environment to be with me when he's content where he is? Would he be lonely here? Do I get a kitten or another cat to keep him company, or would that be even more of a shock to his system? I just don't know what to do. Would bringing him here be too much for him in what years he has left?

180,"I quit my job as a medical receptionist that I held for two years. Whenever I was hired, I never had any formal training so I was trained on a “learn as I go” basis. This was because the office never installed any formal training plan for new hires and no employee (until I came along) would give the time of day to train new hires comprehensively.

I resigned a month ago and in my resignation letter, my reason was that I decided to pursue my education full-time. However, the true reason was that I did not get along with my new supervisor who had been hired in about mid February. 

My sup and I got along really well at first. I felt respected and I even trained her. (By the way, something important to note is that during the entire duration of my employment, I have been responsible for training every new employee that has been hired. And I’m damn good at it.) Anyway, I suspected something was going on but it was definitely apparent when this new girl was hired. My supervisor became cold, condescending, unfriendly, and she jumped on me over petty, insignificant things. 

Meanwhile, our employee turnover rate became extremely high once the new supervisor was hired. Up to today, at least seven employees, including me, quit within the 6 months that the supervisor has worked there. 

Anyway, the office manager reached out to me to ask me what my real reason was for quitting and I told him the truth. I told him all of my issues with the supervisor. He messaged me back and told me that two new employees resigned for the same reasons as me and he asked me to return to train some new employees. He also told me that the supervisor resigned. 

The thing is though, I gave the manager a chance to hear me out about my issues with the supervisor yet he did not have my back. The day I quit, I asked the practice manager to meet with me and the supervisor because I was tired of her mistreatment of me. I told her that I could tell her attitude towards me changed and I felt like I was walking on eggshells around her. I told her I felt she was condescending and cold and unfriendly. 

Of course she denied everything and then she took out a list of incidences that she had written down where she felt like I was disrespectful, insubordinate, and she told me I was “inconsistent in my customer service”! 

SHE HAD BEEN WRITING DOWN MY MISTAKES AND INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THEM WITH ME, SHE WROTE THEM DOWN TO USE AGAINST ME. In this case, whenever I was confronting her about her shitty treatment of me! These incidences/mistakes happened weeks ago! And she claimed that she had addressed these mistakes with me however, if that were the case, there wouldn’t have been any reason for her to write them down because they would have already been addressed!

I e-mailed my resignation letter as soon as I got home. I was never going to give her the opportunity to do that to me again and I wasn’t going to give her any more of my energy. 

TL;DR The manager didn’t hear me out about my issues with the supervisor so I quit. Two more new employees quit for the exact same reasons as me so the manager wants me to come back and train new people. The supervisor resigned after 7 employees quit during her 6 months of employment. 

How do I negotiate my terms for coming back? I am not an assertive person and I’m kind of a doormat. 

1) I was making $17.25 so I want to go up to $18.50 and/or I want full-time benefits (mainly PTO) as a part-time employee since I am taking college courses and won’t be able to work on Monday and Wednesday.

2) I want to be considered for the supervisor position.

183,"Hi Reddit, I recently started a job in a field I absolutely love and genuinely enjoy - and what's amazing is that I landed the job almost straight away after graduating college. There is still a lot to learn, and I'm trying to take in as much as I can every day I'm at the job.

Not even two whole weeks into the job, I overhear my coworkers talking badly about me - about my lack of experience in the area, about how I wasn't contributing enough, how weird I did things, how ""I wasn't all there"" etc. Of course I was hurt and my confidence really took a hit and my work and progress started suffering. I'm making tons more stupid and avoidable mistakes because I'm rushing or because I'm nervous, and every mistake I make just makes me even more depressed and anxious. Sometimes when I ask questions, my coworkers look at me like I'm an idiot (or trade glances), so I'm afraid to ask further questions/clarifications or to reach out for help with something I'm unsure about.

Literally as I'm typing this up and thinking about work, my Apple Watch tells me heart rate is racing at almost 90BPM - I know that's not healthy. I've never been in a situation like this. I'm getting less than 5 hours sleep a night (and its interrupted), my stomach turns at the thought of going into work and facing my colleagues, I've had no appetite and I've stopped enjoying doing activities I used to like. Every minute of the day I'm thinking about work. The mistakes I've made, the comments I heard. I'm starting to believe I can't do my job properly and I'm unqualified. What's worse is that they've started to make the comments within earshot (not even a metre away from me) and while not directly saying my name, I know from the context that it's me.

The thing is, I've done well in the past when I was interning for different companies since every successful task I completed helped build my confidence in my work and because I felt well supported, I experienced a lot of growth. I did well in university too, graduating with first class honours. But this place, Reddit, makes me feel like an incompetent fool to the point where I feel like I can't even complete a simple task properly. 

I'm not sure I can make any progress or grow my skills here. Should I just wave the white flag, say goodbye and try my luck elsewhere? I imagine that quitting my first real job in my field will hurt my chances of success of employment in this area, however if I am not growing my skills and taking steps backwards instead of forwards, what is the point in staying?

An Assistant Manager position is opening up, and I know that I am qualified to do it, that I would just have to learn a different scheduling program, and tie a few loose ends of things I'm not quite sure of given the new work environment.
I talked to my Manager about getting an interview for the job and was almost immediately denied. She kept repeating that, ""It's very rare for someone to go from this position to Assistant Manager, without first being a supervisor."" I had to remind her of my previous work experience and brought up that our location does not even offer a supervisor position. I told her that I would like to advance at this location. She kept bringing up how rare, ""but not unheard of,"" it is to jump that position and that we would see about moving me to another store as supervisor after holiday. She says she has high expectations for the AM position as the first person she hired had 10+ years of management experience and our current AM has a degree.
The thing is I do not want to move locations and I know I have the prior experience to do an excellent job in that position.

My thoughts will just always be centered around whatever it is from the time I get out of bed in the morning all day long whenever my mind isn’t occupied.

My newest focus is him and wanting him to like me- which is silly because I don’t want a relationship right now and he’s a bad person. 

I feel like I’m only living for the two days awake I spend the night with him. I see myself abandoning the good relationship I had with my long term ex, disregarding my friends to be with him, and changing who I am (drinking more, smoking, etc)

It’s very frustrating being able to recognize all of these things and not be able to fix them. Would therapy help? What kind of therapy? And is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this?

Tl; dr: I act on obsessive thoughts to the point where it’s unhealthy and I am tired but don’t know how to change",11Aug2019,1

190,"About an hour ago (3am) I was walking home and a woman that I had just seen sitting with some dude started screaming, I ran back and he was on her trying to pull something from her hands. I yelled, tried to pull them off but the dude was locked on hard and way bigger than me (im like 5'5) I didnt want to turn it violent but I could just do nothing as she screamed for help.

After some shouting I learned one of them had stolen a pipe and they were wrestling over it. I tried more prying, yelled, walked around, stood there like an idiot, let them fight and eventually one of them got it and the dude walked off. 

Needless to say she wasnt grateful and asked while crying why I didnt pull him off. Long story short I called the cops but she had run off by then. Only thing is, I thought it was serious at first but hesitated to actually attack this guy because i didnt want to want to escalate things and get rekt.

It may sound petty, but I cant stop thinking about this and I feel ashamed and cowardly. Im 22 jittery as hell and have never been in this situation before but always tell myself Id do the right thing, did I? I feel like a fake man and a coward.",11Aug2019,1
192,"We're a very open family. We do our best to try and not judge people, live and let live, and try to be accepting of everyone for who they are. I'm also big into minding our own business, staying in our lane, not worrying about other people and the choices they make. 

Our kids are very accepting of everyone. I mean, they have their moments, but they really don't judge people or bully. Way different from when I was a kid in the 80s. We openly talk about pretty much every subject matter that sparks their interest and curiosity. My wife and I try not to censor life in our house like our parents did. Again. 80s. 

Either way, my wife's brother is transgender. He still prefers to be called by his birthname and doesn't mind if the kids call him uncle and if me and wife still refer to him as a him and a brother. He doesn't let little shit bother him. Either way, until recently, he was very private about being transgendered. The kids didn't know. I wasn't supposed to know, but my wife tells me everything, so I knew. Either way, he made the choice to stop hiding who he really was a person, and he started living life fulltime as a woman.

Our kids had questions, but they really didn't miss a beat when their uncle started coming around wearing dresses and makeup. They love their uncle. I think it actually made the kids more comfortable with him and even closer to him. My brother-in-law did a great job explaining his situation to the kids, so they could understand how he feels and the choices he makes. 

My two middle children just told me and my wife today that they're uncomfortable being in public with their uncle. This angered my wife, and -- at first -- I basically shut the whole thing down, and told them they're better than that. I was actually a little over-the-top in my reaction because I could see my wife was really upset by this. But after further explaining from the kids, it's not that they have a problem with their uncle. At. All. They just don't like the attention he gets when they go downtown with him or to the movies.

When I'm in public with my brother-in-law, I do notice a lot of people do stop and stare or make comments. It's going to happen. But I'm an adult, and people judge, and I really don't let it bother me. My kids are seriously upset about people staring at them when they're out with their uncle. I really don't know how to handle this situation. I don't want to make my kids uncomfortable, but I don't want to hurt my wife's brother's feelings by asking him to tone it down or something like that when he takes the kids out. I mean, I'm just not going to go there. I also don't want this to become more of an issue than it became today. Like, if I just ignore it and not address it, I'm worried the kids will end up saying something about it or eventually acting out. 

Really, the whole thing is this: My kids hate assholes who stare, and my brother-in-law gets stared at wherever he goes. My kids do not give a fuck about their uncle being transgender. It really doesn't bother them. We're a very close family who gets along great, and I'm super sensitive around my wife's brother because I don't want him to think I'm judgmental (I know he'd feared this at one point), and I really know he does live struggles that I wouldn't want to deal with.

What should I do? I really feel like I should try to get the kids to be more understanding and not make a big deal about it. But they're really upset by the situation, and I don't want them to either say something offensive without meaning it or to stop spending time with their uncle. They're very close to him. I mean, when they're not with him, they're talking to him on Instagram and FB. It's an all day thing. He's a cool uncle. I don't want that to get ruined.

Should my wife say something to her brother about the kids' concerns? Or should we just have our kids lock-it-up and deal with people being people? Because -- at the end of the day -- there are always going to people who judge and make us uncomfortable. It's just something that's going to happen in all walks of life. 

There's got to be a right way to handle this situation that doesn't make anyone uncomfortable or hurt feelings.",11Aug2019,2

My boyfriend of over a year is going to public school this year. We’ve been long distance the entire time we’ve been dating and we’ve also been home schooled (both of us) the entire time too. But his mom has this crazy new schedule for him that it’s barely letting us talk during the day. He has to go to sleep by 9:30pm which is 8:30 my time and he doesn’t even text me til around 7pm or 8pm my time which doesn’t give us a lot of time. I’ve been very demanding of him which I know isn’t right but I’ve also never been in a serious relationship to know when I’m asking of too much from him... and he’s too sweet and loves me too much to let me know until he snaps which has been all he’s done lately... I know he’s stressed and he doesn’t mean it and he just needs me to not be so demanding and just wants me to be supportive... and I want to be but so much is changing and he’s not giving me anytime to adjust but he hasn’t even adjusted himself and I just... how do I adjust and be myself again? I’ve lost myself while dating him because it’s my first and I want it to be my last relationship... I’m in love with him and he means everything to me he’s my best friend my baby my baba bear and I just... I want to be with him forever and I know he wants the same I just don’t know how to adjust to not having all his attention all the time and it’s just... idk it hurts my heart and makes me sad and...

Also I'm not really comfortable showing him my body because I know he's an absolute porn freak but I'm scared if I say no I might lose him.

What should I say to him? It kind of pisses me off with how sexual he is towards me and I don't like it. I'm afraid of him having strong sexual feelings towards me which I feel like will happen if I do send them.

202,"My husband and I are currently looking to buy our first home. We saw a property on Friday that is a bank owned foreclosure. It looked it pretty good condition. Good price. Great school district. The inside needs updating but otherwise things liked pretty good. We liked it enough to put a bid on it. We won't hear anything until next week. 

Well today we decided to drive by the house and look at it again from the outside. We parked on the opposite side of the street this time and suddenly noticed tarp covering the top half of the roof. The home is a two story and the roofing we could see prior to this looked fine. So we were pretty shocked to see the tarp. 

I'm not sure our options now. We love the house and area. But roofing is a major repair. I rechecked every ad online about the house and there is nothing mentioning the roof. In fact the one picture of the front of the house is too bright at the top so you can't really make out the roof. 

Obviously our offer hasn't been accepted or declined yet. But if it were to be accepted, what options would we have if any? Could we ask for the bank to make the repairs to the roof?",11Aug2019,1

Ive even contemplated joining the military even though i really would rather not.

Idc if its even some sort of fun type of odd job.

205,"I'm 14 and I'm in Australia so graduated primary school in yr 6 (12 yrs old) went to high school at yr 7 (13 years old) and moved to a safer upper middle-class school for yr 8. I went to an event my primary school holds every year and everyone is so different and fucked up and it's freaking me out.

I had a good friend in yr 6. We were mature for 12 years olds and he was kinda dorky and awkward and hit puberty pretty early. Now he looks the same but he has a yr 9 girlfriend he brought to the event. All his friends look old and wear baggy hipster clothes. He's wearing triple Balenciagas and has a Louis Vuitton bag. He has ripped jeans with wallet chains and an Astro world hoodie. He now smokes fucking weed at 13 with a girl I used to have a crush on and posts it on snapchat. All the girls act wayy too mature and wear crop tops and nail/eyelash extensions and smoke/drink. They're going to parties and I'm just here watching youtube wondering wtf happened? Everyone has matured way to fast and I thought I was prepared and ready but now I want to go back to when everyone acted like 12-year-olds and not fucking 19. I'm scared and everyone around me is like ""Yeah what about it"" but I can't get over it. In yr 6 I felt older and more mature than everyone but suddenly now I feel like I'm the one behind. 

Is this fucking normal? 13 - 14-year-olds smoking weed and fucking at parties?

212,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I (18,M) have known this girl (18,F) for about a year, liked her for about as long. She liked me back the entire time. We never got around to dating because she was in a relationship at the time, and we both lacked the courage to come forward with how we feel. We recently both got single around two months back, and finally realized we've both liked each other for all this time. We decided to give dating a try, because we both liked each other a lot, and have an insane level of compatibility as people. We both have a really bad track record with relationships, which is something to keep in mind.

We ended up dating for a little over a week, which is when she broke up with me. She did a lot of overthinking and got freaked out by her feelings for me because she's never been good with dealing with them. She also thought she had feelings for this other guy, which turned out to be false and just her overthinking. We barely talked for the next month and whenever we did, there was some passive aggressiveness, and remorse. 

We got back to talking after a month, and found out that we both still like each other. However, I was about to leave our hometown to go to college, while she was staying. We went out once, and it was great, and we decided to keep doing this without the label and see where it took us. I moved states that week, and it was a really shitty feeling. But we kept talking, hours on end and both our feelings just grew. Eventually, we both fell in love with each other. There was no way I couldn't either, I know for a fact that this is the perfect girl for me.

We kept doing this for well over a month or so, when she ended things again. She has a shitty situation with her family right now, and she needs to do extremely good in college so her family can't hold that over her head. She couldn't focus in class or her assignments because she kept thinking about us. So, she ended things and said we should stick to being friends, not because she doesn't love me, but because she can't afford to be invested in anyone right now. Also, she hates long distance because she's convinced they're never going to work because of a botched relationship her brother had long distance.

That was 1-2 weeks ago. We talk once in a while. I am honestly not the most mentally stable person and have genuine mental health issues. I've had a rough early couple of years, and have bad abandonment issues. I don't understand how we ended up like this because this was the one thing that looked like it would work. My feelings for her haven't gone down even a little bit, I can't focus on anything, and all I can think of is her and how great it was. I know it's stupid and borderline pathetic, but I don't know how to not feel this way.

I've come home this week because I was feeling really homesick and needed a breather from college, and we decided to meet so we could talk things out. We met yesterday. We still have chemistry, it was evident. She said that there wasn't another way, and that we'd have to do this. I could tell she didn't want this either, and she really doesn't. It's evident that she feels how I feel too. She explicitly said she does too, but she doesn't know what to do about this, and she's scared. I don't know what to do. We're both retreating into ourselves as people. We're both really introverted and kind of helped each other break out of our shells a little.

I don't know how to go back to being platonic with her, because I can't seem to get over her even a little. Even during the one month when we barely talked, I still couldn't hate her. I can't not feel for her. It's so retarded. So, now we're both in a place where we don't know what to do. Seeing each other sad sucks, and we're both depressed. Where we are now doesn't feel right to either of us.

I apologise for rambling along for this long, I just don't really have opportunities to vent or explain how I feel. Any advice on what I/we should do would be greatly appreciated. We both want to not give this up, but don't know how to. All advice is welcome. I will be answering any questions you have in the comments.",11Aug2019,1

I still think about you. Years later, new people met, new memories made, but I still come back to you. It doesn’t matter what I do, who I see, or where I go. You’re on my mind. Im beginning to think it’ll never change. Did I make a massive mistake by not chasing after you with everything I had? Or am I just romanticizing all it. Is the way I remember it nothing like it really happened? Am I putting you on a pedestal?... sometimes I hope that’s the case, but when I truly think about it... I can’t deny that what I remember is what happened. The conversations we had and the time we spent together was undeniably exactly as amazing as I remember it to be. Sometimes I think I made a massive mistake not chasing after you after your mom passed. I didn’t because I was absolutely terrified of you thinking I was swooping in while you were vulnerable. Remember when you hugged me in the kitchen that second night I came over? Remember the look your friends mom gave us? If you noticed. It was a “oooooo” look and man... that scared the shit out of me. The last thing I wanted you thinking was I was only there because I wanted to date you. That wasn’t the case at all. Not that I didn’t want to... I did! But I didn’t want you to think I was trying to take advantage of a shitty situation or something. I just wanted to be there for you. But then maybe I made a mistake by not making a move... when you kissed *insert name* in front of me after that girls funeral.. I’ve never felt anything like that before. It was like time froze and someone hit me in the gut at the same time. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I know that probably sounds beyond lame and stupid, but it’s honestly how I felt. 

I can certainly say you were my first true love and I know people say that you never forget your first... so I guess I’ll have to live with the constant pain of wondering what could’ve been. I don’t really know why I’m writing this... I guess it helps sort of to type it out. I was reading through our old messages on Facebook and damn do I miss how we used to talk... it was so easy.

She asked me if I wanted to join them.

I guess the idea of both of them was already that I would agree, because she had a lot of ideas already - some of them very cute which I kinda considered. I guess.

This morning (it's currently 7am) she send some more ideas and the more I think about it the more I'm not happy with the idea.

I haven't spoken to her in 2 years.
I haven't seen her in idek how many years.
I don't need something permanent on me to remind me of this person I barely I know.

222,"Okay so this is going to be really long and maybe confusing but desperately need help.

So I have to children to my ex who well call ""W"". We've always gotten along really well after our break up and stayed good friends (bar when he got addicted to meth and became obsessed with me but that's a whole other story).
About 1.5 years after our break-up he got a girlfriend - we'll call her ""R"" - which was great, she seemed nice enough and even expressed to me how great she thought it was that W and I could remain friends and she like my kids  (then aged almost 3 and 4) so I was happy for him.
They moved in together after being together for about 3 weeks. Seemed a little rushed but to each their own, right.
As soon as they started living together he stopped answering my calls and pick up and drop off of the kids went from W coming inside for sometimes an hour at a time to him co ming to the door, rushing the kids inside and not even saying hello. He would pick the kids up and not let me know when they would be coming home. By the second day I'd be trying to call to find out but he would very rarely answer my calls.
He once went 4 days without answering my calls and just turned up out of the blue on the 4th day to dropped them off. This went on for about 2 months.
About a month into their relationship my kids who were both fully toilet trained apart from my youngest who only wore nappies (diapers? I'm Australian so different terminology) to bed started wetting themselves randomly. It progressively got worse and worse to the point that it would be at least 5 times a day and at the time I didn't see the red flags.
W's 2 older children (then aged 7 &amp; 9) who I was a stepmother to for 5 year while W and I were together (I still looked after them while their mum - who well call ""B"" - went to work even after the break up) informed me that R had hit my youngest child.
My kids were still in W and R's care at this stage but were coming home that day.
When W got to the door to drop the kids off I tried to tell him that I needed to talk to him but he dismissed me both times and ran off as quickly as he could, like always.
I asked my kids about it and they confirmed.
I messaged W to let him in know that I needed to speak to him in person at his next pick up to see what tf this was all about but we never for that far.
Fast forward a couple of days, it's my youngest 3rd birthday and W and I had always split birthday down the middle so I was going to hand them over when they had lunch and after I'd spoken to him about the hitting thing.
W and R had moved into a new house about a 40min drive away. He asked me to meat him about 10mins away from his house so I told him I might as well just drop them off at his house as I'm already travelling more than half way and that way I knew where my kids would be too.
He said nok and insisted I meet at his requested location and when I asked why his response was ""You don't need to know where R and I live, I'll meet you at *location* and hung up ."" I was pretty taken back and had no idea what to think but was now getting pretty suspicious about their intentions. W's oldest child said she knew where it was and showed myself and B on Google maps. I messaged him and said I knew his address so I might as well just drop her off, he can come out to the car and grab them and I'll speak to him as he gets them out of car seats.
He immediately calls me and first thing he yells at me is ""ALRIGHT GET OVER HERE BUT YOU BETTER TURN UP WITH BOXING HELMET ON"" I was like WHAT the actual f and said ""excuse me?!"" He replied ""YOU HEARD ME! GET THE F**K HERE NOW!"" I hung up and put it down to him being back on meth as he's only been clean for maybe 3 or so months at that stage. I asked his brother if he knew of anything going on with W. He said it seemed like W was back on it and told me if he were me he wouldn't be sending them to stay there at all.
I told W my concerns and I immediately get a call from him. When I answered though it was R. She immediately started screaming abuse at me, telling me I'm disgusting and shouldn't even have custody of my kids which is where I saw red. I can't remember exactly what I said but it was sokmething the effect of ""how dare you speak to me like that about my children."" Hung up and ignorees their calls for the rest of the day.

B actually knows someone who dated R and the mother of this mans kids who R was a step mother to for 2 years. Well call the mother M.
B contacts M and basically says sorry for the random message but did you have any problems with R?
M replies something like ""Omg don't tell me she's started already. You need to get yourself a lawyer now.""
B and I met up with M to talk about what her and her kids went through at the hands of R.
She told us of some absolutely disgusting emotional and physical abuse that R had put her kids through, and that even to this day they were still wetting themselves. 
That's when I realized that she was doing this to my children and my heart broke into a million pieces in that moment.
She told us of how her children are still seeijng psychologists, and  the psychs still have been able to get the full extent of abuse out of her son as he was subjected to the worst of the abuse.
M told us about R trying to eliminate her out of her own children's lives. R would never let M touch her own children when she was around, forced their dad to fight for 50/50 care when he'd only ever had every second weekend for the previous 6 years and was content with that.
Even went as far as just not sending the children back to M for over 2 weeks. Constant threats and abuse.
Went as far as gp ing to the police and saying that M's boyfriend was molesting the the little girl.
After the first complaint was looked into and dismissed by police R went to a different police station to complain.

So there was no way I was ever having my children aroujnd her ever again.
After a few days of try to get W to meet me somewhere and talk about what was going on R started abusing me, belittling me and making up crazy accusations. Luckily M had advised me to install an app to record phone calls so I had proof.
It progressed to where they were threatening to kick my door in, bash me and take the kids and move to a different state. They even began calling my parents. My dad once receive over 100 phone calls in the space of a couple of hours.
After a particularly bad phone call from R, B and I were both granted emergency restraint orders which also protected the children. 
Before the pollice had even had a chance to serve her W had called with even worse abuse than normal and we were also granted family violence orders.
Fast forward 1 year. Our restraining orders have run out. R turns up outside my house the very next day sitting in her car pointing at me and laughing like a literal maniac for maybe a minute then drives off.
2 days later the kids are spending tiime with their dad (6 hours a fortnight, supervised by his brother. Restraining order was amended so that R could be there when the kids were spending time with their dad as agreed to by me.) I drop kids off at meeting point and end up behind them on the way back home. They pull over outside my street and I'm like ?? Weird but what ever.
As I p I'll into my drive way who is driving past my house beeping, laughing and waving her hands around with just herself in the car, my kids obviously waiting okn the side of the road with W.
I message him telling him I wasn't impressed and this wasn t conducive to a healthy co parenting relationship.
R pretending to be W (I can tell the difference because W is dyslexic) informs me that I imagined at and as a result of this they will be keeping my children indefinitely and I'm not mentally stable. They can do that now that the restrainijng order has expired.
I go to our meeting point at pick up time and thank God they brought the kids back.
I run down there to get my babies before she plays some kind of sick joke and drives off just to taunt me.
As I get closer I'm holding my hands out telling the kids we need to go. 
She puts my daughter down and starts having a go and me because ""how dare you come anywhere near me"" I honestly just told her to fuck off AND SHE STARTS PUNCHING ME IN THE FACE IN FEONT OF MY KIDS! I'm pushing her away and when I finally hit her back, W PUNCHES ME IN THE FACE. I fell to the ground like a sack of potatos. My bf the comes running down to fucking help me obviously (which I guess could have been seen as agvressive by W) and W pulls a FULL SIZE AXE out of the front seat of the car and threatens to slut his throat, all the I'm in a bent over kneeling position because R is choking me for Litterally about 7 minutes straight. I can her my kids screaming hysterically ""mum"" over and over again and I'm just begging her to let me go while she's whispering abuse in my ear.
When my bf was done with W he came over to R and I and screamed at her to let me go
 She eventually did.
I've applied for another restraining order but for 3 years this time.
She's fighting to have the kids taken off of it which terrifies me.
There are multiple other incidents myself and many other people that I've had cotact with have had with her that gives me absolutely no doubt that she's a low functioning sociopath who has chosen myself, B and our kids as her latest victims.
So what the actual f do I do.
I try to ignore her, I went a whole year without contact but she was still waiting to start on me once the 12 months were over.
I've block both their numbers and don't answer price numbers or even numbers that I don't know as she even had her sister calling me! I'm constantly looking over my shoulder everywhere I go as she's followed both myself and B multiple times.
She's such a good manipulator that she manages to convince everyone that it's B and I  that are victimising her. Like I'm at a loss.
I need help. My lawyer say there isn't my she can do, police are slack even when I send them reminders.",11Aug2019,1

225,"I want to be a nurse. I have two colleges that are ten minutes away from me. Community or private. I’ll most likely go to community, but if I graduate early I believe it’ll open more doors for scholarships at the private school. 

I’m currently a junior in online high school. It’s accredited and reviewed 4.9 stars one every site I’ve seen, and is in the top 5 best online high schools in the USA. So I can graduate from there but it wouldn’t be for another half year or so. I have 5 credits left so I’d be able to finish senior year early, but I wouldn’t be able to go to college until next year, or late. 

My grandma OWNS a school, and she’s the teacher. It’s for adults and regular high school students. Kind of like a GED school but she gives high school diplomas. She’s listened in my state and has been running for 50+ years. 

I may be biased by privilege but I feel like maybe the current school I’m in now is better. Does it even matter where you graduate high school from? Cus I still feel like a diploma is a diploma, regardless. 

It would mean a lot to my grandma if I went to her school but I’m still thinking about my future here. If I went to her school then I could finish in time for the 2019-2020 college year, instead of 2020-2021.

We've been hanging out since but girl B has been yelling at her because according to girl A girl B likes me a bit. I don't have feelings for girl B as she is a bit dramatic and has threatened to kill girl A.

228,"This happened earlier today and I can’t think of a solution or what precautions to take. 


My wife and I had a baby on June 4th so he’s still pretty new and we are pretty protective of him right now. I’m not sure if this is playing into my paranoia or if I am rightfully worried. 


We have neighbors 2 houses down from us that had a baby 3 days ago and the baby was taken from their care because they can’t have custody of their children because they aren’t mentally competent of handling children (so they say). They have one of their children living with them now but legally the custody belongs to the wife’s mother who also lives with them.



While they were in the hospital for delivery they were told that they would be able to be with the baby for three days and then the baby would be put into a foster home until they could go to court and somehow regain custody of their children. While they were in the hospital she told the nurse that when the baby was taken she would feel like killing herself. The nurse reported it and she was put on suicide watch and the baby was taken then and there. She was released 24 hours later and now they’ve been texting and coming to our house to see our baby because they say it’ll help them with their emotions. 


Cut to earlier today and my wife said that k (the wife) was acting strange and spent 700$ at Walmart buying a ton of stuff for the baby saying the judge said she would get custody on Tuesday. This is doubtful as they have three other children non of which are in their custody. My wife and I are under the impression that the stress of the situation has caused some sort of mental state that could be dangerous to our family. I’m at work right now and can’t stop thinking about what could be happening within their house. Are they thinking about taking our baby? Unlikely but that’s my worst case scenario. 


What do I do? I can’t call the police because she hasn’t done anything. If I tell her no to come around that might aggravate her into something more dangerous... Any advice is appreciated.",11Aug2019,2

He has seen so many doctors over time and while he doesn't have nearly the pain he used to he still has enough that it impacts his life. On top of that over the past year he's been seeking treatment for his mental health and has had very little luck as so far his depression has been resisting treatment. Despite this I didn't think he was suicidal until the other day when he talked about how incredibly hopeless he feels about ever feeling ok again.

This has been an issue for almost my whole life and I didn't realize how much it affected me until recently.
I love to eat and I love food. So much so that any and every emotion I have has food attached to it. Angry? Make some dinner. Sad? Grab those brownies. Stressed? McDonald's it is! My cravings get so bad that I can taste what I want and feel the insatiable need to attain it.

Food seems to be a hobby and a coping mechanism. I'd even say that eating and food to me is an addiction of sorts. I can't let it go, even when I'm currently trying to make lifestyle changes for the better (eat better and exercise; I'm trying to lose weight).

252,"Hello! I’m currently up at 1:30 because for some reason I’m stressing about how to move on from where I am. My birthday is coming up and i’m stressing about passing my permit test. As with anyone’s 16th birthday, it comes with quite a bit of responsibility. Junior year is usually the most important when it comes to college. I hope to attend a decent college, hopefully going for a scholarship. I’m taking several advanced classes, and am playing on 2 hockey teams.  I am also attempting to complete my Boy Scout Eagle Project, which is a lot of work. I already have a job that has few working hours, the pay isn’t the greatest, and I’m being paid as an independent contractor, even though i’m considered as an employee. It’s not a great job, but it’s a start. I want to be able to make more money to pay for things like a car and possibly save for later, but i’m not sure if I’d have the time for a part time job. I spend quite a bit of time on video games, which may seem like the answer, but it’s one of the few hobbies I enjoy, and would love to possibly make it a career. I’m not sure where I should go from here, when it comes to a job, clearing up some time, and planning for the future. Any help would be appreciated.

253,"I’m a 22F and I have been planning a vacation with my good friend for almost five months now. It was just supposed to be the two of us. She’s a few years older than I am and she was married up until recently. Last week, her husband died. He died in his sleep and they’re not sure what caused it because he was not old. He was only 26. And they weren’t even married that long, she was married for almost a year and a half so she’s a very young widow. The trip is not completely paid for, but I’m a registered nurse and I really don’t get very many opportunities to take an extended vacation like this.

259,"I have had a friend at work that I really hit it off with! He knew I was engaged and was so excited to see photos of the wedding when I came back. We have always been cool and have hung out at work. Sometimes there would be vibes of attraction but no flirtatious behavior. One week he started hanging around me more due to work related things but I guess I started to be more playful. Harmless though, I'm married! I never said he was cute or anything flirty. I had texted him one night when I was stoned (we both smoke) but it was just apologize again because I had ignored him while talking to someone and he told me he was hurt jokingly.

The day after this message he didn't say hi to me and was not his usual self with me. We all had drinks after work and I asked him what was up and that I cared about him. This was sort of  in front of co workers, after this he was weird. The next day I apologized and said I had drank a lot. He specifically said ""we're co workers"" I said yeah but we're friends. He then repeated "" co workers"" . This really really hurt me because he was one of the very few people I was close to at work and I liked his personality. I later told him we were friends not Co workers and that I was sorry if I did anything to cause this whole flip but I hope we can be friends. He ignores my messages unless it's work related and has been SO different with me. Just wondering, what did I do? I never said anything flirtatious. We mutually liked talking to each other and each other's company. Maybe I overstepped but it was so harmless. How should I be around this guy now?

Let me first start by saying that I'm immensely blessed to be where I am. I have a beautiful wife and daughter that I'd do anything for.   
 I feel trapped. Not in the way that I want to leave or am unhappy with my life, but rather in the way that I can see where I want to be mentally, physically, and professionally, but it seems that as hard as I try, these lofty goals of mine stay exactly where they are and I can't seem to climb any closer. The goals are all in some way linked and the incompleteness of one goal puts me farther away from completing all the others. I want to be more secure in my mentality, but to do that, I need to reach my health goals. Reaching my health goals costs time and money that I lack. I lack time and money because my current pay is rather limiting and because I am working on reaching my professional goals to better support my family. My professional goals are likewise limited by my income, but looking for more substantial income has been a problem for several reasons such as my health and a lack of proof for the skills that I've been working so hard to develop.

When I was younger I used to get extremely attached emotionally to woman a bit older than me that showed any form of love/care towards me. But almost obsessively so, to the point where my emotions were an irrational rollercoster and depended entirely on what they so and do.

As I became older this went away and I assumed it was just childish emotions and craving for attention.

However over the last year I've met and befriended a wonderful woman. And my emotions and mind are starting to do the same thing it did as a child.

I feel hurt if she doesn't text me back, or if she doesn't say something in a certain way...and i get really happy when she does say something. I imagine all the things i could have said wrong or how she doesnt really care... 

All of which is completely irrational and unnecessary. As i am well aware that none of that is real! It's just my brain and emotions being idiotic. 

How do you learn to deal with irrational things like that, even though i know it's not real, it is hindering my every day life. And I am scared of pushing her away.

267,"Sorry if the format’s weird and the writing’s off. I’m on mobile and emotional. My (F18) brother (16) is not mentally well. He’s delusional, and has threatened suicide multiple times. I believe he’ll do it. He’s delusional because he believes that he can get emancipated from a loving home, drop out of school, and move out with friends on minimum wage. His PO has stated that none of this will be allowed. He has a PO because he pulled a knife on my mom a few months ago. My parents called the police on him and he spent a few days in juvie.

Anyway, I’m sorry this is all over the place. He’s told everybody who loves him that he’s going to kill himself within the next couple years. He says he hates us (me and our parents) but then tells us the reason he acts this way is because he doesn’t care about anything, especially himself, and that when he kills himself he wants us to not feel anything and forget he ever existed.

He has frequent explosive rage episodes, and the one that happened tonight is the reason I’m writing this. I’ll be moving to university in a couple of weeks. The original plan was that he wasn’t going to come, but then he said he wanted to so we arranged for him to join us, and now he’s saying he wants to work those days instead so he can “move out faster.” My parents refuse to leave him home alone because he’s basically on suicide watch, so now it seems like only my mom can come up with me to help me move on. My dad always has to stay home with my brother and miss out on all of these events in my life, and it’s really f***ing unfair.

I guess I’m asking for advice because I have no idea what to do. Do I just accept it? My parents have been trying to get my brother help for ages (it’s court ordered, even) but they’re struggling to find a local psychiatrist who’s taking new clients. How do I go about my life at university when I’m afraid that any call I get could be the one telling me he’s dead? Or that he’s freaked and murdered my parents? I honestly have no idea what he’s capable of anymore. I was always adamant that he would never hurt us. Now I don’t know. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Even if you tell me to move on. Maybe that’s what I need to hear right now.

268,"CW: child sexual abuse

I’ve (20F) really suppressed the memory so I barely remember any of it. But when I was anywhere from the age of 5-8, my family had dinner with two other families. I grew up in and around lots of big Catholic families. We went to another family’s house, let’s say the Peterson family, with another family, let’s call them the Andrews. The Peterson’s had a lot of boys, most of them older than me. The Andrews also had a lot of kids, one of them a girl about a year younger than me. While the parents all stayed near the kitchen to chat, the kids played upstairs. There were a lot of kids (the Petersons had seven boys at the time, the Andrews had somewhere around 5, and my family had somewhere around four) so it was pretty chaotic. During the chaos, one of the older (my memories put him at teenager age but he was probably much younger) Peterson boys brought the Andrews girl and I into his room and molested us in his closet. I felt so guilty and embarrassed that I pushed the memory down for years. I was also so young that I have trouble remembering it anyways. For all I know, I may have told my parents and they tried not to let me think it was a big deal. For all I know, they already know. I am and have been struggling for years with whether to tell my parents about it. It’s not something that regularly bothers me, although I really struggled with it when I finally remembered that it did happen. I do think it’s probably affected me in ways I haven’t even thought about. I’ve struggled with anxiety and shyness my whole life, not to mention depression. But at this point, I’m not sure whether I should tell me parents. I don’t know whether it would do me any good, and it would probably just bring them emotional turmoil. I’m also the oldest of what is now a family of 10. They were very careful, strict parents who really tried their best to protect us but I’m wondering whether telling them might help to prevent any future hurt befalling my siblings (my youngest sibling is currently 6).

275,"Standard ""I know something I shouldn't"" story, but daughter is involved:

Today my 11 y/o daughter went on a day trip with my best friend (ex sister in law) and her boyfriend. SIL was driving and BF was in the passenger seat with my daughter sitting behind him. BF was texting on his phone and my daughter was snooping from the backseat. She read a message he wrote to a woman in which he said ""Hey baby, wyd?"" Obviously my daughter's actions have put us in a sticky situation and I've addressed that issue with her and explained that this is a perfect example of why we don't invade other people's privacy.

That said, this woman is my best friend and my daughter's aunt. My daughter is upset and feels like telling her is the right thing to do, and she doesn't see the possible repercussions; as an adult I obviously know otherwise. 

SIL has been with bf for about 8 years and I'm like 99% sure this has been an issue before, presumably on several occasions. We have a mutual, unspoken understanding that when we're having relationship issues, we'll let the other know, but won't typically get into the details, because we don't want there to be unaddressed resentment towards our significant others when we inevitably work out the problem (ie *She* might forgive him for his actions, but *I* would be less inclined as my loyalty lies with her)

So for the most part, I'm unofficially aware that they've had these issues in the past, I just don't know the finer details and I've obviously not been in a situation in which I might be more informed than she is. I'm not sure if our unspoken agreement holds up in this scenario or if I should just carry on letting her deal with it the way she feels is best and hoping it works itself out or she discovers it on her own. 

Honestly I've never cared for BF, for obvious reasons, but I don't want to use that as ammunition to cause upheaval in her life. On the flip side of that, I'm wondering what kind of example it would set for my daughter if I didn't say something. Advice? Thanks!",11Aug2019,1

She was so pissed about us signing this lease that now I think shes doing things in spite of it. 

I was just checking my bank account and it showed I had a 59.92 dollar charge taken from my account.

I did not spend anything higher than 20 dollars since the last time I was there. 

So I remembered instantly that I had a joint account with my mom and the last time she made a mistake using the card for my account was 3 years ago and she has never made a mistake since. I want to think it's a mistake but I doubt it is because she has had to pay electricians and shit to fix our electricity. She has kept my card separate from hers ever since that first time she used my card. I just don't know if I should confront her or if I should just close this bank account because it feels like she's trying to get back at me for not paying her.

280,"Apologies in advance, because this is going to be a long (re)post. I know it'll probably get buried and not get much attention because of how long it is, I don't know if this is the right subreddit even, but I'm trying whatever I can. I've been through a lot of shit in my life. In a way, it's all I kind of know. I mean, even being born my mother and I almost died (she's still alive). Apologies for any typos. Anyways, here's my story:

My life was pretty normal, right up until I was supposed to go into kindergarten. My uncle then has one of, if not the worst aneurysm, ever recorded at the time. It literally broke records. So instead of living my life as a young kid coming out of toddler-hood, I was exposed to severe amounts of trauma, death, and watching families be ripped apart. It was a horrible experience. We were all in a hospital for a several weeks, months passed. All the while, we’d constantly bear witness to a wife or husband weep over a dead partner, or a couple sob hysterically as their kid was wheeled down the hallway on a gurney, covered in a white sheet. The whole experience was way to shocking for anyone to go through, and yet, there I was, barely out of pre-school, having to witness everything. But after the months of death, tragedy, and emotional torment, my uncle actually survived, and life for my family and I finally seemed to move on.

And then I go to kindergarten. Of course, life settles for nothing less than the meanest teacher life could give me, and of course, I'm already pretty fucked up myself. I go through school and am eventually labeled as the weird kid (I was traumatized, obviously). One thing that helped with that is that I gave roses to my first crush when I was in the 1st grade. Definitely helped label me as weird. I go through the motions of school, being constantly bullied and depressed because of all of this, but after the long years, with family/family friend deaths and several more brutal rejections (including one crush I had on a girl for years, and we were good friends, then I told her how I felt and she basically told I me I was stupid for even thinking that way) I eventually make it to the end the 6th grade. I was finally ready for a new start. I was going to start Junior High, and hoped things would get better. Then, be beginning of that very summer, I ended up breaking my foot at my friends birthday party.

This sucks, but whatever. Foolishly, thinking it can't get much worse, I catch a horrible respiratory illness. At one point, the doctor literally told me that the inside of my lungs liked hamburger. So I spent the rest of my summer coughing until I threw up, constantly. Day and night. Of course, again, I was thinking, ""Well, I guess this can't get much worse."" But no, life decided to prove me wrong once again. But this time, life prescribed me something much worse. I was simply prescribed an inhaler. This inhaler was supposed to help my lungs recover. This inhaler was supposed to make everything better. But this inhaler, Symbicort, was a steroidal inhaler, and unbeknownst to me, I am severely allergic to steroids. Because life seemed to especially hate me at the time, I was specially chosen to have a 1 and 10,000,000 chance of having a very specific reaction to the inhaler. And that reaction was shutting down my nervous system. I started losing mobility in my limbs. I had to literally crawl just to move around my house. That continued for several days. Sure, that was scary. Even without knowing that at the time, I was literally knocking on heaven’s door. And with all the constant crap that I’ve have had to live through up to this point, I was expecting some kind of break with life. Well, death didn’t accept me at that time. Unfortunately, hell apparently did.

This is when I started hallucinating. The nervous system damage messed up my brain. No, I didn't hallucinate about butterflies and rainbows. I didn’t see have the opportunity to beautiful unicorns gracefully trotting off in the distance. No. I had visions of demons trying to kill me, I had visions of horrendous apparitions appearing behind me when I looked into a mirror, I had visions of shadow people trying to take my life. Almost too literally, my life became the scariest paranormal movie almost to the point of being unimaginable. A situation so intense, that pure terror would sweep through your body, and paralyze you, overcome your thoughts, and push you to the point where you had no control over your own mind. The kind of terror that engulfs you in your worst imaginable nightmare. And that lasted for nine months. For nine entire months straight, I went through what I would closest describe to be hell. The feeling of constant terror and pain, with no end, with no break. Constant.

I went to a psychiatrist, a therapist, I saw top neurosurgeons, but every time I saw another professional who didn’t know exactly what was happening, and every time I upped my dosage of the medication that was supposed rid me of the paralyzing hallucinations, I lost even more hope. Nothing seemed to ever work. First they told me these hallucinations would only last a couple days, then they told me it would maybe be a week, then maybe a month, then maybe a couple months, until finally, it came to the point where I was told I would have to live like this the rest of my life. As a kid in junior high, and with the past that I’ve already had endured, hearing that absolutely devastated me. And keep in mind I endured a couple more rejections during junior high. But I decided I wasn’t going to give up. Something in me said it will all get better. I knew then and know now I will never kill myself, but in a way, that seemed even more of a burden upon everything else I had going on. But just as I was about to be put on a medication that would basically completely numb me out, it began to get better. Still, I was kind of labeled as one of the weird kids in junior high, though I fortunately wasn’t bullied too much. That was nice for a change. And finally, I was rid of the terrorizing hallucinations and panic attacks. So I told myself, ""Well, that really sucked, but I have gained a lot of wisdom from the whole experience."" And I did. But I was still stupid enough to tell myself, “Maybe this is my big break in life. Maybe things will finally get easier.”

Next up, high school. I join the football team because I was 6'1"" and 280 lbs at the time. So many people told me it would be the best thing I could do, and of course, with all of that positive reinforcement, I thought the team would love me. But no, I was tortured by the team, as well as the coach. Then, as I'm in the middle of the football shit, I get a minor concussion. This happens, this is normal, I'm not worried about it. Going to the doctor's for the routine concussion process, they hook me up to an EKG, and notice that something is...*different.* They then send me to a cardiologist. He tells me that I have WPW. An extremely rare heart condition that affects 0.2% of the world. Basically, with WPW, you have an extra firing nerve on the other side of your hear, but that nerve doesn't have a speed limit. If your heart misfires in any way, doesn't matter if you work out harder or don't, if you're stressed or not, just randomly, then your heart beats up to 400BPM and you drop dead. So, here I was, 15 years old, and I'm worried about dropping dead. I'm worried about dropping dead after living a life of depression, dying a virgin not only to sex but to romance in any way, shape or form. So they schedule me for heart surgery. I eventually go under, and when I wake up, they tell me something else now. I don't have WPW. What I have is where there is my main firing nerve, there is another sub-firing nerve right below it. 20% of the world has this, and it poses no threat. Then, what they had never seen before, is that I have *another* sub-firing nerve below that one. Luckily, they all work in conjunction with another and pose no threat of killing or harming me so they left my heart as is. Again, I come out of this, and I think once again, this is my break. Things will get better. Not a month after this though, one of my best friends comes down with a rare heart condition. And you know I was right there for him because I just went through heart surgery and I knew what the struggle felt like. The best way I could describe my best friend, would be that he was perfect human being. He always had an energy that made everyone feel special and loved and always had the most amazing heart. I strived to be like him, and still do. And this all was rocky, but I was there for him, along with the rest of the community. And with a heart like his, everyone just knew he was going to live and pull through. There was no way life could be cruel enough to take someone like him. Still, I would constantly would text with him, just trying to be as motivational as I could.

Then, he died. Just gone. It was purely devastating, and I knew and know that to this very day, I would go through the nine months of hell I endured 10 times over if I could just bring him back again. That was the day I knew for a fact that either 1. God didn't exist, or 2. God is the biggest fucking asshole the universe has ever seen and he can go fuck himself. I've never, ever contemplated suicide, but at that same time I didn't know how much more I had left in me. I didn't know what would happen when I ran out, but I hoped I'd never have to. So I asked myself everyday, why the hell did I have to go through all of this. What the actual fuck am I actually learning from this at this point. My friend wasn't supposed to die. He would've changed this world, he honestly would have. This time, I didn't expect a break. I just expected life to fuck me over just as it had countless times before. And I was right.

I continued throughout high school, depressed, miserable, and brutally rejected furthermore (just expecting rejection every time at that point, still didn't make it easier). Eventually I finished high school. I fucking made it out of that soul-sucking scum hole. Through all of this I began making films, and music, and that was my only outlet, which truly didn't help much due to the catastrophic amounts of trauma I had been through.

Going back to giving roses to my crush. Every since that moment, I’ve never ever been able to find a girl that was truly interested in me. Every time, if a girl showed interest in me (or so I thought), I would show interest back as friendliness, etc., and then when things seem to be going good, I’d get the cold shoulder. Every single time, and past the point of coincidence. As well as having multiple people I know in my family/friend groups die, I believe I would also unconsciously tie these rejections to death, because I would become interested in a person and involved, just to be abandoned. So in truth, I never just “testing the waters” with someone, because even if I get even slightly interested, it means all of the pain and hurt that’s damaged me over the years will come rushing back up. And it’s not like I haven’t asked that many people out. Countless times, countless rejections. Even my own parents honestly don't even know why I’ve had no success. But with each rejection, it feels like life is telling me I’m unwanted and unlovable.

That was until I finally met my first girlfriend, but even then, it only lasted a little under a month. She loved me to death, but truthfully thought I deserved better than her. Self-esteem issues truly ruined my first relationship. Still, she saved me. She made me realize I could be loved, and that I could be worth it to someone.

So right after I finish high school, I'm going to the doctor's for an annual check up, and they notice something that I pointed out to them. They send me in for a CAT scan. We get the results back, and tell me I have to go in for a biopsy. We go in, and they tell my I have lymphoma.

This devastates my family. My parents have done the best they can, supported me in every way they knew how. After everything I've been through, after my mom telling me not everything is going to go wrong, my body isn't trying to kill me, and I'm told I have cancer. They tell me there's an extremely slim possibility of it being a super rare form of aggressive tumor, called a desmoid tumor, but that kind always shows up in the stomach, and this large tumor showed up on the left side of my chest. So they do the biopsy, we wait two weeks for the results. Well apparently I had a this super rare desmoid tumor show up on the side of my chest. Luckily, we caught it in time, and it hadn't spread into the inside of my chest wall. I go in for surgery, and come out with a foot long scar on the side of my chest. I love this scar though. I feel like it's the biggest ""fuck you"" I can give back to the shit life has thrown at me.

Still, the depression left me not being able to feel the ability to connect with others on a deeper level. I couldn't feel that anymore. And coming from being highly empathetic most of my life, this was extremely hard for me. But the scariest part to me was that I’ve been so damaged due to this accumulation, that I had completely lost my sex drive. It scared me because I'd been so hurt and continually broken down that my brain had literally overridden evolution. And I saw two possibilities to why this was happening, but quite honestly I didn’t know which one was worse. Either my brain decided it needed to keep me alive and stop myself from mental torment so it went into full damage control and numbing me out to emotion and love, or it was just trying to make it easier for me to die.

I then met a girl, and I felt something. I felt *connected* to her. I became friends with her, and I felt like when I was there with her, I was *actually there.* There wasn't any metal/spiritual/whatever-you'd-like-to-call-it wall dividing me from her. I was so scared though. I didn't want to be hurt again. I couldn't. So I never went further than friendship with her, though I slowly started to fall in love with her. I was falling in love again. I loved it and hated it both at the same time. It hurt so much though, and my mind would never stop, I couldn't stop thinking about her even though I wished I could just forget. Eventually it got to a point where I went for three weeks where I would get 1-2 hours of sleep a night, if I was lucky.

Then, one night, I drive home, park the car and just sit. I listen to the music, and then the car shuts off, and the music stops. And I feel a shift. I'm no longer myself anymore. Something else took over. Something *primal.* It was as if my personality was no longer forefront, and my triune brain took over. My reptilian *reflex* was in the forefront. That was who I was now. But in the same sense as if you accidentally put your hand on a hot stove, and the reflex would be to pull away, no thought process, just reflex, my reflex now was to jam my keys into my throat. Shatter the glass and slice open the arteries in my wrists, bash my face into the steering wheel. And this wasn't thought. There was no thought process. Just reflex. All of those self-harming actions were reflex. I still had the logistical part of my brain talking to me from off in the distance though. It told me to call my parents. So I did. They came home immediately, and got me inside. They tried to help me, but literally everything around me was a weapon. Everything around me was an object for my reflex. And it was so insanely hard to keep my metaphorical hand against the burning stove, because I knew if I took it away, I would die. My body was trying to kill me. And I felt nothing.

I thought I had felt ""nothingness"" before, because I had felt different levels of this, but this nothing was something completely different. This was something I didn't ever realize was even *possible,* yet it existed, and I experienced it. The complete lack of any and all emotion. This was absolute zero, which I could never had previously even comprehended. And I know some of you may say you know what I'm talking about, but something comes from being this low, where you can recognize periods you've been through in other people. You can see where there are, and remember when you were at that point. I have never come across anyone who truly knows what I've felt. I'm not saying those people aren't out there, I've just never seen it in others. And I understand how this sound, and it's too hard to explain with words. You can't explain a color to a person who's been blind their whole life. Eventually, after an hour, I came out of this *episode*.

Keep in mind, I had already been seeing therapists for my problems. Nothing was working though. After this episode though I went back to my old psychiatrist who I saw for my hallucination problem. I then found out, that my whole life, I had also been dealing with OCD. Racing thoughts that would never stop, thoughts that would focus and not let go of something no matter how badly I wanted it out of my mind. Thoughts that would keep me up at night. The constant stream of thoughts of death, trauma, pain, grief, that recycled over and over and over again that never seemed to pass, never seemed to go away, never would move on. While most people's grieving process is a conveyor belt, mine was a dryer. If you keep throwing your dirty clothes into a dryer, it's not going to get rid of them. It's just going to continue to run and run and run. And I finally reached the point where my dryer broke, because so much was packed in, and nothing was ever able to be taken out. I honestly was surprised and impressed I had lasted almost 20 years though. But, I had now broken.

A few months after going through all of this, and dealing with being madly in love with a friend where it would never work out, my friend graduated and moved away. A couple weeks after that, I felt a switch. It took a matter of an hour, if that. I felt all emotion and compassion and empathy drain from me. I then no longer felt anything for anyone else. I could still feel personal emotions to some degree, but much less than the rest of my life. And this wasn't and episode.

I lost all empathy and love towards others. I could no longer tell my own mother that I loved her anymore. The woman who bent over backwards trying to support me, trying to give me the best life she could. And I couldn't feel anything for her.

So I went on like this. I lived life hating this new person I was. I don't hate myself, but I hate what this life has made me into. I also met another girl though. And she was really into me. I knew what it was like to love someone though, and have them never return the favor, and even more so, spit it back in your face. So I befriended this girl, and we kind of became friends with benefits for a while (kissing, rubbing, eventually fingering, but never sex because I wanted my first time to be with someone I loved and trusted). Eventually this went on for a while, and she knew about my condition, but loved me anyway. So I made her my girlfriend. And we had a wonderful time. I cared about her as much as I could, but I could never *love* her. She didn't care. She tried to be her best for me, and I tried to treat her the best I could. But this etched away at me. It didn't feel right. It felt wrong. I wanted to love this girl with all my heart, but I couldn't, because I had nothing left. Seven great months went by, but it just hurt. I couldn't be who I so desperately wanted to be.

So a few days ago I broke up with her. This was heartbreaking for both of us, in our own ways. She feels like I am the one, and that she won't ever find anyone who will treat her the way I will, and I can't blame her. She's chubby, and was constantly told by society, family, etc. that she would never be good enough for anyone. She couldn't be loved by anyone. And I did my best to show her that she could. I did my best to show her the way she deserves to be treated. But she feels absolutely heartbroken and lost. We're still friends. She loves me, and I care about her, but it still hurts.

I don't know what I'm going to do now. I don't think I can date again, and if I do, it's not going to be what I want it to be because of me. Because of who this life so cruelly made me into. I don't know what to do. I want to hear all your suggestions, but I honestly believe I have already tried pretty much all of them. Both my therapist and psychiatrist have said they've never seen what I have in anyone else. They haven't seen this before. I don't know what to do. I don't want to die, but at the same time, life just isn't worth living, and it hasn't been for almost as long as I can remember.


Edit: For clarity, I am no longer paralyzed, that happened for a few days but I am now fully mobile. I have some lasting effects such as random ""jitters"" but nothing much more than that. As well, I understand the reasons why other people treated me the way they did, bullying, etc. and as I don't excuse their action I do understand how fighting issues at home can come up as harming others. I also fully understand depression and internalizing trauma and recognize all the ways it applies to me (to my knowledge). As well, it may sound like I have a hatred toward women and condemn them for not liking me, but I do understand their perspective and always have. I understand that when you don't like someone, you don't feel like giving them a chance and you owe them a chance. I hold no hate against women, or truly anyone. I understand life is just the way is it because that's the way it is sometimes. Still though, for as long as I can remember, all I wanted was a loving romantic relationship. I craved it more than anything else. And I still do, I just don't believe I'll be able to truly have one so that's why I don't feel like trying anymore.",11Aug2019,0
281,"I just don’t know what to do. Everyone is so different and if I make a wrong move I can ruin everything. I really want to pull back to show him I truly care and that he can’t get rid of me that easily, but I don’t want it to be taken as me not giving him space. 

On the other hand if I let him be he could end up believing I simply didn’t care enough to even try to show him I care.",11Aug2019,1
282,"Background: I'm 20, living at home, go to university semi-full time and have a casual job (going by averages make about 8k per year). 

 I've wanted to buy a car for a while now but my mum especially thinks it's a terrible idea. Her main argument is that when she was my age not buying a car was one of the main reasons she was able to afford her own place (not true, won't go into specifics but she got VERY lucky with her work situation in her early 20's, like crazy lucky) and that on a casual salary I shouldn't commit myself to something like a car. 

And I mean I get where she's coming from but the best I'm going to get at this point in my life is a casual job and I've checked and rechecked the math and the costs of running a good second hand car would be a little over 2k a year (incl. insurance/registration and petrol/servicing estimates. Upfront cost doesn't matter I know I have enough saved.). For comparison, rent in my city would add up to around 10k a year. 

I know this would be a big commitment and would require me to get better at managing my money especially when I do make a variable amount of money per week but I really don't see that as a bad thing to learn. Especially when I'm sill in that safety net of living at home with few financial commitments. I'm not going to finish university for at least another 3 years and I won't qualify for government assistance for another 2 so I'm  stuck living at home until then and I'd really rather the option of having just a little more freedom.

So I guess my real question is: am I being an idiot?",11Aug2019,1

284,"I’ve never posted here and if your reading this thank you for that alone. This story has many components but I’ll try to keep it as concise as possible. 

For context I’m 19, going into sophomore year of college and me and my friends from high school still get together fairly regularly. 

We had this one friend in high school who I’ll call M (also currently 19) who seemed to enjoy partying a little harder than everyone else back in the day, one thing led to another and now M struggles with addiction to many substances and has endangered herself and others on many occasions. As of a couple months ago me and the rest of our group of friends explained to her that we had to draw a line and not support her unless she were to seek professional help. She refused and continued her habits.

Flash forward to 6 weeks ago, I come home from a party late at night and M is sitting in my kitchen with my brother and his girlfriend (both 25) my brother explained to me that she had texted him saying that she needed a place to stay and seemed extremely distressed. She stayed for 2 nights and then went and stayed with my brothers girlfriend for a couple more.

Slowly my brother began to hangout with M more and more  and his girlfriend (of 5 years) less and less to the point where now it is extremely obvious that M and my older brother are sharing some sort of relationship.

Both my mother and I have quite sternly told him to cut the shit and he still has not. She is in my house as I’m fucking writing this. I’m wondering which one of them I should confront, how, and what I should say because in my opinion the situation is extremely inappropriate and uncomfortable. Anything would be appreciated, thankyou.",11Aug2019,1

287,"I kind of feel bad and guilty that I’ve been smoking weed for a majority of everyday through the summer as I have break from uni. I just can’t help it bc i don’t really have anything to do right now, and I just have been finding really hard to be inside my head.

I’m a pretty rigid over thinker, and with all the time by myself, the overthinking kind of goes into overdrive, and it’s just too much. It’s like things seem much clearer, I feel like there’s a weight lifted off my shoulders, and I’m less negative and more optimistic. It’s almost like the dark cloud that’s there is just completely shut out and I can be focus on one thing, and be in the moment. 

It just doesn’t feel right, and I feel like this can mean something but I don’t know what. I mean I’m working out and hanging out with friends while high, so it’s not like I’m just staying in my room all day. I just worry about the past, future, and a multitude of things when I’m sober. And it’s almost like my high self has become the default me, and it feels actually weird to be sober, and there’s this uncomfortableness that I can’t explain.

Any way this is all to ask if I should stop or what should I do? What could this indicate? 

And I’m wondering is this what something like an antidepressant or something would do, but without maybe the side effects of being “high.” Bc I just feel like there’s nothing dragging me down, and I actually feel more ambitious and motivated, and I go out for runs/exercise while high, and even think about my problems more logically in a way that I can come up with answers.",11Aug2019,1

290,"My parents have been abusing my grandma for a long time, financially and physically. Recently my grandma showed me a large bruise she got from a fight with my mother. I was in shock, and had to tell my therapist because I can't stand what is happening to my grandma. Except the problem is my grandma doesn't want any trouble because she thinks it's her responsibility to take care of her adult daughter who is violent and manipulative and can't get a job or willingly get disability pay. 

My therapist was mandated to make a report, and later on my grandma was visited by a county Agent and deduced that I was the one who made a report. She was very angry at me for trying to save her fucking life. She could've been killed, or seriously injured by my violent mom, and my grandma has the audacity to get mad at me for ""telling somebody"" about it. She doesn't want my mom to go to jail, but I can't stand by and watch my older brothers and parents abuse the woman that gives them a place to live with free utilities.

My parents have abused me in the past, and I've watched my siblings try to kill each other out of pure hatred. My family is really messed up, but they all think I'm the bad guy cuz I try to help myself with therapy and one of my past intern therapists was stupid enough to tell my parents about my mental illness struggles and violent thoughts. Just thoughts! My family uses my own mental illness struggles against me and everyone in my family thinks I'm dangerous when I haven't done anything to harm anyone and I've witnessed them all try to kill each other several times. 

After many of my childhood traumas, I didn't report anything to a therapist when I was still a minor because I was afraid what would happen to me if my parents find out and I was too involved with school responsibilities I didn't prioritize my mental health. It's too late to do anything about my past, but after what's been happening with my grandma my whole family is onto me and I'm afraid they're gonna do something bad to me like before or something bad to my dog. I can't move out because I tried that before for 6 months and had to move back because of how expensive it is here. I have too many mental illness issues I can barely take care of myself if I moved anywhere and there's no group homes for young people that accept dogs, I can't leave my dog behind with these violent evil people.

I've spent the last several weeks staying out of the house as much as I can, going to the gym, spending hours at coffee shops binge watching shows on my laptop, walking around Walmart aimlessly trying to kill time. I don't feel safe at home, and all my friends abandoned me because I'm just a sad mess that no one wants to be around. My therapist is going to take me to this center for troubled youth where they're free to hang out all week, and I might regain some sanity being in a safe place, but I am scared for my life every time I have to come home late at night and see my family on the way to my bedroom that has a lock on it.

I just need words of wisdom/perspective from sane adults on how to deal with my parents/older brother/grandma in case they try to intimidate or threaten me or verbally abuse me. I avoid them all as much as I can but it's still hard seeing them whenever I do.

They do, as any parents of course have some suspicions (especially my dad) but there's nothing to prove them.

296,"So I’m a head life guard at my pool facility which means I basically make sure the pool is running smoothly and things like that.

Here’s the thing: management forever fucks me over. The director/managers for my facility has consistently irritated me and screwed me over. 
Example A: she changed the pool schedule without letting me know, making the work schedule wrong. Anyone can write this off as a mistake, but once I made the schedule, I have emailed AND texted her that I had made the schedule and to make sure she is satisfied with it. She failed to inform me until the day before the new times would be enforced, making me hurry up and scrap employees together for the shift. Example B: I left the pool for a week without performing proper maintenance (I fully accepted that as my fault) when texted by my director she repeatedly texted me, several group chats with others and called me over the matter. I was volunteering for school so I couldn’t come down until later and I told her that, but I said that everything would be taken care of. Spring forward a couple of hours later, I put in all the chemicals I could. She comes down and gives her “inspection” (she isn’t certified in any pool maintenance/chemicals) and immediately calls me over the matter. At this point it’s about 8pm and I’m so over it but she insists I still talk to her. I verbally walk her through all the inspections I did (with all the same results) and I tell her what we should do. She questions my decision but tells me to have a good night and hangs up. I finally think it’s over until she texts me that she’s going to the outside pool by herself at 9:30pm (completely dark and in a shady area) and tells me that if she doesn’t reply in 5 minutes call the police. At this point I’m thinking it’s ridiculous and it’s not my job to protect her ass if she wants to go out by herself at night. She gets home fine, but it’s the fact she made a bigger deal than the problem was and she decided to trust her life with me because of her stupid decision to try to fix a pool in pitch black darkness

There are plenty of instants that have happened that caused me such dissatisfaction over the management but those are the most recent ones and the main reason why I’m posting.

This brings me to my question. I’m not sure if I should leave. Not only do I enjoy the job itself, I get paid 12 an hour (which is a lot for a 17 year old). But the management is so bad and stressful that it makes me hate the job. What should I do?",11Aug2019,1
297,"Hello everyone,

I'm a 24 year old teacher who still lives with his parents, on their suggestion to save money. My stepfather just left a note on my door to get out in a week due to me not keeping my room clean during a week that I worked 16 hour days with three part time jobs. I know, it's juvenile of me, and I've made that mistake and am now paying for it.

Now, I'm a first year teacher who started late in the year, so I didn't get paid over the summer, and won't get paid until the 1st week of September. I have $1200 to my name, and $6k in an IRA I'm considering cashing out.

Now, I'm set up to couch surf for a bit, but I need suggestions for any possible housing options. I've found a few apartments that I can afford with a little help (hence cashing out the IRA), getting me to September. But what other options do people have? Craigslist in my city is quite barren in this department, and teachers report to school tomorrow.",11Aug2019,2
298,"Tldr: Flunked out of college, now I don't have a purpose.


I was in an allied health program in college (not nursing, but I think I'll be recognized if I'm any more specific). I worked hard to get into the program and I was accepted. I did fairly well in most of my classes except one....I failed and then retook it and failed again so I am now dismissed from my program.

I filed an academic appeal and went all the way through it for the college to say that all rules and procedures were followed. The grading was arbitrary in my opinion. The reason why I failed was during an assessment I told my patient to do something but didn't say exactly how they should do it. For example, I told my patient the way they needed to do something but I didn't explain how. Something very simple that my patient showed no confusion, and I even confirmed the patient was doing the right thing. Because of that I failed.

Now I don't know what to do. I did well in all of my classes except for one part of 1 class. My to a is 3.5...and was a 3.67 before this happened to me. My husband told me I shouldn't go to college just to go...but I feel like I need to finish some degree. I have 130 credits and no bachelor's degree. I want a good paying job that doesn't involve customer service on the phone...and I never want to join a cohort again. In fact, most places say if you flunk out of a cohort they auto reject you.

Any ideas? I have two kids and I'm not fresh out of high school.",11Aug2019,1
299,"Every time I go out of my house, I see a couple on the streets.

Usually, it's a man and a woman, sometimes it's a man with another man, and a couple of times it's a woman with another woman.

Good stuff, right?

People living their lives with someone that they love and this someone gives love back to them.

Must be real nice, right?

Well, I don't have any of that.

When I go take the subway to stroll around the city, there are couples all around me.

I see some couples kissing, cuddling, showing affection to each other, embracing, you know, all that good love stuff.

Must be pretty nice.

But when I see couples around me, two things usually happen:

One: it reminds me of how lonely I feel every day and every night since I don't have someone which I could express love and be loved back

Two: It also reminds me of all my negative traits: I'm ugly, i'm fat and i'm an idiot. No women in sane conscience will ever love me, because I'm a piece of shit, off course no one will love me. I'll die alone.

I feel this reassuring feeling that I'll definitely die alone.

I'll never be loved again.

Everytime I see another girl, I think:

""I'm ugly and retard. She'll not like me. She doesn't care about my existance. It's for the best that I leave her alone""

I don't stand a chance

There are other guys better that a girl should date, not me.

I'm filth.

I'm a mysoginist

I'm racist.

I hate women.

I hate people.

I hate feeling this way.

Seeing other couples... just makes me feel like killing myself

I feel that other couples shows up around me as a personal attack, as if those couples I see when I'm outside were taunting me, like ""yeah u/alexhidanbr, just look at us, look how better we are than you that we love each other while you're a fucking loser that can only masturbate to porn at home, as the lowlife that you are"".

So... I was thinking:  


Why do I feel this way?

I can't help mysef.

I don't have control over this jealously feeling that leads to depression and suicide thoughts.

This sucks.

300,"I had grown up in an abusive household. My parents were both alcoholics, and my brother repeatedly assaulted me and relentlessly bullied me. Since then I have seen a few therapists and all of them diagnosed me with manic depression, which is bipolar. My parents got clean and my brother got a girlfriend that calms him down, so I guess I have a normal life now...

I feel empty inside and my happiness has a direct corralation with how much time I spend not talking to them, but they're hella clingy and always want to spend time with me despite the fact I'm a major introvert. 

I wanted meds but my parentals don't believe in them and said that it's bad for me or whatever. I'm empty inside and perpetually upset. I spent some time working and living by myself for the summer and that was the best I've been. I lost thirty pounds and enjoyed life, but since they got here I hate myself.

302,"If I need to move this to some other page, please let me know. I've never used an advice thing before. This is an account I made just for this.

I am 20 years old, in the US, and I've never actually dated anyone that's been in my area unless you really want to count my 7th grade girlfriend of 3 months. Other than that, I've had plenty of long distance relationships since 8th grade and on. The only other one that would be ""in my area"" is this guy I was introduced to over a friend's minecraft server that lived in my state.

I'm a transgender guy (FTM), can't afford any treatments and I'm not sure if insurance covers it. I'm not interested in sex, but I really dont have a preference towards who I date, I do find masculine people a lot more attractive than feminine people. 

Back in 9th or 10th grade, I was diagnosed with plenty of anxiety disorders, depression, and binge eating disorder. I self-distruct a lot and that's part of the reason why I don't really get out there. I feel like I'm bad at flirting and I'm just nervous constantly, almost like I should just put a stamp on my forehead that says ""nervous wreck, approach cautiously.""

When I'm out in my town I always get quiet or shy whenever I see a cute guy. A few times at work (retail, first job was with a company that's now shut down everything but their eyecare), a cute person would come in my line and I would be overly nice to them. I even had a group of guys come in and the one I thought was the cutest I was on my BEST behavior. Going to some restaurants suck because my luck, we get stuck with a really cute server. Hell, I went to the farmers market yesterday with my mom and I didn't approach one stall because one person there was absolutely my type and I knew I'd start stuttering or blushing.

At my current job, my coworker had recommended I try online dating. I don't even know where to start with that. I also still live at home with my dad, for a few reasons, but none that I'm sure any potential partners would find appealing at all (mom left dad after years of her cheating/being irresponsible/making us lose our house due to lack of payment/mentally and verbally abusing me/etc, he also has diabetes and last year he had a heat stroke and I don't want to leave him alone). 

I know this is long and I sort of ramble but my point is I don't know what I should do.

308,"Sorry if that title is awkward, I couldn't figure out how to phrase it. Basically, I'm the one with separation anxiety from my pet, not the other way around which seems to be much more common. I've Googled and searched Reddit and every answers is for those whose pets are the ones that struggle in their absence - but in this case it's me.

I will be going away for almost four days later this month and I've already had so much anxiety over it I'm barely holding back tears. I feel ridiculous. I'm excited about this trip and want to go. Yet I can't stop dwelling over it. Honestly it isn't really that I'm concerned about her (my cat's) safety. Of course I always will be a little but we still live with my mother, who I trust to take care of her as she did last year, when I went on a similar length trip. My mom even wrote a 'cat diary' of what she did throughout the day and her 'thoughts' which was great. My main issue seems to be just...being away from her. The thought that I'm hundreds of miles away from my baby and can't just go pet her or hear her meow is greatly upsetting to me and is what does me in. On my trip last year, for the most part I was busy enough that I couldn't dwell on it but there are times where it hit me and I thought 'what's she doing right now?' and get upset. It's sunny out, is she sitting in the sun? Is she playing? It's night time, is she sleeping or prowling the house for mice? Picturing her like that, so far away, tears me up and while I can ask my mom, that seems to only upset me more to actually know or see pics.

Like I said, I feel so ridiculous. Other pet owners go on 2+ week vacations without their pets, travel for work, go camping. Hell, my ten year old cousin went to summer camp for a week away from her family and pets and handled it fine! The person I will be visiting has three cats and has frequently gone on multi-day trips. Yet here I am, almost 20 years old, struggling to deal with the same issues I did at 8. Only back then, it was about my mom, but I realized the issue is exactly the same - thinking about what's going on without me and not being able to touch/hear them. Now it's my cat instead of my mom (no ill-will to her lol I just outgrew that).

I know the answer is probably ""therapy"" but I can't do that before my trip. What can I do to settle down and get over this so I'm mot constantly fighting tears and trying to distract myself during those four days?",11Aug2019,3
309,"Alright so as title says, I think I am starting to have issues with my hearing. Specifically when there is significant background noise. I currently work in a warehouse where there are forklifts and other machinery running. For at least a few months now I’ve had to Consciously focus on people’s mouths when they are speaking at work otherwise I can’t hear what they are saying.  When this first started I didn’t question it because I work in a loud environment but lately I’ve noticed that if I don’t look at someone’s mouth when I’m in public I can’t “hear” or understand what they are saying. Another example would be that sometimes when my boyfriend and I are out in public, he has a tendency to place his hand over his mouth and I have to ask him to move his hand because I can’t hear what he’s saying. I feel like more and more I’m starting to need to read lips in addition to hearing what someone is saying In order to follow along and This is starting to scare me a bit.

311,"For starters, sorry for formatting and spelling, Mobile. First post too so, yeah. Bare with me. I am a 16m currently in my Junior year of High School. My family has always been real loud and outgoing with each other and, when I was younger, I was also like this, but as I grew older I began to become more introverted. (Not in an unhealthy way, I just started liking privacy more.) My mother was always seen as being VERY nosy by everyone in our family. Your business is now her business. 

Recently an event has happened where she intruded on my personal privacy on an EXTREME level. I expressed my anger with her and how what she did was unacceptable on many different levels. We had a 1-on-1 talk for a couple of hours that night and we eventually made up, but through us making up she revealed to me some stuff from her past.

She told me when she was younger, she was sexually advanced on by a family member of hers. She held it in for a long time out of fear that he might hurt someone else too. Eventually she got the courage to tell her Grandmother (who pretty much raised her) about what happened, but she didn't believe my mom. She said that really hurt that she wasn't believed and has been bottling all these emotions for years now, and still is.

After we made up, I told that she needs to talk to someone. I would be here for her, but she needs to seek professional help. She's afraid to talk to friends or family about it cause internal family-drama spreads rumors fast. I guess she's just learned to know I can be trusted when talking about sensitive things. She agreed with me that professional help would be beneficial to her, but eventually started making up excuses why it probably wouldn't work. Time, Not wanting to talk, taking care of me, etc. (She majored in Psychology and has worked with people who can't help themselves. Children in bad homes, elderly people, and so on.) 

Bottom line, I'm worried for her health. She knows that seeking professional help would be best, but most likely won't seek it. I want to help her in any way I can, but don't know how to. Help.

TL;DR : You're not getting one.",11Aug2019,1

315,"A little backstory:
I have diagnosed ADHD and so I'm taking medicine for it. I've always had a healthy appetite, but these meds are infamous for messing with ones willingness to eat. I've taken them for around a month or two now, and I didn't notice any problems until only a week ago when I realised that I didn't have as much energy as I should, and was losing weight fast. Six to seven kilos in a month fast.

Now I am a bit on the overweight side so normally this would make me happy, but I'm not too foolish to not realise that six to seven kilos a month all of a sudden isn't healthy. I called the health hotline, they brought up the meds, and I've tried to figure out ways to eat more during the day. 

On average, I currently eat way too little. Half of a small meal a day, maybe a single bite of an apple. Way too little. The problem is I feel hungry, take a bite, and instantly feel full again. Eating more and forcing it in is a painstaking and tedious task that provides no results and ends up with me feeling defeated and almost a bit sick. 

I used to use a tactic when I was younger and didn't feel hungry at dinnertime sometimes, which was just to leave the food out next to me and I'd find myself gradually picking at it during the course of the evening, but it won't work. I just have no interest at all in it. 

Now since I know this is kind of an infamous side effect of these kinds of meds and is common, I thought maybe someone here has some advice. My doctor is fully booked for another month and I would love some help so I don't lose another seven kilos.",11Aug2019,1

But at the same time I'm afraid that he is going crazy, because if he would manage to cure this disease he would definitely get a nobel prize. This isn't some rare disease, this would get world wide attention. So even though he probably is a genius, I don't think he is THAT much of a genius, so I'm worried he is going crazy.

I’m usually a happy person. I live a happy life, but here recently i’ve been feeling really sad. I just can’t get over my fear of death. The fear goes of people I care about dying and the thought of possibly not knowing how the ones I love would handle my death. I should also mention that my fear has slowly developed for a year and a half when it all started by a good friend from high school nearly burning to death in a fire (thankfully he lived and can’t even tell that he went through such a traumatic experience). After that moment, I realized that people around me would die and that one day I would die and it’s a lot to handle. I have a twin brother that I would very much like to live until the end of my days or else I don’t believe I can carry on in this world. 

I’m always been a sort of emotional person as it is, but recently I just keep getting thoughts about death and then instantly start crying. I don’t think I’ve been this emotional since I was really young, and I’m just not sure how to embrace the fear or “get over it.” 

Another thing to note is that for the past 4-5 years or so I’ve lived as an agnostic, but recently I’ve been praying heavily and really trying to believe in a God so that I can be comforted by the thought that I can look forward to a place to go after death. I feel guilty that I’m using this as a safety net so it’s an all around tough situation for me mentally. 

I know this is a common fear but I just feel like if i don’t try and see a more positive outlook soon it will drive me to be mentally unstable. 

One thing I have been trying to do is use my fear as a creative outlook to write music and so far it’s worked, but there is still a void that needs to be filled.

As the night went on he was getting angrier and angrier just fully scaring me, I took him to a bedroom to try and calm him down because he was clearly making a scene, but he interpreted it differently and started to make out with me, I pulled out and told him it wasn't a good idea in a calm sensible way, he continued to aggressively make out with me and then started to put his hands down my pants.

I tried to call for help but he had blocked off the door and I felt so trapped, I eventually got out and everyone just thought I was making out with him because I am too ashamed to confess what really happened. I feel so strange like as young teenage girl I would have never imagined it to happen to me and especially not with someone that I have known since I was like 6. I don't really know what to do at this point if I'm completely honest so any advice would be great :)",11Aug2019,2
332,"Hello,

I have a brand new job and I'm currently driving 80km (50 miles) for 60 to 80 minutes (twice a day).

So naturally I was looking for a flat near my job. It's quite difficult to find though. It basically comes down to 3 possibilities:

I could either:

1. Take a small flat 7km away with a 15 minute commute but it's 20% more expensive in mostly old rundown 1960's - 1980's buildings (nicer buildings are way out of my price range) 

2. Take a slightly bigger flat for a fair price 17 km away but because of a critical intersection with a 22 - 45 (!) minute commute according to Google maps in a newly build and nice 2016 house.

3. Stay at my parents house because I don't pay much rent and drive everyday. But I'm about to reach an age where it's not socially acceptable anymore (almost 25)

What should I do? Not sure if choosing 2 is much of an improvement in terms of the commute. Thank you",11Aug2019,2
333,So I’m going into high school finally in just 8 days. Usually I’m excited for a new school year but it’s safe to say 2019 has not been my year. I had an incident in 8th grade with me and a girl (go figure) that ended in me transitioning from this cool half assed fun to talk to kid to a social outcast. I barely escaped with any friends and going into high school I’m afraid that rumors will spread about me there until I’ve got no shot at rebuilding a social life. I doubt not many for middle school will be so fast to forgive me as some and might stunt my chances at a normal high school year. What should I do?,11Aug2019,2
335,"TL;DR: Started a job in an field I LOVE, but am bullied at work. Should I just take the hit and leave?

Hi Reddit, I recently started a job in a field I absolutely love and genuinely enjoy - and what's amazing is that I landed the job almost straight away after graduating college. There is still a lot to learn, and I'm trying to take in as much as I can every day I'm at the job.

Not even two whole weeks into the job, I overhear my coworkers talking badly about me - about my lack of experience in the area, about how I wasn't contributing enough, how weird I did things, how ""I wasn't all there"" etc. Of course I was hurt and my confidence really took a hit and my work and progress suffered greatly. I'm making tons more stupid and avoidable mistakes because I'm rushing or because I'm nervous, and every mistake I make just makes me even more depressed and I feel like a failure. Sometimes when I ask questions, my coworkers look at me like I'm an idiot (or trade glances), so I'm afraid to ask further questions/clarifications or to reach out for help with something I'm unsure about.

Literally as I'm typing this up and thinking about work, my smart watch tells me heart rate is racing at almost 90BPM - I know that's not healthy. I've never been in a situation like this. I'm getting less than 5 hours sleep a night (and its interrupted), my stomach turns at the thought of going into work and facing my colleagues, I've had no appetite and I've stopped enjoying activities I used to like. Every minute of the day I'm thinking about work. The mistakes I've made, the comments I heard. I'm starting to believe I can't do my job properly and I'm unqualified. What's worse is that they've started to make the comments within earshot (not even a metre away from me) and while not directly saying my name, I know from the context that it's me.

The thing is, I've done well in the past when I was interning for different companies since every successful task I completed helped build my confidence in my work and because I felt well supported, I experienced a lot of growth. I did well in university too, graduating with first class honours. But this place makes me feel like an incompetent fool to the point where I feel like I can't even complete a simple task properly.

I'm not sure I can make any progress or grow my skills here. Should I just wave the white flag, say goodbye and try my luck elsewhere? I imagine that quitting my first real job in my field will hurt my chances of success of employment in this area, however if I am not growing my skills and taking steps backwards instead of forwards, what is the point in staying?

I'm sorry if I sound like I'm complaining or venting - I just need to hear a different viewpoint. Any advice is appreciated. If you got this far - thank you for reading.",11Aug2019,1

338,"I don’t know why but after 8th grade, which was only three years ago my memories just started to fade away or fade in and out. I remember somethings of an event or person in my life but for some reason I can’t remember all of it. I just recently remembered that my new girlfriend went to the same middle school as me but I can only recall the fact that I have met her and hung out with her for maybe a week or so back in middle school. So I asked my best friend about this person and he said oh so you remember her now huh and I was confused at first and he told me we used to hangout all the time but I don’t remember any of it. I can remember things from middle school and elementary school but the people I knew and hung out with all the time I don’t recall any of them they are like ghosts in my memories. For another example my friend today was taking about how one of our friends killed herself and I couldn’t remember any like that. Until she showed me a picture of her I remembered the person but I didn’t remember her killing herself and or anything about her just the fact that I knew that person I just don’t remember from where. And again my friends said we knew each other in middle school and she went to the same elementary school. I only remember one thing now with this girl, but I don’t remember her killing herself. Which I find weird because my little sister killed her self around the same time and the girl who killed herself was my friend according to my other friends and my best friend. Another weird thing is I remember my little sisters death, but not my friends death and they both happened around the same time like a month apart or so. I’m mad at myself at the moment for only remembering my little sisters death piece by piece but not my friend like I know some people are going to say well she is your little sister you have been around her more often and she meant way more to you then your friend, but I’m pretty sure like any other person they would remember their friends death.",11Aug2019,0
339,"I was literally surrounded with ""friends"" that just made me their bitch and called me a pussy now and then, and I literally took on that ego. Now that is exactly how I behave; just overly nice and shy and stutter a lot.

I literally have no personality in my life right now, I admit it off the back I'm a straight as pussy and feel like a slave day to day that is being used by everyone else. I laugh because the other person is laughing, I agree with the other person because I'm not confident in my own thoughts on the matter, I say what I think people want me to say because I don't know what I want to say.

341,"So a couple of months back, I smelled AWFUL. I didn’t know what was causing the smell but my doctor told me it was BV (Bacteria Vaginosis) or a inbalance of bacteria in your vagina that cause many odors. I remember the smell changing. It smelled fishy, musty, sweet, and it also smelled like beer and cornchips. It was humiliating having to go to school and smell so bad. As you probably have assumed by now, the kids teased me a lot. And even to the point where I wanted to kill myself. I was trying everything to make this problem go away and it felt like it was never enough. And that I would suffer like this forever. My doctor even gave me antibiotics which made it go away for a period of time. It went away and then came back like it never left. I would notice no smell and then in the next couple of days, I’d smell something again. 

Now, I’m always self conscious about my body and my smell. I’ve gotten better. But not completely. I’ve stopped taking 1hour long showers and I’ve stopped scrubbing my vagina roughly. I’ve stopped spraying feminine deodorant down there. I’ve stopped using scented feminine products (summers eve wash, and wipes).

 But I can’t shake the feeling that I smell and it’s almost become a phobia. It’s on my mind 24/7. And I’m so tired of it. It’s making me feel like the future isn’t gonna be any better and that these dark thoughts won’t ever go away.",11Aug2019,1
342,"I feel really guilty and I’m not sure my reasons are justified in not wanting to be hanging out with one of my used to be close friends. Ever since my freshman year of college I’ve been trying really hard to get on my feet and we became close friends when I was in a very vulnerable place in life. The past year I can’t seem to find anything in common with my friend and I feel like my opinions and life style offend her but I don’t think she wants to grow up. I feel like I’m baby sitting not hanging out with my friend the past 3 years. 

Ok thing that last driven us apart that she’s offended I don’t invite her places because she doesn’t have a job and refuses to get a job. She’s 21 with no job experience. I accidentally said once about another girl we knew that it would be impossible to find a good job with absolutely not job experience or degree and she got so mad at me because that was basically her. I also don’t mind she doesn’t have a job but I don’t want to pay for her all the time when we go out. 

She’s also offended that I don’t want to stay home and hang out with her even if I don’t want to spend money. The funny part is that she will eat all the food at my house. She will never invite me to her place and never offer me anything when I’m there. We both live with our parents so it’s not even a matter of having kore personal space to ourselves. She also complains about a lot of things. Like that she sleepy so she will sleep in my bed. Or that her head hurts so I give her aspirin. But honestly she asks for something every time we hang out she’s so needy. She makes me feel like I’m materialistic for not wanting to help her all the time but I don’t want to take care of her all the time.

Another reason we’ve been growing apart is that she’s not socially aware. She just acts really inappropriately or just never pays attention to the conversation so she makes herself look really dumb. I always have to catch her up or defend her. She also takes every opportunity to get drunk and then does something really inconvenient for the me and my friends. One time my friend had a small get together at her house with 5 friends and she got drunk. She was the only one who got drunk off of strawberry lemonade with vodka??? Then proceed to pee in the bathroom with the door open. She also again has no money but waited after we had ordered pizza to say she was broke. We couldn’t refuse her pizza but she literally ate half a large dominoes pizza and all the chips at my friends apartment. My friend was so angry about it. Another time at a party she literally pissed herself whilst crossfaded and I know I wanted to help my friend but god is it so annoying having to clean someone’s piss? And when we casually drink at my own house she knocks shit over and starts screaming. I tried to explain how crazy she was acting but she got really mad at me. I’m tired of literally having to take care of her financially and physically. And it’s even more annoying she wants to party all the time together. And I have to be the sober one because she will never take care of me. 

On the other side of the coin she has done a lot for me. She has been my friend through thick and thin and will always be my emotional support and my rock. She has always been there to help with what limited ways she can. And she’s always tried to have my best intentions in mine even if she was never really helpful to me physically but emotionally. I feel bad just for hurting her feelings and I want to invite her out to fun places but I just can’t always do that financially. I don’t want to her to feel like money and material things is the driving force in our relationship. It’s starting to feel that way though. I just don’t get a lot out of this friendship because everyone we hang out it’s figuring out how I’m gonna feed her and making sure she’s taken care of. But at the same time I feel like that pretty fucked, it’s just all material things she needs.",11Aug2019,1

345,"So basically as the title states, my apartment complex has given away my parking spot that I pay for. 

The backstory to this is that I live in this complex that has paid for parking with assigned numbers, there are no parking passes you put on your car saying you are allowed to park there or not. I've lived here for a little over a year now and have been paying for this spot for roughly 9-12months. The last couple of days when I come home from work I've noticed someone in my spot and so I just took pictures of the vehicle and their license plate along with the spot number. So Saturday morning I reported this to one of the landlords (there are multiple people who work in the office) and I found out that a different landlord went ahead and gave my spot away to a new tenant that is moving in and just took my name off their excel spreadsheet. I got no notice of this and I am still paying for parking without having a single assigned spot for me to park in now. So I got an email from them later on Saturday basically saying that they went ahead and moved me to another spot which is the complete opposite of the parking spot I had which is realistically now the farthest spot away from the building when I already had the closest spot to the building.

I'm unable to do anything till Monday and was wondering what kind of advice anyone might have to share with this sort of situation. As in are they really able to do this? if they don't give it back should I ask for money back or even possibly take the issue to the manager of the building?",11Aug2019,1

I mainly seek things that motivate thinking and teach you to use your brain. It could also be anything of the similar kind (could also be just those that helped you grow as a person). Even if it was a minor thing, those help more than you think, please add it here!

354,"I am currently a 22 year old student. I often feel inadequate to my peers. I feel that I have yet to experience anytime they have had. I don't have any friends that I can confide in, I never really use any social media platforms to connect with my friends(I have lost many close friends in the past), I never had any job experience until earlier this year, never went travelling, never really drank alcohol, smoke, date or hangout with friends(it is till the point that I feel like a hermit). I often get jealous learning about the experience and achievements(academics, sports, almost everything) that my peers have. I am truly happy for most of my friends, but I can't help myself from being being overly envious. That is probably also the reason I don't use social media, I don't really want to see my friend's achievements and feel inadequate about myself. I am aware the social media is not an adequate representation on real life and with its recent privacy concerns I should not really feel the need to be engage in this. But,  I have always felt that that is one of the many reasons I never really had friends who last long.

Other reasons include me not dressing well, social anxiety, performance anxiety, summing up with my lack of confidence.

I grew up being a tomboy (when I was child I wished that I was born a boy instead, I have since came to term with it), it was hard for me to try on dresses/skirts, feminine, makeup without feeling like I am cross dressing (I am trying to force myself to dress feminine, I genuinely want to wear a dress and feel confident about it).

 I am pretty straightforward, so I quite difficult social cues. I often find myself not knowing how to start a conversation or sustain a conversation that will be interesting or stop a conversation from too personal.

I don't really know how to put this but I feel that I have quite an 'extreme' personality. I tend to either be really lazy or work super hard for something for a short period of time. I could just spent my whole holiday just laying on my bed watching youtube videos. I can also cramp my whole semester's studies to the last minute prior to my exam (which I think is horrible as I believe that knowledge that are cramp tend to be forgotten very easily but it has been a habit that I find it really difficult to kick). When I got my job earlier this year, I decided to pick up several hobbies and work overtime all at the same time. While during summer vacation, I decided to slack off again. I attribute my personality to my feeling of inadequacy, my inadequacy is my motivation to work hard and gain as much experience as I can within a short period of time. Sometimes, it works but often times it doesn't and I will go back to my depressed  state.

I know what is happening with myself, but I don't really know how to take the first step. I felt that I have grown a lot ever since I got my first job but I still can't help my inferiority complex.

Thanks for reading my lengthy post. Here's a TL:DR if it helps:)

TL:DR: I grew up shunning myself away from from all social events. I easily get jealous of my peer's achievements and experience. I feel the dire need to compensate for the time that I have lost, often trying to cramp everything I can do in a short period time which then led to failure and depression. Asking for advice to be less jealous and focus more on myself and to focus on priorities one at a time.",11Aug2019,1

356,"

My Mum broke up with my Dad when I was about 6, my dad used to hit my mum and my mum cheated on my dad with his mate at the end of their relationship, (I don’t know the full details, they’re both still angry towards each other and I’m now 18. Mum also likes to talk crap about dad any chance she gets). They had me and 2 other kids together. I’ll call them k and May. We’re all about 2 years apart. After mum and dad broke up mum got with dads mate and had a kid with him, Alex. He was really mean to K and I. I have many horrible memories when we lived with him. He’s one of the big factors why I had childhood mental illnesses. They broke up not long after, alex was born, I don’t remember why. At some point my dad got with my stepmum Fe, she had a daughter from a previous relationship who was a year younger than k. They’re still together. Mum likes to say that dad was seeing her before they broke up but dad says he wasn’t. Mum and dad were doing weed this entire time. 

After mum broke up with Alex’s dad, she decided to get off the weed and she sunk into a massive depression. Me being the oldest, had to fill in for her. Dealing with my siblings and starting puberty, it was a lot for me. I don’t actually remember much let alone the dates and such. After a few online boyfriends mums older sister convinced her to start going to church, she threw herself into religion and became a fully fledged Christian. There she met a friend, M. M had a single brother with 5 kids from previous relationships. His name was Steve. They hit it off and they soon got together , mum fell pregnant and gave birth to my youngest brother, James. 

Things were going ok for a while, mum and Steve got married and he moved in with us. His kids would come and visit everything was ok. My grandparents moved to the same town as us with mums 2 youngest brothers. They were in their older teens. We moved houses a few times and ended up living next to a drug dealer. A few of Steve’s kids moved in with us and they were troubled kids. Steve’s oldest daughter, B, would always start fights with mum and she hated mum. Mum likes to say that B would try and turn me against her. All B did was vent to me about mum. Mum was very controlling. She would get extremely mad at us kids for misbehaving. Mad to the point that she would smack us multiple times to ease her anger. I can remember counting up to 10 hard smacks on my brother before she stopped and left him to cry in his room. I hated listening to it and I did all I could to stay out of trouble at first. Then I just gave up and stopped caring. I started to misbehave at school and wag classes. I got caught and suspended. This was my first time being suspended. Mums solution for punishment was treat me very hostile. I was made to do the laundry for 10 people. Wash, hang up on the line and fold. It took me 4+ hrs to finish the folding. I had to clean up the house and when it came to mopping I couldn’t find the mop so I was made to scrub the floors with a towel. I was not allowed a break for the 2 days I was suspended. when my brother was suspended he got to sit around and do nothing.

I hated school and I hated home but I had nowhere to go because my mum made me hate my dad. She even made us stop listening to ‘worldly’ music, pretty much everything that wasn’t Christian music. After it was found out that my uncle was inappropriately touching May and Steves daughter who was the same age, mums and Steve’s marriage fell apart. After they broke up, mum started seeing another man, Michael. I hate him so I’m going to use his actual name. At first he was ok, he helped us start a better lifestyle. We moved out of the drug street and into a better house. Things seemed to be going well. Mum was studying and becoming more relaxed. He brought her a house but kept it in his name. We moved in and a few months later Michael and his two youngest kids moved in as well. Michael is in his 50’s so his youngest is 16 now.

I had a causal job at hungry jacks (Burger king) but the house they brought was in the next suburb and I was working until 9pm sometimes 10pm. Because mum had to come pick me up because the buses stopped at 7pm and leave the kids at home alone, Michael didn’t like that. He convinced mum to talk me into quitting. A few months later he would complain that I didn’t have a job to pay for anything for myself. I was also overweight a little. Say 5’4 and 80kgs so I had a bit of chub. I was always hated how big I was and mum didn’t help either because she was always putting me on diets. Michael started giving me papers about diabetes and heart disease wanting me to read them and thinking it would motive me to loose weight. At this point I was failing year 10 and I’d lost my friends. I managed to scrape through and get to year 11. 

2017 was a hard year for me. I was starting a new school because most of the schools in my area go from year 7 to 10 and you complete year 11 and 12 at a different campus. I’d lost my virginity just before school started. It was to a guy that only wanted me for sex and I was too naive to realise, he told me after that he was in love with someone else but wanted to continue seeing me. I knew the girl from year 10 and didn’t feel comfortable with continuing to talk to him. The next month I missed my period I think due to stress and I went to the dr to get a pregnancy test, mum found out and was extremely mad at me. She made me feel like a whore. After Michael found out the whole house knew because he would love to make jokes about me. Michael was in charge of getting my school books because he said that he would get them. I gave him my booklist when I got it. I found my maths book on Facebook for cheap and the only thing he got me was a calculator because it wasn’t a normal one and I needed it to do my schoolwork. I started failing my classes in the first term. 

I had major anxiety and I started to SH. I’d also lost almost 20kgs because I couldn’t eat and my only form of transport was the bus even though both mum and Michael had a car. After the first term Michael sat me down and convinced me that dropping out was a good idea. So I dropped out of school and sunk into a deeper depression and started SH more. Once Michael found out he started to mock me even though his daughter SH and showed them off and I was trying to hide it, I didn’t want the kids to know. Mum told him to stop but left it at that and practically let him. 

I met my now boyfriend. He was the one good thing I had going for me. He’s 8 years older than me. I didn’t tell mum about me for the first 2 months. She eventually did find out she was happy at first but once she found out his age she was upset. He wasn’t treating me bad or anything he was just older. Mum started to point out things to try and make me see him in a bad light. She tried to use the excuse that she didn’t want me to be in an abusive relationship like she was. She would give me these long talks and it felt like she just wanted me to break up with him, she ended up having a full on yelling match at him before she felt ok with me dating him. She would also yell at me a lot for stupid reasons. After I dropped out of school I was practically the nanny. I had to clean the house and make sure the kids got their chores and homework done before Mum and Michael got home at 5:30. If I didn’t I would get into trouble. I was also made to look for a job and if I didn’t find one it was because I wasn’t trying hard enough. I ended up doing a hospitality certificate and got a job through the work experience. That only lasted a few months before they fired me for not being able to look after the restaurant on my own. My bf thinks it was because I was underage and could serve drinks at the bar. Mum broke up with Michael for the first time only to get back with him a few weeks later. Not long after that I moved in with my bf. Mum didn’t like it at first but soon accepted it and was acting really nice to me. 

About 8 months later she broke up with Michael again and fell pregnant in January 2018 to Alex’s dad. After Michael found out mum was pregnant he wanted to sell the house. I guess he thought he wouldn’t have another chance with her now she was pregnant. He never sold the house but mum did move across the country for 8 months, she took the kids out of school and moved to the same town her younger sister lived in. She didn’t have a house ready nor a job lined up. I went up for a 3 week holiday over my birthday and the baby was born the day before my birthday, her names Grace. I found out a few days before that mum was talking to Michael again and I was so upset that I actually cried on my birthday. Mum later told me that she was only talking to Michael as a friend. She then later after I’d gone home, told me she was dating him again. She then decided to move back. Michael had given her the house back and they’re now living together. 

Since being back my sister has gone off the rails. SH, doing drugs and sleeping with heaps of boys. She’s even tried to od twice. Mum tried to say that me selling my car for $500/$1000 was a good deal even though it’s worth more than that and tried to say my bf and his mechanic friend didn’t know what they were talking about when it came to what was wrong with the car. That pissed my bf off and he called his mum who then called my mum and told her she was a bad mother. My mum lied to her saying I said my car was worth $80 and a few other lies that I can’t remember off the top of my head and then took that as me talking about her behind her back and hasn’t talked to me since. She couldn’t even tell me when my brother or sister ran away or when my sister tried to od for the second time. She couldn’t even say hi to me when I helped my brother pick his stuff up from hers.
She’s now being friendly with my brother and wants to know what’s my problem with her. But still won’t contact me directly. I have a lot of time to reflect and think about how much she’s set me up to fail and I just get mad and upset 

Sorry for the massive backstory but I felt I needed to include a summary of it all. Am I wrong for being mad at her? Should I give her another chance? I miss my younger siblings terribly but I don’t think she will let me see them without being on talking terms with her again",11Aug2019,1
357,"Hello everyone. I am currently living with my grandma for the summer in the apartment building. She has been majorly sick in the past and still has heart problems. I recently found out that a neighbour of her often smokes right in from of the entrance into building. Because of that, not only stairwell stinks most of the time, she can't open windows in the kitchen andd her bedroom because they fill with smoke. 

She has asked him multiple times to stop, but he always deflects and continues to do so. I met him today while he was smoking and asked him to stop. He did not listen and even mockingly asked ""Oh are you suffocating"" to which I said yes and he turned around and started ignoring me.

I am already planning to take photos/film next time I see him smoking near the open entrance, but is there any other way I can approach this situation? This happens in Lithuania",11Aug2019,1
358,"I appreciate any advice or opinions! I found an apartment on Trulia. Nothing about the listing seemed particularly out of the ordinary. The listing said no broker fees. 
The information said the contact name was Mark. I sent email through Trulia and got response via email and text. The sender of the email was Maple Properties* (with w trulia generated email) and the respondent identified themselves as Mark. Since then communication has been over text. I asked if they were the owner and they said they work for the owner. 
We met and he showed me the apartment the next day. Place seems good, he seemed nice, no weird vibes.  I asked what they need to move forward (ie application, proof of income, etc). He said he could email the lease and I can sign and email back. Asked my income and said something to the effect of yeah you're fine. The lease says it is between Maple properties* and tenant. 
They haven't asked for cash or money to be wired, no one is ""out of town""  or anything super glaring. Only security deposit to (Bank) and rent on the first of the month. 

A couple of things are concerning to me - 1. There is nothing about this company online, only thing I found was a state tax record with maple properties* listed as owner. This individual seems to be the decision maker (there has been no statement like oh let me ask the owner if that's ok in response to a request). 
2. They do not want any sort of application or credit check
3. I only know this guy by 'Mark' and haven't been told their last name or the owners. The lease was sent from (streetaddressofrental)@gmail.com

Does this sound like it could be a scam? Should I be concerned and if so how do I find out if it is legit or not?",11Aug2019,1
360,"I am 16, and I work at a place where we load 1-3 trucks every night with snacks and beverages; and long story short, it’s a shitty job. It pays horribly; we get paid per-truck, but it usually takes us multiple hours to finish the job every night, so it ends up becoming about half of minimum wage for how much I work. Not only is the pay horrible, but I’ll be taking three AP courses when the upcoming semester starts at school, and I don’t think I can maintain good grades and this subpar job at once. I would just quit outright, but there’s one big problem; my boss is a good guy, and I don’t want to anger him, as he’s been nothing but friendly to me. The only thing I fear is that he’s got a poor temper (that I’ve never been on the receiving end of) and he already seems to be irritated after one of my friends recently quit the job.

TL;DR - My job sucks and I’d like to quit, but my boss is a good guy and I’d like to not trigger his seemingly short temper. How should I go about quitting?",11Aug2019,3

Out of no where they will start playing music with no concern too the rest of flat. As I am writing this post now I have a fever and just want to sleep so I can go to my 9-5 tomorrow. 

But no these people have not heard that earphones or headphones were invented or that we have to live with everyone else.

Now here are two ways I am thinking of dealing with this.

1. Find a meme about it and post it on our WhatsApp group so they'll be embarrassed not to do it.

2. I wake up at 6 am and these people wake up at around 10 am on weekends so on the next weekend when I would've recovered from my sickness I'll just blast songs by borrowing some really powerful speakers from my friends at work.

363," I have a coworker (M), who recently asked out another coworker (F) on a date. We all work in the same system, but the girl works at a different branch, so there's no dating-who-you-work-with issue here. She used to work at my branch however, and her best friend (F) still works with me, so the girl who got asked out used to be in my branch a lot, visiting her friend and former coworkers. 

Anyway, the girl is not really interested in the guy. She’s also very religious, and still lives at home with parents who would disapprove. She’s very conservative and traditional and doesn’t really want to date anyone outside her religion. She’s also not interested in him as a person. 

But she’s also very socially anxious and sweet, and deathly afraid of conflict. So she turned him down in a vague, excuse-making way that didn’t really make clear to him that she does not want to date him. 

As a result, he has not given up hope, stating his intention to the best friend to ask her out again, and even to learn more about her religion. That’s not really helpful though, because she doesn’t want to date someone who converts because of her; she wants someone already devout in the faith. But I digress. The best friend has tried to gently persuade him to give it up, but apparently he is undeterred.

As a result, the girl has almost completely stopped talking to him, when their relations were friendly before, and all but ceased her visits to our branch and her best friend. She’s far too anxious to ever confront him and the best friend is completely uncomfortable being caught in the middle, because she is still friends with the guy. 

And let me make clear, I do not believe he is aware of the anguish she is experiencing. He is by all accounts a decent dude and seems to have truly believed that she only turned him down because of surmountable obstacles. So I don’t think there’s any issue of sexual harassment. 

My question is this: would it be appropriate for me to step in and speak to the guy? To tell him that the girl is not interested at all and that he should drop his efforts because she is too anxious to ever tell him so. Should I mention that she is avoiding him and her friends because of the awkwardness? I wouldn’t say I’m particularly close with any of the involved parties, I just can’t help but see a problem created by poor communication and social anxiety that I am equipped to deal with. But I don’t want to overstep my bounds or exacerbate the hurt feelings. 

I suppose it’s worth mentioning that I am a man, and probably about 5 or so years older than the involved parties (I’m 29).",11Aug2019,2

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

367,"My dad is a great guy and has always been there for my family but I’m afraid of his when he’s angry. It started more when I was little and everything was punishable through a belt but as I got older and the belt stopped working he got more violent. It would be an electrical cord or a switch and after talking to my other friends I thought this was normal but one day this logic stopped. It was the fifth grade and I hadn’t done my hw for a week and I had done the same thing the year before but for a few days but this time my dad hit me in the face. I remember him smacking me so hard that I ended up with a bloody nose. For a while I didn’t think anything was wrong bcs even when my dad hit me my family claimed it was discipline but when he lied to my grandma I knew something was up but I never brought it up again because when I told my mom she’d yell at my dad and I would end up being hit again. Since my dad had given me a bloody nose he would still yell at me and by then I’d shake and cry bcs I was worried about being hit but the only other instance where my dads hit me or hurt me intensely was the 9th grade when I was rebelling by not doing my hw (Call it laziness). But he ended up choking me out really badly (mind you I was 13/14) and I just remember crying my eyes out. The only reason I’m saying this was because on weekends my sister and I usually clean up the whole house while my dad sleeps, unaware to my mom (she’s working). My mom realized that the master bedroom was still messy and she yelled at my dad about it bcs why wouldn’t it be vacuumed. He ended up yelling at me and was cursing about how the room looked like shit and I just remembered being 9 going on 10 and the fear I had and how I would hyperventilate out of fear and I just need some help with coping? I’m 16 but I’ve seen my dad yell and belittle my sister how he did to me and I usually stop it but witnessing it makes me cry.

I'm currently a senior at high school and my school is an early college highschool, so I should've been able to finish with my associates when I'm done with highschool. Here's the problem, i generally think that my grades are so fucked that I don't think I'll be able to go to college or the fact that I failed college algebra twice and that it's going to affect me. I don't know what to do and my year is almost over. My grades are so bad because I didn't care and now that school is almost done I can't do anything about it. I really don't know what to do anymore and I'm some what considering suicide or something because everyone in my family saw me as this prodigy child but now they see that I'm just retarded and struggling to pass school. I don't know what's wrong with me, everytime I have issues with something I just set aside school work and deal with whatever first and I don't do so well. I spoke to a counselor at school about this and she was just speechless when she pulled up my transcript and was surprised that I didn't get kicked out of the program. I'm just so ashamed with my self for not being better and I can't do anything anymore because it's too late. What do I even do at this point? No responses from Universities, not only that if I do get accepted and I get my bachelor's in computer science, who's going to hire me?

369,"In the last two months, my current job has gone through so much change in leadership and team dynamics. I used to be able to really interact and do work with people that really benefits them (I work at a gym), but nowadays I’m just stuck at the front desk all the time doing the same thing over and over again—which is getting a little boring dealing with the same thing and the same attitudes all the time.

I can’t really move up any positions since I’m only working in part time and I’m in college. A lot of people have quit in the last month, and as such, those of us who are still here are required to take their hours with little flexibility.

Many of us are upset, and at a lot of points this week I’ve found myself dreading coming into work when I used to enjoy coming there. The only part of the gym I enjoy now is just working out—not even working there.

The only thing holding me back are the people there. A few of the people at front desk and management are good people, and although I’m like 85% on quitting, I know that my decision will screw them over—and I don’t want to put those people in that position, since I know it’ll put them through a lot of struggle.

I can always wait and see if more people are hired or if things change, but my mental health is really telling me to find a new job. The gridlock happens when my morals prevent me from ‘screwing over’ these people whom I’ve worked with for over a year now—who are almost like a second family.

I want to find a new job, but I don’t want to leave on bad terms and I don’t want to screw them over.

I'm in my teens can't move out we're all supposed to live together next month and honestly we've been living together with our grandma for 2 years now i don't know if i can take more of this.

My grandma often says stuff like the stuff above when she's mad and i often think ""Should i have some protection should i lock the door."" it's physically scary living with people who say they'll kill you so easily.

Don't do that again watch what happens."" we all mumble things when we're mad but at times i just say it in my mind to let the steam go like ""I hate you i wish i was never born in this family"" In my mind and get over it later on. I'm pretty sure my grandma likes everyone one of my cousins besides me i know who her favorites are and honestly i hate how she blatantly said their her favorites.

I'm a 22 year old college student soon starting my final year in college (commuting 45 mins) while working a part time job. 


Heres my story 


Before we bred my dog (abbie) I was totally on board with keeping one pup. At the time we only had two dogs. Abbie and Ben.

But then after breeding Abbie, my mother decides to adopt a 8 week old pup - Charlie, from our friend who also is a breeder. Okay? But now I'm fine with Charlie cuz shes alittle older and I trained her well so far. But my mother still wants to keep a newborn. Right now there 3 weeks and a couple days old. We sell them off at 8 weeks.... I can't handle ANOTHER puppy in the house. The plan was to keep a puppy, not adopt another dog and then keep a puppy (totaling off to 4 dogs) 


that's a lot of WORK. Charlie was a lot of work when I got her... I literally wont have time to spend time with this new pup and I'll feel so bad. Chances are I'll end up taking care of her like I am with Charlie 

I know ur gonna say- tell ur mother that u dont want one. 

Trust me I did - numerous times. Shes convinced that we all can pitch in. *False statement*

But this issue is, all the work falls on me cuz I'm the one that cares for them. 
(Except for ben cuz that's my sister's dog, but even he doesnt get cared for, he just sits in a room and does nothing.

My sister complains that I bonded too much to Emma - cuz its technically its her dog...
But I'm the one training her and caring for her. 

This past night she left her in a cage instead of taking Charlie to her room to go sleep with. Of course I felt bad and I took her up into my room to sleep with.

375,"Hi first time poster here. I just need some advice as I’m really struggling right now.

I’ve been watching my dad die for the past 9 months, and it had gotten so much worse the last two weeks. We thought it was goodbye but we got a call last night that they found a match for his organs, and he got a double transplant (liver + kidney) today. 

Naturally, I’ve been extremely stressed and worried and upset, so I have not been feeling my greatest overall. However, tonight is a whole different ball game. I’m not sure if it’s just the gathered stress of everything, but o started having GI distress, and by the time I got home from the hospital I was shaking uncontrollably and feeling like I was going to pass out.

I have pretty bad anxiety so I knew that I was having a panic attack. However, it’s been about 2.5hrs now and... it won’t stop. I dozed off for a few mins, and when I woke back up, I immediately started to shake and feel out of control again. I have not had anymore GI distress except for just stomach feeling upset. Not even really “nauseous”, per say - I just get these waves of pain/burning in my stomach.

At first I thought maybe I got food poisoning, because of the GI issue and then my stomach pain, but I feel at this point, the GI distress would have been so much worse or kicked in full blown by now? We all at dinner at a (highly-rated) Mexican restaurant by the hospital at about 1830, it’s now almost 0600 where I live.

378,"Okay, so I did something *super dumb* back in April.

It was the start of summer break and I was bored. Then an anonymous guy asked me NSFW questions on CuriousCat. I was intrigued so I answered them. This went on for a few more days until he made a dummy account on Facebook. He added me on there and we talked. I didn't know who he was (big red flag!). At this point, we were kind of like friends with benefits? I never got the chance to ask him what we were so I don't really know.

Later that week, I sent him suggestive pictures and he sent me some back. Also more sexting. It was going great, I felt more confident because of the constant stream of compliments he gave me. But I was also starting to suspect something -- why won't this guy just tell me who he was? All he told me was that he knew me IRL, that we were classmates back in either Grade 9 or Grade 10, and that we were once close friends. Okay. Anon (I called him anon), why don't you just tell me your name? Do you have a girlfriend or something?

AH WELL SHIT! I was right. He did have a girlfriend.

And he was indeed a close friend of mine.

*Yikes.*

Since I'm not a complete piece of human crap, I told his girlfriend. Yup, she was also a friend of mine. You can already imagine how shitty I felt as I was confessing. It was a night full of tears and guilt. I'm sorry, \[redacted\], I didn't know your boyfriend had the hots for me and I didn't know he was a scumbag. For real tho, I was and am really sorry.

OK. Blah, blah, blah, the girlfriend tries to go and dump this cheating sonuvabitch. Anon's mom interferes and asks her to give anon a second chance -- *ew* \-- now girlfriend can't break up. More tears, more fights, more bullshit. Of course, I'm there as an emotional support for the girlfriend since I felt so bad and we were friends. And I was also out there telling my other friends what happened. Now everyone was mad at anon... as they should be. Some of his friends confronted him and some started ignoring him. He was so pissed at me. I was satisfied.

Keyword: was

Now I think everything is backfiring.

Just yesterday, anon's mom messaged me. She asked me if my parents knew about me sending inappropriate pictures to other guys on the Internet. Well, duh, of course they don't. How the hell am I gonna tell them? Hey, mom, mind if I sent this guy a picture of my boob? *Ugh.*

Anon also messaged me. I think it was something about me paying my share? Haha, what share and how much? When am I gonna pay? Should I give you the money in person or should I transfer it to your bank account? *Double ugh.*

Yes, I know I seem like I'm just mocking them (lol yes I am) but I am also really scared. My parents are really strict. They are Asian. They are Catholics. If anon or his mom sent my parents the pictures, then I am royally fucked.

So I am going to beat them to it.

**How should I tell my parents this? Thanks!**

TL;DR: Talked to anon guy. Sent nudes. Turns out he has a GF. Exposed him. And now he might tell my parents what I did.",11Aug2019,1

Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it.

381,"(not looking for relationship advice)

Hey reddit, I've got an issue and would appreciate some advice ...   
My boyfriend, who is awesome, makes up stories a lot. He's not a kid, he's a dude in his 40s. I don't know how to feel about this. 

Example: I called to ask about his day, and he told me he'd gone to the mall and bought us cake for dinner because he'd really been craving cake. When he got home, he didn't bring cake. He was confused for a moment when I asked about it and then went ""oh right I told you I bought cake! I was just joking, you didn't believe me did you?""   
Now, there was nothing in our previous conversation to indicate he'd just been joking. In fact, we had a 10-minute, mostly serious talk about the mall and cake, and now it turns out he never went there. Sometimes the stories he tells are just plain unbelievable and I can easily spot he's just joking and making stuff up to get a laugh, but mostly I just believe him and then later find out by accident that it was all made up. This has already led to some arguments between us. He doesn't lie in a ""bad way"" and maintains that I should not take him so seriously/believe everything he says, but that's hard for me. I trust him and why would I want to start doubting everything he says? 

I asked him to at least tell me he's making things up when he realises that I believe him, so that I'm not disappointed (like in case of cake. I mean, who wouldn't want cake?), but he thinks that's pretty ridiculous. 

I don't know how to handle this. Does anyone else either do this, or know someone who does, and can offer me some advice? Should I really just not believe *anything* anymore? Is it wrong of me to expect him to at least give me a clue afterwards? 

I feel like the butt of someone's creative writing exercise ...",11Aug2019,1
382,"Hi guys, 

A little background, I was in a relationship from 16 to 24 with a girl. But after 4 years she cheated on me, we split up but went back together. Very bad idea, I didn't really care and was cheating all the time. Finally, after 4 years we slip up for good. She did it beacause I was doing a semester away and was thinking of traveling more and she couldn't handle it. 


I was single for 2 years. I really loved this seduction game, to know that a girl is attracted to you, this little game you play with her while seducing her. 


I finally met a girl and we matched greatly. We moved together after 4 months due to some external circumstances. The 10th first months were amazing, but now I have this envy that is growing to go back to this seduction game, and I hate it. I don't understand why. My girlfriend is amazing (not effect like everyone) but I start looking more and more at others girls and trying to fight those thoughts that I would love to seduce her  etc etc. 


Why am I like that ? Why I can't be like those people that say their so is amazing, and yes that girl is beautiful but they don't want anything more because they are happy like this. 


My question is, should I stop it here to avoid going back the track I was or there is still hope ?",11Aug2019,1
384,"I'm doing an online coruse and volunteer to gain experience.

The problem is, here that after a certain age they need to pay you more than min wage, but many trainees are only 16 or older so get hired instantly and are trained and get a job.

I only have 2 years customer service experience and a bachelor degree (in arts, but haven't found a job in that either, probably because my portfolio is just not commercial enough).

I thought applying for retail jobs with my experience is good enough, but can't even get a job there because younger people are getting hired for cheaper labour.

I really have no clue what to do, I mean, I still have money but not enough to travel far to volunteer to places all the time.

I feel so inadequate and stupid most of the time because of this, people at my age are all working.

I have tried volunteering at other vet clinics, but they mostly don't help me; one manager even told me to stop doing all hte jobs because she wants to leave those to train people she actually is hiring, so she wanted me to just sit around and watch...

I keep busy with exercising, studying and drawing a graphic novel , I have tried selling my art online but it's just not good enough (and probably the reason why I couldn't find anything with my digital media degree, all I was asked to do at the end was create a portfolio of 12 artistic images...not great to branch off into marketing.)",11Aug2019,1
385,"I [20 F] have a friend [21 F] who doesn't speak well of me behind my back. She has told people things like- 'She dresses up so that she gets a boyfriend.'
'Her brother looks so feminine.'
'She is such an attention seeker.'
It came to me as a shock especially because she is close to me and knows better than anyone that I don't even want to date currently and also that I dress up for myself, I like looking presentable. Another helpful information would be the fact that I don't dress up provocatively. 
I still wanna hangout with her because of some of these reasons. We study well together. Her boyfriend's friends are my good friends.
I don't know if I'm making excuses for her, but she isn't super nice to me.
Also the fact that people in my college aren't easy to befriend, their state of mind is completely different from me so the ones I am friends with, I'd like to keep them for the next two years so that it's easy and I meet my daily human contact needs.

Then a really bad burning sensation came so I put some aftersun on it, by then the burning had gone away but as soon as I applied the aftersun the burning got much worse. It calmed down and now one day later everyone is saying that it looks like a first degree burn. I now have sunscreen on it and am staying out of the sun as much as possible.

My best friend (m) and I (f) have always been super close, super open talking about our problems, we have a well working relationship. We’ve both never had romantic feelings for each other, and most likely never will. 

We don’t see each other very often (once/maybe twice a week, only for a couple minutes) but we do text all the time. That’s just how it’s always been.

It’s always felt like it was just us two. I’ve never been more close with someone or more comfortable talking to anyone but him. 

He recently got into his first serious relationship. His girlfriend seems great. My best friend and I talk less, considering he likes to spend majority of his free time with his girlfriend and It's very clear that his priorities have shifted. Which I completely understand. I do not expect him to place me higher than his girlfriend. But sometimes it really does feel like I’m slowly losing him and whenever we talk, it feels like there’s somewhere he’d rather be.

I even went away with his family and he spent most of the time texting his girlfriend, at times we wouldn’t even speak and I would just sit in silence for hours while he would be talking to her.  Like i was forgotten/not cared about. 

It just hurts to feel like we aren’t as close as we used to be, I really wanna go back to how it was. And i feel selfish for thinking this because he is so happy in his new relationship, and i'm really happy for him

Any advice on how to cope with this?",11Aug2019,2

Knocked my head last night against a wall - I was at home but slightly intoxicated as I was enjoying some wine with my Boyfriend, when it happened.

I feel seedy today, didn’t get a great sleep (I’m sure because of the wine) but I am SO paranoid something bad is happening to my brain because of the knock - the anxiety is causing me to feel nauseated and it’s making me feel even worse about it. I did the worst thing and googled, only to find a string of articles along the lines of “why a knock to your head can be life threatening” which has spiralled my health anxiety.

The crazy thing is - I’ve knocked my head before MANY times and never felt this worried?! (on the car boot, getting up to quickly from under a table and stocked my head, opening a cabinet you name it!)

However I am now having doubts about whether I would enjoy the electrician training and I also have the opportunity to volunteer on a sail training ship, and this would be until I could restart my application for the Navy in April, which would mean I could possibly get in January 2020.

397,"So I’m at work with a coworker I’m already not fond of honestly and she’s complaining to me about one of our clients.

A different coworker, the cook, had made the client a smoothie using the client’s almond milk without making sure it was ok to use the almond milk. Other milk was available and the client doesn’t have a lot of money.

So the one coworker is complaining to me and saying the client was being crazy, but unsure I asked to clarify if the client had requested the smoothie. My coworker said they didn’t know but even if the client did not request the smoothie and the cook had no reason to assume the client wanted a smoothie that it is ok. The cook was trying to do something nice so using the client’s property without asking would be ok no matter what.

A bit flabbergasted I asked if they thought it’d be ok for me to just steal their car and use their gas to buy them a soda that they didn’t ask for and I had no reason to assume they wanted. They said yes.

I need to know if I’m the crazy one here thinking theft is wrong even if it’s to do something nice, especially if you have no reason to assume they want the thing you’re doing for them. Am I really wrong about that? And if I’m not wrong, how can I try and help my coworker understand because that seems like the foundation for an issue.

401,"I \[20F\] live with my father \[58\]

One of his friends \[M / close in age to my father\] is, for want of a better word, creepy.

When I first met him at 17 he was very 'touchy feely'. Not in a way that was obviously sexual, but he wanted to hug me, put his arm around me, or make physical contact in situations that seemed uncalled for.

It made me uncomfortable. I didn't say anything to anyone because I thought it was just me, and my father doesn't have the easiest time making friends, so I didn't want to rock the boat.

Since then I've avoided him when he would come over, but his behaviour has remained the same. I don't want to come out of my room when he is at my house. Even if I make sure I'm not near him, he looks at me in a way that makes me incredibly leery of him. Recently I have talked to my sister, and she has found the same issues with him. I've made remarks over the years of him being creepy, but my family blows it off, and my father has flat out laughed in my face. I really don't blame him for this, my father is a good man, but he's very trusting.

Recently my parents went out of town and he called. I tried to avoid telling him that they were away, but politeness won out and I told him they wouldn't be home for a number of weeks. The call ended and I was very anxious that he knew I would be home alone for such a long period of time. I immediately checked the locks on the doors and windows, and called my brother to let him know what happened (he didn't seem concerned). 

For the foreseeable future I will be living in this house, and this man will continue to be a presence in my home. I'm sick of having to hide out in my room when he comes over. He is one of my father's only friends, and I don't want to deprive him of that. But frankly the man scares me.

What can I do in this situation?",11Aug2019,4

404,"Sooo asking for advice on this feels kind of weird since it's not something which people would describe as a tricky situation per-say but I have no idea what to do.

I've had this person I've been best friends with since I was a baby. We lived in the same city, went to the same school and etc. Anyways when I was 12 my family moved away and this person I spent like practically all my time with became very distant. I would only see them like once a year after that and admittedly it's my fault I never organised stuff.

So last year (I'm being inspecific about ages on purpose btw) I went to visit them and I had the realisation I've not been doing anything to see them more often, so I arranged at the end of the day to meet them at the same location around midday. Next day comes and they don't show. I was standing there for about an hour and then his brother showed up (our brothers were also friends) and told me that they were still at the house so I walked over (to their house) with the brother. Anyways my old friend wasn't super keen to see me from how they acted. They barely spoke and were quite distant (at least that's how I felt). But one positive is that they asked me to go in the pool with them which I couldn't cus I didn't bring shorts. (For context, it wasn't just aquard silence because our brothers were also in the room talking to us).

Next day comes and I had arranged for them to come to ours. They didn't. They said that they had an illness and were unable to visit. I had a feeling they were lying as this is the second time we made plans and they never showed but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and said it was fine. Just to be clear my brother was the only way for me to contact them as I didn't have their number or them on any social media, so all communication went through him.

About 2 days later I go back to where i first met them them and got their social media. I proceeded to message them saying if they want to do something they only need to message me and I'd be down.

Never got a response from them other then ok. For two weeks.


I'm back again and have the option to visit them of I want to. I haven't yet because I feel like they were being distant to cut ties with me. I don't know whether to visit them and confront them on it or just not bother.

I know this seems dumb but I've literally been having dreams with them in it where I confront them or I'm reminded of time we used to spend together. It's actually annoying me because I thought I had settled that I wouldn't be visiting but it's like my brain disagrees. Please help me figure this stupid shit out. Thanks",11Aug2019,1
405,"My husband and I have been together for two years one year as bf/gf and the second year we were married. We had moved out of his parent's house about 10 months ago(3 months after we got married). His parent's were both very abusive in every way possible. They abused us financially, emotionally, physically (beat their son) they also were codependent and it was a nightmare. My husband's father has a severe drinking problem that is so awful and to top it off he's self centered and a complete narcissist. My husband's mother she's not mentally right in the head and she treats my husband like it is her husband and she cries and whines if he is not giving her attention. This is a terrible situation because my husband and I have tried hard to maintain a civil relationship with his family but he relies on them for money way too much. This isn't a good situation for me because I sometimes feel like the third wheel in my own marriage because his mom requires his undivided attention as well as his dad and he caters to their needs on repeat. He has tried to stand up for himself and put his foot down but there is no good luck trying. This morning I got hurt because his father left an inappropriate voicemail on my husband's phone where he was threatening us pretty much with if he was dying on a death bad we would be the last ones to know since we don't keep in communication for obvious normal reasons based on the matter. My husband does not want to block his parent's from our life but in my opinion I feel they are very toxic and abusive people to maintain a normal relationship with. This is a mess some advice would be great. I am on the verge of saying forget it packing my belongings and ending my marriage. I'm just hurt because his family ruined my credit drained me emotionally and than their son also hasn't treated me the best he's lied and done sketchy things behind my back which were drug related.

412,"Hey everyone, 

I didn't know where else to turn to. So lately my mental health has been diminishing for the past few months now. Last year I had quit my previous job because the work environment was toxic, hours were way to long, and the amount of pay was not where I wanted it to be for the amount of work I did. I was extremely depressed for the longest time so I had to make a change. I saved up some money to get me by for a few months then I put in my two weeks. After I had left I was looking for another job and wasn't having any success. I was trying to get into a coding program and that did not work the first time around. Some months went by and my money had run out. 

Side tangent, I am living with my girlfriend and she makes decent amount of money to support both of us. When I had my job I also was supporting both of us until she found something. When she did find something I had to make sure both of us were getting to work since we had one car. The distance from her job along with how early it was meant I didn't get to spend a lot of time with her or getting decent sleep and that was if I was lucky to get out on time. This stress also didn't help me when I had a job either.

After the money had ran out I got a little more serious about looking for a job and still couldn't find anything. Another opportunity came up for me to try out for the coding program and I got in. For the first 3 months I was happier than what I have been in a long time. About a month ago I have been feeling extreme loneliness along with depression. I had taken medication in the past for my anxiety and depression but that was before I was kicked off my mom's insurance. These feelings are starting to take hold of my mental state to somewhat dangerous levels. I haven't been able to sleep right and being by myself is like being attacked in my mind all the time. TV, video games, etc. that would normally give me comfort are no longer working (they haven't been for some months now). The only break I have in my mind is when I'm with other people. I love my friends but I can't expect them to be around all the time.

I'm at a point where I can't take it anymore. I've dealt with my mental illness all my life and I'm scared of my own mind. I don't have money for therapy nor money for any kind of treatment. I don't want to be committed since I don't want that burden for my girlfriend to try and pay. I want some kind of comfort but I don't know what exactly will give it to me. Can anyone relate and give some advice please? I haven't been to bed in about 20 hours so I am going to try and get some sleep. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",11Aug2019,1
413,"I really don’t know where to post this question, any Google or YouTube searches proved fruitless so I’m gonna take a shot here. 

We have a single Amazon Echo device that we connect to through Bluetooth, Spotify being the only thing we really use. Because of this we know that with Spotify, you’re able to control the volume of the Echo itself by toggling our phone buttons, and we can see the volume change on our Alexa. That bits kinda important. 

It all started maybe 2 weeks ago, I had the house to myself and fell asleep in front of the TV. About 2 AM I’m woken up to really loud banging, very echoed and shrill sounding. My first thought was the TV and a horror movie was playing so it added up, I smoked a joint and went back to bed lol. 
Everyone is home by the Monday. 4 people live in the house, me and my brother are the only ones who would connect via Bluetooth rather than voice command, but my mom was home alone in the morning playing music when it was interrupted by a hymn of the Our Father. A very ominous recording that really scared her. I could walk you through the past two weeks but I’m just gonna chalk up everything we’ve heard from Alexa since then:
Our Father/Hail Mary, sounds like someone recorded it inside their pocket. 
Creepy girl laughing/breathing/moans and shrieks. 
Ring around the Rosie. 
“I’m watching you” -local accent, kinda important. 
Overly static recordings of kids outside playing. 

There has been a few more that I can’t recall, but will try to video them if people want. 
These recordings over ride whatever song is playing and when we turn the volume down, we can see Alexa’s volume being turned up by the person harassing us. I obviously know our device isn’t haunted, but a factory reset has proved useless. 

We have no neighbors within Bluetooth range, and if anyone was within range we could see them from our house as there’s nowhere to hide until you get to tree cover where our Bluetooth doesn’t reach. 

The last bit that really threw us off was a phonecall my mom received off someone  claiming to be a police officer. They told her; “my name is Garda O’Reilly and one of your family members is undergoing demonic possession”. 

We really don’t know what to do, as these recordings come on full blast at random and without Bluetooth/WiFi for them to play off.

414,"So I'm 18 years old and traveling with 4 of my best friends who are not muslim in Japan for about two weeks. This happened about two days ago. Basically we all went to go get korean BBQ and I've only ever had it about once or twice, so I let them handle all the ordering and just say not to order any pork and if they want to, to wait until I am done eating so that they would be able to cook it on the same grill as I am eating on. So they all agree and we have a lovely dinner. Fast forward two days, they ask me questions about would I get in trouble for eating pork if I was not aware I was eating it and I answered no, I wouldn't get in trouble but say someone did feed me pork knowing I can't eat it for religious reasons, they would get the sin for it. This has them break out into laughter and state that they ordered pork because they really wanted some when we got Korean BBQ two days ago and decided not to tell me until now because they thought it would be hilarious and they really wanted some. So I go quiet and just question why they would do that when they explicitly know I can't eat it and they know that, as I've been friends with some of these people for over a decade and have spent more time than not with them in the last 5 or more years. They say I should be happy that I was able to try pork and won't be punished for it by god, and claim I'm overreacting when i get angry. One of my friends explain that they initially didn't know it was pork and thought it was beef, but after having it texted all 3 of my other friends to order more and no t tell me because It was already ""too late"". I could have easily just stopped eating if they had told me and went to go eat somewhere else while they finished up and ate whatever they want, but instead they turned it on me and said that I was the one that said I'm able to eat it if its an accident. I haven't spoken to them in two days and they seem to think im overreacting, and i don't know how to feel so im turning to the trusty community of reddit to help me out and maybe tell me if I am tripping or what they would do in that situation, because I think what they did is disgusting and if they really were my friends they would never do anything like this, knowing me for damn near a decade.",11Aug2019,3
415,"Hi, my husband and I just rescued three kittens and they've been living with us for just shy of a week (however they've acclimated pretty quickly and seem content with their new home for now). One of the kittens got very ill on the first day, she had a LOT of worms blocking her system and became really constipated. She spent the night at the vet and she's doing much better now, but we have to monitor her poops still.

The problem is, some friends of ours suddenly had to leave for a week (personal business) and their dog is with a sitter but nobody is able to take care of their cat except us. Their cat is about 10 months old and our kittens are 3-4 months (one is a bit older than the two others). Our kittens are extremely playful and nice, very patient. Their cat is also very playful but a bit coy. We're really nervous about maybe having to introduce them since none of us can leave any of them alone for an entire week and we can't go back and forth. 

We're wondering if it's best to bring our kittens there for the week (they have a very big house, we have a pretty small apartment) or if we bring their cat here? We're worried they won't get along and it will be a huge nightmare, if our kittens will feel too overwhelmed in another new big house, or maybe become used to having a much bigger space, or if bringing their cat here will cause utter chaos (three's a crowd already). 

If anybody has any suggestions, PLEASE help. We have to decide what to do today and we just can't make up our mind on what is best..",11Aug2019,1

418,"So this past year I became pregnant with my first baby, my mother’s second grandson. She always frets about not being able to see her first grandson as much because he lives several states away. I live about 90min from her so I figured she’d be super excited and on the verge of overbearing wanting to come visit all the time. It has turned into the opposite. She seems to make excuses whenever I let my parents know when I’m off and would be a good time for them to come visit. I somewhat think she may be nervous about caring for him on her own, like if we went to dinner or something but she watch him when he was 2 weeks old and my husband and I needed to go to a special doctors appointment that took the entire day. I don’t recall shaming her or scrutinizing her. He’s 6mo old now so definitely more fun and less fragile but I don’t get it 🤷🏼‍♀️ if I ask why she doesn’t visit more it’s always an excuse- she has a cold, she’s tired from helping with my sick grandmother (who just passed so can no longer be an excuse), she has mail and bills to pay, she doesn’t want to bother my husband and I (rather than offering to come watch my son and let us go on a date for once). 
Why do you think someone would fret about not being able to visit family but when the opportunity comes, they come up with excuses and don’t seem to truly mean it? 
She was a great mother to my brother and I and when she does rarely come she is helpful but how can I get across to her I’m disappointed she doesn’t visit more without her making excuses and feeling offended? 

TLDR: my mother doesn’t visit my first born son nearly as much as I thought. How do I let her know how I feel without it causing more drama since she just makes up excuses or becomes offended when questioned?",11Aug2019,1

I got a message from a coworker asking if there was any way I could have accidentally broken her phone (by accidentally hitting it with my bag, I realise now I would have heard it) and she bought it the night before, I replied saying if there was any way I did it I didn’t realise.
I then asked if it was on the floor and she said no back on top of her bag, I said then no it wasn’t me and if I knew I did it I would’ve told her. 
She said it happened in a half an hour period but I had left 20 minutes prior.
She said a manger was going to look at the CCTV footage but now the manger has realised the camera facing to the cubby’s doesn’t work. She has told some people at work she suspects it was me and I’m really anxious at work. It will be awkward when we work together and I feel like people think I’m lying about it.

- i live with mom and grandpa, just turned 18
- have always been the perfect child (grades, behaviour, housekeeping, manners etc.)
- dad never married mom (she was the mistress)
- left her alone when he found out i was on the way (18 years ago)
- came back a few years ago, since his wife died and now he wanted another chance
- i struggled with mental health for years, they truly only made things worse, faulted me for everything, said i was a burden
- we find out about his PTSD
- thinks he's being followed, borderline alcoholic, manipulative, won't listen to anyone but himself talk and overall toxic and aggressive
- tells me i'm unwanted, my mom is mental and a bitch, i'm a drugged lazy pig, i never was and never will be a part of their family (him, mom, grandpa)
- he sends me and my mom threatening messages with close to zero sense, sometimes for a few hours straight (he'll kick us out of OUR house, he'll kill us all and throw bombs, he's an ex-cop so he'll ""make things happen"")
- my mom soaks up everything he says, denies being under his influence
- i find a bf and new friends with whom i feel accepted for the first time in probably 15 years
- i feel at home with my bfs family, they took me in as one of their own, his mom is like a friend to me and gives great advice
- they all have the bad boy/girl look but are the most genuine,  smart and caring people i have ever met, the perfect miy of rocker/hippie haha
- still, i struggle with mental health, but they have made it sooo much more tolerable 
- i realize how fake my old group of friends was 
- my dad convinces mom and grandpa to never let me see them again
- we fight all the time
- they tell me constantly how my whole family is ashamed of me, how i will ruin my life, how these people are trying to kill me
- they let me live in the house, but only if i never leave (except for work, and they track i don't go anywhere after my shift)
- say i'm at fault for most of their problems and i have ruined the family 
- i feel more isolated and lonely than ever before, every day is worse
- i still got one year of hs, and then i move 4 hours away for college",11Aug2019,1
426,"There’s a girl, lets call her N. I know N for like 5-6 years, we started talking again like 2 weeks ago, and it was really awesome, we met couple times. I invited her for a coffe, and then walked in the local park for hours. When she left, she said: “Im happy we started talking again, I enjoy being with you”
I felt happiness first time in months. After that we talked for days, one day I called her, because I had to walk home, and I was bored. (The route that im taking to go home is usually 15-20 minutes.) I intentionally walked slower, because I enjoyed talking with her. I got home after like 40-50 minutes and then I sit down in the front of my house and talked with her for an hour. Then I went inside, this was at like 11PM. I wanted to sleep, but then she called me. She wanted to talk more. You know, as we talked for hours, it got really late. At like 3AM we talked about something that I dont remember, but she said this: “Im wondering, could we speak to each other like this if we were a couple?” This line hit me in my feels, I was so lonely for months. I missed human contact, I missed being loved, and I missed loving someone.
After this, we talked for a bit, and she said she loves me, and she wants to be with me, and she wants to make me happy, because she thinks im a wonderful person. I was so f*cking happy. 
We talked about our lives, she told me couple times, how she loves me. 
Then all of a sudden, she says something: “you know, i want to tell you something. Ive never told this to anyone”
Im like, okay, what is it?
Then she told me: she loves someone, she is in love with her older brothers bestfriend. And she said that the guy loves him too, they only dont date because they dont know how her brother would feel about this.

427,"Hi, throwaway account here needing some help with a situation I am in. Please bear with me as this post will probably be a long one. 

Earlier this night I was playing a game online with a few other friends. The game is not important but understand that I took a resource that is available to the team but only 1 person can have it and it takes about 1/6th of the game for it to replenish. It's debatable whether or not the resource was better with me or with my friend in question, and looking back on it, I would lean towards it being better on my friend. You could make a valid argument for my case, but even I'd agree that in this scenario it would have been slightly better to just outright better with him. I'd also like to preface this by saying the friend I got into a fight with does act more brashly than the average person and in terms of what interests we share in common, well, that'd mainly just be the game we're playing. Anyways, after taking the resource myself he told me that I was intentionally ruining the game for him and our team. I told him that it was not my intention to do that and that the resource was fine on me. I could utilize it in roughly the same way and even in different ways but I didn't explicitly express it (once you take the resource you can't drop it, you'll have to wait for it to replenish and as I was taking it, only then did he tell me not to, but it was too late). I only replied that it was fine on me without explaining what I just did for you. I do understand that more communication could have helped prevent this. Basically, the argument escalated because he repeatedly told me, ""You're intentionally ruining the game""  to which I replied, ""I am not intentionally ruining the game."" I told him that maybe in his eyes I was INtentionally ruining the game but if anything **at the most** I was UNintentionally ruining the game because it was not my INtention to INtentionally ruin the game for you or our team. After that, it got into a petty argument over the definition of what ""intentional ruining the game"" meant which I would say I was correct in what the definition is. Purposefully taking actions in the game that you know will be detrimental to your team. Looking back I agree that this argument was stupid, but during this fight he said things such as, ""shut up you're wrong"", ""stop acting like a child"", ""stop being a princess"" (I'm a male), ""shut up faggot pussy"", ""listen to your weak ass voice"", ""You're probably the type of dude to ..."", etc. There's more but I cannot remember them specifically word for word. Just understand that these insults were on more of a personal level rather than just dissing my ability to play the game. Even during the argument it really wasn't even a structured debate in which someone would state a point and the other would have a rebuttal. It was mainly him trying to talk over me while providing very little factual evidence as well as some personal anecdotes (but mind you this was less than 10% of his argument). His main point was talking over me telling and insulting me with lines from the aforementioned list. During this argument, I realized that it was going nowhere and that I shouldn't play with someone who personally insults me over something so trivial. Yes, an argument takes 2 so I am partly at fault, but I only argued over definitions while he was personally insulting me. Because that this was the case I told him that this would be the last time I'd be playing with him and I would never play with him again. Bad timing, I know. I could have just left without saying anything. Being calm now I can say I was definitely heated as well and I said that statement somewhat out of feeling rather than thinking. But, for the most part, I'd like to think generally speaking that I am usually as rational as possible even in situations like that. After I told him that I'd no longer be playing with him he said what you'd expect, that he was happy/fine/insert adjective here with it. Only after the game did he give a very weak ""I'm sorry"". I was pretty upset by that point so I didn't reply (my voice was actually shaky by that time (it wasn't during the argument) and I didn't want to talk with a shaky voice to just be met with more insults) so I just typed I was busy and I couldn't talk right now. I plan on apologizing for getting into such a dramatic fight over something so petty to everyone that was there during the duration of the argument as well as the person I got into an argument with as I also called him a child after he said the plethora of personal insults that he did.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**  Got into a petty argument over an online video game with another friend (I know lul). Friend starts insulting me heavily on a personal level rather than my skill in the game. I told him I'm never going to play with him again (I was somewhat upset/not thinking 100% straight) since why would I play with someone who insults me like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I make it a point to follow through with things I say. It can be a strength and a weakness. Yes, opinions and people change. I told him I'd NEVER play with him again. Writing that out sounds petty enough to me, but he heavily insulted me. What are your opinions on this sentiment? 
2. Am I soft-skinned/weak? I don't think his insults changed the way I perceived the argument. It did make me act a little more rashly and it did make me upset. So am I just weak'/soft-skinned for not wanting to take personal insults like that over an online game or am I handling this ok?
3. We share mutual online friends and I am not sure if repairing this is worth it or not. I know you guys don't know all the details, but maybe a personal story/experience might help give me some insight into this. So, should I try to repair the friendship for our mutual friends?",11Aug2019,1

430,"I just wanted to have a shower, but no. The water pressure in my shower wasn'teven strong enough to build a stream. It was just single drops of water falling out of it. So I wanted to atleast brush my teeth, there was a very small amount of water coming out if my bathroom sink, but I thought it was enough. I thought wrong. By the time I was finished, there was no water at all coming out of my sink, so I had to rinse my wouth and wash my hands with a bottle of water I had in the fridge.   
Granted, this is only the second or third time this happened in my 9 months of living here, but even under normal circumstances, the water pressure is barely enough to shower. Holding the shower handle on one side of the shower facing the other side, the water would hit the ground before it reached the other side (in a shower that is already very small to begin with).

432,"Me and a guy had our first real relationship together. We really fucked each other up while we were together, kinda on and off for about 3 ish years. We had a lot of psycho stuff happen after we actually split up. I tried to cut him off he found out where i lived. I self destructed and talked about the problem we had that hurt me almost constantly. 

We've been in and out of each others lives on and off for the last 4 and a half years pretty much. Each other's first loves bull crap. I'd feel nuts or something would hurt and I would cut him off. We had a conversation about being friends maybe just seeing how it goes we had sex etc. Id found out hed been seeing someone when I was going over to his plave one day and he was driving off with a girl in his car. He told me hed cut her off after that because he wanted to see me. 

We started getting intense and in an attempt to pull back on the intensity I kinda flaked on some plans we had to spend time and go on a trip with family which was shitty I know. So he immediately texts that girl to meet up and make out and throw it in my face. She had left hickeys all over him just to be mean because all she knew was that his ex is flaking on him for something more fun and just being crappy to him (that's what she told me more context to come on this).

 I had my suspicions because he acted like he used to back when we were together and we had this pattern of him screwing around me if I wasnt around enough. Hed been saying stuff about us dating etc This time I heard a specific ringtone go off that I knew was just for an app where he specifically texted this girl and didn't use it for anything else. Instead of doing what i used to where I'd just be quiet and get angrier over the time I mentioned it when it went off. He ran. I started losing it again. And I did some unhealthy shit likw fighting with him but trying not to to just defuse it but I'm emotional unfortunately. 

Long story short I wasn't sure if it was her or not i didnt care I just didn't want to be alone i met up with this girl. We hung out realized it was Definitley her. She was pretty chill we talked for awhile.  Became pretty friendly actually. Today She messages me wants to see him ive still been fucking him as recently as today. I didn't hide that from her but I've decided I don't want to be exclusive with him. He seems very conflicted on what he wants. Hes said he doesn't want to date her but he could see himself dating her but her personal issues makes him not want to. I want to remain his friend I want to be her friend. 

She and I have honestlu discussed the possibility of a threesome since we're both fucking him anyways. I'm starting to wonder how that will effect my relationship with both of them and if i shouldn't just kinda back off and pull away from this whole situation and tell him to just go for her despite his kinda valid concerns or what and I'm not sure what he wants cause I can see how conflicted he feels about it on his face and how hes held himself since. I'm wondering if I'm not just causing him damage now with this and what I should do.
I've been thinking about it and I also think she may be manipulating him a little bit too. Because his whole attitude towards it all is changing. He's getting aggressive and way more accusatory about things and jumping to bad conclusions way more than he normally ever has. She apparently has a mutual acquaintance that after me and my ex had split up I had ranted to. So she's getting him riled up and telling him about nasty shit I've said about him apparently but the way hes acting it sounds lile shes even exaggerating the truth from that too and getting him riled up more.

 My plan to deal with this is to point this stuff out to him apologize because it was crappy for me to rant to someone i didn't know. Tell him I want to remain distant from this situation. That I'll still be his friend and if he has any issues he can talk to me because o do care about him and maybe point out to her how i think shes being manipulative and tell her I'm pulling out of this situation. Or not cause that may stir the pot more I'm not sure what to do there. Either way I can see the snowballing into an avalanche of hell and I'm not sure how to pull away from this. I just dont know whats right.",11Aug2019,2

I'm being careful not to give her any hope of us and I'm pretty sure she still likes me and hoping. She's also diagnosed with depression.

There's this one girl \[17F\] that I \[17M\] really like. We used to talk and call each other nearly everyday (we got close \~2 years ago) and over time I got really fond of her. But ever since I moved abroad last year we rarely talk at all, and any attempts I make to start a conversation with her online gets left on read. Should I just tell her how I feel and cut her out of my life? I feel like my connection to her is really toxic since it hurts a lot every time I see her ignore my messages but I'm afraid of risking our friendship. What should I do?

tl;dr: used to be close with girl but not anymore and I want to confess but I'm afraid of risking friendship",11Aug2019,2
439,"Okay I'm a weird guy I have interesting kinks but fucking my actual sister isn't one of them, but she's the only one of my family who I actually don't hate, I've been back at my parents because cause I just got engaged and they wanna do all the bullshit celebrations, and since that happened my sister has been overtly sexual around me, and weirdly jealous when my finance is around. My sister and I were just having shots in the pool house to avoid some dinner, and she didn't explicitly say ""hey let's fuck"" but I got that energy she had her legs resting on my lap and her foot was kinda rubbing my crotch, her bedroom is down the hall from me and she has her own ensuite bathroom but she insists on walking through the hall nude/half nude to shower in the upstairs bathroom. I ask why the fuck she does that and she said she ""prefers the water pressure"" which doesn't even make sense, she always coming into my room and laying on my bed and just being weirdly intimate.

She has always been a weird crazy bitch but that's why we got along, she diagnosed with BPD and I'm diagnosed with ASPD, idk why that relevant but maybe its a favourite person thing, idk its getting pretty annoying cause I don't wanna have to stop talking to her cause she's fun to get up to mischief with and her bpd antics are very entertaining, but like bro it's making me hella uncomfortable

tl;dr sister is being really flirtatious and sexual around me and acts jealous around my finance, and I kinda don't know how to deal with it",11Aug2019,0

442,"Im 19 now and in a year Im going to enlist and in 4-5 years I am going to either admit into a University or looking for a job. But till now Im still sitting at home, leeching of my parents playing video games. I've consistently tried to force myself to go on Udemy to look for some courses or do some work out but ended up procrastinating. 

Just 2 nights ago I had a nightmare which may or may not have shooked me but I dreamt about being a loser at age 30 and had not accomplished anything.

I want to be a game developer, rehab center manager, a bar tender and my main aim is to start a social media company. There's so much I want to do yet I cant kick this bad habit of laziness. Im actually afraid of my future so please advice me on what to do.",11Aug2019,3
443,"I'm the type of person that, no matter when or where, if you got problem's I'll listen to them and hope that I can help. I'm like the First-Texter, the guy that makes sure we stay in contact, and the guy that makes sure you're okay. And no, I'm not a r/NiceGuys guy, I'm just someone who cares about the people around me. 

Latest example: Yesterday I contacted an old friend of mine, whom I haven't talked to in like 3 years. I ask him what's up, and he says that he doesn't feel good: long story short I spend 3 hours listening to him and his problems. Today, we planned to meet up and do something together. He cancelled around the time we were supposed to meet. 

Another example: My ""Best friend"". A girl from my old school, we've always used to be cool with each other. There are countless nights in which she called me for whatever reason, I could call 1000 examples. Last week I asked her if we wanted to do something together, like going out and eating something. She told me that unfortunately she couldn't, as she got a lot of things to do and her mother wouldn't allow that. For the past 3 days, she had uploaded videos of her and friends drinking and partying together. 

Same with all the other friends, nobody really wants to get to know me, nobody wants to know what things I like and what maybe makes me sad.

I feel like I'm just someone to fill a hole with, someone you hang out with if no one else can. 

I basically have no one to talk about my problems, how I really feel about certain emotional things or just someone to ask me how my day was. I'm just always choking it, thinking for myself that it won't be too bad. Mostly I'll just lay in play room for a few hours in complete darkness and listen to music. 

And I'm somehow ALWAYS happy. I'm never in a bad mood, I always laugh and smile a lot, I'm always friendly and respectful. But then, if my friends are in a bad mood they'll be total assholes to me, saying that I'm annoying and that I should shut up.

Even though everyone says I'm such a funny and caring person. I literally have tears running down my face, as I just realised this when looking at my friends storys who, as always, didn't invite me. 

I'm 16, why do I suddenly feel this way ? I've already thought about this for over a year now, nothing has changed and I'm slowly on the way of just completely isolating myself and completely losing contact with everyone, as no one seems to care about me anyways. I'm desperately trying not to sound like a drama queen or whatever, but I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I feel like I'm faking myself to make me fit into my life. 

I'm sorry this got so long but it's the first time I've ever talked about this to anyone at all. 

Thanks in advance to anyone who wastes his time to read this :) 

And sorry for typos: English is not my first language.

Edit: Even at this exact moment my drunk ""Best friend"" texted me telling me how much she likes me and that we NEED to do something together asap. She does tha every time she's drunk, last 3 times I've answered with saying how awesome the last year of school was and how much I miss her, she didn't even answer. I'm giving up on friendship, honestly.",11Aug2019,4

But I’ve now began working and so I’ve been trying to fix my sleeping schedule using sleeping pills and it sort of worked but I ended up messing it up once more. And it seems as if it’s gotten worse. For the last 2 days, I’ve slept at around 8 pm and end up waking up at around 12-1 am. From there I stay awake until about 7 am, where I fall asleep and wake up at about 3 pm. As I’m writing this post, it’s about 5:30 am and I have work in a few hours with only a couple of hours of sleep. This has also ruined my diet since instead of eating I would be sleeping.

452,"Due to financial problems, my husband and I are staying with his parents where all of his siblings live. His brother, next youngest from him, has crossed a line with the youngest sibling, their sister, in a very disprespectful and demeaning fashion that, once I heard about it, made me lose all respect or sympathy for him.   

I have not seen him since learning of this last night but he doesn't know I know. I am a terrible liar and terrible with confrontation and I don't know how to handle this situation. He likes to come hang out in our room sometimes because he doesn't have friends (go figure) or a girlfriend (recent development, somewhat relevant) to do things with. I don't want to hang out with him but if I tell him to just go away he's going to ask what's up.  

The little sister has been going through a terrible time finding out that all of her friends are apparently fake and liars and this recent incident may be turning her few remaining friends against her because they are on the side if the brother, or think she is over reacting (she's not).  

She lost her older sister a few years ago who would not let this shit fly and would know exactly what to do. I wish I could be that sister for her right now but I just am not that way. I want to show her I have her support but I also don't want the family to explode and be torn.  

The brother in question also struggles from anxiety and depression (definitely contributes to his behavior) but is currently not seeing anyone for it or doing anything about it. His only friend is sort of incel-ish and problems only began when he returned from school after being away for 8 ish years.

If you've read this far thank you very much.

453,"So I was recently (May) diagnosed with Scoliosis. During this I was working as an assistant manager at a casual italian bar/restaurant, working an average of 45-50 hours a week, all of which were spent standing. Let me preface this a bit by saying that I’ve dealt with moderate to severe back pain for all of my adult life and most of my teenage years as well, in the form of muscle spasms usually contained to the lower back. At some times they’re manageable, sometimes they are not. In early May, on one of my rare days off from work I woke up and found that I was in an *immense* amount of pain. Didn’t matter what postion (laying/sitting/standing) I was in, the pain was unbearable. I went to work the next day in the same amount of pain, then went to urgent care after my shift ended. Urgent care said it was a strained muscle, pain pills, sent me on my way. Another thing to note is that I am not insured - my work at the time didn’t provide insurance even for full-time managers. I was excused from work for a few days, but as a manager there are responsibilities that I’m expected to withold regardless, so I really only had about 1.5 days off. The time off didn’t help, the pain pills didn’t help. So I decide to see my childhood primary care doc, which like I said took some serious deliberations on my part because no insurance. He ended up seeing me at no charge (very nice guy) and told me I have scoliosis. I never got xrays or anything like that, he is a pediatrist so I am assuming he’s just familiar with the test they give children? Not sure. It makes sense, i’ve never been flexible (sit &amp; reach test was always a big big struggle for me, i can’t touch my toes despite being in okay shape). Anyways to kind of cut to the chase, I ended up having to resign from my job because the pain of the day to day requirements were too much to handle. I’ve tried office work since then but sitting for 8-9 hours a day is also too painful. I’m pretty much at my wits end in terms of options and what I should do. I’m stuck on a lease with no way to pay my bills, i’ve barely struggled by the last three months and now my rent this month is 11 days late and my bank acct is 
-$85.00. 

Help me please",11Aug2019,2
454,"Okay advice sub, do your magic and help me get through this. Prepare, because this will be a lengthy post.

 I'm currently working a seasonal job of selling fruits and vegetables. The job itself isn't that hard physically, most of my time I spend sitting and looking at stuff on the internet. I was never the one who shied away from work, I spent a lot of time around the house doing tough jobs. Had to, as I'm the only man in the household. 

The actual challenge of this work would be two things - 1) It's a 12 hour job with no free weekend, meaning I'll be working every day for the rest of the summer; 2) I have had allergies and suffered breathing issues for the past 8 years of my life due to dust and cigarette smoke, both of which I have plenty here. 

Now, here is the deal - I come from a poor family, in a place where it's near impossible to find any kind of job. For the past 6 years I've been looking for some seasonal jobs and I'm EXTREMELY lucky I was even able to find this. I'm not from U.S. and trust me, this has proven to be a real challenge. In that time period I mostly relied on my mother's income (my father died when I was young) as well as my father's pension, which really isn't that much. The pay I'm getting here quite literally doubled the income of my household and will allow me to finally get something that has been a lifelong dream of mine. 

Here is the rub. I've been working this job for the past month and it has been comparable to a torture because of my health issues and long hours with no free time. Basically my routine can be summarized in me waking up, eating breakfast, getting to work, spending 12 hours there, getting back home, eating dinner, showering (optional, if I wasn't too tired) and hitting the bed (losing consciousness). I had a specific date in mind, the end of the month, and I ground it as hard as I could, no matter the consequences. 

Now, at the very least I have to work this for another month, possibly some weeks more. The reason for that is twofold - 1) Because I'm greedy, I want to get paid as much as I possibly can (I also need the money as well, the more I earn the better); 2) I have to leave on a good note so my boss will invite me to work here next year as well, which I will absolutely need for my hefty college expenses.

The reason why this falls so hard to me is firstly because of my health issues. At this point I've tried every medicine known to doctors and nothing helped. In the past 8 years I've easily visited 100 different doctors from 20 different places, to no avail. The last one gave me an inhaler (which has at this point expired), but I've still been actively using for the past month while I worked here Dully note, I don't have asthma but I did have troubles breathing. The only possible cure I found was absence of dust and smoke. I'm fully aware it's detrimental to my health, even though I refuse to find the exact repercussions. My mind simply can't handle it at this point. It was a long and hard road making piece with my health issues, something that left deep scares in my mind. It has been heavily taxing and has left some serious emotional issues, rage and fear for the most part. It completely changed me as a person, for the worse. Suffice it to say, should anything happen that will permanently worsen my condition, I wouldn't be able to handle it. I have contemplated suicide because of it. 

Another thing of note - We are expecting an influx of money in the next two weeks, which could allow me to fulfill that dream of mine. This is basically a carrot and a stick which makes me want to leave my job after those two weeks are done. I would need another two weeks to complete full two months. If I bailed early, my boss would definitely find another person for the remainder of the season, which would basically kill any chance of him calling me back next year.

I don't know what do to. Please help me.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr - Because of health issues and pressures of the job, as well as some money I'll get I wish to leave the job early. It'll kill my chances of being called back next year, which I'll absolutely need because of my college. How do I make myself stay?",11Aug2019,1

When I was 2-3 we moved from Eastern Europe so my parents could pastor a church. I grew up homeschooled, my mom is smart (has a masters in college) so I guess it’s not a big deal. However, unbeknownst to my parents I had ADHD, so while my sister and those around me would excel, I would struggle to even be able to sit still. My whole school career was hell for me, I grew up thinking that I was just innately flawed. In May I finally got the needed treatment I should of gotten as an child for ADHD, yes my family wasn’t rich but if I was put into the school system I would of gotten help sooner. I’m not stupid I just had issues due the adhd. My parents didn’t send me to public school because “they’d put me in special ed” and/or “the people there would eat me alive”. I don’t know if that’s for certain but I personally feel if I had an outside party around I would of gotten treated earlier. Maybe they would of been able to catch other red flags that I see now. There’s other things too, but I’m not trying to be here all day. Basically I just feel like by parents homeschooling me, neglecting to take certain things into account, raising me in an exclusively small church community, etc. that it’s hindered my life.

I feel like I’m lying to everyone because I can’t be honest with my sexuality, my personal beliefs, etc. When I was 15 I decided that Christianity wasn’t for me, and it feels like since then they’ve done everything they could to make me feel alienated. honestly I just want to kill myself. I have no one to run to, I don’t have pretty much any friends (outside of college). It just seems like my family has always put the church and the people inside it over me. I love my family dearly don’t get me wrong I just wish that I had been adopted by people who would of been more able to help me and give me the love and treatment I desperately needed. I feel trapped and like my only viable option is suicide. I can’t daydream my way out all this situation. Pretending I’m somewhere better doesn’t help because I know nothing has changed.

So I am think that this subreddit would help me figure out a lesson in my life.. That I can't...

So.. It all began in march.. I got a new car.. and in 3 weeks I managed to get into a car accident.. My car was totalled...(No casualties.. just some bruises...)

So after 2 months I bought a new used car.. wasn't any car expert so I managed to buy myself a rusty old car that I had for only 1 month..

The next thing I got is a penny board.. And I wanted to repair it by changing the bearings.. and I failed at that too..but managed to fix it with an old skateboard of mine.. It still isn't perfect, but it can skate..

And the last thing I broke was a new... 4 day old bicycle (I ruined the rear derailleur) just yesterday..

My question that I can't answer myself is...

**How am I able to break everything that I can get?**

Am I just to clumsy... or not careful enough of what I am doing??? At the 4 days I had my new bike I cleaned it multiple times...

I just don't know what is this? Bad luck? Is there a life lesson hidden inside of this events of mine? If so? could anyone share it with me?",11Aug2019,0

461,"My dad likes to talk on Facebook to ladies that he knows (some married) and send them really graphic texts or ask to hang out so I presume they can have sex. He doesn’t know that my siblings and I know about this.

My mom and him have been married for a long time and they were each other’s “firsts,” but their flame died out about after the kids were born. Dad has this mentality that he must “stay in this marriage for the kids” because his dad divorced his mom while he was younger and this emotionally wrecked him.

I can’t even remember the last time my parents have had sex (probably 6+ years ago?). I know this is a weird thing to say, but my dad often complains to these women about never ever having sex. I know sex is an important healthy aspect in a relationship, but the thing is he never asks my mom for sex. He never initiates it.

It’s like my parents are roommates. They don’t talk to each other, don’t hug, hell I can’t even remember one time when they’ve kissed or even touched each other.

Obviously there needs to be some counseling or therapy, but according to my dads rants to these women on Facebook, he is stubborn and just wants a divorce when all 3 kids are in college (2/3 kids are in college right now).

I’m fine with a divorce, I’ve come to terms with it a long time ago. But I just need some advice to see if there’s any way to salvage this relationship. I’ve tried talking to my dad about the way he even treats my mom (without bringing up the cheating part), but he just shuts down and ignores me. He’s so stubborn and has a mind blocker. 

Maybe I should just completely let it go and advise my mom to start saving money now for when he takes the house during the divorce that is inevitable. 

This relationship is also damaging to me and my siblings. It’s caused us to never want to be in a relationship/our image of what a healthy relationship should be is skewed. 

This has been hanging over my head since I was 12 and I discovered these messages on Facebook (he forgot to log out). I’m now 20 and in college. My sister is also in college. My brother is the only one left at the house, but he should be leaving for school in a few years. My dad doesn’t even know how to handle himself around my mom when my brother goes to hang out with friends. 

My mom has tried to talk with my dad but once again he shuts her down, tells her to be quiet and just walks away and shuts himself out. My mom has tried everything when it comes to talking, everything from writing notes to cornering him asking him what’s wrong but he just refuses to talk. He’s so stubborn. I highly doubt he would agree to counseling.

463,"Strap in for this one. Worth the read I guess??

So a bit of context first! My girlfriend has anger issues and rarely shows emotions, never cries.. sort of switched onto one feeling. 
Me and her have been seeing each other since she broke up with her ex, he went off the rails and started threatening to kill himself if she didn’t get back with him so she stayed in contact with him which I was a massive fan of but I was pretty much a rebound off him anyway. They’ve been dating for 3 years so I thought yeah it is what it is I don’t want to look jealous I’ll let it slide.

Anyway, fast forward 8 months since their breakup and since we got together and they still speak, she tries to hide the fact that she does but I know it’s happening 🤷🏻‍♂️ her dad spoke to me and started pointing out signs that she was becoming depressed again because she’s dealt with a bad spell in the past and he was just asking me to look after her. So she said that she just needed to get away and I understood, the town we live in is a black hole! She claimed she booked a holiday with her “friend” which again fine yeah no issues there, it was about a month lead up to the holiday and she never called her “friend” never met up with her which I thought bit weird but whatever. Fast forward to the night she flys back after 2 weeks I was at hers and she was getting picked up by her “friend” at around 2am come about 1am and she was stressing that I needed to leave, “you need to go I need to sort stuff you need to go” I thought again bit weird so I left, tried calling her in the car but her “friend” was driving and didn’t want her on the phone, but weird again.

During the whole holiday I only ever saw photos of her on her own never with her “friend” I raised this issue and was met with the “why do you want pictures of her so bad?” So I was sat here thinking, obviously I’m just being fucking mental, I don’t want to look crazy; I was telling myself, surely she wouldn’t of gone with him A) how would you pull that off and B) Why would she? She went through a horrible breakup (this fella fully stalked her).

The day she got home I thought, I need to confirm my suspicions as either I’m fucking mental or she’s just mugged me off, I went on her phone and found like 6 pictures of the two of them in her hidden folder and my heart just sank. She came upstairs and I asked her “Who did you go on holiday with?” - “my friend?” I asked her again and went “did you go with him?” - when I asked that I could detect panic in her voice and could tell she was thinking “oh shit” she instantly started crying and I didn’t get angry, I didn’t kick off I just sat on the bed. I asked her how much happened and after prying the info out of her she claimed they “kissed twice” I said I don’t believe that. You could tell she was defeated and said “if I told you I slept with him you’re gonna leave aren’t you” i denied that allegation and stated I just want to know the truth, because my heads going to be running circles......

“Yes I slept with him”

I cannot describe the heartache

“How many times....”

“Twice, one after the other”

I sat there and asked her to explain herself, she said “alcohol isn’t a crutch and I’m not using it as an excuse but it was involved” she told me how when she was isolated with him it felt just normal to do that because they’d been together for so long (longest relationship she’s had).

She exclaimed how the whole holiday all he did was shout at her and make fun of her and how she hated being there the entire time and just wanted to come home....

But.. she still slept with him I guess? More than once as well, she said that it was once after the other there wasn’t a break in between they just kept going (I mean fair play to the guy I’m tired after one session).

I am madly in love with this girl and I gave her a second chance because she sat there and wept, I’ve never seen someone cry like it, she wept and wept and begged for my apology. She instantly deleted him from all social media, blocked all of his friends and family.... he was gone.

It’s been about a month now and all I can think about is “well how did they do it? Did they go down on each other? How did they have sex?” I just think of him over her and it happening. I’m ashamed to admit it but I think about him on a daily basis. 

I don’t want to break things off because we have a good thing going, but my god does my head hurt constantly, as soon as there’s a break in the noise of the world I think about it, I think about them.

My heart aches but tells me to stay because when I am happy... I’m really happy. But my head goes you can’t let someone treat you like that, cut her off get rid of her what if it happens again?.

(Oh and I work with this girl as well so cutting her off is gonna be hard .__.)

I feel like I can’t talk to people about it because I took her back after that? That makes me look like a dick and I don’t want any more hassle.

In my honest opinion she did seem genuinely sorry and she does more for me than I would ask for (maybe in a way to make up for it?) but it still happened didn’t it?

I just don’t know what to do, I feel if I left her it’s just going to ruin my head more? 

I don’t know.

What would you do?",11Aug2019,2
464,"Hi guys, I hope someone can help! I work for a bakery and do deliveries. I work in the kitchen, but mainly deliveries. The vehicle I use is a company vehicle, and I get paid minimum wage. Yesterday, I was doing a delivery, (almost $3,000, it was a large delivery) and the woman said, “I know I already tipped online, but here this is for you”

I’ve been working here about 2 months, I’m mainly the only one who does deliveries, am I entitled to the online tips? Deliveries range from 5 to 15 deliveries a day. 
My company takes the tips, especially the large ones or the ones for catering orders when I’m there setting up everything. 

Please let me know!! Thank you",11Aug2019,2

466,"My girlfriend of 8 months broke up with 4 days back and I've been crying my eyes out to the point they're... swollen, like I couldn't see bright colors without my eyes stinging. 
Thing is, even though I feel terrible and heartbroken, I understand her reasons (her mental health mostly) to an extent, if not entirely (mostly because I'm hurt, I know I'll understand entirely sometime).  Previously when I liked someone (all men, unfortunately) and had to get over my feelings it was easy because they also gave me reasons to resent or dislike them. But I'll never resent/dislike her and right now it feels as though I'll always have a soft spot for her which just makes it harder. I've also been back home for 3 months after I was done with my graduation and it has been very isolating, most of my friends are not here and I feel...alone. I'm all over the place and feel so weak and gross. 
This was my first relationship and being seriously involved with a woman and I'm just having a hard time not spiralling because it came at a time where I was horribly depressed. I can't even look at gay things anymore without breaking down lol. 
I've been on a social media sabbatical so I wasn't entirely sure whether to post or not but I'm just... desperate and want to not cry. (Again just to reiterate, it's not her fault I guess. I just want to find a way to cope instead of crying everyday or something in addition to that. Anything works, kind words, anecdotes, your own way of coping with such a situation, memes, artwork, music... anything tbh).",11Aug2019,0

469," 

I feel like a shitty person for saying this, but it just feels like I can’t deal with the problems of my friends anymore.  

Me and my friends are all in this big friend group and all we ever do is drinking or smoking. We're also all 17 and still in school. Two of my friends have a lot of personal problems.  

Friend 1 had to move out from her mother's place two years ago, because she was to mentally unstable to keep taking care of her. Their house was a mess and her mother had some kind of victim complex. Now she lives with her dad and her stepmother who both don’t want her to be there. Her stepmother always tells her how great her own kids are, and she says that she feels unwanted in her own house. When we are out drinking together, she usually starts crying at some point and says that she wants to leave. We then sit with her for hours and try to calm her down and help her, but she mostly isn’t responding to anything and isn’t thankful both annoying that we try to help her, there is never a thank you for spending hours trying to calm her down. She tried to kill herself with pills about a month ago. I think she also has some kind of social anxiety and doesn’t like hanging out with a big group of people. She also told us that she only had one friend back in her old place which used her to whole time and pressured her to do a lot of stupid shit.  

Friend 2 has dad that is strongly religious. He’s a Muslim and doesn’t let her do anything and even hits her from time to time. She tried to kill herself with pills around 4 years ago. She also feels unwanted at home and feels like nobody really likes her. She always thinks that everyone wants to do to something bad to her, which isn’t true.  

Me and my friend always try to help them but it just the same repeatedly and at this point I really don’t know what to do. It kind of feels like they don’t want any help and just keep digging themselves deeper in to that mindset. It also feels like they’re both having competitions about which live is worth. One of them way crying and the other one literally went and said “Why can’t we talk about me now? You only care about her.” When everything was fine with her. 

Always having to look after is just so emotionally draining after time and I don’t know for how long I can keep doing this. I’m also just a 17-year-old girl that has her fair share of problems and tbh I can’t even deal with those. I have no idea how I should deal with all of their problems too.

472,"Hi all,

Two weeks ago I was asked on a date by a really nice girl who I've always talked to and I've known for years. I kindly said that I currently wasn't looking for any sort of commitment because at the end of the year I'll be moving away to join the defence force and I likely will not see her often enough.
This morning she's pronounced dead by suicide by hanging in her bedroom while her parents were home. She was found by her father, while I was sleeping as it was early in the morning. I wake up to see my phone blown up with missed calls from my friend who had somehow found out.

She left a suicide note in which my name was mentioned many times. She'd been fantasising about me for months but only two weeks ago had built up the courage to ask me on a date.

She's never shown any signs of depression or self game tendencies. She's always been a bright and playful person who is an absolute delight to be around. I miss her so fucking much but now there is absolutely nothing I can do.

It's nearly midnight and I feel as though I will never sleep again.
This is all my fault. I do not know what to think, or what to do.

At the end I started crying because of the fact he didn’t make an effort to come talk to me. We had a talk after my dad made him talk to me then after that talk ended he went to go have a talk with my boyfriend. They started getting hostile because my mom was telling my brother false information saying my bf hits me and stuff.  While they were going back and fourth I had a bad anxiety attack which resulted in a large group of people coming over to us and then since almost everyone was drunk (I was not even buzzed) they were getting hostile with my boyfriend saying they want to hurt him and taking pics of his license plate and all that. They wouldn’t let me in the car so I started getting hostile because I just wanted to leave and not have problems at my brothers wedding. My parents didn’t care about the situation they ignored my multiple phone calls. My boyfriend was absolutely pissed. Now everyone’s pissed off at me and I can’t think about besides what happened last night I am so heart broken and confused and hurt and I feel betrayed by my own blood family.

476,"Hi guys, I’m a 17 year old high school student from Australia. I know this might sound dumb and I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I still wanted some advice on what I could do nonetheless.

About a week and a bit ago I had my AirPods stolen and I’m almost certain I know who took them. I’m pretty sure a guy a share some classes with took them because there’s a lot of stuff which points to him... If you don’t care then you can skip the next few paragraphs.

There’s 3 main things that make me believe he took them. 
1. The time slot in which he started showing up at school with them matches perfectly with when I lost them, about a week ago, and for being so new they look very old.

2. My red pen had exploded in my pocket and covered the case in red/pink ink. I managed to get the ink off on the outside of the case but in the inside they still had pink and red smudges, and wouldn’t you believe... he had them too. Although he coloured in the base of the inside of the case (not sure if that made sense) and claims that the smudges are from that... but he coloured it in orange and the smudges are very clearly pink.

3. His story keeps changing. I’ve been talking to a few people about it and they’ve asked if he actually did take them from me and where he got them from. When I asked he said he’s had them for ages and that he bought them himself, when a close friend of his asked he told her that he found them on a train and when some of my friends asked he said he bought them recently. 

Anyway, the only way for me to 100% know if they are mine or not is if I check the serial number, luckily I still have the box and I know what it is... The problem is that ever since I kind of accused him of stealing them, he doesn’t bring them to school anymore. I know it was dumb of me to accuse him without being able to prove it or not but what’s been done has been done. Every time I bring it up he says that he doesn’t know where they are or that he think he lost them or left them in a suburb a good hour and a half drive from where we go to school. 

I don’t know what to do and it’s clear he has no intention of bringing them to school or giving them back. I thought about going to the police but I don’t think it’s the best idea since I don’t actually know for certain that they are mine until I check the serial no. And for all I know they could actually be his. This all might sound dumb but I just want some advice on what I can do about this.

I’m not looking to file any charges against him if it turns out he did steal them either, I just want them back. And I also don’t want to keep bugging him so much because I think that’ll give him more reason to never bring them to school.",11Aug2019,1

478,"TLDR: I was diagnosed with Asperger's relatively recently and have been more critical with myself since.


When I (mid 20s f) was just going through therapy for anxiety years ago, I used to do that trick where I counter negative thoughts by pretending I'm talking to my younger friends, as if they'd told me what I tell myself (duck I'm an idiot- that's not true! You're amazing!). Asking myself if I would say that to them also helped - as the answer would always be ""That's an awful thing to say to someone you value"". It was working for years.


I was just now laying here wondering why I struggle with self-talk now, until I just now made the connection that I was only diagnosed with Asperger's a year and a half ago, and before that, I wasn't this bad. 


I've been a lot harsher on myself since then, far too much ""I should be better than this"". That shouldn't make sense. Idk why that happened. The diagnosis helped me *understand* why I am the way I am, so why do I suddenly take everything so much more harshly? 


I compare myself to my SO all the time. I have good artistic skills, which she reminds me she's proud of, and then she is BASICALLY a wiser, ballsy-er version of me (minus said skills). I kick myself a lot for not having started work at a younger age like her, how she earns more than me, owns a home, but thinking this way is SO stupid. Being an artist, I KNOW that comparing yourself to others like that is *so detrimental!!*. But this has been hard to fight off as of late.

My mom continuously puts me down whenever I share anything with her. If it a good experience or an achievement I've managed to get, she says something along these lines: ""Oh that's good, but your sister went through it before too. She did pretty well.""

Sometimes I can brush it off and continue with what I'm saying, but most times I just get frustrated. It's exhausting being compared all the time. It gets worse if I share about a bad experience I went through, or if I failed at something. My mom goes ""Your sister would have known just what to do. Luckily she takes after me.""

481,"I hate him so much for what he is like and what he has done to me, my mum and dad on this holiday we have just got back from. We went on a 14 day cruise and I had to share a room with him. He is older than me and lives on his own. I was not sleeping at all yet he didn’t care he came in whatever time he wanted. Then he would turn the lights on to text on his phone. Packing his suitcase in the middle of the night. I am absolutely exhausted. Plus I had sea sickness and he kept spraying his hair stuff and aftershave all the time, just no consideration. 

He kept ditching us for other random people he met. We think he is gay as he kept befriending gay people and even wrote a letter to one of them. Then I saw a text message from his female friend telling me to see how it goes with one of these guys. We didn’t push the fact but it’s like he is shoving it in our face. Then it was my birthday and he left half way through the theatre and went and sat at this bar talking to 2 old women. He told me dad and myself to go away and it really upset my mum and myself since it spoilt my birthday. Then my dad was upset and really angry. He just doesn’t care as long as he is happy. 

Then on our trips telling us to hurry up and walking fast. Knowing my dad struggles with breathing, again he doesn’t give a crap! He had the time of his life and me and my mum and dad have had a horrible time. What makes it even worse is my dad paid for him for the holiday and gave him spending money! It was supposed to be a family holiday yet he didn’t give a crap about us. I started talking to him this morning and one of his gay friends came down the stairs and he just walked away from me mid conversation. Then he told me to move away when I sat next to him even though I couldn’t see the tv screen. All because he wanted to sit next to some stranger instead of his family. Again my mum was really upset. 

So am I right to not want anything to do with ever again? He obviously didn’t want anything to do with us. I seriously wanted to attack him and beat him up. But that would of upset my mum even more and we would of got chucked off the boat. My mum and dad don’t even seem bothered by it anymore and are just really nice to him like nothing even happened. He spoilt my whole holiday! There’s no talking to him neither, he doesn’t care.",11Aug2019,1
482,"Hey you folks. I’m honestly posting this for emotional support at this point, because I feel like I have to remember that there’s nothing wrong with how I feel at the moment.

If you don’t know what this is about, refer to this post: [Previous Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/clzgkk/update_my_mom_sold_my_dog_against_my_will_and_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)


So...what happened in the past week?

Well, I walked to my vet in secret to ask for advice.  The united arab emirates having pleasant weather as it always does, it was 41 degrees and a 40 minute walk one way but I walked there while contemplating my options.

I talked to two nice people over the counter there and they helped me explore my options. They told me there’s really nothing that can be done to search for this dog effectively, so I’d have to cross my fingers and hope the person who bought my dog would respond to my calls to tell me where she sold my Akita. They also said  that if anyone came in with my dog to any of their vet branches, they’d notify me (they have her microchip number and everything). I asked them if I could maybe contact multiple vets to ask about my dog, and they said I could. They apologized for not being able to be much help, and I thanked them and left.


I compiled a list of all vets in Dubai, since thats where the person who bought my dog lived, so I thought she’d take my dog to a vet over there. From that, I called every single one and asked if they had a dog with the microchip number of my dog, and none of them did. Some still didn’t respond, and I had to write down their opening times sometimes so that I could catch them when they were actually open. Since it’s Eid over here in the muslim middle east, a lot were closed. Still, I was able to get in contact with plenty.

I also contacted my entire family. All my sisters, my dad, and kinda my bro (I don’t reallt trust my bro) to tell them about what happened. None of them support me. A comment from one sister is “You know you’ll just forget about her right?” and from my second sister, “Why do you even care? It’s a done deal, she was sold.” my third sister kinda said the same thing, but she did help me when I asked her to call the lady who bought my dog. I asked because now when I called her, it just says that the phone number is unavailable, and my whatsapp messages to her don’t go through anymore. So I wanted to check, and yes, she blocked my phone number.  

My brother did as expected and called me a moron for caring about a dog and that they’re filthy creatures and stuff like that. Honestly nothing unexpected from him. I talked to my dad, and he was apparently siding with my mother, and he was telling me I was being ridiculous. So little to no support from them.

I talked to a bunch of my online friends about it and my one irl best friend, and they’re all supporting me and my feelings so well, and remind me that I’m not crazy. I appreciate that so much.


I contacted the person I originally bought my Akita from. He was a cool guy and was friendly, so I thought it would be worth asking him about what to do. He said he’d contact his vet that he works with about the situation, and he’d be with me after Eid was over because he’s busy. He said he’d talk to my mom as well.

I expanded my list of vets from just Dubai to Abu Dhabi and Sharjah as well. Didn’t call that many of them yet...

My mom got really upset with me over the past few days. I of course, was calling the lady who bought our dog every day almost (till she blocked me that one day), and my mom knew about it from her. I also went to ask my mom what the name of the vet that she deals with is called, because my mom knows that info but is refusing to tell me. She still is, and is calling me extremely disrespectful for not listening to her and dropping this whole thing. As she puts it: “What part of this do you not understand? She was sold, I don’t know where she is, it’s over, bye.”
Since I was obviously seriously against what she was doing to me, I voiced my opinion by telling her I seriously do not respect the fact that she’s doing this and that it makes me think less of her as a person. This infuriated her, and she told me that I can pretend she’s dead if I really don’t respect her. She brought up the religious verses about how a child is required to respect their elders. I told her that this “pretending she’s dead” thing would be a childish and straight up impossible thing to do since we are mother and child living in the same house, but she didn’t wanna hear it and kept saying things like “Do you not understand? Pretend I’m air. I do not exist. You do not have a mother”
Of course, I still went to her every day and just ask her “What is the name of the vet that the person who bought my dog uses?” and she just doesn’t look at me.

This is it so far. All I have in my plan is to call up the vets in Sharjah and Abu Dhabi to ask about my dog with her microchip number, and wait for the guy who originally had my dog to be free again so that he can help me out however he’s planning to...I hope


As a side thing, I’ve contacted my therapist again. The one I stopped going to because the one hour ride to him with my mom was hell, and wasn’t worth it despite him being a good therapist. He suggested some ways I could get to him, and I wanna get back into therapy to keep myself mindful. He’s also going to only be available after Eid.

Tl;Dr - mortgage advisor suggested it's better to take house on my parents name. It'll be on my parents name but I'll be providing finances. Dad doesn't want to do it because we already have a mortgage on current house. Need advice on how to convince. 

What I want to do: Get a second mortgage on parents name, fund it myself and give it up for rent. I just need their name on the paper.

Why I want to do it that way: I'm aware I could get a mortgage on my own name but because of my current income band, it won't be much for an individual. Besides, I'd lose the first buyers privileges even if it is to give it up for rent. 

Problem: We already took a mortgage on current house and parents are hesitant to take another mortgage. 

----------
Alrighty, so my parents have not exactly been the ones to plan for long term. They are getting old and I'm worried and I don't want to be working 8-12 hours everyday for someone else and only manage to pay the bills. 

I've managed to earn and save enough to cover a down payment and legal costs. I understand that they are concerned since it'll be their names on the documents so they'd be legally liable to anything that happens but I'll be working with solicitors, agents and advisors to make sure it doesn't. His plan for us is to basically keep working till things are paid off. He also wants to make investments which I'm sure he'd expect us to fund too. He relies majorly on me since I'm the eldest and have a stable job. But working nonstop and paying off things he asks me to isn't exactly what I want to do. He wants to wait till our current house is paid off - which will take years and then think about buying a house to rent it out. I understand why he would say that but I personally feel that's a waste of time. You cannot wait for years for one thing to finish to start something else. 

I know people who have done it that way and it all seems fine. He is fine to buy lottery tickets and has been for years and cigarettes and alcohol but talk about making an investment and he hesitates. Now you may have an idea about what type he is. Although our current house is on my parents name, me and my siblings are paying it off. I'm going to be turning 25 soon and I don't like how he still wants so much control over our lives. Gets angry if we get something we want without telling him, etc. This isn't even about me. I just want to convince him to sign the papers because we've been living according to his ""plan"" and that crap ain't working. Have us working 9-5 for years to pay stuff off for him and that's all he has planned for us. He has taught more to my cousins than he has taught to us. 

Before you comment on me living with my parents at 25, we're Asians and they don't really let you go anywhere. 
I am currently studying (started late because of personal circumstances) and working and I'll be moving away for my master's once I finish my bachelor's. 

He wants to invest in some shitty idea one of my cousins suggested and you can bet that he would be using our accounts. Like I said, my cousins hold more weight than we do for him although we would be the ones he'll be depending on once he gets old. We're just supposed to take the shit. I've tried talking to him, explaining and everything. I also booked an appointment with the advisor so he can get his questions answered. He didn't go. It's like he is refusing something just because it is out of his comfort zone and it is putting us all through difficulties. He won't even put in the effort to understand. I also share room with one of my siblings but he wants to work on the garden first before getting the attic fixed and letting us have our own space. I'm getting frustrated just by writing this. 

He is a difficult person and I apologize for the rant and I don't want to change him, it's not possible anymore. I just want them to agree to sign the documents so we can get a house and rent it out and start an investment portfolio. 

Any advice/suggestion is appreciated.

My ex in-laws (kids grandma &amp; grandpa) are asking to hang out with the kids (they don’t see them often) but my 7 &amp; 11 year old don’t want to they said she isn’t the nicest to them. 

Well they asked to hang out with them the day before and I told them if they would meet us at the pool I would pay for them to get it so they could hang out with the kids where we were at. They said ok ..... didn’t show up completely blew us off and didn’t answer my call. So now today they text me saying “ tell the boys we want to hang out with them and we won’t be able to for a while if they don’t today”

So ya anyone give me some advice. I was planning on going to therapy to talk to someone once a week. But I feel like it's to late",11Aug2019,2
490,"So, this is going to be long and obligatory I'm on mobile, so bare with me on the grammar and spelling mistakes.

TLDR: I believe my friend is in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship, and she has severed ties with me after a very strange exchange and I don't know what to do.

So I have a friend who I went to High School with. We graduated in 2003 and I moved out of country and we really didn't speak much, until about 4 years ago when we reconnected through social media. In those 4 years, we've talked almost constantly, and about the mundane to very deep topics. We spoke about her marriage, my marriage, the fact she was in counseling for the issues in her marriage, we talked through her getting a separation and divorce from her previous husband, and we've talked as she met and started dating a new guy, who I'll just call Strange for the course of this story.

So since she and Strange met and started officially seeing each other, I've had less and less frequent conversations with her. I get it though... new relationship, everything's exciting. She's also still working full time and going to college. She generally has a very hectic schedule. Through our limited talking (they've been dating about 3 months) she's mentioned that Strange's ex had passed away and she felt really bad for him. She also mentioned that he was a convicted ex-felon who had served a prison term for attempted murder. She said however he was very upfront about these facts and that he didn't try to hide it, so she was willing to overlook it and work on them. However it was about 2 weeks since we last talked and I reached out to her on the 9th, just to see how things were going, and she essentially laid bare the fact that he constantly checks her phone. Asks her who such and such is that she's speaking to. Has given general descriptions of her co-workers without having met any of them (like ""Oh, is that the overweight Mexican guy"") and is after very dodgy about how he knew physical characteristics of co-workers she has never introduced to him, and is essentially overbearing and flat out told her that he had bugged his exes phone to make sure she wasn't cheating on him, and if he ever found out she was cheating, that he would kill her.

Fast forward to last night (the 10th) and this morning (the 11th). I messaged her just to see how she was doing and had a very bizarre exchange with her. I have screenshots, but it essentially went like this:

Me: Hey! How's everything going?
Her: Show me something
Me: Show you what?
Her: Nvm
Me: ?
Her: Nvm
Me: What the? Lol
Me: You're being weird 😂
Her: She's dead
*deleted previous Snap message*
Her: Sends Snap of a guys face in a very dark lit area.

Now at this point I tried to call her cell, and a guy picked up. I hung up and blocked the number and immediately called the police on their non-emergency number for the general vicinity she lives in. I gave them all the details I had, but I couldn't provide them a home address or anything like that, so they said that they cannot do a welfare check until I provide them with it, but I can call back in an hour or two for further details.

I spent about an hour digging up anymore details about her that I could through messages and whatnot. Called back after an hour, relayed the new information to the dispatch and was told there was no further news. They asked me a few more questions regarding her that I didn't know the answer to and suggested I get into contact with her family to get an address or assess whether she's okay. I don't have any of her family on social media, and it's a very common maiden name, so this led me to messaging other friends who live in state that are mutual connections in IG and such and asking if they had any information regarding. Bare in mind this is like 2:00 - 3:00am my time, and like 11:00 - 12:00 their time. No one gets back to me.

I call the dispatch again, and while I'm on the phone I get a message through her Snapchat telling me that us talking isn't healthy for their 3 month relationship, and that she is going to delete the app and we'll have no further communication. She also asks for me not to send any further welfare checks concerning her. She then sends me a picture of her face in the same sort of dark lit room. I say I don't believe her and ask her to send me a Snap with her telling me it directly. She doesn't respond. I ask her to let me know where she is at least then so I can have the police go by and do a welfare check and confirm she's okay. She doesn't respond.

I find her sister who lives under a different last name and out of state by combing through what must be 20,000 messages on IG over the last 4 years. I send her a message with all of the screenshots I took of the odd exchange and ask her to please follow up. I tell her the event number through the dispatch, and tell her I don't need to know the location she's living (the sister has never even met me... so I can't expect her to trust me outright) and just ask her to confirm that she made it home tonight and is safe. I then find her mother who she's living with currently through her sister's FB and send her a less detailed, more generic ""I'm such and such's friend. I'm worried about her well-being... could you please just confirm she got home safely tonight?"" message. 

I called the Dispatch one last time, and I'm told they transferred the event file to another office which was closer to her jurisdiction. The Dispatcher gives me their non-emergency number and I call them. I give the Dispatcher information so she can pull up the file and I'm put on hold. A detective ""Dan""picks up, and tells me they made contact with her and she is safe. Then says something along the lines of ""I don't know what is going on between you two, but you need to stop calling and tying up lines. She's safe. Have a goodnight."" and I felt as though he was insinuating that I was making this all up... so now I have no idea what to expect as return messages from her family once they wake up and sit down to them.

That was about 4:00am my time, 1:00am their time. It's currently 10:00am my time and I've heard nothing back from any family or friends.

What more can I do in this situation? She hasn't responded on Snapchat. She blocked me on IG... I just have a sick feeling that this isn't her. Any advice / suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and if you read to the end of this, I appreciate it more than you know.",11Aug2019,4
491,"I’m actually kinda pissed atm because of it.

I mean, the way I percieve it it’s just art. Nothing else related personally, but she seems to take it that way and it kinda hurts me because i’ve shown her something i’m proud of and she comes off saying “Ano mana langga man? Gahibi mana sa dugo lantawa bala.” Or “What is that dear? She’s crying blood, look at it.”

Here’s the example ^ not that good of a drawing but i’m just trying to get my point across.
https://imgur.com/a/QNgHJyW

It’s not even tears of blood, sure it has a resemblance to it but that wasn’t the first thing which came into my mind until she mentioned it.
Like what about tribes with paint on their faces? Why can’t she just understand it?

I’m not even sad about anything in real life, when she suddenly went off about it my heart just sank and felt more disappointed than ever.

It’s just art, mom.",11Aug2019,1
492,"This is a throwaway and I am on mobile typing with a broken thumb so sorry, but I really need advice/to talk to people about this.

Ok so here is the background I met this girl at camp in 8th grade (my first year) and we have been friends for a few years now. We talk to each other a lot at camp and some on snap chat. A few months ago I starting having feeling about here, except these were different feelings than ones I normally have about girls. Previously I felt a few ways about a girl, I felt sexually attracted to her and wanted to hook up or she is a friend/family members and I just like spending time with them or I do not care about them. This time I felt different, she is cute but I do not want to hook up with her, I just want her in my arms and I want to spend time with her and talk to her and get close with her. She is amazing and when ever I am done talking to her I feel so warm and happy. I plan on telling her how I feel but I am unsure on how to tell her how I feel, how she feels about me, or if she is willing to try a relationship. Here is the catch though she lives a four drive away from me which is do-able, as I drive. She is also dating one of my best friends, however, after camp my friend who is dating her goes back to Israel and she will be single again so then is when I can make my move. I really do not know if she likes me, as she is sending me mixed signals and I do lot want to lose my good friend who is currently dating her but will not be soon. My current plan is to get close with her after camp ends, when her current BF is in Israel and we are not, I will snap chat/FaceTime her a lot so we can get close, but I do not want to come off as clingy and I do not want to be put in the friend zone and I also do not want it to be a one way conversation. I am just very confused about this whole situation and need help. I know I did a poor job explaining the situation so please leave questions.

Please feel free to ask me questions so you can give better advice if necessary anything helps, just say anything you know that could help me, thank you for reading and have a great rest of your day.",11Aug2019,1

494,"So one of my best friends for a couple years now has recently been talking to a guy. I found out who he was and what he did. My friend is not the type of person to come even remotely close to dating a person like this. I’ve told her what she was getting into on more occasions than one and she still won’t budge. I don’t know if he’s like pulled some Jedi mind trick on her or what, but I can’t be having my friend affecting her life and dating someone known for drugs and sex. 

If anyone wants anymore details I’ll be glad to reply to the best of my ability. Thanks.",11Aug2019,0
495,"I have a new job starting tomorrow and after many trials and tribulations, and bending over backwards for the company through security checks and referencing, I have managed to secure the job.

A little background:
I am in my mid 20s, and already I have had over 10 jobs, accounting for those in job applications and through resume/CVs has become very difficult at this point, as has obtaining references. Due to in part, issues of mental health and other personal factors I have found it very difficult to hold down a job. At this point I've been unemployed for 3 months and my debts are getting out of control.

This time I would really like to keep this job, I am very adamant that I won't let my mistakes from the past repeat themselves; it still really worries me though.

At 8:45 tomorrow morning, I'm expected to be at my new place of work, and I have never been so anxious and sick to my stomach in my life, and it is making it so that I'm even considering not turning up.

So I ask you please r/advice, could you please give me any advice or knowledge that you can to inspire me or to encourage me to grasp this opportunity, because I'm so scared.

this would be advised in keeping and maintaining my job, as well as overcoming the initial nerves from actually first coming to my place of work..

Thank you.",11Aug2019,1
496,"I'm 19, in my 4th year of college, and have been moved out during the school months since I was 16, but over time, she's only gotten more strict. She tracks my location, has access to my finances, doesn't whatsoever respect my privacy or relationship with my boyfriend, and is increasingly judgmental/harsh to me regarding my appearance/physique, boyfriend, and academics the older I get. The tracking has been a problem with me from the start, and now having the app makes me feel no obligation to communicate with her where I'm going and what I'm doing. Not only that, but my friends and boyfriend think it's weird and creepy, and I have never given her reason to track me like she does. She asks my little brother every day while I'm gone to work or to see my boyfriend or friends to check the phone app and see where I'm at every so often, but she denies it, saying, ""Contrary to what you may believe, I don't just sit and watch you,"" but my trustworthy little brother testifies otherwise, and given my mother's history of invading my privacy, I don't exactly believe her so easily. Just recently, I faced a major privacy issue with her. She always shamed me for wanting to go on birth control for my irregular/painful periods, so I went behind her back at my university and started it after talking with an OBGYN; however, when I came back for summer break, my mother went through my purse while I was asleep after work and found it, raising 9 kinds of hell over it. She's grown to be incredibly harsh to me at times and is really judgmental over my boyfriend. He comes from a family in a lower-income bracket and grew up facing many harsh conditions that my mother who grew up with wealthy parents in suburban Michigan never had to deal with. Because of circumstances he can't control, she's very rude to me over my relationship with him, even though he's been no less than wonderful. He's not HER type, not up to HER standards, so he must not be good enough, I guess. She's seemed to have done everything in her power over this summer to keep me from seeing him, and it's put a lot of strain on my relationship. I don't want to lose my relationship with my mother, but what little we have is in shambles. I'm financially independent of my parents; they don't pay for anything for me, and my education is fully scholarshipped so they don't pay a dime toward that, either. Yet, every single thing she gets mad at me over, she threatens to pull me out of college, turn my phone off, or take the car I pay for. I took on two part-time summer jobs in order to keep up with my bills, hopefully make some spending money, and really, to stay gone from the house because being around her can just make me so unhappy. What can I do to hopefully maintain my relationship with her, but still have her respect my feelings?",11Aug2019,1

498,"I [F18] recently broke up with my ex [M21] of a bout a year and a few months. We were long distance but I was very much in love, and recently I came to find he was wanting to have sexual experiences with other girls. I’ve accepted that these things are the way of life and I just shouldn’t be around my ex or talk to him. However, when I try to sleep at night I’ll often have dreams of him (one where I accidentally called him and it wouldn’t allow me to end the call) and I’ll wake up with a strong pain in my chest that lasts the whole night. I can feel the pain now but it’s more dull, I’m wondering if this is normal or if I should try something to help it?

499,"I study at university and there are a few problems that make my studies a huge burden:

1. Irritable bowel syndrome: sometimes this thing makes studying insufferable, cause I have to endure extreme pain all the time, and very often it makes me get late for classes. It also makes public speaking much tougher, cause whenever I make a report in front of the audience I get nervous and IBS makes it feel like a torture.
2. Mental health problems: I also have OCD, which is usually triggered whenever I do something that I enjoy. So it makes it much harder to practice my hobbies and have a rest from classes. Besides, due to the studies I’ve become extremely nervous and anxious, living in a constant fear of losing my university. I’ve even started to flinch whenever I hear something like a loud noise, which is certainly not all right. If people whose opinion is important to me tell me something or even look at me, my limbs start trembling and I cannot control it. It often leads to panic attacks and makes it impossible to interact with people. This year I’ve also tried to find a girlfriend, but the girls I wrote to just left me on read. When I tried to approach girls at my university, they just ignored me. All my classmates are also girls, and I cannot become friends with them, no matter how much I try.
3. Conscription: in my country there is conscription, so if I lose my university, I will be conscripted. This means that I’ll have to spend a year of my life being bullied, beaten and humiliated, eating shitty food, living without sleep and weekends. Also if I have a girlfriend eventually, she is not gonna wait for me to return, cause here most girls break up with their boyfriends if those get conscripted.

So what do I have to do to solve these problems? How can I make this life better? Studies are a very important part of my life, but it has become insufferable.",11Aug2019,3
500,"Im a female, 14 and about a week ago I watched a couple videos about catching pedophiles and predators. I thought it was amazing that people could catch such awful people trying to harm younger people. Then all of a sudden a thought came into my head about my younger cousin and it was sexual. I was not aroused at all but I actually had a panic attack and started getting suicidal for even thinking about her that way. I was so shocked as soon as that awful thought slid into my mind. Now it hasn’t left and I don’t know why. Now when I’m around my younger step sister who is about the same age as my younger cousin, I just feel afraid of having thoughts about her too. She’s a beautiful and creative little girl and I wouldn’t ever dream of harming her or my little cousin. I don’t know what to do to end these thoughts. I have a wonderful family, a beautiful house, and a great life. Why would my mind want to ruin that for me by causing me anxiety and depression? It just happens and its like my mind takes over with intrusive thoughts about every little thing. My mom is very special to me and my step dad is the best person. They both want to know what’s going on with me but I’m just too ashamed to tell them. Because they might disown me and be disappointed and hate me and view me as a monster. It just terrible because I don’t want medicines and I want to cure this with my own will power but I don’t know what to do.

505,"I’ve got good parents I would say compared to other kids that I know have it a lot worse than me, which is one of the reasons I hate discussing this issue because my parents have paid through my entire private school education and will continue to pay for university. Yet with that it’s so hard to just be grateful without feeling sad with how I feel like I’ve trapped my parents in a loveless marriage. 

My parents constantly fight. Sometimes when it’s a good day I’m surprised that they’re not biting each other’s throats off. My mom accuses my dad of cheating and stealing money and my dad is sick and tired of working and coming home to cleaning the whole house and cooking dinner and feeling like a servant to my mom. Yet they stay together because of me, that’s what they both say. Even though I hate it, having to endure through the fights almost every single night. They’ve both never been that physical (both affectionately or during fights) with each other other than the occasional slap or throwing bottles or newspaper, which at this point is so ordinary to me that I don’t even know how severe it is to engage in that type of arguing. My dad sometimes says he should just be dead and I never know how serious he means that. Living abroad makes it hard for both of my parents as they’re not around family, and being from different cultures hasn’t helped as well. So that’s one problem that I have no clue what to do about. I’ve tried telling them how I’ve felt, how it hurts to hear that and if they ever wanted to get a divorce they should. I just don’t know how efficient communicating with them is. 

And the second thing is my mom. I applied for universities and got into a few. While my scores are competitive in the schools I didn’t get into, I was obviously not suited for those schools in other areas. Yet my mom constantly chooses to verbally abuse me by saying I’m not good enough. That I’m a fraud. That my friends are just using and lying to me, which I don’t understand because all my friends have always been incredibly hardworking and she’s barely interacted with any of them for more than 10 minutes at a time. And the thing is I would understand if it was something that was the heat of the moment. But it’s every single day. Every time she’s annoyed at me she comments on how I’m ugly, how no university would ever want me. The thing is I hope I could say that this was something that just started occurring after I was rejected by universities my mom deemed good. But it’s not. It’s been like this since a child where nothing I do is good enough. And the thing is if you were to meet her in person you’d think that she’s the sweetest lady ever. And she can be. Just not that often with me. And maybe it’s my fault because I always talk back or get frustrated with her, but it’s reached a point where I truly can’t stand her. I’ve talked to my school therapist and a close friend and both just tell me to stay strong and survive through this. I get to leave and go to college half way across the country in a month. But I can’t help but still feel responsible for my parents once I leave. At this point I just don’t know what to do. I’m constantly on the verge of breaking down when I’m with my mom and if I did that in front of her she’d just tell me I’m weak. 

I’ve just always been hopeful for the future but this last month just feels so damn hard.

He had me corned and wouldn't let me get away. So I punched him in the mouth and he started pouring blood. Blood all over the towel and his shirt and the floor.

Pretty sure she was going to pubs and bars without my parents knowledge or permission. I even saw her drinking liquor in my house which my dad kept in the house store room. Even he rarely drink unless there is a occasion.But i don't really mind anything about this, or her character, its her own choice. Im just super worried about her future.She went abroad to another country to do dentistry even though my dad adviced not to go in the field since there is basically too much people in the field waiting in queue to do housemanship (post graduate training). The government hospitals were full. And even if she got the work , she has to work for minimal salary and after finishing the training she needs to afford the expensive equipments to work , not to mention the place. Our family is not rich. The thing is she failed her course which is 6 years in total , but she came back in 2 years because of the bad results and blamed it on she's feeling sick all the time.which i know it's not true. This meant that my dad paid his 2-3 years salary for nothing. It was one of the most terrible things that happened. My dream was to do sound engineering but looking at our family situation, i decide to do a normal diploma course in another field which was really affordable and is only 3 years and you can easily get a job after graduating, So i can support my family if my dad is unable to to work since my mom is a house wife.Now my dad who is working hard overseas (16 hours a day) to pay our education fees have enrolled my sister in a local college to study business which we are not sure of how's she's doing.
She rarely comes home and my mom is all alone at home since my dad works abroad. It's me who the one always comes back to make sure she's ok and to help her with buying goods and cleaning the house. She's kinda sick these days and getting old ( my mom). Yesterday my friend shared a tinder profile because he knows my sister. but i dare not to tell my parents because they will get angry and mad at her, which might affect our whole family. I don't talk to her because she is a very sensitive person and likes to make conflict out of nothing. For an example me using her table to study because my room is too small which She would shout at me even if she's not using the table.

This has been going on for as long as I can remember, constantly yelling at me or putting me down or cussing me out when she feels like it, and she always plays the victim card. My dad just makes things worse by siding with her the moment I try to stand up for myself, since apparently I have to show them respect 24/7 but they don't have to to me, and if I talk to him in private he makes excuses and enables her. I don't know what to do and can't tolerate it anymore, I honestly hate my parents at this point. I'm sorry for the text wall, I'm at my wit's end here.",11Aug2019,1

515,"My best friend, let's call him Jay, will always say nasty shit and make fun of me for multiple things like being shorter than him (even though I'm .1 inch shorter) and at first I thought that it was a thing that friends just do but then I realized it wasn't. He always has to make fun of me, even when we we're having fun. It makes me so pissed off that I want to start following the rule ""talk shit, get hit."" I will sometimes do it back to him so I fit in, but its just so fucking exhausting knowing that I have a fucking hatred for him deep down inside. I think he was also the reason I went through a depressed phase and have social anxiety.
  
   A while ago we constantly argued cause I kept calling him out, and it led to me punching him in the fucking face, giving him a cut and black eye. We made up, but he still always makes fun of me and I'm sick of it, he will laugh at how I'm underweight, skinny, and again, shorter, and many other things. I just need help, he's mentally draining, reminds me of my mentally abusive stepdad from a while ago, and I'm afraid that I'll end up cutting him off, or beating the shit out of him because of my anger issues.

516,"He was a terrible boyfriend. Refused to pay for his share of rent, groceries, and weed. We argued a lot and it sucked. 

For some reason I decided to stay friends with him. 

He was unemployed for a while, and I didn't have any problem with making him dinner, and smoking him up, or going out and I would pay. However he's had a job for a few months now, and I've been waiting for him to return the favor, or at least stop assuming I'm going to pay for everything. ( I should add that he doesn't have to pay for rent or food where he lives now)

So he asked if I wanted to hang out and I said yes. Then he blew me off to hang out with a woman he has a crush on. Which I'll admit that part of it did hurt me, but also he was going to be in my neighborhood because he was planning on buying weed from someone who lives in my neighborhood.

 After months of me smoking him up, putting gas in his car, etc. he only decides it's the time to buy weed when he spending time with someone else. 

I should add that he literally never thanks me for any of this, he never thanks me for buying him dinner or anything. I know I let him treat me like a doormat...

So I got annoyed with him and told him I thought it was bullshit that he's more than willing to spend money when it comes to other people, but not to pay his fair share with me or to return any of the countless favors I have done for him. And I told him that it wasn't cool of him to just blow me off like that, and that my feelings were hurt and I'm pissed off.

He has a history of people giving him the world when he's in need, but when he's no longer in need he still expects to be given everything, and gets upset when asked to pay his own way.

He is very upset that I called him out and claims ""i scared him."" When I asked if that's it, we're just no longer friends because I got upset with him once, when it was completely reasonable for me to do so. His response was ""your actions have consequences.""

And it just struck me that I've been letting him live a consequence-free existence, letting him take advantage of me over and over and over and over, and the one time i get upset about it, he can't handle it. 

So my question is how do I stop thinking about this guy? How do I stop feeling bad?

 My therapist assures me I did absolutely nothing wrong and that he is simply a user who will take everything he can from me, then the second things become difficult, he'll drop me and move on to the next person. People I know that have known him a lot longer than me say the same thing.

Why is my urge to run and apologize to this guy? How do I get him out of my head? Wtf is wrong with me?",11Aug2019,1

(Suicidal, abusive, blackmails, etc etc) Recently, we were texting, and she was talking about her abusive boyfriend and I was trying to calm her down, when out of the blue, she said “Hanging out with *names* has slowly begun to make me lose my mind. I’m going to off myself.” I then said “It’s okay, you’ll get through this somehow. You have so much to live for.” And she said “I just need me time. I can’t be friends with you anymore.” I said “If you need anyone to talk to, I’m always free.” That was the last conversation I had with her. I’m obviously gonna respect her and give her space, but it’s starting to affect me as well. The last time I met her irl was a month ago. I’m not just gonna abandon her. I can’t.

My little sister carries a Bible with her to school now. In the past hour she's come into my room to smudge it and light candles TWICE. Its nearly past 10 PM!


The most discomforting is when she says things like, ""we're all children of Jesus, right?"" or ""Use your faith in God to help me and protect this household."" I don't feel like I even have I choice and am obligated to go along with it.


She told us that she started doing this because the house was ""no longer at peace,"" which only worried me about what she saw or heard that led her to believe that.

I don't care whether or not she or the rest of my family are believers in God; of course I want her to be happy and express herself, but it just seems like a lot, and with how dedicated she's become to her faith, I'm afraid that I'll upset her by telling her and she may even punish/reprimand me.

524,"So I'm an American student and I studied at a decent University for my first year but didn't think my education was good enough. Since high school I've been planning/dreaming in the back of my head to study overseas for my entire degree. My parents backed me up and I only heard good things about it. I just want to be successful. I applied overseas to a uni in the Netherlands to study computer science. I put in a lot of effort and time into this application and I got accepted, which was great. I set up everything, including the ticket, visas, and tuition. But the one pesky drawback with this uni is that it didn't provide accommodation, you had to find your own in the city. And what's more is that this uni accepted more international students than the city can handle, it's a mess! I've been warned like anyone else but I had my head up high and I did all I could to set myself up for a great education in the NL. Unfortunately I still haven't found shit, and every landlord I talk to seems to turn me down. The clock's running out of time and I'm starting to give up, because what the fuck am I gonna do if I don't have a place to live? I'm beginning to feel humiliated, embarrassed, and crushed ngl. All of my friends and family know about this giant plan and we did things together as a last hoorah and they wished me luck and all that stuff. If I can't find a place (which I don't think I will) my plan B might be to go to community college, or back to the Uni I used to study at in the winter semester. I'll be a semester behind my peers and that'll drive me nuts. I feel like I'm gonna go insane and just watching my life go downhill. I messed up big time trying to follow a dream.

527,"Hey everyone, I’m 15 years old (turning 16 in a little less than 3 months) and for the past year or so, I feel as though I have been put in a rather difficult situation regarding my parents and their beliefs, ethics, and world views. This post is a little hard to word, so I apologize if I come off as spoiled, rude, or ungrateful in any way, because that is not my intent whatsoever. But first, a little backstory.

I am an only child, and, for most of my life, my parents have been, well, fairly good parents. My mom hasn’t been perfect, and we often haven’t seen eye-to-eye on certain topics, but, we have always gotten along. However, whenever I have had any trouble with my mom, my dad has always been there for me. He and I are much more compatible, and we have similar world views, believing in similar things. I never really felt like I could confide in him, though, because he would always just tell me that I should talk to my mom about whatever my issue was, but, I knew my mom would offer unsolicited “advice” that I wasn’t asking for, which would usually make the situation worse.

However, about a year ago, this all seemed to change. Personally, I think it is because I have grown up and discovered more of the world myself. Previously, I had pretty much taken whatever my parents had said and believed it immediately, at face value. However, I have recently began to question some of what they (mostly my mom) says, and, after doing research on many things, I have realized that my parents (again, mostly my mom) are a bit misguided.

Now, on to my problem. My family is certainly not rich, but we’re definitely not poor. However, recently we have had to make a few adjustments due to financial circumstances, which made me realize that we don’t have a ton of money to spare. My parents have asked me for some ways in which we can save money, which I have happily provided, because I can think of several ways to cut back on spending. Unfortunately, they refuse to accept any of my ideas.

For example, my mom buys exclusively organic non-GMO food. She WILL NOT, under ANY circumstances, buy inorganic food with GMOs. Now, after doing some research, I have found a general consensus showing that inorganic food grown with GMOs do not harm you. And, inorganic food grown with GMOs is much cheaper than organic non-GMO food. However, my parents simply refuse to believe it. Out of curiosity, I looked at a receipt that my mom left on the counter from when she went food shopping, and she spent a whopping $450. She goes food shopping about one to two times a week... 

Now, that’s not all. My mom also is really into homeopathic remedies. She buys several homeopathic sprays per year, which, after some research, seem to cost $20. Now, homeopathic remedies are not accepted medicines for curing ailments. The first ingredient in every single one is water, and on the back, it even says that it is not approved by the FDA.

Finally, our dog. My mom buys so many bully stick treats and food for her that she absolutely does not need. She barely eats the bully sticks, and they cost about $40 per bag, and my mom also buys about one of those per week. Oh, and they’re also organic and non-GMO (I assume this means that the cows the treats come from are not fed inorganic GMO feed). I have never actually seen our dog finish a bully stick, and yet my mom keeps buying them. She always ends up throwing out the ends, which is also incredibly wasteful.

Now, previously, I have mentioned that my dad usually agrees with my points of view. Unfortunately, my dad simply keeps letting it happen. I know that he secretly agrees with me, as he’s confided in me with that information. However, no matter what my mom does, he will always side with her. No matter what I say or do, no matter how much evidence I present to him, he will not help me with this.

It’s infuriating to me, because I know of several solid ways we can cut our expenses to save money, but my parents simply refuse to look at them. They are literally wasting money, and there’s nothing I can do about it. I feel powerless to help, despite wanting with all of my being, to do just that.

If anyone has any ideas and advice on how to manage this situation, I would be very grateful. Apologies for the extremely long post.

TL;DR: My parents are wasting a lot of money on organic non-GMO food, homeopathic remedies, and organic non-GMO bully sticks for our dog that she never eats. We need to cut expenses, and I have been trying to convince them to purchase alternative food products and stop buying homeopathic remedies, but they refuse to listen, and I am at a loss for how to proceed.",11Aug2019,0

530,"So, a little bit of context, I'm almost 20 and i got my girst actual job a couple of weeks ago in a Cafe.

I have no experience in this sort of business (i.e pouring drinks, brewing coffee, being a waiter etc..) and the staff has been teaching me how to handle my job, the thing is most of the customers are local and they come here every day, they demand special service and custom brewed coffee most of the time, i keep being pressured from the side of the locals and from my bosses side where she complains that im too slow at cleaning tables/brewing coffee/serving/pouring drinks/cleaning the dishes/restocking inventory/managing the cash register etc.. 

It stresses me out extremely and as a result i tend to forget what i have to do (I'm extremely forgetful as is)..

It doesn't help that every mistake that i do, i take to heart way too much and i beat myself up for it..

So, today i decided to call in sick, frankly i felt like utter shit the whole night, I couldn't sleep properly and felt like throwing up, i texted my boss to let her know that i feel really sick she replied with 'what's wrong?' and i answered her by saying i felt like throwing up and that I didn't get enough sleep, that was it.. 

I also let my mother know that i stayed at home for that reason, she flipped shit, 
She yelled at me that I'm an ungrateful child, that I don't deserve the things i have and that i wont be getting anything from her ever again, that she has to work when she's so sick she could die while I don't go to work because i feel like 'shit'..

I'm new to 'adulting' and i just wanted to know, is what i did really that wrong? 

I feel horrible now because of it.

531,"Throwaway because paranoia breeds paranoia.
Also on mobile so please forgive format/errors.

I work at a small office and my boss is the business owner.  Boss seems incredibly high strung to begin with and is very controlling and the epitome of micro-managing. Boss has microphones and cameras all over the office which I know is perfectly legal. Legality isn’t the issue. I’m just wondering how common what happened to me is. 

There’s an impending (positive) company change coming in the extremely near future that boss has been lying to the employees about and requiring me to lie about too because boss thinks the bigger companies in town will find out the plan and use it against us to shut us down. (I don’t think we’re THAT important to the much much larger companies in town but ok...boss also thinks they’re watching us and trying to destroy us constantly.) It’s horribly obvious to the employees what’s happening. They know. They keep coming to me and asking about it and I’ve denied, denied. One of the other managers has said something confirming “big secret” to the employees so they definitely know. Telling them they’re wrong at this point is counting them as being very stupid. They see vendors that could only be related to said “big secret” coming in multiple times per week. It’s obvious. Last week boss was out and a few employees and another manager (the one who has confirmed it) were in my office for something and one of the employees began talking off the cuff about when the “big secret” happens because a client has said mentioned the “big secret” to the employee. Rather than deny I tried to joke it off say I’ve had that happen too. Another employee asked when they’re going to be told about “big secret” because literally EVERYONE knows. I told her I don’t know...probably a week before it happens. I realize saying that confirmed it which is wrong on my part and it’s not excuse but I was exhausted after two deaths in the family last week, two days of solid chaos at the office, and IT issues. I slipped and I own that. I was trying to move on from the convo as best as I could and I handled it poorly.

I get a phone call immediately after from boss who said they were watching and listening the whole time via cameras and mics and that I undermined them, am insubordinate, and a huge liability to the company.  Boss flipped out and yelled at me for 15 minutes on the phone. I’m honestly wondering if I’m going to go in tomorrow morning and have my desk already boxed up for me to leave. I’ve never been let go from a job before and I’ve been working for 20 years. I’ve applied for probably 7 jobs over the course of this weekend because either way, I want out of there. I think I needed to vent to the universe about this because I feel a little better having typed all that out. 

My original question was going to be on a scale of “everyone does this” to “batshit crazy”, how toxic is the behavior of the boss?

TLDR: boss listened to an awkward conversation between me and a coworker through microphones. Boss then called and told me i was “insubordinate”, “a liability”, and had “undermined” them and yelled at me for 15 minutes. Super toxic or do I just need to accept this as a new normal for business?",11Aug2019,3
533,"Hello everybody,

To keep it short: I share a house with five other people and recently three girls moved out to live togehter. The entire moving out process was such a pain but in the end they finally moved out.  
Shortly after  though, I noticed that almost all of our cups and plates went missing in our cupboards. I thought that maybe my flatmates were keeping some dirty plates and cups in their rooms and simply were too lazy to wash them but since one of them is on holiday and the other one quite attentive about the dishes he uses, I am starting to suspect that the girls took them when the left. 

All I want to know is, if there is anything I/we can do? I thought about confronting them but it can either end with them lying to us -because why should they tell me the truth anyway- or confessing, but then what? They are not going to return it voluntary since they took it without our permission already. They technically stole part of our possessions since they didn't discuss this matter with us, right?",11Aug2019,1

537,"Okay, so this is a super sticky situation. I’ll give a quick backstory so you kind of get an idea of what’s going on. Basically I’ve been with my boyfriend for over 3 years. I had a decent relationship with his mom in the beginning, but after seeing who she really was, I quit going around her. She’s been cheating on my bf’s dad for years (he’s FINALLY unwrapped from her finger and served her with divorce papers a few days ago), she lies constantly, always cancels plans she makes with you, only speaks to my bf and his sister when she needs money, tries to sweet talk my bf’s dad to give her more time to “come back home” (it’s been 8 years, you have no intentions of coming back home) so she can use him for money and car insurance, and to top it all off, she acts like the victim when no one wants to be around her. My boyfriend will go over there when he can, but he’s pretty busy with school and work. I flat out refuse because I can’t stand her or the guy she’s with, and my bf’s sister lives 40 minutes away without a driver’s license (the sister also has it figured out her mother only uses her for money so she really doesn’t want much to do with her either). Let me also mention that his mom lives maybe 50 FEET away from us in another apartment, she could easily see her son if she wanted to. 

So, about a year ago my bf’s grandmother (mom’s mom) messaged him saying how he and his sister need to see her more (again she’s playing victim) and how I need to have a relationship with his mother if I expect to marry him (she’s crazy if she thinks she has any say in that. I also have no clue what lies his mother has told her mother, or if the grandmother is in on it). She also said “if (my name) doesn’t start going over there, I’m gonna have a talk with her.”

Fast forward to about a week ago, I get a message on Facebook from the grandmother asking to hang out, she wants “to spend time with me.” Keep in mind the previous paragraph and the fact that I’ve been around her a hand full of times out to eat, always with my bf and his mom (my bf pretty much forces me to, but I don’t really speak, I keep my nose in my phone). I am not close to this lady at all. 

So I read the whole message on airplane mode so it never shows her I read it, then delete it. This morning I got a text from her saying she tried me on Facebook and never got a reply, and then basically the same message as last time. I’m not dumb, I know it’s gonna be me meeting up with her and then everything is cool for awhile, and then I get a passive-aggressive lecture on how I should spend time with her daughter/bf’s mother. I haven’t replied to the message. What do I do? Should I agree and go talk to her (granted, nothing with change my mind, I one million percent don’t trust or really like my bf’s mom), completely ignore the message (we do live in the same town and she’s come in my work a few times), or just say I have a busy work schedule? I really don’t want to be upfront and be like “i know this is some ruse, I’m not stupid” cause I really don’t want to start family drama. Please help me.",11Aug2019,2
538,"Hi everybody, I'll try to keep this short. I've been unemployed for a while and living off of benefits and savings while looking for a job. I went to a jobs fair a few weeks ago and a teaching agency for TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) in China got back to me. I had the initial consultation last Monday and it sounds a really good deal; decent salary, amazing experience, they provide lessons in Mandarin, I don't need to have finished the TEFL to start applying for a VISA, health care, annual flight allowance, and so on. I was always apprehensive about whether I could go for reasons I'll explain below, but I didn't have the courage to state my concerns then. So I have my video-call interview tomorrow. Although I might fuck it up there, they seem keen. 

The problem is that of course *if* I get the job, I need to sign a contract to work in China for *at least* a year. There are a few major barriers to this 

1. I have only been living in my current apartment for around a year, in fact I only secured the tenancy this summer. The flat is mine for life, but unless I can somehow pay for 2 places at once on an entry-level graduate salary, I'm going to have to give this up if I move abroad. I am not allowed to sublet it since the flat is part of a housing association. I was living at my dad's before I moved here, but he's changed the spare room where I was sleeping now; it's unfair on him to go back to his. Plus I have too much stuff here to do so currently (books, folders, etc.) 

2. A friend suggested illegally subletting my flat, however absent ethical concerns, the government are helping me to pay for my housing benefit. So contractually this is impossible to get around unless they butt out of my life the moment I sign off. I have anxiety issues myself and I imagine that living abroad knowing that I am breaking the law in my country of citizenship would send it through the roof and cause me not to enjoy myself. Again, this strongly suggests that I would have to give this place up. 

3. I live near my mum who worries a lot about me (has anxiety, can be over-bearing/helicoptering, but loves me clearly). She helped me obtain this flat in a stroke of luck when I had had no luck, and she is going to be both upset and angry if I give it up.

If I fail (say if I get fired) then I potentially come back to either living with my parents, or straight up homeless.  

4. Perhaps this is a stereotype but I'm not sure how hard the culture shock will hit me and I keep worrying I'm going to get deported or arrested for saying something stupid.  

5. I have been out of work a while and am not even sure I COULD hold down a full-time job, let alone in a different country. 

This is the trip and job of a lifetime, and the agency may never have a vacancy again! But I don't know what to do. The risk is enormous and I even risk alienating my family. I understand none of you can decide for me, and it's probably too late now. Just need to vent heh. Thanks",11Aug2019,1

I usually eat around 2k cals but it made me gain 5 kg and I wanna get rid of it within 2 months. I was 48kg last year now I’m around 53.  I don’t know what to do because it’s the hunger that makes dieting the hardest bit because normally I’m used to snacking too much. thanks.",11Aug2019,1

541,"Basically I’ve been smoking daily for all about 5 years now. I’m 23, have a good job, I’ve just moved out of my parents, drive etc and did all those things during my time of smoking, so it’s done a lot of things positive for me (when I was 18 I was depressed and didn’t have a great deal of ambition)

But my reasons for quitting are due to starting a big qualification in a month which requires lots of studying after work (so for time reasons) and also I guess cost, and I have more responsibility now. But it’s hard to let go. Weeds also been there at the end of the day to help me feel positive, look forward to the future, I guess I’m kinda scared to let go of something which has given me so much happiness and hasn’t really impacted my life in a negative way.

So I was thinking of using for a month, before the deadline of starting my exams. But does this sound like a bad idea? Because I’m also thinking perhaps it would be safe to quit now, meditate and exercise etc, so I’m not fighting any withdrawals when the time comes when I’m studying.",11Aug2019,1
543,"Background info- For whatever reason, for my entire life I’ve been terrified of sleeping away from home. The fear has become more intense the older I got, and is now unbearable.


I’ve had several panic attacks already. To put it into perspective the severity of this is-I’m from the U.K, and last year I went to Venice. My family and I stayed in a B&amp;B the day/night before our flight, instead of travelling to the airport in the early hours of the morning.


I was so scared I kept throwing up, and couldn’t eat for 3 days. It was always worse at night. I would wake up gasping for air, or shaking so much in my sleep the squeaking bed would wake up my parents. I got so scared that I would genuinely consider suicide to escape. I felt trapped and isolated, and so so lonely.


This year I’m staying in the U.K.- going to Cornwall. It’s around a 4 hour drive due to the roads, but technically would only be an hour away from my house as the crow flies. We’re staying at a small holiday lodge.


I’m so scared. I didn’t want to post this as I didn’t want to validate how I’m feeling- I feel sick as I type this. How do I counter this? I know I won’t be able to change the way I feel overnight, but are there any ways to make this trip more bearable?",11Aug2019,3

554,"Throwaway. 

My ex boyfriend of 5 years still keeps wishing me happy birthday after its been 3 years since our break up. During our 5 years of dating he never forgot to wish me happy birthday even when he went to university, his wish would always be the first wish(except on the last year of our dating, more on that soon) that'd pop up on my phone and wishes from others would only come after I post it's my birthday. Tbh his wishes are way out of this world, he shocks me as to how he comes up with those stuff. And I on the other hand, have always forgotten his birthday, not even once had I remembered his birthday, hell I don't even know when his birthday is on top of my head. 

On the last year of our dating I had asked to take a break because things were not as good as before but still I'd flirt with him and send intimate snaps. Then my birthday week came my birthday is on October so he's always away during my birthday. Anyway he kept reminding me for days to turn his post notifications on on our FB group(just him and I) we had stopped posting there for years so I didn't know why he asked me to do that but I kept forgetting to do so. Birthday came and it's weekend he's out with his friends. It's midnight he texted me to check on me, I guess since I hadn't texted him the whole day. Told him I was mad that he hadn't wished me a happy birthday and then he called and asked me if I hadn't done what he has asked me to do multiple days ago and stupid me instead of checking the post out I made a big mess out of it. This caused lots of fights for weeks(from my side), he claimed to have worked on it for a whole month and when I checked it out I didn't get it until years after we broke up and it indeed looked like it took a whole month to come up with it, just the thought of it is enough to make me happy for years. I didn't show any appreciation whatsoever for it, not even a bit. The fact that he hadn't stopped wishing me happy birthdays after that triggers good times with him and it makes me want to try things with him again. He was very very lovely my parents and relatives liked him except my bestfriend. When he loves he does it in the best way I can imagine but he had hurt me a lot, I'm sensitive and it's easy to hurt me and he's the opposite of me but lately he had noticed how sensitive I was and started watching his words so he was hurting me less but still he had his assholish days. 

Few of the reasons I want to try to go back is

1- He knows and understands me very well. I had feelings toward other guy and he knew just when I asked him to move on out of the blue. He took me back tho after talking to him about how mentally ill the guy was. And on last year of our relationship I kept picking fights with him over things he claims which I made up and in retrospect he was right, my feelings played me. It came to an end after he asked me if I was going out with someone else and I was but I denied it and didn't tell him until he mentioned how he thinks I'm lying and mentioned every matching patterns I did when I started seeing the first guy and this second guy. 

2- He listens to me 24/7 and remembers everything even the smallest details. On the beginning of our relationship I've made him promise me that before our first sex he'd ask me in a serious way(not in a playful way so I'd have to think about it well) if I want to do it and he promised and delivered. A night came when we were to do it but he did as he promised and I've said no, that was the closest we were to sexual intercourse, so I never had sex with him. I'd only do so with my husband. 

3- We talk occasionally and I've came to know he's been single ever since we broke up and I think he still hasn't moved on or else he'd have been with someone since many girls including my friends have a huge crush on him. And almost 99% of the girls I know had a crush on him at some point. So I don't know

I'd get creeped out if he was like any ex but he's a major childhood friend and grew up together. We agreed to stay cool and not enemies so this makes it not creepy at all, at least for me. 

How can I shut these thoughts off?",11Aug2019,1
556,"Basically the title. I won’t exaggerate my side so I can get the best advice. 

I work as an hourly floor manager in a mid-tier sporting goods store in the state of GA, USA. Within the last two months the store has undergone changes in the general manager and assistant manager. They both like to use group chats as their main form of communication. The texts have quickly turned contentious, with them “putting us on blast” whenever things go wrong, not offering solutions just embarrassing me and the other floor managers. I’ve spoken to the other floor managers and they agree that it’s embarrassing and affects morale. We receive at least 5-6 texts daily, even on my days off. Most of the time it doesn’t apply to me at all, they just use the group instead of texting the party of interest directly. 

I couldn’t find any information on this in the company handbook so I’m asking you guys: should I ask to leave the group chat and ask them to contact me directly if they need me? Or should I (respectfully, of course) address the nature of the group chat and how it affects our morale. Or should I continue to bite my tongue?

Thanks!",11Aug2019,3

558," 

I'm 18/F. I have been at work constantly this week, as I believe my scheduling manager may have made a mistake because I was scheduled eight days in a row. I could've said something or asked, but I also wanted to go for it, so I did.

Well today was day seven of eight, and I got so frustrated I ended up crying and all my frustration was coming from this manager who kept putting me on the spot. I mean, some of it was from other problems in my life, but I was trying to hold it together and make it through the shift as best I could, because I take my job seriously. I work night shifts, so we're overworked and understaffed.

I have a real bitterness towards strictness. I am not sure why, I just have this disdain for following rules, especially corporate rules. I started working with a fairly new manager this week, and while I know how to do my job taking orders quickly, this new manager kept trying to tell me I had to say specifically ""Would you like BBQ with that?"" Or ""Would you like coke?"" because McDonalds wanted us too. This is confusing to me, cause I'm just tryna service customers and don't see what difference it makes. I just kept doing it my way, and she would keep coming back to call me out, saying stuff like, ""Hun I don't know if you didn't understand but you're supposed to say it this way.""

We were having problems before because she kept calling me out on everything and I started to feel very uncomfortable, and was trying to get her to back off by just staying out of sight and trying not to cause problems. When I did go up front to see if there was anything anyone needed help with, she started asking me what was wrong and when I said ""Nothing"" she said something about my attitude not being cute. But I don't know what she was talking about, I literally just went to see what everyone else was doing since I got bored of being alone in the back, and didn't have lots to do. It was making me kinda nervous.

She sent me on break, and I got some food. Ordered 2 cookies. This was so dumb, but the cookies I got were hard. I mean the kind of hard where you bite into it and there's a crunch rather than just a bite. I went up to the counter to let her know, and she kind of shrugged me off saying if I wanted soft cookies I could go and put the cookies in myself because she wasn't throwing anything away. This really rubbed me the wrong way, and it was what finally made me cave. Everyone keeps telling me I'm in the wrong irl because I wasn't doing my job right, and I actually feel guilty for almost walking out mid-shift after I clocked back on. 

When I started to panic and cave, I asked to be sent home. All I got was a, ""You need to start acting like a grown woman and work out whatever it is that's bothering you."" and I told her, ""Sorry, then I guess you'll just have to write me up."", took off my headset, and walked to the back where I started to cry. It was sad and I was feeling really defeated and like it just wasn't worth it. 

Even though everything is okay now, and we eventually got the fuck over it, I still feel really bad. She went as far as to call my GM and put me on the spot again while I was sitting there crying. She was acting like I was being unreasonable and selfish. It was really embarrassing and my coworker was trying to calm me down before I left. I ended up deciding to stay because I do need my job, and I might not find another. But I would love to hear somebody else's opinion on this entire situation, because I could use some honest feedback. I would use AITA but my post always gets removed for some reason or another.",11Aug2019,2

560,"I bought my own place last year and have great neighbours, except the ones I share a boundary with I’ve only once spoken to (so I can’t judge them) and that was due to this advice situation. I wouldn’t confidently be able to pick them out from a line up. 

The fence posts have rotted away and starting in March, slowly falling into their garden. Initially I thought I owned the fence at least partially so got my builder friend round for a quote, then got out the deeds to see if it was 50/50. If so o was going to get a written quote and approach them about sharing the costs. Turned out the fence is 100% owned by them and not me, so I sat on the quote and waited to see if they’d approach me. 

In May one of the neighbours came round and we chatted about it. I told them although I know it’s theirs, I also know how much it costs so I’d go 50/50 on it so we can get a decent job done. The neighbour told me they “knew a guy” and he’d be round to sort it in a couple weeks. I saw them out and once again said when their guy had given them a quote to let me have a copy so I can give them half when it’s completed. 

We’re now in August and then fence is not fixed, only leaning more into their garden. The panels have warped and will likely need replacing in two places at least. End of July I dropped a note round as they weren’t in, giving them my contact details and the details of the builder I use. I included a note saying he’s doing a job for me on this date, so if they wanted to I could get him to quote us, but would they mind us coming in their garden too so we can see the whole situation. I dropped the note round as I’ve been round before to return their bins that had blown down the street in a storm, only for them to not answer the door despite being in (could see tv on as I went up to the door and their dog was out in the bag garden, which only happens when their there). 


They own the house so there isn’t a landlord to contact either, which is why I thought there could be a delay. 

We haven’t heard back from them. I’m fairly certain I passed the neighbour I haven’t met yet in the street today and tried to catch his eye to speak, only to have him see me and quickly stare directly at his feet as he passed, so I gave up and went on.

567,"I'm so upset right now. Basically, I just started my second year of medical school and this week has been busy and I've been studying like 24/7. School requires me to get a TB skin test so I made time to get one and it cost me $35, money that I don't really have to spend. But I took it and I forgot to go back yesterday and get it read, and they closed early yesterday. So I took a photo and called them today to see if they would accept it and they said no not even with a photo, which I think is some bullshit because I could easily describe the reading - I'm in the medical field for crying out loud and it was negative. Anyway, I just feel so disappointed about this it was a complete waste of time I could have used to study or relax and a complete waste of $35, I literally only spend money on groceries and necessities and that money could have been used for something worthwhile. It may not seem like a lot but to me it is particularly when I'm a student and I'm legally not allowed to have a job while in school. 

Now I'm trying to study but I can't because I'm just so upset about the scenario. I literally have cried over this and I'm sure it seems over the top but I've had setbacks and I know there are worse situations but that doesn't mean I'm not upset - there are several other stressors in my life and this is just the tipping point. It is truly so upsetting to me that I wasted valuable time and money and that I have to go back and get another test which was uncomfortable and painful is just so disappointing.

575,"I always tried to explain to my mom that I didn't like church, that I don't believe in Christianity. Over time, it felt like she'd never listen to me and we got into more and more arguments over it. I tried to explain that I am fifteen and am old enough to develop my own beliefs and ideas and if they would respect that, they would respect my decision not to go to church. Their response would always be the same, that they do respect my beliefs and idea but do not believe I am old enough to decide for myself. I stated that we treat religion nowadays like  genetics instead of something you do because you actually believe in. After one argument, she said in a very calm voice that I didn't have to go to church anymore. She said she'd pray the Jesus enters my sister and I's hearts. To some, I guess I may have won, but I don't feel like I can win either way. My sister and I try to go to church occasionally for her, but last time I went my brain just filled with bad memories and intrusive thoughts. (I have OCD, so just sitting for an hour can be hard at times. This is also the reason I can't really focus or pay attention at church.) I tried explaining to my mom that if we went to a more modern church, that had more interactions and was more engaging, that it may help me enjoy church more. (Even though I still feel like I don't believe in Christianity either way.) She simply replied that this is the church she has been going to for her entire life and that she didn't really want to change it. My grandmother is disappointed in me. She said she missed me at church. My whole family is christian on my mom's side. (Which is the side I'm close with.) The only people that really understand are my dad, who is atheist and doesn't go to church (because he is an adult), and my sister who is also atheist but I think she's really only told me for now. My dad says there is no right or wrong decision to make and either one my sister and I make, someone will get upset.

I really liked it."" (WTF). When I say I like a movie (I don't even recommend it), oftentimes she will watch it as well. When we FaceTime, it's like 7 hours at a time.

580,"So my sister’s 9 years old (I’m 14) and she really likes talking about sex? And women’s breasts? And she pretends to orgasm? And it just makes me so uncomfortable. 
The thing is, I don’t really identify as a female (but that’s a whole other thing) and I have this weird issue where I don’t really function right when people mention “biological female issues.” And especially when they’re specifically talking about me. So like my sister likes talking about my breasts? And I like just can’t. It gives me gender dysphoria. And so basically that causes me to respond casually like I don’t care, but I can’t respond any other way. Like I literally can’t control what I’m doing when she talks about this stuff. So I can’t talk to her about it and say that it’s wrong.
And another thing is that I have a brother who’s 8 years old and my sister’s being a really bad influence and now he thinks that it’s okay to say that stuff too (in a somewhat rude manner) 
I don’t know what to do. It has caused me to self harm and stuff and I also don’t want my brother to think that this is all okay. I also don’t have a close relationship with my parents so I don’t think I’ll be able to tell them. 
Idk I just need advice.",11Aug2019,0

585,"I need some advice how to handle things at this moment. So long story short; i broke up with my ex girlfriend afther 7 years. Moved out of my parents house and started living on my own after we broke up. While this was going on i met a girl and fell deeply in love with her. Yes i cheated on my ex with a kiss. The day after we i told her we couldnt be toghether anymore.

So time went on with this new girl. I was never been so happy in my life before when i was with her. Things were great, i felt complete i love her with whole my heart. Afther 2 months we got in a relationship. Things were great, went on trips, took a small vacation, we had a great time. 

Then things changed, she told me she needs more time on her own to work things out. We saw eachother less and less. Eventualy we saw eachother only the weekends. 

After 7 months in a relation with her she broke up with me. She needed time for herself and dont know if this is what she realy wants. The night she told me that, i was crushed. She still wants to see me once in a while, still have the keys of her house and some clothes are there from me. 

Its been now 3 weeks since the break and im a mess. Got to the dokter for help, started drinking and smoking weed every day to feel numb. The dokter sended me to a clinic to get help. I have a appointment in 2 weeks. Work sended me home for a week because i couldnt function anymore. I dont know how to be alone. My house doesnt feel like a home. Suicidal toughts are spinning through my head. 


In a couple hours im going to her place. I dont know what to do with this. 

I love her so much, she made my life so much better. We were so happy together. She was i dont know how to say this but like jumping trough her house of happyness and now its all gone.

587,"It has been about a month when my mom told me that she was thinking about divorce because she wasn’t happy and they were fighting over everything, and I totally support her decision and I already told her that.

I’ve already seen this coming but I didn’t want to believe, it’s hard to think that their marriage is falling apart, and I can’t even think myself choosing who I will live with and probably not living at the same house as my brother.

My brother is only 9 y.o and he probably doesn’t understand what is really happening, but besides me(who is actually 14 y.o), I can’t live a day without thinking about the divorce, moving to another state(my mom told me if she got divorced she would live in another state and my father too), going to a new school and probably losing my friends.

I really want to stop thinking everyday or just stop crying when I think deeply about this situation. I just want to be as happy as I can and enjoy their company.

588,"So, to begin with, I'll give a little background information. I've moved and traveled around a lot, and have had experience with different cultures around the world. I was born in a South American country, but moved to North America when I was very young (my parents are Latino). I lived there for 11 years of my early life, but moved back to South America for 7 years due to my father's job (his job requires him to travel a lot so moving back would be easier since he caters to South American countries for his profession). Recently, about two months ago, I (F18) moved back to North America to start university, and during summer vacation I met a guy (M19) and we hit it off well. We started dating and have been together for about a month and a half now, but recently we've been experiencing a lot of issues within our relationship. These issues mainly revolve around me crossing the line with what is socially normal and what isn't. Yesterday was our biggest fight with regards to cultural differences.

Yesterday, I got off of work and went to get food with one of my male coworkers at a casual restaurant that's situated right beside my workplace. We ate some food, my mom picked us both up and dropped him off at his house, and that was the end of that. To provide some context, this male coworker did express interest in me when I first started working there, but I told him I had a boyfriend and he's respected that ever since. He's around my age and since I'm new to the country, I expressed to him that I only wanted to remain friends and he accepted. Anyway, after grabbing dinner with my coworker, my boyfriend called me and asked me what I did throughout the day. I told him about work and about grabbing a bite to eat with my coworker and he quickly started to questions who I went with and where we went. I told him, and he just replied with ""okay."" Later that day after getting back from the gym, my boyfriend showed up at my house, clearly distressed and started telling me that what I did is inappropriate here in North America and to go out to dinner with another male that isn't my boyfriend is unacceptable. He told me that whenever a girl goes out to dinner with a guy, it's almost always considered a date. After a few minutes of telling me how unacceptable and inappropriate it is for a taken girl to go to dinner with another guy, he said to me that there are almost no guys here that would accept their girlfriend's doing what I had done. I kept silent the whole conversation and listened mostly to what he had to say. I feel like he doesn't trust me and that he feels like I'm going to cheat on him because he stated, ""I want to believe you when you say you love me and that I'm the only one you love, but your actions contradict what you say to me."" He also kept asking me if I wanted to see other men since ""that's what it seems like you want through your actions.""

Overall, I'm really confused because I don't know if I'm in the wrong or if he's being jealous and overly controlling. He did want to place a rule about ""no prolonged touching"" since he knows I like to hug people a lot. I've asked all of my friends about their opinion and they've all seemed to agree with the fact that he doesn't trust me and that he's trying to control me. I'm Hispanic/Latina so it's normal for me to be friendly and to not read too deeply into actions. In South America, hugging people and kissing people on the cheek is normal. Men and women go out together all the time, regardless if they're in a relationship or not. But apparently here, men and women don't mix into friendly interactions so lightly as they would in South America.  Please help me figure out a solution to this problem! Am I in the wrong for being too friendly and warm to people? Is it really a cultural difference or is he just being too jealous? Was it wrong for me to grab dinner with my male coworker?

TLDR; my boyfriend got mad at me for grabbing a bite with a male coworker. He states that it's not normal in North America and that it's different from where I grew up in South America. I don't know if its really cultural differences or if he's just being controlling.",11Aug2019,1
590,"Bf and I left for a week long vacation. We get back tomorrow. 

A friend who is having severe mental problems and was in jail for assaulting his parents got out of jail yesterday. We didn't answer his calls and want nothing to do with him. 

We woke up this morning to a voicemail of him saying he broke into our apartment and stayed the night. 

Bf called the police but couldn't do a report since we are not there to sign for it. We had a friend go over and there are no damages, nothing stolen, and no evidence of a break in (he exploited our window ac unit to get in somehow). She sent us pictures and all we see is a mess but everything's there. She secured the place. 

Bf and I obviously feel very uncomfortable. He wants to press charges. He also wants to call our landlord so she can make the report right now instead of waiting for tomorrow when we are home. I am against this. We are on a month to month lease and I don't want to give my landlord a reason to end our agreement, especially when nothing was broken or stolen and I consider it relatively low priority.

591,"*This is a throwaway account*

I (15f) am constantly caught in between fights in my family. 

I have a younger brother (11), diagnosed with ADHD (has been placed on medication) , who drives our family crazy. 

We adopted him at an extremely young age, and are not sure if his behavior has something to die with the way he developed in the womb. 

Both of my parents are teachers and are both very well equipped on dealing with kids. My mother even works with special-needs kids and knows how to work with them. But it seems like my brother is a different story.

He constantly disobeys my parents, screams when things don’t go his way, and often goes to bed either crying or screaming. Recently, it’s gotten worse. 

Example: my mother told him to clean his room. He screamed at her to get out, so she did. She then proceeded to hide his Nintendo Switch and his phone, until he agreed to clean his room. This did not work. My brother fought even harder, resulting in my mother “throwing his switch into the garbage”, sending my brother into a fit of rage.  He tries to hit both me and my mother, then screams and cries when my mother yells/spanks him. 

He has said numerous times that he doesn’t want to be part of this family anymore, and that he hates all of us. He threatens to run away, calls the police, and numerous other empty threats that we are tired of. 

It’s summer vacation, and we are worried about him entering middle school. 

Every method of punishment we’ve tried doesn’t seem to work. 

We are all tired and helpless, and have no idea how to handle him. It’s like he’s an insane asylum patient: normal one moment, then throwing toys and screaming the next. We may have to put him on a new type of medication, because he one he is on right now is proving ineffective. 

We don’t know whether we need to get him tested for other mental disorders, we don’t know if it’s just hormones. 

We just want him back to normal. Any advice would be extremely helpful.",11Aug2019,1

594,My class just ended so I was going to ask them to remove my stuff. Would my data just stay there even though my class ended? Makes me feel weird honestly,11Aug2019,1
595,"About six years ago I moved from my small town to the city to study at university. I've lived in rented apartments with other students or workers and I've eaten my meals in the university canteen, occasionally cooking for myself at home. I've learned basic domestic skills, cleaning, shopping, some cooking and doing the laundry. My mother paid my rent and I also had a scholarship. The first three years I moved around using public transport then I got a used car and learned to drive around the city.

I have an aunt who lives in this city and when I moved there she contacted me often, inviting me for dinner and insisting on bringing me groceries (mainly milk, biscuits and bottled water) or giving me pocket money. I accepted because she insisted and I didn't want to seem impolite, but to be honest, these 'gifts' weren't always worth the trouble...she would call me repeatedly to tell me she was going to give me some money as soon as she had her wages, then make me get two buses to get to her workplace the other side of town to give it to me. Sometimes she would call me to say that she couldn't give me the money that month, making me feel as if I had asked for it. In the end I had to tell her straight out that I didn't need any money and that it wasn't necessary for her to bring me any groceries.

She also organized a few events in which she had me play the piano, which is not bad as I would make 80/100 euros but she was a bit 'controlling' about it, posting photos and videos on facebook, making it seem that she was 'taking care of my artistic career'. 

After a while I started declining my aunt's invitations and making excuses for not playing at her and her partner's events. He is an asshole. Typical 'alpha male' who constantly tests your intellectual abilities and manliness, and finds any reason to make you feel like shit. He's also two faced. When we were alone he would make snide comments about me 'eating for free' at their house or taking advantage of having free car rides. I practically haven't had anything to do with them, except for family events or holidays, for a year and a half. 

In my home town everyone knows me as an accomplished pianist. Recently my mother found out that my aunt's partner has been telling people that my aunt has been 'looking after' me while I was in the city, as I have autism, and that she's like a second mother to me. 

My mother is shocked and disgusted. Now, I show signs of being in the spectrum, and maybe I even told them I probably have aspergers. I am quiet, reserved, weird, but also have musical intelligence.

But you can't go around telling people that I have autism and that my aunt has done a lot for me when it's not true. How does that make me look? It sounds as if I can't even do the laundry or cook for myself. Or even make decisions about my studies or my career.

On the surface these people are all 'I love you' but I realise that I have been part of a manipulation process in which they wanted to make it look as if they were taking care of me. Now I realise why they downgraded the prestigious opera theatre where I found myself a job as an extra, or why they talked bad of my piano teacher who had me play at his concerts to give me experience and visibility. They want to be the only ones to thank for my success. 

 What should I do? Should I write a public Facebook post telling the truth? What should I write?",11Aug2019,1
596,"My wife and I have an amazing opportunity to live in my parents house while they are out of the country for 18 months rent free. This is amazing because it gives my wife a chance to go to school while I work full time. My parents don’t drink alcohol and told us that while they are gone we are not to bring any alcohol in the house or we will have to find a new place. My parents are very religious and don’t drink and I was brought up the same way. I’m not as religious but I still don’t drink because I just don’t like it and I don’t enjoy being around it either, so this rule is not a big deal for me. For some strange reason, it is to my wife. She flipped out when I told her and is already looking for a new place to live and said she will quit school and go back to working because of this. She told me she doesn’t like to be threatened and won’t live in a place where she has to stand by any rules set by others. Again, I’ll happily abide by this rule because we could use the help. This could help us to save enough to put a down payment on our own home soon. I need as much advice as i can get.",11Aug2019,1
597,"So, I have some pretty rough life circumstances, and right now I'm at a loss for what to do and things feel really hopeless. But I *know* there are people out there who have had it worse than me and somehow managed to raise themselves up from it and attain some level of self-sufficiency and success in life.

My circumstances are that I am a 24F in the U.S.A (currently Alabama) whose parents passed away when I was 18, right after I graduated high school. None of my blood relatives could have given less of a crap, then or now, and left me entirely alone. Since then, I've spent the last 6 years moving from place to place with different people I've gotten involved with, some dating, and a few random people who offered to house me from on here or other social sites. But none of those living situations have ever lasted more than a year or so. 

In my current situation, I'm sharing a room with an ex-boyfriend who wants me gone by the time our lease is up (July 2020). However, I have suspicions that he and our other roommate are probably going to ditch our apartment before then, so I'm not sure exactly how much time I really have to find a new situation.

I don't have a car, and the retail/food service industry really just isn't for me. I work it part-time out of necessity, but I could never handle 3-4 retail/food jobs in order to be financially independent. It would just be a never-ending dead-end sort of deal anyway, and I really want to move forward in life somehow, in spite of my circumstances and some various mistakes I've made over the years. I always got A's and B's in school, so I'd like to think I'm capable of more than those minimum-wage jobs.

None of my friends or anyone I know is able to help me, and I really hesitate to ask for help on Reddit or anywhere else again, because I've always had *really bad* situations happen from dealing with random people who offered help. I ended up in a homeless shelter with a broken arm the first time, got molested the second, ended up with some really irresponsible people who couldn't handle their parts of the bills the third time, so... yeah.

So far, here are 2 options I'm considering:

A) Attend a University and work towards a degree and live in the dorms.

However, the issue with this is that I've heard that college these days is like a financial trap... people close to me have said that they ended up in massive debt and had to drop out before they finished because they couldn't take on any more student loans, and they didn't even stay in a dorm...

B) Be employed by the trucking company C.R England

C.R England, from when I last checked, is a trucking company that offers free CDL training and job placement in their company, as well as housing during training and the year-long employment contract you get with them. However, there are countless reviews of them treating their employees terribly, and of employees being molested and having issues with the other drivers you have to pair up with during work. (All year, you're forced to drive as a team with random people) As a 24F in the trucking industry, especially a ""shady"" company like that, I'm pretty much 100% convinced I'd get assaulted, so this is mostly a ""last resort to avoid homelessness"" sort of thing.

Other than that, I'm totally at a loss. I'd like to be financially independent, but I don't have it in me to work 2-4 retail/food service jobs, I can't really even handle one full-time. (I'm certain I could handle a full-time job in literally any other industry where it isn't on your feet 8 hours a day and dealing with bullshit 24/7. Unfortunately I have a ton of anxiety and depression from my life, so retail is just too much for me) I just really don't want to be stuck in a dead-end job (or five) forever and never have a chance to improve my life.

I know the situation in our country is absolute garbage right now, so maybe the only answer really is ""suck it up and work yourself to death in retail forever so you can afford somewhere to live and a car."" But I thought maybe, hopefully, there might be things I am overlooking, or maybe people are over-exaggerating about how bad college is? I'm honestly pretty much willing to do/try anything that isn't hard physical labor, or selling my body. Leaving the country is no issue for me, either, if there's some sort of opportunity.

So, that's my situation. If anyone has any ideas whatsoever on what I could possibly do or where I could go that isn't just ""giving up"" and getting several retail jobs to try and live alone, let me know.

TL;DR 24F, parents died when 18, family didn't care and left me out to dry. Currently no car, about to be homeless in less than a year, can't handle full-time retail much less 4 jobs like that, want to try and find some opportunity to improve my situation.",11Aug2019,1

603,"We are surrounded by opportunities for real human connections

Every day, we go through dozens of situations that encourage light, authentic interactions with the people around us.

All these moments when someone is next to you, and YOU feel like you want to interact… but you don’t 

…you are working at coffee shop and there someone next to you. You share a smile, you look at each other a few times, you want to say something… but instead you convince yourself that you are too busy and leave wondering what if…

…you are standing in line, someone in front of you looks cool, you like their vibe, you could give them a compliment but you are not sure, what are they gonna think, whats the point anyway… whatever…

…you go out to a bar to meet people. They are people all around you, you feel tonight could be fun but instead you order a drink and talk to you friends all night…

Opportunities are all around us, but instead of diving into the moment, we hesitate…

We second guess ourselves and overthink our intentions until before we know it, the moment passes us by.

Maybe we make up an excuse why it didn’t happen, or maybe we just accept the fact that we are just not “that kind of person”

Either way, we censor ourselves, a moment here, a moment there, constantly moving further away from the connections we so desperately crave and building comfort on the sidelines of the life we could have.

These interactions could lead to our next friendship, job or romantic encounter but the most important realization is that its not about the outcome, it’s about you.

The real question is who would you be today if you had gone for it even half the time in the last few years? What you lose is not only the moment and the potential connection, but the personal evolution that this moment would have brought you. 

We are so focused on the outcome that we forget the initial intent of expression, the desire to say something, we forget about the process…

I used to judge my interaction on the outcome, I made a friends, I got her number, I went on a date etc… until I realized all this is irrelevant.

The only question that matter is: “Did I express myself or did I censor myself”

Why? 

Because overtime, being committed expressing yourself self-expression will simply give you more experience. 

You’ll be more comfortable expressing your truth, you’ll meet more people, you’ll just have so much more experience which will impact how you relate to people, how you express yourself… which in turn impact your new interactions.

I realized that I should be able to talk to anyone with the same ease and presence I have when I am with my best friends.

All the frictions you can experience are just opportunities to better understand yourself and your perception. 

Interacting with people is first and foremost about you. It’s about expressing yourself, the rest takes care of itself. 

The only thing you need is to let your true self shine through. That’s what people want to see, and it’s the only way find real people to share your life with.",11Aug2019,35

Here's some background so you guys can better understand my situation, I joined a new school in the middle of 7th grade last year, and I barely had enough time to make friends, but somehow i managed to make a cool group of friends, but they aren't me.

We got our class schedules last week and I have 0 classes with my group of friends, but more with my individual ones I made during other classes last year. So, because of the fear that I might be more left out from my group of friends than I already am, I asked one of my closer friends if I could sit with her at lunch for the next school year, mostly because of the fact that I have more classes with her this year, and also because I know majority of her group of friends well.

608,"Hello,

I've got 3 nephew's (and one baby nephew). 2 of the 3 from oldest brother and 1 from second oldest. The oldest brother's kids are around 6-8 and the second oldest ones around 3. They're amazing children. 

My oldest brother's kids are not too active and eat very little except junk food. They eat quite a bit of junk food and don't want anything else. I feel like that's normal for kids but not too sure. I've been a really inactive kid and got very overweight, it's been hell losing the weight and I'm currently at a good point. I don't want my nephew's to go through that kind of thing and I worry they may get bullied at school. I want to try and encourage them to exercise but how does one go about that? I've asked what sports and stuff they like but they just like swimming (I can't swim). I'm gonna try and get them to play tennis with me sometime. 

My second brother's kid's issue isn't really to do with him. My brother and sister in law are spoiling him. He's still a sweet kid but all hell breaks loose when he doesn't get what he wants and he spends so much time playing games on his mother's phone and watching TV it's crazy. Even if there's complete strangers in a room, he won't notice cause he's too sucked into the phone.

610,"So I always read Reddit but this is my first time posting since I don’t have anyone too close I wanted other people’s advice on something.

So my parents died when I was 6  (I’m 27 now)so I had a rough childhood of going back and forth between homes. That’s not the point of this post. My brother and I who is 13 years older than me received social security money. I don’t know how long he received his since he was over 18, but I received monthly checks. After being 14 my brother actually got custody of me and was my guardian. So he was in control of all my social security money etc. He always said he will save it and whenever I need it in life for any emergency or whatever it may be. 

Recently I had to leave the place I’m renting short notice and don’t have really any money saved up and I was recently laid off 1 week before this. So this is what I consider and emergency situation. I asked my brother about that money since I needed it to move ASAP. He told me “what do you mean? I used that money for you when you were living with me. I understand that’s what that money was supposed to be for but he always told me he was saving it for me for the future. He told others this too. It kind of makes me feel like he was saying that so people would tell him what a great guy he is. He was always told how great and caring he was for taking me etc. When I was 16 I got a job and pretty much paid for all my own stuff. Also had to start paying rent when I was 17 so it’s not like he was severely needing that money.  

Whatever I figured ok maybe I’m just being ignorant and I should be able to figure this stuff out without relying on the money I always thought was there for me. I brought this issue up to my cousin who lived with us at that time and his response to the situation hurt. He basically laughed and said do you think anyone cares about you? You’re the only one who will ever be able to care about yourself. Do you think he wasn’t going to spend that money. Me and Robby were spending that money at the bar and going out every month. He didn’t care he thought the extra money was great. We were partying off your money.  He wasn’t trying to be too rude but he was basically trying to make me see not to count on anyone but myself because really nobody cares about you truly but yourself. 

So I just want to know what to do from here? Do you think I should continue having a relationship with my brother? Looking at things now I feel like he could be a narcissist. His whole life people were saying how great he was for the situation he was placed in and how he worked himself out of it. My whole life people were telling me how great Robby is and I should aspire to be like him. I didn’t notice these things at the time but he seemed to eat it up and love all of that kind of attention. Am I overreacting with my feelings of hurt and betrayal just because how I’m in a shitty predicament? Or do I have a legitimate reason to feel betrayed/used.

School starts soon, like in 3 days, and i need some advice on how to make a better, more secure group of friends and stop being as awkward 

Here's some background so you guys can better understand my situation, I joined a new school in the middle of 7th grade last year, and I barely had enough time to make friends, but somehow i managed to make a cool group of friends, but they aren't me. Like i feel like I don't fit in with them well enough. Because of the short amount of time I had to make them I don't have as many friends as I would've liked to.We got our class schedules last week and I have 0 classes with my group of friends, but more with my individual ones I made during other classes last year. So, because of the fear that I might be more left out from my group of friends than I already am, I asked one of my closer friends if I could sit with her at lunch for the next school year, mostly because of the fact that I have more classes with her this year, and also because I know majority of her group of friends well.  I don't want to act like I'm butting into their friend group, but essentially, that's what I want to do. I want to join their friend group, I just don't want to make it as obvious.I'm just fucking nervous.",11Aug2019,1

That being said, I would appreciate any advice on interpersonal communication skills you have used with people like this- for better or worse. Thank you.",11Aug2019,1
616,"Long story short I just moved into a new apartment this weekend. We are on the first floor with an apartment above us. This really was a dream apartment and location for me and my partner. Unfortunately the neighbors above us appear to be a very heavy footed family with at least 1 toddler. There is constant walking and stomping — it really is un-nerving. 

Its especially annoying as we left our old place which was an old building that had terribly noisy neighbors above us (one of the main reasons why we left). Before moving in I did ask the property management team if you could hear walking upstairs and they assured us we would hear nothing. I felt confident as I have lived in newer apartment complexes like this before where you do not hear anything. 

Strangely a friend of mine lives in another first floor apartment and he cannot hear his neighbours. 

We have built a good relationship with the onsite property management team so I’m wondering if it would be rude to mention it so soon after moving in? 

Moving again so soon really isn’t an option with expenses, deposits etc.",11Aug2019,2

I got really annoyed and she and her mother could tell but i ended up being snappy almost the entire game. I feel bad and realized it after the game that I got annoyed by this, but also I really really like her brother, i try to invite him to stuff me and my gf do.

620,"Throwaway.

My ex wife cheated, I confronted her and she essentially told me she didn't want to be a mother anymore and told me to take our child and go.  Our child was just a toddler then.  

Leading up to all that, my ex wife was very abusive to our child both physically and emotionally.  Instead of seeking help for her I wished I would had called the police on her.  

We initially had a 50/50 split but she wanted to let me know that she could still abuse our kid and it would stop if I ceased seeking any past, current and future child support.  So we agreed that I would gain full physical custody in exchange that I never seek child support.  She told me that if I ever seeked child support, she would strip our child away from me and she would send our child to be raised by her family.  

I never once forced her to be a mom.  She chose on her own to have our child.  She essentially chose for me to become a dad.  It was a rough road for my child and I.  It was a long and brutal picking up the pieces and trying to recover.  

My child was struggling severely emotionally, developmentally and in school.  Over the course of 10 years...I worked super hard on him to get him back on track and by high school, he became a straight A student.  

Now, my child's mother wants back in the picture and I am very hostile towards her over it.  She was so destructive towards our child that I still remember her screaming at our then toddler to ""go off and die,"" as it was yesterday   She has zero remorse for what she did, zero admission of any wrong doing.  Our child used to urinate in his pants at the site of her, scream and cry and I remember it like it was just yesterday. 

Pretty much the closest thing to her admitting any wrong doing is her saying that she ""found"" Jesus and everything is up to him.

628,"Hi everyone, I need some advice on my family. I want to know if I am the problem. I will try to say everything so both sides can be heard as best as possible.

I will also delete this post soon because there will be personal stuff in here I don’t want out there.


So, yesterday my mom went to the hospital (it was nothing. She is fine). She went to the hospital and no one told me. When I asked my dad why no one told me he said it was because I am emotional. I was so pissed off on the inside. Me emotional? This guy cries and complains and yells about everything when he doesn’t get his way.

I went to my room and was pissed off and made a post yesterday about it. I was so upset. Bad things just keep happening to me and I just feel like I am 100% the problem. 

Yes, I do get emotional, I won’t deny that. But to me, I think I have every right to be emotional. My whole life, I have dealt with abuse. My dad beat me, my mom, my sister, my brother, even my grandma. He is just a monster and I will never forgive him for making me go through that. I have told no one this ever in my life. This is the first time me saying this to anyone. 

So now I am older (20 M) and have a mind of my own. I do get emotional but I also have poured my heart and soul into this family. My parents own a restaurant and have made me work there since I was 13. I had to work harder than anyone else because I was the owners son. My sister got to stay at home and do nothing for her whole life. She has rarely worked a day in her life. The one day she did work, she was with me. She literally just sat on the table and I had to do her job (which was to clean the tables). We were not even there for an hour at that point. 

At the age of 15 or 16, I developed back problems due to my parents. My dad forced me to carry an extreme amount of packages and all that and they were really heavy for me. I just couldn’t handle it and by the end I heard a click in my back and fell straight to the floor. Now, I have back problems for the rest of my life and everyone blames it on me. Saying I shouldn’t have done it when I had no choice.

I also am going for a degree I don’t want. Having to take classes I don’t want to take because my dad is forcing me to do so.

So all that makes me a emotional. I think I am allowed to. I honestly feel done with my family. They have used me my whole life and are not appreciative. My dad is so emotional, more than anyone I have ever met, and he gets praise just because he is the dad. He abused all of us and now people are praising him. In my opinion, that is complete bs.

I know this is as 50-50 as I wanted it to be what do you all think. I think I am the problem but am I?",11Aug2019,1

630,"So, to start off, after having coffee with a friend who had gone abroad to study and had just finished their first year of uni in the Netherlands, I realized that, after hearing their interesting stories, and their description of how well uni was going for them and how interesting their course was, I realized that I had almost nothing good to say about my first year of uni in Slovenia. I've been having a lot of doubts about my course/uni choice months before this and am now heavily considering switching.

I'm a 19M Macedonian and have been studying a ""two-disciplinary"" course of ""English and Japanese studies"" in the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.  
I've been considering posting a thread on here for a couple of months now as my doubts have grown stronger.  
I've passed 4 out of 10 subjects and the exams for the rest are coming up this month and at the start of September.

Initially when i was trying to decide on a uni I came across Slovenia and found out that tuition was free for Ex-Yugoslav countries (in my case N. Macedonia), and decided that I would apply there.  
My main reasons were because since N. Macedonia isn't in the EU, tuition prices are super high for us, and that if I graduated in Slovenia, I would gain, what everyone here called ""a European diploma"". My family is relatively well off, so I could afford paying for tuition that ranges around 3000 euros I suppose? But after doing research when I was looking for unis ( of which I admit i could have devoted more time into), from the ones I saw I got heavily discouraged because the tuition prices were extremely expensive. Honestly Slovenia wasn't my first choice, and neither were English and Japanese, but at the time it seemed like a good idea. I eventually chose to study English and Japanese through process of elimination as I was either not interested in the other courses or the ones I was considering (Psychology and Film) required fluency in Slovene, of which I do not have. I ended up choosing English because ever since I can remember I've seen it as a ""second mother tongue"" and have always gotten compliments and encouragement about my knowledge and fluency of the language compared to everyone else, and my parents even more so pushing me to, as they claim, ""continue what I'm good at"", which led me to definitely choose it. As for Japanese, I thought that it would be a good idea to take another language as that would give me more flexibility after I graduate, and I'd always found the language to be really interesting.  
However, I've passed the only subject where we study Japanese and most of the English literature subjects and have yet to pass all of my English grammar subjects.  
As the year went by I realized that I was enjoying Japanese but I was mostly trudging along with English, only enjoying the literature subjects.

I've voiced my doubts with my parents but they just keep telling me that it's inevitable that I'd have some subjects I disliked and that it'd be best if I continued with this course for now.  
And this is partially the reason why I'm so torn, I could continue and force myself through the next (hopefully) 2 years and get my diploma, or switch to a university with a course I actually enjoy (I've been heavily considering psychology or film).  
I've asked myself multiple times if I enjoy English, and it feels like i really don't. It could be because I still haven't passed any of the grammar subjects, but I don't know, I feel really lost.  
And if anyone is curious as to why I didn't choose to study in my home country, it's because the education there is lackluster to bad.

Also I'm using a throwaway because I honestly feel somewhat shameful because I was so motivated to go study abroad and now that I am, I'm considering going somewhere else, and that some of my friends frequent Reddit.

  
I feel really lost right now and any sort of advice or different perspectives would be a great help!  
Sorry if anything I wrote isn't very concise or is really wordy. I'd also be happy to give any extra needed info!  
Thanks so much in advance!",11Aug2019,1
631,"Hi everyone. Today I want to talk about my house. So, I live in two separate homes. My dad's most of the time and I go to my mom's during vacations. My parents aren't divorced, but my dad and I are trying to get a Canadian citizenship so my mom can get one too, but my mom did her residency in the US.

Back to the topic. Neither moms house, or my dad's house really look nice. My dad is OBSESSED with buying things used, to the point where all of our furniture is thrifted. I understand that my dad doesn't make a lot, but I don't understand why he has to buy a ripped and falling apart couch for 20 dollars, when he can buy a 100 dollar couch that looks nice and lasts long! He refuses to decorate the house with anything other than antiques, even though I've tried to buy some things myself to make the house look nice. The house is full of un-matching and old looking items my dad got for cheap.

When it comes to my mom's house, she deliberately chooses not to make the house look nice. She has money, she's a doctor. She doesn't even want to paint my room, or help me bring the mirror she bought for me up to my room. Our  house is just leftover stuff she puts in places. She doesn't even TRY to make it look nice, I have to help her. 

The worst part about all of this, is that I feel really guilty for feeling this way. My parents try their best. My mom get's really lonely when my dad and I aren't around, and my dad has a hard time running a business and supporting me by himself. My parents put food on the table, a roof over my head, and clothes on my back. But I go to a private school, and I feel so underwhelmed by my home when everyone else's house looks straight out of an IKEA catalog, and mine just looks and poorly put-together.

I take that as “I like you, but I’d never want to be with you”

644,"I've been wanting to visit this former teacher/mentor who had such an impact to me. Brief story time:

I was this shy, awkward transferee back in high school. Gets good grades but only studies because her parents told her so. I had this teacher---strict, intimidating, competent, very smart. Everyone looks up to her because she's one of the best (if not the best) teacher/s in the campus. (No shit. She really is.) She has high standards, hasn't given an A to any student in her entire career. So yeah, I was still the same, I did school works as an act of compliance. Now, to my surprise, this teacher started complimenting me, saying that I'm good in her subject and all, even to her co-teachers. Knowing her by the words of many, she wouldn't just go around saying something if she didn't mean it. She is the best in her craft and she knows it, so it's a huge thing to hear that coming from her. It felt awkward and touching to my part. It's a first for me to hear such compliment without the person needing something in return. Plus it came from someone who has established her name and is excellent in her calling. I myself didn't even believe in me and the things I could do. I felt honored, appreciated, and validated. 

This then drove me to strive hard in school. The next thing I knew, I got straight As in her subject, which shook the hell out of everyone including me. She never gave an A. Ever. Students from other levels started to know me as the kid who got As in this teacher's class. A friend from other class even said that this teacher brings up my name whenever they talk about excellent academic performance, same thing was told by a senior schoolmate. It was extremely awkward, I can't deal with too much compliments and people caring about and appreciating what I do, but I felt sincerely grateful to her since she also brought out my other potentials in different fields. This went on for the next year. I graduated high school with the highest honors.

Here's what stopping me though: I'm a fresh college grad now and is currently unemployed. My mentor and I aren't really close and I'm awkward around people. My college life was pretty bland, yes I got in to this premier uni but I didn't excel so much in it (I was lost and had mild anxiety) and I had no organizations, so there's literally nothing to share. 

Should I visit her still?",11Aug2019,1
645,"A bit if back story, me and my family always fight there wasn't a time I remember after I became12 that a month went without us fighting.

There are alot of reasons that caused the fighting, bad grades, talking back, not wanting to study, being a delinquent.

But the biggest reason is my over the top passion over electronics, it used to be tame at first watching alot of TV, playing alot with that hand held game that you could raise a pet, and occasionally sitting a bit over 2 hours on the pc.

Things escalated in the next 3 years, after I discovered website games, Minecraft and Terraria, I used to come back from school and hop on the pc and play it till night, not doing my home work and only studying before the exam.

But this year I was able to control myself better, but I still played video games alot.

Also this was the same year that I decided that I wanted to study electronic engineering and codeing.

After deciding what I wanted to study I talked to my father to change my school so I can roll in a technology course, and that when shit hit the fan for my father he got mad because I wanted to change schools and go to this course because he thinks it won't help me and I won't be able to get into a collage, but after 3 months of conversation be between me him and the school he was willing to enroll me in the school that I chose, but he didn't really accept it.

I finished the entrance exams and get accepted with 19 (there was like 120people who enrolled so it's a big thing that I got accepted) but my father still talked about how he still doesn't accept it but I still do what I want and never listen to him.

After a while of me working in his work place and every week getting talked to because I never do what he wants summer almost finished and I'm taking these last 10 days as a break for myself.
Today I woke up super early at around 6 I cleaned around the house, then I sat yo use the pc at 10, when he opened the door and saw me using the pc, he then got mad and warned me to not use the pc, i thought that it was annoying but listened to him, then at 6 pm I opened the pc to save a document on Google docs so I could edit it on my phone, and that's when he entered again (fuck my luck) and got mad and I mean MAD.

He started screaming and cussing me, I tried to reason with him and tell him what I was doing but he didn't listen to me, and told me ""it's either me or that box"" and because I need the pc for my school, I told him this ""this already happened before, I chose you then used the pc after 2 months, and you screamed at me because I chose it over you, so whatever I chose you'll be mad because I need the pc to study in like 3 weeks"" and we dropped it at that, then we had some minor talks while we were out of the house, the last conversation we had was in the restaurant that I'm in right now, the outcome was

His side: that he didn't want me to call him dad and that he doesn't want to talk to him 

My side: I'll one day get the right to call him dad and I want him to wait for it 

Now im going to change my life style to be more productive and please him, but I don't know how.

What should I do with him.
How can I stop that I do that annoys him.
How can I change my life to the better.

I'm stuck and I don't know how to get out, I know what out come I want but I don't know how to get it.

Can someone please help me?

So I noticed that whenever Jen needs help or favors, she never asks me, or attempts to approach me. Instead if she needs favors, she will get my mother to ask me. Same goes with my brother Rob, he never approaches me to ask for favors when he needs it, always goes to my mother and then i have to hear my mother say, ""Rob wanted to know if you can babysit his dog this weekend"" ""Jen wanted to know if you can pick her up from this place on this date"". And just last week, my brother calls my mother to ask how the dog is doing, but my mother isn't even taking care of the dog, I am the one taking care of the dog, feeding it, walking it, and he knows this, but he doesn't call me a single time to ask how the dog is doing.

I find it really weird that they wouldn't just call me and ask me themselves.  I feel like they don't like me and are trying to avoid me. It really bothers me and makes me feel really awkward when I do them favors because they aren't really asking me directly. I don't know what I should do, should I stop doing them favors?",11Aug2019,1

654,"I'm looking for an apartment as my current lease ends soon. The cost of renting in my city is insane and it's a full blown fight to the death to find a decent home with decent roommates for a decent price. Last week though (Friday the 2nd) I toured a great apartment that had some great girls living in it. I usually feel really shy around new people but I just really enjoyed talking with them and felt totally at ease, plus the apartment was wonderful and the price is unbelievable for where I live. I thought our conversation went really well and I felt good about it. Anyways, they told me they would get back to me by the 15th at the very latest with a decision. That's a few days away and I still haven't heard anything yet, but I just saw that they put a new ad up on Craigslist with more information so obviously they're still looking for more candidates. I don't know if that's because they totally ruled out everyone who responded to the first ad (including me) or if they're just trying to expand their pool. I'm really stressed about this because I have no idea how seriously I need to be looking for other apartments. I toured another place that looked good but its more expensive and I didnt like as much  I am not sure I should put in an offer in for it if I'm still waiting to hear from the other girls--- although as time passes I'm feeling more and more discouraged that they wanted me.

I was thinking about reaching out and sending this text: ""Hey! This is X, I came by last Friday. I know it's still a little earlier than we said but I was wondering if you had made any decisions on the room yet. Just trying to get a better idea of my options! Let me know if you need anything else from me.
Thanks so much!""

What are your thoughts on this? I figure it couldn't hurt. If they ignore it or let me know they're looking for other people, then I know I can cross that place off my list and seriously consider other options. If they respond positively I'll know there's some hope",11Aug2019,1

660,"This is going to be a pretty long post but it's necessary for context.

I'm 23F (almost 24) and before this comes up, I can't afford therapy at the moment. I feel like I always have this vision of myself as a completely upgraded model. A much better version of myself. I think of how to get there and I feel relieved. Then I start thinking about how to bridge the gap between the current me and the person I want to be and I just feel hopeless, like no matter what I do I can never escape what might just be inherently who I am.

I think a lot of what's lacking in my personality and character stems from my childhood and I hold some resentment towards my parents because of it. My father was physically abusive under the guise of discipline. Devoutly christian and very controlling, we used to get beaten with a wooden spoon or a belt and have our ears twisted. If it wasn't physical it was him screaming at us over every little thing. Being scared of my parents definitely contributed to me becoming a compulsive liar. No matter what I never felt good enough to be loved by my parents. My mother was submissive to my dad and I never had a relationship with her. She often pushed his patriarchal views and I felt uncomfortable when I started developing sexual feelings etc. 

Being in this environment pretty much led to really erratic and irrational decisions in my teens. Promiscuity, tattoos, piercings, drugs etc. I ended up in university but went through a rough patch and ended up having to do 2 more years than necessary with a pretty bad track record during those years. When it comes to relationships I've never been able to keep many friendships and after some very bad experiences with men I've decided to take time away from that area of my life. Much of this is my fault and I know that but I feel like at this point I've done so much damage that I don't know how to fix it. 

I also want to mention that while my parents were physically abusive and in a lot of ways emotionally abusive they've also been really great in other ways. They have never kicked me out and they do encourage me, but they also don't know a lot about me and have made certain comments that lead me to believe they are still very judgemental. Im not ungrateful but sometimes I think about how they shaped my childhood and I become angry at them for contributing to my dysfunction. Then it's followed by me feeling guilty for feeling that anger and feeling like I have to take responsibility for my actions alone. 

I want to become this person that I feel like I never will be, I want to have friends, success, a family of my own. But I don't know how to better myself, how to change the parts of myself that I need to change. Where do I start? Im not ready to give up and just be this mediocre person and I don't want to be a victim of my own character. Is this is even worth the fight?",11Aug2019,2

663,"I hope this is the right place to post something like this. If not, please direct me to a more fitting sub. Thanks.

Let me preface this by saying that neither of us want a kid and that **we are very naive, stupid, reckless teenagers who don't know any better.** I am 19, my girlfriend is 17. Last night we made the stupidest decision we've ever made in our entire lives.

I went over to her house. It was the last night I would be seeing each other before I went off to college. It was about two in the morning, her family was home but everyone was asleep and we had sex at least six times for about two hours probably. Bear in mind, it was unprotected and she was not on the pill. Now I know that's already playing with fire, but it gets worse. As we were doing it, we were going for awhile until it was time for me to finish. Now normally I would pull out, I do every time we have sex and all goes just fine. This time was different however, as I deliberately did not pull out because she said she ""wasn't going to stop until she finishes"", so I finished inside of her.

We were in the heat of the moment and were too horny to actually realize what the fuck we were actually doing and how big of a risk we were taking. Immediately after I finished she got off and we checked an app she has on her phone that tells her whether or not she's ovulating... and she **was.** We immediately went into panic mode and rushed to the local pharmacy and grabbed the morning after pill. She took it as soon as we got back (so basically an hour or so after we had sex) and our worries subsided a little until we did some research and found out that basically, if you take the morning after pill while ovulating, that it only temporarily stops ovulation. From what I understand, when a woman isn't ovulating, she has a *low chance* of getting pregnant, but still a chance. So basically, the morning after pill she took isn't going to guarentee a 95% chance that she won't get pregnant like it normally would, rather, it will just temporarily stop her ovulation, leaving us to sit here and hope and pray that nothing happens. She's going to buy an early detection pregnancy test a week from now and another pregnancy test two weeks from now. Until then, all we can do is wait and hope that she isn't.

I'm sorry but I just need to write this down somewhere so that others can learn from people like me. If you are going to have sex, either use protection, make sure whoever you're doing it with is on birth control, or most importantly just do **both.** I swear shitheads like us are the reason people send Planned Parenthood ten bucks a month. If whoever is reading this has anything to say besides how fucking stupid and mindless we are, anything would be appreciated. If anything, I deserve to have a kid after doing something like this, despite **all** of the warnings I have received over the years; friends and family always telling me to wrap up, the warnings of what will happen to *me* if I get a girl pregnant, etc. I owe everybody, even God if you're superstitious, an enormous apology.

I know I'm 19 (pushing 20) with enough (or I guess *some*) maturity, decency and intelligence for my age but I am **not** ready for a kid. I am just not prepared nor mentally in a fit state.

Is there any hope for us at all? Any other recommendations you have to further prevent a pregnancy?",11Aug2019,0

666,"Back story, I began college as a communications major at 18. I failed out and had no interest. I struggled with mental health and had no passion for learning nor the capacity for learning at that time in my life.   
I took 2 years off finding myself and was diagnosed with Bipolar Depression. I am on mood stabilizers and my life has changed for the better. I am much happier and am anxiety-free. It was a tough time and I still at times regret not taking a gap year.   
I am currently at Keiser university doing my undergraduate studying business administration. For some reason, I am still not fulfilled.

For more backstory:

As of right now, I will be 24 on December 8th and have an endless appetite for learning. I read textbooks for fun and enjoy learning new mathematical equations for fun--even so much so that I spent an entire day bewildered over statistical field theory and the unsolved integers in the Pythagorean Theorem. My entire life I have loved Meteorology with everything in me. It is my passion, my obsession, and my dream field. I look at 4 different radars every day and even run a small photography business off pictures of what I call mother natures fury. I sit for hours on my balcony and track thunderstorms. I watch the weather channel every day and have been glued to that channel since I was 4. The fascination was rooted in me in 1998. I was 3-years-old when an EF 2 tornado came over my house. I have vivid memories of seeing golf ball-sized hail and my mother holding me with pillows and blankets in the closet. After that, I was hooked for life. When asked if I could have dinner with someone dead or alive, it would be Jim Cantore. 

I would love to get a degree in meteorology but it had never been offered where I was and I haven’t had the means for relocating. 

Is it too late to begin pursuing a meteorology degree at almost 24 years old?

When he first came, my parents knew and we were all excited to meet him together. I still live at home so my parents' opinion of him mattered to me. My father really likes my boyfriend. Obviously as much as a protective father can possibly like the man her daughter is dating. 

My mother seems to like him when he's around.... except she won't stop sending me articles, videos, news stories, etc of women and young girls who are killed in gruesome deaths by men they met online. Even now, after so long of knowing him, she continues to send me stuff like this even after I keep telling her to stop. We've done a thorough background check on him, I've talked to his family, etc. I know as much as I can about him from where he is. He's never shown any violent tendencies towards me and was open about everything. my mother practically interrogated him in front of my family like she was a detective. Asking for his i.d. and asking me why I don't have his social security number?? 

She keeps telling me I'm stubborn and will have to learn on my own. She tells me she had a dream he was going to kill me. She told me every scary thing she possibly could. Why is she doing this to me...?

Granted, my boyfriend and I have a large age Gap, and I understand to a degree her concern. But clearly I'm smart enough to understand that and I've done countless background checks on him, and everything I find he confirms for me anyway without even knowing I looked him up. He's older, but I'm not all that naive. I would never do anything to put myself in danger. I just feel like it's rude to send so many scary articles to me. What is she trying to say? Can somebody either help me understand or tell me if I'm right for feeling offended? I'm trying to see both sides here.",11Aug2019,1
670,"I am taking a break from dental school, and I am working for a local dentist while I figure things out. I was having serious health issues, so that is why I am taking a break. My boss is a very nice and caring person, but I have an intuitive feeling that he might have feelings for me. I feel like I can do no wrong in his eyes... or if I do something wrong, he is very gentle about it with me compared with my coworkers. He compliments me a lot, but I'm not sure if it's because he feels bad for me with my health situation... maybe he feels the need to build me up? He has said that he wants to hire me to work as a dentist in his practice when I graduate, so maybe he just sees me as a potential career partner? He gets so excited about my future as a dentist... moreso than I even do. One time he joked with me because he found out that I like guys who have a beard. He then said that he used to have a beard and that he can grow one fast. I thought that was an odd comment to make.

Additionally, he seems extremely nervous when I talk to him while he's in his office. He fidgets to the point that I feel anxious. He's just awkward around me at times. But he does not fidget when he is doing our weekly meetings and sits in front of all of us. He once put his hand on my upper back before (not in a creepy way) and he laughs pretty loud at my jokes... even if they aren't good. He constantly tells me about how alike we are (which he is not wrong about) and he gave me two raises during my first year working there... and I know he has never done this for anybody else. I am a good worker, but I still feel like I might be favored a bit. I can't figure out if it's because of my potential to be his business partner in the future, or if he feels bad for me, OR if this is something more. It could ALSO be that he feels bad for me because I was really having a lot of serious health issues that forced me to take a leave from dental school. I've been trying to ignore this for awhile, but I feel like I need answers now.

671,"Hey guys, I don't know who to talk with since most of the people I know are very preoccupied when it comes to my current situation. Obviously this is a throwaway as well as I want to use it to post on offmychest as well and some friends of mine don't need to know about everything.

Around exactly 8 months ago I broke up with my then girlfriend of six years. The main reason was that I wasn't sure if it was the right thing being together and also we had different ideas of relationship to some degree I guess. She cheated on me once, about 3 years ago. It was a messed up situation and she didn't blame it on the alcohol but tried to explain me what was wrong with the relationship and all. I could cope with it for a year, then two. At one point in time it wasn't too relevant anymore and life kept going on.

In some random netflix TV show the topic came up and it basically kicked off a long streak of ""why and how could I even forget what happened and how could I even cope with it?"" in my mind. I've talked about it with a friend of mine who tried to give his best advice and we ended up classifying the relationship existing due to habit. I've tried to talk about that topic with my now ex-girlfriend before as well and we didn't end up having a very productive talk since she is sorry but can't turn back the time. I ended up leaving her since, as I've said, I wasn't sure if it was the right thing and if I could live with her. Now, eight months later, I notice that I'm still missing her. Like a lot. A lot of things I do remind me of her and also a ton of things I see since there were so many ""insiders"" between us.

672,"I met with the owner of a condo yesterday. He told me yesterday, if I wanted the place, it was mine, he just has to do the usual background check and asked for a pay stub to prove how much I make.

I'm fine with all that.

Now, here's where things get dicey. My credit score *blows*. My credit history is only 3 years old, and I have three missed payments (because when I first relocated scores the country four years ago, I'd never owned a credit card, and when I lost my job, I was late on several payments). I don't recall him mentioning anything about credit score, but I feel like it's bound to come up.

Also, on the application he emailed me, one of the questions is whether I've ever been rejected for renting a property. Last year, I went through the same process, but the owner of the condo (I never met her, I went through her realtor) apparently didn't like that I'd had those missed payments in the past, so I didn't get the place.

To my knowledge, there's no documentation of that rejection, since it was all over the phone, but should I be upfront about that? Or would volunteering that information just be shooting myself in the foot?

Also, should I include a letter along with the application, just saying ""I am aware my credit score is a bit lower, but I am very excited about this apartment, and if it would give you more peace of mind, I would be happy to offer two months' rent as a security deposit"" (he's only asking one month rent right now)?

Frankly, I'm in a really bad living situation, and it could become completely unlivable at the drop of a hat. This place is nice, affordable, AND close to my work. We shook on the deal when I was at the apartment, but I'm sure he was unaware just how bad my credit actually is, and just want to do whatever I can to improve my odds of getting the place.

PLEASE offer whatever advice you guys can come up with.",11Aug2019,3

675,"Hey all of r/Advice!

I'm here under a account that's not linked to my real personality as to not link my personal details too much since i am ashamed of this question and know that is probably am looking in the wrong direction.

&amp;#x200B;

I work as a freelance software engineer, of which i work three days at home and two at a office with others.

Like many others with my job, I spend most of the time thinking and figuring out problems. Over the last year I've developed a weird habit to eat stuff like mentos while doing so, as to have something to do with my mouth and play with in my hand. This has been going on for way to long (around 6 rolls per day which comes down to 7,20 euros per day and not healthy at all)

&amp;#x200B;

At the office, many of my coworkers are smoking since that is something what helps them clear their mind, this however is something i don't plan on doing because of the Nicotine addiction aspect and other possible consequences. I've been looking at vaping (without nicotine and some other stuff, just to keep it plain as something to keep me busy rather than filling a addiction) but have worries too about that all tough it does sound nicer.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking you for advice, it can be something small or something i simply didn't think about for long enough or at all.

I don't want yet another addiction, i just don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for reading, take care and have a nice day/night!",11Aug2019,2
678,"2.5 years ago, I fell for a guy who lied to me about having a girlfriend. We hung out for 2 weeks before I found out. The girl was one of my hostel-mates and a fair-weather friend. I should've told her. I didn't because I didn't want to be bothered. (Very asshole-y of me)

I avoided him as much as I possibly could being in the same college. He wouldn't. He'd beg for chances and say, ""I won't go till you come to see me"" or ""She means nothing to me"" or ""I'm never gonna marry her"". I fucked up by listening to him. I thought I should fix him and ended up being attached to what it was doing to me, to the attention (and maybe to him too). This would lead to infuriating conversations about 'wanting him to treat me &amp; her right' or 'if he really liked me, why was he still with her?'.. I'd end up getting hurt and disgusted by his blatant disregard for me, women and people in general.

I realized I was wrong and told him never to contact me again. He still would. The manipulating got worse and it fucked me up. I wanted revenge and I decided on telling the girl for the wrongest reasons. (Extremely asshole-y of me).. I texted her, gradually, asking if she really loved him and reminded her of instances where mutual friends tried warning her of his cheating. I was about to tell her everything but, at that moment, they were together &amp; she was asking for explanations. Before I could tell her, he calls and threatens me that he would ruin my reputation, spread rumors and make it very hard for me. I got scared and didn't tell her everything but I still warned her &amp; asked her to be careful. She still chose to date him.

I blocked him but we'd still run into each other &amp; have same classes. Even after all this, he kept bugging me. He'd smirking-ly ask me what I'm upto. Sometimes, with people around, I'd have to reply. As a result of one such incident, he found me alone, said he wanted to take me out, take me to his farm-house. That felt demeaning and disgusting. He'd keep on doing this till we finished college. It fucked me up too bad. Took me a year and a lot of love and healing from my current boyfriend, to let go, move on and trust people again.

A month ago, I get a call from the girl, telling me they broke-up, asking me what had happened between him and I, accused me of having a fling. I told her everything. Didn't have proof or screenshots so all I could give her as evidence was ask her to recollect how I had acted when he was in the same room, like, I had stopped going to the library, would leave the room if he was around and little things like that. She said she wasn't mad at me, just wants closure. I never wrote back. I'm still hurt and I want to hurt them back.

TL;DR: Guy lied about having a girlfriend, I fell for the lies, told the girl but nothing came out of it.. Years later they break-up and the girl accuses me of having a fling with him. How do I stop feeling vengeful and let go?",11Aug2019,1

686,"I’m 20F and a bad person. I ended up online schooling most of high school and then did my first two college years online. All throughout that time, I cheated on exams and got out of doing things that people my age should experience, whether they like it or not. As a teenager, I made horrible decisions, ones that were highly detrimental to my future. I have never had a proper job and have spent the past five years barely leaving my parent’s house. I can’t drive a car because I am terrified. I’ve been diagnosed with persistent depression and possible ADHD, but that is no excuse for the type of person I am.

There was a guy I liked when I was in high school (before I started online schooling). He was beautiful, smart, had a job, could drive, was independent, and was all around an amazing person. I never spoke to him, but intuitively and by observation, I just knew. He moved abroad, learned a whole new language, got a degree, and I have no idea what he is doing now. I have been obsessed with him, or rather the idea of him, since the first time I saw him six years ago. I know it’s pathetic, but I cannot stop myself from obsessing no matter how hard I try. I literally think about him all day.

My point is, I could never be as amazing as him. I could never measure up to him. He is way out of my league, and I feel physically ill because of it. I want to kill myself because I can’t be like him. I am not smart enough and I have already made huge moral mistakes. I am living my life as though somehow I will see him again, and I want to be able to impress him. I want him to be attracted to me, or I want someone like him to be interested in me. I am a ditzy airhead that cannot contribute intellectually to conversations, I get lost, I can’t remember things, I am a cheater, a lazy loser, and everything in between. I am disgusting, and he is beautiful, he is everything that is beautiful.

691,"17F I used to study in a school that really pushed kids to their limits. We were taught concepts that people three years older than us were learning and had tests every single week. Even though the academic part of it was horrible and made me want to slip into a quick coma, I was always motivated. I studied when I had to and always did my best. The summer after the last year at that school I decided to do absolutely nothing because I thought I deserved it. And I think that's when I sort of became a burn out.
A moved schools and year ago and since then I have zero motivation. I can't bring myself to do things that I very obviously NEED to do. My career depends on how I use my time now but I couldn't care less. It was just such a sudden and drastic shift in attitude. I thought it was just a phase and I would back to normal in a couple of weeks but it's been a year and I still can't bring myself to work towards my goals and even do basic things that are good for me like take a walk or eat a healthy meal. 
I've had about a hundreds spurts of motivation over the past year but they last about five minutes. Recently I've started drinking coffee because without it , I fall asleep three hours after I wake up in the morning.

TL;DR
I left a school that pushed my limits constantly a year ago and since then, I've lost the will to work hard. I used to be a pretty hardworking and motivated kid but now I've just run out of shits to give and I don't know why.

694,"I'm a 43 year old male. My life is basically over. I never once held a job. I have no social skills or life skills that will help me. I also have autism.  I always remember my two bullies from high school getting frustrated with the fact that I didn't want to commit suicide. They would say things like ""No one is going to care if he dies so why does he keep on living?"". Sometimes the kids that spread rumors about me would ask me if I thought life was a game. I would shake my head no. Then they would say "" Say something you mute, you have a mouth for a reason,"".  They were right I wasn't mute I could actually talk. I also remember other people touching me in private areas. I would turn around to see who it was, but all I saw was a group of guys laughing. 

 Then one day they went too far. One day I went to gym class. I got changed into my gym clothes in the locker room, and when I came back to the locker room I couldn't find my clothes. So I went to guy who I suspected hid my stuff. His name was Cory. Cory said to me ""I don't have it, get lost you filthy mute,"". So that's when I snapped and yelled at him "" Give it back now!!!"". I grabbed him by the collar. Then all of sudden he punched me in the chin and I got knocked out. When I woke up I was naked and only had my underwear on.

697,"This sounds pretty petty in terms of most of the questions here, but it's something I constantly struggle with and have yet to find a solution or any words that stick with me on it.

Every time I play competitive games with friends, I can't help but feel singled out or victimized when something happens to me. Like, for example, when playing games like Smash Brothers or tabletop games like Settlers of Catan, when I am targeted by someone else for something that's just part of the game, I take it personally.

My logical brain knows that it's part of the game and everyone wants to have fun, but the ""in the moment"" brain just feels like I'm being singled out for some perceived weakness and zeroed in on. This, in turn, leads me to feel like I'm letting down the other teammates or the friends I'm playing with are judging me for my performance and, while I know that's not true, I can never shake that feeling.

Pros

No time will be wasted
I'll be able to do the other course I want to do sooner
I might make friends
I'll get my diploma I want

Cons

I'm obese and embarrassed

We’ve been broken up since February, but we still do all the relationship stuff i.e. stay the night together during the week, go out together on the weekends, sleep together, talk about the future, always include each other in our plans, etc. like full-on relationship, but not “together”. So here is where it gets super complicated… When we started dating all those moons ago, he told me about a trip he’d been itching to take for years. The trip would be in Asia and he would go for six months. At first, I didn’t think much of it but that he was a guy with ambition, but as the relationship went on I started to realize he was, in fact, going to go on this trip. He never talked to me about it and he didn’t invite me, but I picked up on it when he would talk to his friends about it in front of me, so one day I sat him down and asked him about it. We had been together for a year or more at this point and I needed to know if he was just going to up and leave me for 6 months. During this particular conversation, I asked (basically demanded) that he invite me, which I hated, but he did it. I started saving my money and following traveling pages on Instagram, and even bought a travel backpack, but still, I was noticing that we never really talked about it, which I think is strange, and caused a few arguments… Anyway, in February of this year, I found messages on his phone that clearly stated he had cheated on me, soberly and intentionally with his ex-girlfriend. I was devastated, this is what led to our most recent breakup, but here we are “back together”. So anyway, he has set a date in September to leave for Asia and he won’t be back until April. I, again, am devastated, and without a clue of how to deal with this. I don’t know how to prepare for such a thing. I love him more than anything on this entire planet and I’m going to miss him INCREDIBLY, plus I know he won’t be faithful to me while he’s there, but he will passively expect me to remain loyal for the duration of the trip.

That I'm leaving a really dark period of my life behind for good. It's a big symbol for me of where my life is headed.

713,"i noticed a few months ago while drinking a white sangria that my face started to feel like it was on fire and my face turned all red. and it eventually went away but i thought it was very strange. then a few weeks later the same thing happened with another white sangria at a different restaurant. after a few sips my face felt heavy and burning and i already felt drunk after like three sips (and i wasn’t drugged because some of the drinks i’m about to list i had at home). then another few weeks i did a vegas bomb and the same thing happened. few weeks later i got some drink with gin mixed with some citrus mix or liquor and it happened AGAIN after only a few sips. then i had a margarita and the same thing happened. it only happens with certain drinks. i’ve noticed that wine doesn’t bother me, neither does gin and tonic, vodka, nor tequila. but there has to be a common denominator with the previous mixed drinks listed above. i thought it was peach schnapps or triple sec but i’m not sure now because that gin drink didn’t have either in it.",11Aug2019,0

715,"So, I am a nurse and I love my job. But I've come to realise that aside from the chronic understanding, ridiculous paperwork and the total fun of being punched in the face at work, the opportunities for career advancement are either specialising or admin, so I pigeon hole myself or get a desk job at a slightly better rate of pay than I currently have.

My friend works in london and has told me about pharmaceutical medical sales jobs available which i could apply to on a graduate scheme as i am a 2018 graduate. 

My concern is that although i have transferable skills, I've never been in such a competitive environment and an office based job. I am very interested in going for these jobs as they are well paid and have wonderful opportunities.

Does anyone have any tips on the application/interview process?

716,"I couldn't find anything on Reddit about this, I mean I'm sure it's somewhere, but I couldn't find it 😅 

I'm (23M) trying to put myself out there more. As with many people I don't get  out much aside from the usual daily routine. I have a small circle of friends that I really trust and I'm glad they are my friends. The thing is though they can't usually come out with me because of conflicting schedules. I've thought about going out to bars or clubs or something by myself, but in a setting like that it just seems really creepy. I want to know what other people think of that and what I should do. Can I go out by myself? Would that be too weird? Are there specific places that accommodate that better? 

Much appreciated 🙂",11Aug2019,0

718,"Okay I know the answer is about to sound extremely obvious but I just want to get everything out there first.

I am currently in a long term relationship that has lasted 7 years. We live together and I am financially dependent on him while I am in school (I work part time and am in school full time). I pay my car payment, insurance, bills, and for the groceries. He pays for everything else including his car payment, insurance, rent, and anything we buy throughout the month, like if we need shampoo etc. I am dependent because of the living situation. There are no other options in regards to living situations at the moment, as I cannot afford to rent a room and any family members live too far away. 

We have been going through a LOT of rough patches over the past couple of years and I am feeling very uncomfortable and not happy in the relationship. We broke up for two weeks a couple of weeks back, but decided to mend things and try one more time. Things were great for the first week back together, but have gone back to the way they used to be (i.e. he doesn't do anything unless I ask him to, he's glued to his computer the second he wakes up, I don't feel attracted to him anymore, he keeps his stuff extremely dirty/doesn't care about it, he is not the most hygienic person himself). I have to pick things to do over the weekend, even though I have said, multiple times, that I want him to decide, and that it would be nice if I didn't have to make every decision all the time. He then will complain when I do finally make a decision. He refuses to eat healthy and I am genuinely concerned for his health, especially because he is sitting all the time. 

Our goals and aspirations are so mismatched. I feel like he doesn't strive for anything at all in life. 

Again, I know this sounds like ""well duh, leave already"", and I don't really know what I'm asking for here, I guess I just needed to get all of this out to someone. I don't want to vent to my family about relationship stuff because that isn't fair to anyone; he is a good person and doesn't need to be slandered (even though I guess that's what I'm doing here). 

I am thinking of just moving my stuff into the second bedroom and sucking it up for the next 8 months of school.",11Aug2019,2
719,"Now I know it’s really weird to word it that way but I genuinely feel so lost at the moment. So for some context, my dad is 50 years old and was raised within a very sexist and cultish (not as bad as I’m making it sound) religion until he decided he couldn’t be baptized his family always treated him as the black sheep when he was young  and he’s been with my mom (catholic) for about 30 years. I was raised catholic but religion doesn’t really play into this as much as it sounds. Now when I say I’m not sure if he’s abusive it’s because ever since I was little me and my dad have been like best friends, he always gave me what I wanted, I always tried my best to earn everything I was given and I always told him everything. When I was younger I noticed that my dad was always the one that held the most power in the house, if my dad ever wanted something and my mom said no we’d never take her into account, if my mom said no to us we’d run to our dad to day yes and my mom couldn’t do anything, her
authority wasn’t really real. My dad loves to shower us in gifts and make us feel like we’re so important but sadly that always turns so quickly. Whenever he’s mad at my mom he throws it in her face that he makes the money, he tells her that she’s worthless and my mom just takes it but he’s never hit my mom or threatened it. And when we agree with our mom he becomes angry and says we all just attack him etc and then out of no where the next day takes us to Ulta or buys us gifts etc. My dad is also very prideful and anything could set him off to yell or just become someone so mean and conniving. An example was we’re all on the car and my mom asks where he’s going with no mean intent behind it and he says “you fucking know it all don’t you?” And keep in mind the day was going great nothing could ruin it for us but for some reason that was the trigger. After that he made everyone in the car feel so uncomfortable, he started to act delusional and played the music as loud as possible telling us “if we didn’t like it we could kick rocks,” and overall making us feel so little. Once we tried speaking up saying he was being mean he would say “we didn’t affect him” and that “he’s just being him and you can’t change that” but he just wasn’t. It’s so weird seeing my dad shift from such a good father to someone who is so mean and almost childish. I don’t know if it’s abuse because if it was I know I would have to report it but I don’t think I could let my dad get arrested or taken away from us, cause I care about him so much. He’s such a good dad but can be so evil sometimes. I want to say it’s his Diabetes, he doesn’t take care of himself and his blood sugar is always so high.  I don’t even know how to explain this situation correctly I just feel really awful.",11Aug2019,3
720,"Hey guys,

So I think I really messed up, I'm not sure yet but I think I might be pregnant because my period is 5 days late. I had unprotected sex around the time I was ovulating twice with this man I barely know (stupid af i know I'm judging myself). This was about 3 weeks ago and i was supposed to get my period 5 days ago. I talked to this guy for about a month last year and then we stopped talking until this past July. I barely know him but he's shady af. He drinks, smokes weed, has anger issues, and has had problems holding down a job, also he has a lot of family problems which break my heart but also make me feel really overwhelmed as I feel like I won't be able to help him with it. He has also shown himself to be disrespectful to my mom and hes really crude and some of his behavior puts me off ie. impulsiveness, anger, being irresponsible. I don't even think I want to be with him because he gives me a lot of anxiety and I know deep down that he is not the right person for me. I don't have a lot of friends and he's the first guy I ever seriously talked too and he said a lot of the right things and I guess I just got attached to him. I also am very bad at telling people no, standing up for myself, and I have barely any boundaries, and I'm kind of an all or nothing kind of person with no instinct for self preservation I guess. He however is very into me and would want me to move in with him. This also scares me because if I am pregnant I think that he would want to be involved however his life situation is not good for having a kid rn so maybe he would get scared I really don't know what he would do because I barely know him. What I did was really stupid and I realize that and I've cried everyday about it and I'm not much of a crier. My parents are also very strict and religious but I know that they love me and I love them and I'm so scared rn that I want to tell them but I know that it would absolutely break their heart. They didn't approve of me being with him in the first place and this is probably what they wanted me to avoid. I'm so scared to disappoint them like this. I also just turned 20 and this man is almost 30. I won't go into the thought process that led me to get involved with him and have unprotected sex but it was really messed up and I have realized how wrong it is. Part of me wants to keep it a secret from him because I'm not sure if he would be a good dad, I don't really think I want to be with him, and I don't know if I want the child to be around him because of the way he is and the choices he makes, I feel like he would be a bad influence and wouldn't want to compromise or work with me. But then I would be lying and I want to stop lying because it has only ever caused me problems. I don't know how he would react or if he would pressure me into making decisions. Part of me wants to keep it a secret from my parents but I would have to move (I have 2 places I could move to but idk how easy it would be to hide it) and I would miss them and I would feel like I need them to get through this, however I feel like it may destroy my family. I know its my fault and I knew what I was doing so I'm ready to accept the consequences. Part of me thinks my period could be late because I've been really stressed, haven't been eating or sleeping this whole past month. It's been 10 days late before. If I am pregnant tho I don't think that I could have an abortion, part of me wants to but then I would have to live with it and idk if I will be able to handle it. I don't wanna marry him or even be with him I don't think. I don't wanna lie to him or keep him away from the kid but part of me considers it just because I think it may not be a good environment for the kid or me (i know i should've thought about this before i had sex). I also broke up with him yesterday and we haven't talked since and I'm thinking that was maybe a mistake too. I just thought that if I am pregnant and decide to tell him he should know that I'm not 100% sure about him and so far I've kind of been leading him on. I'm just really lost right now. I'm also in college studying a major that I really like and I have good grades and would hate to mess that up.

I guess to sum it up my main questions that I'm struggling with are:

1.) Do I tell him?
2.) Do I tell my parents?
3.) Do I keep it a secret? I think this seems to be the easiest but in reality would be the worst option.

I don't know if I would want to parent it or put it up for adoption. Ideally I think I would put it up for adoption and have the father go along with it but I'm not sure that he will. I feel like he would say that he doesn't want another man raising his child or something like that. But at the same time he has no money or car and he lives with his family right now like 2 hours away from me since he got kicked out of the place he was living at before which was a lot closer to me so maybe he would think he can't be there as a dad. I wouldn't want or need like child support or anything from him. I would move out of my parents house but I don't have enough money and i don't know if I can do it alone.

I know I really messed up and what i did was really really stupid. He is also irresponsible for not using a condom but it takes two and I knew what we were doing and didn't say anything. He did pull out tho. I realize there are consequences to what I did and I just want to deal with them in the best way possible.

I have only told my one friend who told me to keep it a secret from everyone move in with her and she would help me raise it but she also has a problem with alcohol and mental illness and I'm scared that it would be a bad environment for my child and I would not have my family there for me and idk if I can keep it a secret my whole life.

I haven't taken a pregnancy test but I'm really starting to suspect that I'm pregnant. I know that taking the test would be the first step. Should I go visit my friend and take it with her? Should I tell my mom and take it with her? Or should I take it alone? My friend said not to take it alone because it may be to much to deal with.

I know how dumb this all was and how immature and irresponsibly i acted and which ever way this goes I have definitely learned a lot of lessons, hopefully some of you guys have some advice and won't judge me to hard. &lt;3",11Aug2019,1
721,"As title says, idk if this is the kind of question that is acceptable here but im just going to ask anyways. 

Every morning is a fight to actually get out of bed, I wake up feeling like trash and I got to sleep feeling the same ways basically every night, like I've done nothing for my life. I don't know what to do or what do I seek to do with my life, I can't finish projects I start, if I even start them at all. Sometimes I just don't go to work because I just feel so useless I can't even force my eyes open, I just want to sleep the rest of my life. Time flies and everyone is doing something and im not even out of my pijamas. 

I feel like everything I do is useless and meaningless, cutting of communication with basically everyone I know because talking to anyone is so fucking exhausting, I can't keep up, I want to be left alone but being alone is scary and depressing.

If anyone has any advice on how to break this cycle. Please let me know whatever it is, I just want to stop feeling this way",11Aug2019,2
723,"Sup everyone. 19 year old guy here  


Alright, so I don't know how to start this off, so I'm just going to explain the whole thing. I basically matched with this girl on Tinder and shortly after we matched she asked for my snapchat, which I gave her. We didn't really talk a lot on snapchat. I think I just sent her a few snaps, and that was it. After that, we didn't really talk for weeks. But on this friday I happened to get a snap from her, were she asked if I was going out. Now this was a complete suprise for me, as I didn't really remember her, but I later figured out she was from Tinder. 

I live in a rather small city in Sweden and it crosses borders with Norway, where she is from. So, apparently she and her friend had went out here to take some drinks. Now, I didn't know she knew I lived here, but I guess maybe the snap map gave it away? Once I got the message I got really nervous, as it was very unexpected. I replied back by telling her that I might go out and then shortly after that, I asked which bar they were heading to. She told me she didn't know, as this was her first time here. I gave her advice on were they could go, but she then asked me if I wanted to meet up with there. 

Now, I can get nervous around girls, so having to lead the conversation with two females is beyond me. I told her sure, and that I was going to bring a friend with me. She replied by saying that me bringing a friend was perfect, as she had one female friend with her. This made me think of a double date. Now I didn't even have the thought of this being a date, so that made me even more nervous.   


After this I go and meet up with my friend, but as I'm about to meet up with him, I see him talking to someone else. This was a female friend of his that just got off work and then just happened to meet each other. My friend tells her that we're going out and that we're meeting up with two girls. She then, basically invites herself, and says that she wants to come. At this moment I got very sceptical, as I thought it was just going to be me, my friend, her and her friend. But I didn't have the guts to tell her that I didn't want her to tag along. So, she went with us :/ 

We meet up at the bar and introduce ourselves to each other. Now, keep in mind that I had barely talked to this girl beforehand, so it was like talking to her for the first time. I didn't know much about her at all. Anyways, we all talk to each other and what not, but I feel like the girl who tagged along was very talkative, and therefore I didn't get to have a one-on-one conversation with the girl I was supposed to meet. Because of this, it felt more like a hangout between friends, rather than a date. 

Anyways, the night goes on and we go from bar to bar. I bought her a drink, we all danced together. Then we went to get some food together. Now, this girl like to share things. We tasted each others drinks, I took a bite of her chili cheese. I don't know if thats a sign to take in consideration? Like maybe she is comfortable with me? Or maybe she just like to share things, idk.  

Shortly after that we all decided to end the night. We accompany them back to their car, but as we were getting closer, she suddenly puts her arm around my waist, so I then put my arm around her. I then hug her goodbye, but idk if I should have gone for it :// 

When I got home I sent her a snap hoping that they had a good time. She told me that they did, which I then replied by saying that they should come back some time. I might have screwed this up tbh, but I can't stop thinking about the whole  thing and whether or not I should hit her up. The last time we talked was on Friday, the same day we met. I need advice whether or not I should just let this go or try and do something.

I'm curious if anyone has managed transition from being a very creepy, socially awkward, toxic person into something more normal, acceptable, and healthy.

I have a very long history of overstepping people's boundaries and being excessively pushy. I'd pester crushes well after they'd tell me how much they don't like me, take pictures of friends that I thought were acceptable but I'd eventually realize they seemed uncomfortable with, ask friends questions they thought were way too personal and nosy, etc. 

Sometimes people have gotten mad at me for it or pushed me away over it. The clearest connection between all of my social issues is that I seem to lag when it comes to absorbing and applying any cues, but I don't know how to fix it.

730,"Bit if a backstory I am 25f and 2 years ago I got out of a relationship with someone I thought was the one. I was infatuated with him from the beginning. All the butterflies and nonsense and thought that was it. Turns out it wasn’t and I have been on and off dating for the past year. 

I started a new relationship (M29) recently. My friend/coworker set me up with one of her friends. I had met him twice before we were set up and he was really cool and fun. We have been together about 6 weeks. 

Our very first date was awesome. There was no butterflies with him. Just a little anxiousness. We were together for 6 hours and I didn’t want to leave but I knew I needed to go home. Then our second date was two days later and 3rd was a day or two after that. We live like 45 mins apart but try to see each other as much as possible. When I’m with him I don’t want to leave. He makes me smile and laugh so much. I think about him all the time and he thinks about me too. 

Over the weekend I stayed with him for two nights. This was the first time I slept over. It was great. The first night we ended up saying I love you for the first time. This is what is messing with my head. I had been thinking about it for a while and he had told me he thought he was in love with me and why. I got super happy and Then we said  it. Since we have said it I am freaking out that maybe I shouldn’t have said it. 

I’m afraid that I’m not feeling more than I should be because it’s not all butterflies and rainbows. It’s laughs and smiles and he does whatever he can to make sure I’m okay and happy. Everything he has done for me in this relationship is good and new. Completely different from my last. But I’m terrified bc I’m not feeling more. The last time I felt more it wasn’t right now I’m trying not to compare it with that.  Everything with him is comfortable and fun and happy. I’m just concerned I’m not feeling more.  I feel like I’m supposed to know if I want to be with him forever based on if I love him and that’s not true right?

So, there's this girl who I'll call Beatrice. We met when we were in kindergarten and remained friends for over 10 years. I'm not a very extroverted person, so my only really super close friends were her and my best friend, Mary. We were that classical trio of girls who always did everything together. We had an extended group of friends, but we had our own separate thing going on, so most times we would hang out just the three of us. 

With that ""friendship background"" laid out, I need to give some background on Beatrice. She isn't the easiest person to deal with. When we were 12 a boy leaked a video of her masturbating to the whole school, and obviously that was a huge trauma to her and was what I think worsened the major trust issues she already had. She is that kind of clingy friend who ""chooses"" a person and becomes obsessed with them. When she ""picks"" a best friend they become the only thing that matters to her in the whole world. She wants to do everything with them, gives them the most expensive gifts, invites them on trips with her family... I was there to see every best friend she ever had, and it never lasted due to her being extremely possessive and jealous. Even talking to someone else sometimes was a reason for her to start a fight. Even though we were friends for a long time I was never the target of her obsession, so my role was to listen to her endless rants about her best friends and try to show her how harmful her behavior could be some times – which usually ended with her getting mad at me and ignoring me for days. She treated me like shit many times just because she was mad at other people, but I always let it go because I felt like it was my duty as a friend to be patient because she had been through some shit and I thought she needed someone to be there to help her through it. And by shit I don't mean just the video. When we were 13/14 Beatrice became best friends with this girl who I seriously believe is a sociopath. They had a messed up, really physically and psychologically abusive friendship, and although the abuse came from both sides, Beatrice was more victim than perpetrator in that situation. I'm not going to go into detail here because it would be too much of a tangent, but just know that it was REALLY fucked up. 

The sociopath I just mentioned thankfully moved away when we started freshman year and after that Beatrice improved a lot. I know the last paragraph didn't paint the best picture of her, but she was actually a really good friend when she wan't swallowed up by some unhealthy and obsessive friendship. We had a period of peace and, of course, she found a new best friend. This time it was a pretty chill girl and her, Beatrice, Mary and me all became a small group. That year was suprisingly healthy and drama free. 

But then, at the end of the year, this new girl announced she was moving to study in New Zealand. That's when everything started to fall apart. At first Beatrice acted as a supportive friend, but then she started to try and convince her not to go by arguing that it wouldn't be good for her future and whatever. She even manipulated ME into doing it for her, and I feel so stupid to this day for falling for it even though Mary warned me time and time again about how she was manipulating me and how selfish she was being for not wanting her best friend to have that experience in the first place. Anyway, it didn't work and new girl went anyway. After that Beatrice and her entered in this spiral of fighting, making up and fighting all. The. Time. And of course, Mary and I were caught in the middle of it all the time. Mostly me, because Mary always had this ability to not give a fuck when Beatrice's drama became excessive, while I felt bad for her and tried to turn her into a less posessive person. She slowly became more willing to listen to me and she recognized she was wrong sometimes, but there was little progress and this whole situation felt so draining to me. To always have to be there to clean up someone's emotional mess and usually get fucked over in the process because once again she would get mad at me and ignore me. 

So, it's time to talk about me now I guess. First, I think it's clear from what I've told that I'm not the kind who stands up for herself. I'm way too submissive to people I like and I always feel like I'm walking on eggshells even when I'm not. I'm a people pleaser and I can't stand knowing anyone has a bad opinion or is upset at me, and I HATE this about my personality. Also, I've dealt with mental health issues since I was a kid and am still trying to get off a self harming habit I developed at 11 (Mary and Beatrice are the only people I explicitly told this to, btw. Keep that in mind). Just before I turned 16 my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer. She died last October. I had just gotten out of 3 suicide attempts before this whole thing, and became even a bigger mess during her illness and after her death. I got drunk all the time, had crazy emotional breakdowns in the middle of parties, fucked up a lot. Beatrice and Mary were there through the whole thing. They were comprehensive at first but then their method of helping became shaming me into sobriety. I don't completely blame them for this. I know it's not easy for a teenager to deal with a mentally ill person. I had to deal with my dad, who was severely suicidal during a good portion of my life, and sometimes I didn't know what to do and thought acting angry and shaming him would help. Mary still showed sympathy for me and tried to understand, but Beatrice did that less and less. She had reasons to be mad because I fucked up a lot during that time, but she would bring up the shit I had done all the time even after I apologized a thousand times and after she said she ""forgave me"". Also, at the same time as she treated me like I was an alcoholic who should be ashamed of herself and stop drinking, she was glad to forget there was any problem and use me to buy alcohol and to go to parties whenever she wanted to have some fun. 

All of this was slowly making me resent her more and more but of course, I still kept quiet. That is until my mom died. After that, I slowly started getting fed up with her, her judgments and the way she took me for granted. It all blew up when one day she said people who try to commit suicide are disgusting and should do it right or live a long life while waiting to go to hell. I never told her about my suicide attempts, but she did know my family had a long history with suicide. My grandma went through so many I can't even count and I helped my dad through multiple crisis. I told her she didn't know anything about what she was talking about and that she was being disrespectful. She got unresonably mad for being called out and tried to say I was ""defending suicide"" somehow and then proceeded to say all my opinions were shit and that I shouldn't be talking about it because I'm ""unstable"". She kept repeating I was unstable, and of course having one of my closest friends using my mental health, which she knew was a major source of insecurity for me and had ruined my life, against me for such a childish and stupid reason hit hard. But the worst came after. This time I refused to just forgive her when she came back pretending what she said wasn't a big deal, and she got mad at me for not forgiving her immediately. She said I was only mad because ""truth hurts"" and all she did was say suicide was bad. Mary took my side in all of this and Beatrice messaged her many times saying that the only thing that mattered to her was Mary's and New Zealand Girl's friendships, and that she couldn't stand Mary being mad at her. She tried to turn Mary against me and only when that failed she tried to make amends with me. She never said sorry though, to this day. She still believes she did nothing wrong and that I should be grateful that she forgave me for all the times I fucked up, and that she was my friend even when I didn't ""deserve it"". 

Mary and I are not close to her anymore. This fight was months ago, and for a while we all just minded our business and were civil to each other and things were fine, but now Mary and I became close to another girl, and well... Beatrice just can't have that. She recently went back to attacking us – with a focus on me as always – and is trying and successfully isolating us from all the other girls in that extended group of friends. I don't even know what is the point of me writing this. I don't know which advice I want. I just feel so confused sometimes, like I'm somehow wrong in all of this. I do think I made a mistake in not telling Beatrice sooner about the things that bothered me, and I definetely was very sudden in the way I ended our friendship, but I just don't feel the same about her anymore. I almost hate her now, if I'm being honest, and I really don't want to because this is all making me feel so sick, so heavy. I just want the year to end already so I can be out of school and away from her and all the drama forever. 

Anyway, I'm sorry for the long post and thank you to anyone who has made it this far. Feel free to make any questions, there are still a lot of minor details that I left out in order to not let this be as long as a Bible.",11Aug2019,1
736,"I recently graduated university after a while of on and off attendance. Im 25 , 26 soon. I majored in something I dont want to pursue but it was the easiest route to complete my bachelor's degree with all the classes I had already taken over the years.

I live at home and I am desperately seeking a secure tolerable job that I can do in the mean time to save up to move out and start paying off loans which will go into repayment in a few months.

I have a per-diem job that I do in educational institutions during the school year. The income is pretty good but is dependent on how many jobs are available which in any given week can range from 2 -20 jobs. So, I'll be starting that back up in September.

I began applying to office setting jobs back in May and heard back with rejections. (I don't aspire to work in an office but it's steady employment) My gf knows that this is such a huge burden on me and has caused much anxiety and depression for me. She suggested I apply to retail and service jobs in addition to the more professional jobs I was applying to. So, I did and I heard back from a job at an artisinal coffee shop and got contacted for an interview. I did the interview last Friday and the spot in brand new opened only a few days before my interview. The owner was very unorganized and askes me my availability and also told me to remind him of experience and name because he forgot what I had written in the email. It felt kind of odd and not like an interview at all. It lasted all but maybe 5 minutes. He seemed in a rush to get back to what he was doing before I arrived. I told him I preferred morning shifts and replied with ""are you reliable to come in early because if we open and there is a line and the person is late it just fucks everything up"" . I told him I was reliable but just didnt get a vibe that he cared about who he was hiring. It bothered me. He told me to come in the next day to meet the mnager and begin training. I came in and she didnt seem informed that I was coming so I told her I was there for training and she pretty much threw me in the water and it was okay but no mention of pay or anything was ever discussed. One customer after I served her asked if there was a tip jar and the manager replied to her that I was just training. So, Im not being paid. Before I left the manager asked for my info and availability and she texted me today saying she would love to schedule me for more training shifts and asked if Im still interested. To be honest Im not!

Last week when I told my gf about hearing back she was so excited for me. I told her I had anxiety about ot that I couldn't explain. But she didn't understand. Im concerned of what she'll think but Im pretty set on responding that Im not interested. Its just that I went through all the trouble to apply and interview and train that one day its just not for me.

My decision for denying a job that would be useful but that doesn't feel right is my own but I cant help but think she'll think I'm being lazy or not motivated enough. Like I was looking for a job for almost 3 months and I get one and turn it down. But I honestly don't want that job.",11Aug2019,3

741,"So I [17M] went on a date with this girl [16F] yesterday after we’ve been talking via text for two weeks, everything went fairly well, we laughed, had a good time, there were a few awkward silences during the previews of the movie, but afterwards things went well. But today she seems to be sending dry responses to my texts, and I’m just wondering what I did wrong, the date seemed to go well and I’m thinking that maybe she’s annoyed I didn’t really initiate anything between us, we are both pretty awkward so I wasn’t expecting her to really be expecting me to make a move, so I didn’t, I want to save it for another time we hang out, but did I make the wrong choice? Because if not I have no idea why she’s kinda blocking me out right now.",11Aug2019,1
742,"Well, first off, I kinda feel like she’s being really dependent on me. She acts childish, even in her clothing choices, and sometimes I feel like I’m the one being the parent. Get ready for a super long essay 😂

When I was young, my mother came down with depression. I found out when she dragged me to my room, sat me down, and told me she was sick. I never knew that this would be the beginning of a misery unimaginable to my seven-year old self. 

My dad never really understood emotions, and he even looks down at them. So I was the one who stayed by my depressed mother and tried to take care of her. I did everything alone when she was sleeping, without a mother to oversee my progress, and when she was awake, I’d drop everything I did to hang out with her. We’d take walks, with me doing most of the talking, and we’d eat dinner together... although it felt like I was doing it alone. But thanks to medication, she was eventually cured, temporarily. 

In seventh grade, she got depressed again. Middle school is probably the most excruciating time for anybody that I know, since we’re all insecure teens who just wanted to feel at the top of the world. So, because of my high voice and gay-ish tendencies, I was bullied a lot, and at one point it got so bad I didn’t have any friends anymore. 

That’s when I broke down to my mom, and I told her about all the problems I had gone through. Because of my loneliness, I confessed to her that she was my only and best friend in the world. And she told me she felt the same. 

That one line is something I regret to this day. 

A year ago, sixteen-year-old me was playing video games with my friend, when she came up to me and wanted me to help out with the yard (my cousin was coming to visit the next day). I seriously wasn’t feeling it as I had just took the SAT the day before and felt like I deserved a break. So I told her to ask my dad or to ask a friend of hers, but she said they wouldn’t help her, and even got frustrated with me because I “knew that already.” So I held my ground and hesitated, and eventually she gave up and went upstairs. I started feeling bad and offered to help, but she started crying and yelled at me from her room that she didn’t want my help anymore since it wasn’t out of true willingness to help. And then 5 minutes later, she comes down the stairs with her trash can, dumps the contents of it on the floor while yelling “TRASH, TRASH, TRASH!” while literally trashing the house. She threw out food from the pantry, and even books off the shelves, and eventually stopped after I literally obstructed her path. Things happened, we talked, I felt ashamed, and I went to work cleaning the house instead of doing homework that was due the next day. But 4 hours later, she told me that she was going to stay at a hotel for the night because she wouldn’t be able to face my cousin, and I would be paying for the hotel’s expenses, all the while doing a contemptuous stare that was honestly quite alien to me. I was so shocked. 

A few days later, we talked, and she said that she was wrong for acting so extremely, but she said nobody’s perfect. But she continued to say that I was also at fault for not being there for her when she was there for me all the time. Back then, I accepted her explanation, and I apologized profusely. We agreed to move on (I never was able to, though).

Over the course of the year I grew more aware of her inappropriate behavior. She would tell me about her issues, I would listen and tell her my thoughts on her issues, give advice maybe, but 3 weeks later she was still venting to me about the same thing. It’s as if I wasn’t even heard. So at that point I asked her why she didn’t ask her friends for help. She responded by telling me I was the only one in the universe she could talk to. (I hope I’m not at fault for not wanting to listen to her; I felt a tremendous pressure to be the perfect son, friend, husband, counselor that she desperately needed in order to function properly.)

Yesterday, I came up with the nerve to tell her about everything that bothered me. I kinda let it bottle up in me, so when it did come out, 1. It was harsher than I intended and 2. She took it all very horribly. Basically, I told her that I’ve been feeling like she’s depended on me a lot all of my life, she’s invading my personal space and independence, and she’s not respecting my individual growth. I sensed her becoming very depressed, and soon she began lamenting about how surprised she was to hear these words coming out of my mouth, saying that she had failed miserably as a parent. And after I kept telling her she was wrong, she entered into a state of silence, staring at the floor for about 5 minutes straight, before getting up and locking herself up in her room. I asked her if we could talk, and she didn’t even respond. 

Later, when she got up, I asked if she could talk, and she told me she couldn’t even talk to her son, that she had to talk to a counselor, while tearing up. Eventually I couldn’t take it anymore, and went back to my room to cool off. 

About four hours later, she came into my room and told me she was ready to talk. I began the conversation with telling her I wanted to set boundaries, as I cannot hold the roles of caretaker, son, and everything else that she wanted me to be. She took extreme offense to this. She probably thought I implied I wasn’t interested in listening to her, which is “what family’s for.” I told her that when she vents to me, I do feel a tremendous pressure, to which she responds by saying she never put the pressure on me in the first place, and she never knew where I got that idea (but wait). She continued to tell me how surprised she was to hear how badly her depression and her incident last August impacted me, but most surprising was the fact that I “thought” she was dependent. Finally, she ended with the statement that she had failed to raise a kid with compassion, that my compassion had disappeared from the me of the past. (Why wouldn’t those things hurt me? Why wouldn’t I want to help her? I’m HER KID?)

The memory from last night’s events remains foggy after that, but all I remember was that 1. She had never requested I take of her while she was depressed (she was depressed, how could she? =.= I thought it was the right thing to do as a child); 2. If I wasn’t interested in listening to her problems, there’s nothing to say, and she would therefore not be interested in having a relationship with me, HER SON (why does this sound like a break up conversation?);  3. Because I said I existed for her back in seventh grade, she existed for me, and if I don’t need her anymore, she doesn’t need to exist (it seems ironically convenient that she doesn’t have any friends or a husband anymore, huh?). 

 I was feeling extremely exhausted and wanted to end off the conversation, so I just learned to shut up and take everything she was saying. At the end I told her that we should just resume the conversation after our scars have healed, and she agreed. Now, we’re just a mother and son who don’t talk to each other. It’s like we signed a temporary treaty... that’s not natural in my opinion. 

The truth is, all I wanted to tell her was that I’m moving on, and she isn’t the center of my universe like I am of hers. But I can’t muster the courage because I’m afraid *this* will happen again. I’m afraid that she’s going to make me feel like a bad son, that’s she’s going to guilt trip me, that she might disown or abandon me. I can honestly see her point of view, that I should help out around the house more often, and that I should be willing to listen to her after all that she’s done for me. And I will for sure. 

So now the questions come:
1. how do I avoid the growing resentment of my mom for using such passive aggressive tactics, and especially on her own son. And for treating me like I’m responsible for her happiness. 
2. How do I tell her to get help without her getting mad at me? I’m afraid that if I do tell her, she’ll be so mad that she’ll disown me. Either that, or she’ll run away and not take therapy sessions. 
3. If she does disown me, how will I be able to live? My dad isn’t a very caring person, and I still need to go to college... I don’t have a bank account of my own, and I think it’s a bit late to ask her for one now (she might think I’d be setting up to run away). 
4. Right now, I’m terrified of my mom... how do I get rid of this terror and dread that comes up every time I think about her? 
5. I determined her unreasonable arguments were because I had set up an unrealistic expectation in the first place. Aka telling her she was my best friend, telling her that I existed for her and nobody else... but that was just my childhood innocence. How should I reverse these expectations without her completely disowning me? It seems like I can’t even have a civil conversation because she still has these unrealistic expectations of myself when I was a child. 
6. What are exactly the boundaries between a mother and a son? What can’t a mother share with her son? And what do you all think are the best ways in which I can communicate these with her? I find myself lacking the confidence needed to tell her the boundaries that I need to set up.

743,"Ever since I’ve graduated high school, I’ve felt so confused with everything that’s been going on since. I have felt very depressed and alone lately. I have been looking for a job for months, and I finally found one but I haven’t been sent my first week’s schedule yet. I’m hoping to start soon because I have to start college soon. I’m not going far at all (community college) and I’m going for a two year degree, but I already feel extremely stressed about it already and I don’t start until the day after Labor Day (less than a month). Although I feel great about starting out at college, I have absolutely no clue what I want to do for a career. All that I feel like I’ve been doing lately is thinking, because I have so much time to myself lately at home. I could just sit here thinking about everything in my life going from college to work, and if I even have an official part-time job anymore. To add onto that, I still have to work on getting my driver’s license. This has been affecting not only myself internally, but also my relationships with loved ones lately because I haven’t felt fully in the moment with anything I’ve been doing lately because of my stress. I feel like I’ve hit an all time low in my life. I do have a history of being highly anxious and my mind always goes to a dark place even if things aren’t going wrong in real life. I’ve heard of this type of depression or anxiety after high school. I don’t know if there’s a name for it but I was wondering if anyone else has or is experiencing this, and what you think I should do to move on from high school.

 The other day I was at the store trying on new clothes, and inside of one of the dressing rooms there was a double mirror that showed what you looked like from the side. I had a hard time looking at myself from that view to the point that I had to cover the mirror up with clothing.

For one, I have huge eyes. They look really pretty from the front, but from the side I look like an actual goblin. I also have a nose that juts out and is quite long. I can’t even look at myself because of how awful it makes me feel, wondering about what people think of me and thinking I’m ugly myself.

I’m fine with my front view. I think I’m pretty. But the side is so awful, I can’t even take pictures or videos of myself facing that way or all of my confidence will be destroyed.

At one point I went for a cold shower to shock my system. I've been like that for maybe months (minus the racing heart) but the pain in my neck made me go to her. I asked could it be brain related and said no, so she sent me to get xrays. Waited a week and she told me that all was normal. So I asked could it be brain related, should I get an MRI and she said I have no symptoms that would require it. Now today I wake up with i guess you could call a tension headache in the back of my neck. I ate a piece of bread and around 30 mins feel my heart race, back of head pounding so i go out to walk and calm myself. Now when I come home, around 3 hours later and sit still my head still pounds i have nausea and i have a constant feeling like something is gonna happen based on these feelings. I thought it was hunger so i ate, buy as I ate I was getting nauseous and stopped. My headache is still here and I'm still nauseous with a constant worry.

I’m in a constant state of “becoming” rather than feeling safe in just “being” who I am.

749,"TL;DR My sister's on/off guys is a shitty waste of life and for some reason she always goes back to him not matter what, and I want it to stop.


So my sister's on again off again guy is the absolute worst. They have around 5 years or so of history.
In the beginning he was great, a fun dude to be around and all around good guy. It wasn't until he showed his true colors that it became obvious who he was. After around a year my niece was born and thats when things sort of started going downhill. Shortly after she was born, he started showing his true colors. He went from responsible and respectable to, undependable and a steaming pile of shit. He had no real care for anything but himself and was pretty much using my sister for money (her credit is awful now because of him). Along with this I learned that he is a racist and legitimate nazi. Like, he had a Swastika and Iron cross ok his legs but had covered them up because the modern world doesn't like garbage people. Along with that, he started cheating. A lot. In fact he actually had another kid with a friend of my sister's. While they were all roommates. For whatever reason she decided he was still an alright guy and took him back. Then he just bailed to go fuck off wherever until he got bored and needed money. Did my sister think this was ok? Apparently, because again she took him back. She says its because my niece deserves to have her dad in her life, but hell, I'm a fucking better father than he is to my niece. Now this happens constantly, he vanishes for awhile breaks my sister and his daughters heart and then shows up when he needs something. My sister *ALWAYS* welcomes him back. Four years of this and she just can't tell him to go. Flash forward to a few months ago he convinced her to pack her things a move in with him four states away, and she did it. While they were living together he was cheating on her, again. A co worker of his took pictures of him and the other girl(s) and showed my sister. Shout-out to that girl, you kick ass, thankyou for that. So my sister was pissed and decided she was done and left. Things were going well and she was done with him, and talking to other guys and even went on a few dates. Until he showed up again to ""talk things out and apologize"" *for the hundredth fucking time* and she took him back. Again. Now they're running off to the beach this week because my dad gave her his condo to use *while not knowing HE would be tagging along with her*. She hides all of this from our dad because he'd be pissed if he knew. Hell, all of us in the family absolutely hate him, if he just straight up died that'd be a big fucking win for all of us, but thats not gonna happen.



I don't know what to fucking do, man. I've been staying out of it cause my sister and I have always been close and I don't want to jeopardize our relationship. If I tried to say or do anything I'm almost positive she'd cut me off, the only reason she sticks around with our mom is because she pays for everything for my niece, otherwise she wants nothing to do with her because of him. 
I don't know what goes on in her head and why she goes back to him Everytime, she's too fucking smart for this shit. He fucking broke her and I want my sister back, man. How do I break this cycle? I'm the only one in the family thats just stood around and done nothing but I feel like I'm the only one who could make a difference.

751,"Before you go and say im the average teen and am not thinking straight please hear me out. I was at one point in my life a straight A student, i even cried when i got my first B. However this all changed when i went into 6th grade because the crowd changed which lead to me changing. I got to the point where i didn't care and honestly i don't think i've actually learned anything of substance since then. im am in no way saying the cliche ""ohhh school isnt teaching me anything of value"" i just genuinely stopped paying attention which lead to me not learning. But this never stopped me, i dont mean to brag but i am intelligent and even though i have this gift its been a bit of a crutch. i can completely not pay attention, hell not even show up, and be right back up on top and pass the test. I think this is in a way what probably lead to my decline, the only stress i had was when i would cut it so close that i was almost working against myself. i just lost interest in school and was never really engaged with joy when it came to the process and grind of it. 

High school has really been one hell of a dusie with mistakes and drastic life changes (my mental state). As my freshman year progressed my work and attendance declined and i eventually made a mistake and caught a charge on school campus. i was sent to an alternative school which ill touch on more in a second. I loved weed and loved to smoke (i can positively say this had nothing to do with my performance at school) But that came to an end when one of the repercussions of my charge was drug screening. Back to the school, i was to attend a full year which was broken over the ending half of freshman year and the beginning half of my sophomore year. From what i can remember i did fair in the first half with only hiccups in my attendance and the second half is where everything crashes and burns in my story. My attendance becomes a major problem to the point where a meeting is called basically hearing to what is gonna happen  and a resolution to the incredible amount of school Im missing. Now this i where things hit an immediate left turn, about the time the meeting is called my drug screenings are relieved and i can indulge in weed again. I smoke and enjoy myself but wake up after a couple days of on and off smoking throughout the day and feel on edge and off. My perception has not been ground zero since this happened 7 or 8 months ago. I believe i have dissociation, i described it as feeling high but after a while i realized this isn't what feeling high feels like and that i described this change in perception as that because every time i smoked i triggered it. this is why I could never smoke as much as others and was a ""lightweight"". I know the weed was fine because others smoked it. I was actually bed ridden the first couple of weeks and ended up going to the hospital because i was so scared. 

Now will call this paragraph the downfall because this is truly the beginning of the end. If you recall me saying i had a meeting coming up you know these feelings of perception change collide right with it. I dont know what my decision would of been if i didnt have this change but i think it could of possibly persuaded me out of fear to switch to homeschooling. Im gonna have to laugh here because as i write this its clearly evident my choice would of never worked out. Keeping true to my habits and past actions i bombed online schooling and didnt do any of it. Ive been here at home with a declining mental state (bad hygiene and habits leading to me not being happy), hell i haven't done anything productive in months. But theres always been music which has peaked my interest. This isn't a spur of the moment thing i remember writing my first and very bad song in elementary. I remember the kids who rapped and really turned me on to the whole music thing, ever since thin musics been my thing. I used to think and was always unsure if i was good enough to professionally record my own music, ive done in home recording with shitty mics but never went any further. But ive always wrote, telling myself this is gonna be recorded in a real studio. Not one has but i really do see this sorta of doubt in myself as a stepping stone because i never stopped and i think its time. I believe I might be good enough now and can possibly make good music. In a way i feel like its time now and the choice of school or music is like a mamma bird pushing its baby to fly. I know i want to do music and am going to. Im honestly fearful of going back to school because of my mental state(I know i need so see someone who specializes in what i got going on and am working on it). What are your suggestions on my situation? Do you think its reasonable to lay off school and work on music? I know this is what i want to to and am not interested in school, my lack of interest in school and musical skill has been has increased throughout the years. I am going to record and if it comes out well hopefully be able to follow through with it into a career. School is coming within the next week. Im terrified of recording but know i gotta do it!

I'M 16 btw

752,"I just turned 18 eleven days ago, and have been working at this daycare for nearly 4 years.  Long enough to witness babies grow all the way to 4 as their parents bring them frequently.  Over the years I have made several connections with the kids I work with.  I look forward to work each and every morning knowing that I'll see these specific kids who will talk to me about anything, want to play with me, and just... it's extremely hard to explain.  It's sort of like I'm a teacher who's young. My interactions with these specific kids is like how a brother and sister would talk and converse, maybe even like how a father and daughter would in some circumstances. I am heading off to college in 11 days and am going to miss a good handful of these kids SO much.

I will always come back in the summers but I know after I graduate college in the upcoming 4 years that I can't just be 21 and working at the daycare.  Kids won't look at me as the ""fun young teen"" who they can talk personally with, have fun with, and jump on/pull/grab etc. opposed to the old people who just supervise the kids until their parents come instead of  establishing any real connection. I already get stereotyped as incompetent by some parents who bring their kids in if i'm one of the only people working that day, as it is because, well... I'm a teenage boy.  I fear as i get older I would just look like a creep.  I am also aware that these kids I've made a big brother - little brother/sister relationship with will grow up and be out of the daycare.  

All of this was so hard to explain because I truly believe you would have to see me ""work"" with the kids to understand how i feel.  Despite this, I don't know what to do. I would like to keep this big bro type relationship with this one girl and her little brother who I would say grew on me the most, and these three sisters who also grew on me for two years consistently besides the school year.  I don't know how to achieve this though.  Maybe I could become a family friend, but that of itself is tough.  Their mothers know me and know that they frequently ask her to roll the car window down so they can scream my name and ""hello"" when they see me walking to my car or into the building, but other than that the parents really don't know me, and I feel like becoming a family friend (like that one uncle who isn't blood related but is a friend of your parents) is the only way to stay on the radar since there's no blood relation.",11Aug2019,1
753,"He came over today and we went for a stroll in my estate and there were little kids playing and he started telling them that he'll call the guards on them. The kids then told him to ""fuck off"" and then he was like ""who are you telling to fuck off"" we are 18 and they are like 8. How immature is that. I told him to stop and that we should keep going but he wouldn't stop and these little kids and my friend were having an argument for like 8min before the kids parent came outside and then he ran away.

I'm scared shirtless now because these parents might go to my house since it's my estate. I don't even interact with these people. I'm thinking of banning him from coming to my house and then ditching him and not being his friend anymore. Am I too harsh? I'm too old for this kind of shit behaviour.",11Aug2019,2
754,"I'm too poor to afford therapy, and I'm looking for a place or subreddit to get some help or guidance with making some changes in my life.

I recently realized after a breakup and serious reflection on my life, that I'm a super shitty person. Like 99% of the people who've had exposure to me over any length of time hate me and for good reason. 

I'm 25 now, but in high school I was bullied to the point of eating lunch in a bathroom stall. My first girlfriend and the person I lost my virginity to ghosted me when I was 20 after we dated for 6 months. After 2 months of no contact she reached out to tell me she had an abortion and that's why she ghosted me.

I think these events and others led me to be a huge asshole, unable to open up to anyone, unable to be vulnerable, and a very bad person. Me being shitty caused my girlfriend of 4 years to leave me a few months ago, which led to all this reflection. It really sucks to know I lost a person who actually cared about me and tried to help me. It sucks even more to know the pain I caused her.

I think maybe because I feel this sadness and regret that maybe I can fix myself?

762,Hey. I’m 18 but I don’t have much money or anywhere safe to go that my dad can’t find me. He’s always abused my mom and blamed it on her drug use as a matter of ‘her deserving it’ he’s shamed both her and me (verbal abuse) and is physically abusive to her if he’s angry. The cops were called when I was a kid but he ended up with custody because I guess she didn’t tell them he was abusive and he told them about her addiction issues. I’m supposed to start college but in the wake of recent events I’m probably going to have to cancel that as my dad A.) will not be paying for it if I have to call the cops on him for abuse or B) even if I move out *no where to go he can’t find me and no money* I won’t be able to afford the tuition. I don’t know what to do I’m so lost. Where do I go? If I leave I’m worried he’ll just kill her.

I'm a 37 year old single male, living in western Canada, and I've generally been dealt a tough hand in life.  I battle depression and anxiety daily, and have some pretty debilitating lower back problems.  Here's my current situation:

I was on leave from my Accounting job since November, and then at the end of April, I herniated a disc in my lower spine for the 4th time in 8 years.  In the past week, I've left that job(for a few reasons)  and decided to go back to college to finish my degree(s). I'm registered for 2 courses in September.  I'm currently staying with my folks to rehab, and have arranged to be here for the long term to finish school.  I've received a lump sum settlement from my insurance company and have enough money to get by for the time being.  But for long term, I won't have enough for to get by and finish my schooling.

&amp;#x200B;

My question here is:  Does anybody know of any options for doing something relatively simple from home for a few bucks, to help make ends meet?  I briefly looked into this last year, and recall seeing things like:

\- Typing up minutes from meetings/other important recordings

\- Transcribing from home

766,"Became friendly with our new neighbor. Briefly mentioned once that If she ever needed to go away I would be happy to watch her dogs. (We know she doesn't have family or friends here and I dog sit for friends and colleagues in my spare time)

Last month she said she would be going away in July and could we dog sit and feed her cats for two weeks. I said yes as I knew I'd already offered but expressed two weeks was a long time to have her dogs in my house and asked if they would be unsettled etc, she said no definitely not, they are good and well trained. 

Anyway, it was the worst two weeks. They have zero discipline, chewed a lot of my possessions, things I've never had to move out of other dogs way (pillows, coasters, books etc..) Everytime I left the house I would return to chaos, pee everywhere, shredded magazines/books/phone chargers chewed and spat out all over the floor! 

They dug up my garden, all the flowerbeds, shredded a bush and deposited the remains all across the back yard. Dug up the TV cable and chewed through it. (Thankfully we don't use it) 

We messaged the neighbor to let her know things weren't going perfectly, politely.
At the end of the week I was in despair, they actually brought me to tears! I was also going into her house everyday to feed and clean the litter of 4 cats. 

When she returned my partner told her again how hard it had been and that we were disappointed that she told us they were housetrained and not ""chewers'. She said that they are perfect for her and they must have just been anxious. 

She did apologize but didn't really say thank you once. She also did not think we were expecting anything for doing it. Now, we didn't discuss this upfront but seriously, who doesn't give someone anything for taking on 6 (less than perfect) animals for two weeks.

She then quietly said 'oh so are you expecting any money to replace the items that were damaged?' or something like that. My partner said well yes we were as we need to buy some new stuff. She said NOTHING. And I'm actually offended that she didn't think we were expecting any money for sitting the dogs/cats! I know she's saved around $500+ by not boarding them in kennels! 

Anyway she still hasn't given us anything, not even a thank-you card or a bottle of wine for example. 

She's still being as nice as pie when we see her outside and i just don't understand! She didn't even THANK ME for looking after her cats. 

What should we do now? She knows we are disgruntled but isn't trying to resolve it. How should we move on? Am I overreacting?

TLDR: Looked after neighbors dogs for two weeks. They turned out to be nightmares and she hasn't really thanked us or given us anything to replace damaged possessions or given us anything for looking after them.",11Aug2019,1

770,"Hi,
I sent my application to a clinic for a three year paid apprenticeship (kind of trade school). I already have a very good high school degree, but not good enough to study medicine. But you can still study medicine with even that apprenticeship. Now about my brother.
He gets 24 this year (me 22). He thrower school any doesn't have a high school degree but would be able to do the apprenticeship. He didn't apply for it.
Now comes the dilemma. Tomorrow is the job interview  (they said only one place has become accidentally free).
I said to my brother something along those lines ""I could give in your application"", not saying how I would do it (that I'm the actual person invited).
I thought about giving them his application after the interview. Now comes the dilemma: I'm not quite sure if I actually want this apprenticeship (kinda 50:50) and I would have a guilty feeling for my brother if I get his place. He is without a job and no perspective.
I thought about saying at the start of the interview: ""I'm not interested in this 
""(actually not sure) ""here is the application of my brother, prefer him instead"". 
I don't know if they would take him at all and if we both won't get an offer instead. Bur I'd also have a guilty conscience before him with ""my secrer"". 
What do you think?
It actually is pretty late for the application and it is also interview phase, so I don't actually now if they even look at his application.
What should I do? I don't want to feel guilty and as a traitor.

TL;DR: I don't know if I should sacrifice my future work prospect at a clinic having a good high school degree for my brother how threw high school and ha's none.

Thx",11Aug2019,1
771,"My parents divorced last year and it wasn't pretty. There was a constant battle between them on how to divide their wealth but eventually they settled for 55% - 45%, in favor of my father. So they sold our home and divided the money accordingly.

Fast forward to today, my father has already bought a new home but he had had to take out a loan. He has recently told me he would occasionally need some money to help with the renovation, and without hesitation, I agreed to help. As it turned out it wasn't quite true, he didn't just occasionally need some money, he wanted me and my brother to help him pay for his loan and that even with our help it would take 18 years.

I told him today that I thought it was unfair that he would lie to us. Then he brought up the point that I should have known it given that since we didn't stand with him during the divorce procedure, he had less money to spend in the first place, hence the loan. Also, the home would be ours too so according to him it makes sense if we help with paying for it.

I'm a little baffled right now. On the one hand I feel like he is right and that I shouldn't care about that little money that much. On the other hand, I work as an intern and this expenditure would take away much of my income, so much so that my savings which aren't too much anyway may start to deplete. Also what if I'll want to move out? Because I'll want to move out one day. Would I have to pay for his loan even then? On a less financial note, I have a hard time getting over the fact that he lied to me.

I'm really confused right now... AITA? Or is he? What am I supposed to do? My anger would drive me away from home at the moment and given the fact that I also feel pretty low lately, I feel like this could push me over to do something stupid. I feel betrayed by my father but at the same time I also feel guilty. And I have even less an idea how I should approach this. Should I pay? Should I move out? Should I do something else?",11Aug2019,1

781,"
In January 2018 I was on my way home and processing out of the military. I was 3 months away from finally completing my contract and I was just looking forward to being with my Fiance at the time. Throughout the 4 years things have been up and down, just like any relationship would be. Long distance was the hardest thing but I made it work. No matter what I would stick through it thin and through under any and all circumstances. This person was my only source of direction at the time.

Something I never tell anyone was I almost killed myself during my Deployment. I think back now and I wish I would have done it. My engagement was breaking, I was going to get foreclosed on my home, and my life being overseas was hell. All 3 parts of my life was getting destroyed. 

I held my rifle to my head crying, pleading and sobbing. I sat alone in the dark hoping someone would come look for me. Asking God to help me but no one ever came

I finally put the rifle down.

During this time I was suffering from severe experiences I had in Iraq, also suffering emotionally and mentally.

Last year throughout January - Feburary 2018 me and my Fiance at the time did not work out. During this time March 2018 I was finally home. My contract ended and my only source of direction abandoned me. This ultimately took me towards a downward spiral which I am not proud of. I have developed such a strong resentment and anger towards any women in my life and started messing around disregarding their emotional health, or well being.

I would go on apps like tinder, go on multiple dates, I'd manipulate and take advantage of them and I am so ashamed to admit that.

I finally met someone let's call her (D). I started a relationship with this person while still keeping in touch with other women, doing things behind (D's) back and much more. It wasnt until one day she found out and I came clean to her and told her the truth about everything. Watching her heart ache got me. It made me regret all that I have done, how could I put someone else through a heartache? How can I use people and not have any sympathy? As I came clean I tried to work things out.

A few months things have gotten a little better, but as time went on the Past would never fully heal and it would always effect our Future.


It wasnt until these past few weeks I once again started going towards a downward spiral. I would disregard (Ds) feelings and concerns. I would do my own thing, I had nothing but anger and resentment building up and I just didnt know what to do. I would start drinking excessively, I was even drinking and driving for about two weeks. I would show up to work drunk. 

(D) at the time would do her best to comfort me, she would be there for me through out it all and I pushed her away. I was so blind to see what I really had, I needed help. 

I thought I had loved my Fiance to death, but I never knew what love was until (D) came into my life. This person came to me and stuck by my side through out all the negative things I've put her through. All my anger and nasty words she ate them all up and continued to love me.

This person would slave for me, she cooked me 3 meals a day, on my bad days she would comfort me, she would heal my soul and massage my body at a moments notice. She committed her soul and mind to me, there was never a time she said no to me. I've never felt this way and I never knew what was in front of me. 

It wasnt until this last month, I pushed her away without me realized it.

I lost her.

I lost my soulmate. 

I reached out to the veterans crisis hotline and for the past 10 days I've stopped drinking, I've been doing my best to stop cussing, to stop having any form of negativity in my life, I needed to change and I need to do a complete 180°.

I am working to be a better man, I wish I had this crisis during my time with (D) maybe she would still be here with me. I was so blind at the time and I am left with regret and mourn. It was too late and I know now what I have done.

I have been going to the programs the VA has, I've been doing my best to stay alone and heal my soul. Theres many times I want to go Online, many times I want to find someone, any distraction, even porn but NO. I cannot go down that downward spiral. I refuse to be the demon I once was. I dont want to lie, I dont want to take advantage, I dont want to be this horrible person that I once was. 

I will continue to go to these programs, I will continue to fight these urges, I will continue to be a better man and find my place.

I am sorry (D) I ask that you forgive me

785,"Hello! I’m in a downward spiral and need any advice I can get. I am a woman in her early 20s who currently lives at home, solely due to the fact that my parents refuse to allow me to move out without being married. I’m in my last year of college and was already planning on moving out after this year, by telling them I found a job out of state.

My parents are horrible, horrible people in some aspects. I grew up in a highly abusive household (mostly physically between my parents but sometimes towards the kids) and emotionally abusive and oppressive as well. Over the last couple of years my household has settled down, but I was a large part of this. I act as the general counselor of the house and my dad has learned to use his words more than his hands. My mom is happier as well, but knows when I leave that things might resort to how they were and that my dad might kill her. I don’t know how true this is, but it has been enough to keep me here. She refuses to leave him.

I have around $5000 saved up. I have amazing people who have offered me to live with them, but I am considering looking on Craigslist and even shelters at this point. I’m just scared. I have two younger sisters at home and they haven’t had to deal with them how I have. I’m afraid the house will become toxic again because of me but I can’t stay here. I’m not even allowed to take antidepressants, which were prescribed to me after I tried to commit suicide a few years back. I wake up everyday trying to think of reasons to keep living and hold out for one more year, but I’m running out of them.

What do I do? I’m not a minor, so I know I can just leave...but it’s so much harder than it seems. Do I ask the police to escort me out of the house? Do I stick it out? I don’t know. I don’t know anything.

tl;dr I’m in a household that I emotionally keep together, but I need to move out for my own sake. How should I proceed?",11Aug2019,3
786,Sorry if this all over the place. I’m having a panic attack. My boyfriend broke up with me today and told me he’s suicidal and is not replying anymore. I have called 30 times.

787,"Girl and I had sex and the next day she told me she was regretting it because she was still hurt from her last relationship and the fact that I had left out of no where from before (long story but was dealing with family drama and didn’t want to put it on her so I just left). 

I assume this was because I asked if we were dating at that point. 

I said I’m sorry that you feel that way and I apologized that things moved kind of fast. 

I told her that I’d be supportive towards her and whatever decisions she makes and that I’m alright with taking it slow and just being friends. 

She told me ok and thank you but I’m kind of paranoid about it.

However, since she is starting middle school, I want to get her to stop wearing childish things because she will be made fun of. I have tried telling her that other kids in middle school don't think it's cool to be childish and she is going to have to start being more mature.

790,I had a sexual thought about a little girl a week ago after I watched a bunch of videos on pedophiles and predators being caught. I don’t know why it happened it just did. I thought about killing myself because I would never harm a child and I don’t want to be afraid for the rest of my life that I would. I don’t want to be labeled as a pedophile for the rest of my life. I’m just afraid of being alone with children now. I’m just so scared of telling my Mom because this is not something AT ALL normal about me AT ALL. I was a funny lightheaded young girl but now all I want to do is cry everyday. If I tell my mom she definitely won’t take it lightly. I’m afraid she’ll call me a monster and be ashamed of me and embarrassed to have ever called me her daughter. She loves me more than anyone in the world and I just don’t know how to tell her that the thoughts won’t stop. Because I don’t want to think about children this way. It’s not who I am. If it goes well she might tell my doctor and try and help me stop thinking this way because it’s been hurting my physical and mental health. But if it goes bad... I don’t know what she’ll do. Please tell me what to do so my suffering can end and so I can finally be happy and get the help I want and desperately need. I would never be capable to hurt or harm a child but these thoughts just won’t leave.,11Aug2019,19
791,"It's midnight and my mum isn't home yet, what should I do?

I am currently on holiday in Turkey in the Marmaris district, although I will be more specific if my mum isn't home soon. Today was a festival here in Turkey so my mum went out. I can't remember what time but it was past 4pm. Although it was a festival, it isn't really. It is a day where we greet eachother and stay up later than normal. No party or anything, my mum just wanted to go out.

This isn't really relevant, and I need to get to the point. It is now midnight and my mum still isn't home. I don't have much else to say. My mum took her phone with her and there is no hotel phone. The streets seem very quiet right now. I would have though she'd be back by now. I was diagnosed with Paranoia when I was 11 but this seems like a rational thing to worry about, which makes it even scarier. I feel helpless. If i blow this off and say that my mum is just a bit late but she is actually in danger for whatever reason, she could die and I might just be sitting her denying myself, or if I react, there could be unnecessary complications with police and what not.

792,"I have a person stalking me due to my political opinions, it’s quite funny but it’s starting to get annoying. What all would blocking him achieve? Would he still be able to stalk my profile?",11Aug2019,0
794,"So I've been talking to this guy since March, last month we made things official and we lasted for 2 days. He ended up blocking me and said all of this rude stuff to my best friend. He told her that he was just in it for the booty pics. And yes, I did send them and now I look at it I'm quite idiotic for that. (He has screenshots of them.) And before you ask, no he isn't a pedo or a catfish. I've facetimed him many times and been in calls. So he broke up with me out of nowhere saying he just lost feelings for me. It's been 9 days since our breakup. I was in the phase where I was really angry at him. 2 days ago he messaged me saying that he missed me, I ended up yelling at him and he said whatever he just wanted to say sorry. He is toxic, he lied that my best friend showed her tits to him. He's lied about a whole lot, while me and him were a thing not official he told me he had sex with a girl. I was sort of hurt from that. (It's not his first time having sex either) He brags about all these girls that are into him and stuff while me and him weren't official but we were talking. He didn't talk about the girls when we dated. Now, We have each other blocked on every single social media and I blocked his number too. Except I don't have him blocked on Snapchat but he has me blocked on Snapchat, and I have him blocked on Instagram but he doesn't have me blocked on Instagram. And that's where we went wrong, I can still contact him and he can still contact me by a simple unblock button. When I feel like I miss him a whole lot I unblock him on Instagram and send a quick dm. I've only done this once and he's only messaged me that he missed me once.  And I have a feeling we will do this a whole lot in the near future. Like I can't really live without talking to him, but if me and him remain as friends it will drive me crazy. I always think about him and we've been broken up for over one week now. I just want him back because when we were together and dating he did treat me right. I don't know if I should tell him how I feel I'm just scared he doesn't want me back. My close friends hate him a lot they say he made me emotionally unstable and stuff. But no other boy has loved me like he did and me and him haven't ever met. We just had this connection and I find it hard to believe he just lost his feelings for me just like that. Any advice on how to recover from a breakup? Or should I text him how I feel? Like I'm just really stuck at this point and all I really want is to get him back honestly.",11Aug2019,1
795,"Ok, so this may be long. Scroll along if you want. The past week: extended family member commits suicide. Husband’s coworker commits suicide. ( I am someone who attempted and was discovered  by police before I completed the act.) This brings to a very bad place in my mind.  I have a teen daughter who said something incredibly hurtful. I know she didn’t mean it, but she tends to not give a fuck about my feelings. Husband has decided to start taking to an ex-girlfriend I hate. Mother  has major medical crap going on and waiting to find out more biopsy results. One of my best friends is moving this week. I also spent more thank I can afford on my kid and have no way to pay it back. I’m pretty sure I’m at the end of my rope. I have never asked for advice before bc I’m pretty damn private and I’m  so done. What do I do?",11Aug2019,3
796,"Here we go again, another post in r/Advice asking about “relationship advice”, but I’ve no other idea where to turn as all my friends are seemingly useless when it comes to these things (all bicker with each other and give different opinions, never agreeing on anything). As you’ve probably guessed by now, I’ve got a pretty big crush on a friend of mine. Even though we’ve only been friends for around a month, I feel we have a very... complicated relationship between the two of us. Over the past month we have hung out every week at least twice. We’ve gone to our state fair, we go to parks together at night, we’ve gone to movies, or just run errands, almost always blasting music in the car and jamming out together. She’s someone I feel like I can comfortably be myself around and she won’t judge me. When we hang out there have been more than one occasion’s where we’re laying together and watching a movie and my arm is around her and she’s laying on me, just recently we were stargazing on a trail together and she got startled by a branch falling in the trees, and that ended up with us holding hands the rest of the way back, I couldn’t wipe my smile off my face. It all seems really good right? Well, this is where my uncertainty comes into play. Except for the very first time we hung out at a beach, I’ve initiated almost all of the times since then (with probably two exceptions). Also, when we’re together (as in “in person”) I feel so connected to her, but after we’re not anymore I feel like she kind of drops off the planet. I’ll have texted her or Snapchatted her and stay on delivered for hours, all while she’ll be online and talking to other people. I promise I’m not like stalking her or anything, I just checked out of curiosity once and started to notice a pattern. We’re likely hanging out tonight and I want to tell her how I feel but there’s part of me telling me to hold back. I don’t know what I would even begin to say, and I really care about having her in my life. Help me out of this rut?

TLDR: Caught feelings fast and hard, and there’s possible connection thrown in with a lot of mixed signals. I don’t want to ruin what we already have between us.",11Aug2019,3
797,"I'm (33f) Divorced. 2 early teenage children. I get no child support. I get no help from the gov't anymore. Not even foodstamps or HUD. These aren't options for me anymore. I could get disability, if I had the time to wait the year or more it would take to get a decision. I've applied and been denied 7 times. 

I have Ehler's Danlos Syndrome-Hypermobility type. I have GERD, POTS, MCAS, Severe Asthma, arthritis throughout my body in various joints. I've had two major joint repair surgeries within the last year. Right ankle, two cadaver ligament grafts anchored to the bone. Also, my right shoulder anchored in three places. They removed my bursa, because it had advanced bursitis, 1cm of my clavicle due to arthritis. They did a capsular shift to try to get my humeral head to regenerate, because my shoulder was so lax it was rubbing the bone raw on other bones in my shoulder. Also repaired the muscle cap and reattached my bicep tendons. I'd been walking around with both things messed up and getting worse all the time for a bout 10 years before they fixed them, and I use that term loosely with regards to my shoulder. Which still pains me a considerable amount, even though it's been just over a year since surgery. I haven't let them look at the other shoulder yet, though I assume it's in just about as bad of condition, given the amount of pain I feel with it.  

I had a husband that was making good money and so I was able to have these surgeries and keep my home, children, and animals well fed and happy....my husband just didn't love us like we could ever understand. He was from another country. (Romania) They make people a bit harder there. He'd seen too much. He'd been raised in such a different way, and his idea of help was to yell over you as you lay on the ground after slipping and hitting your knee, that he TOLD you that you would hurt yourself. He TOLD you and you didn't LISTEN!

 He said cruel things about my children, their weight. He picked on my daughter especially, because she's the oldest, 14. He would say to me in private that she was nothing to him. She was just my daughter. My mean daughter. Even though she was and is not mean at all. She's one of the most kind people you'd ever meet. She's a magnificent artist and a beautiful singer. She's a strong, and empathetic leader to her section in choir. She's an honors student. Nothing he said made sense to me. I couldn't ever reason how he could make me such promises about my children when he was still overseas and then when he finally got to be with them, his style of parenting just wasn't the same as mine. I don't think shame is a good tool to teach children anything. Neither will forcing them to only eat his approved diet plan. We are all a bit fluffy, but it's deep into the culture of my family to be a seeker of the yummy foods. It's a habit I've tried hard to break in all of us, but my parents are heavily involved with my children and spoil them like all Southern grandparents tend to do. He would call them murderers for taking the children to get ice cream. I'd watched once as suddenly my son's happy face smoothed down into a hard stare. I could always feel the room being sucked of joy when my husband was in it. I asked him to leave after he'd only been in the States for 6 months. We'd taken quite enough of his abuse. I reached a breaking point. He continued to pay the bills in the house, because he wanted us to be okay, he said. I felt like he was trying to bribe me not to report him to USCIS for duping me into marrying him so he could be here. It felt like he was that way on purpose. Who knows if that's true or not. It's just my feelings on the matter. 

It wasn't a good match. He stopped paying the bills last month. I was confident I made enough hours to maintain it. After all, I had two part-time jobs for the first time in over ten years. I was not only doing one thing to make a bit of money, but two! I delivered flowers, and I did some clerical work for a management team. Plot twist, my boss from the management team, buys the flower shop I work at, and gives me more hours because he wanted to do deliveries himself at the flower shop.....Capitalist, corporate kind of guy, my former boss. His choice to let me go was fueled by the fact that he'd taken on serious debt from the previous owner of said flower shop. He was a bit foolhardy if you ask me, thinking he could take a little shop in a little town and turn it into something BIG. Within two weeks of him taking ownership, I am now notified that I no longer have a job. Via text. 

I have no current prospects. Our area is heavily manufacturing, where all my physical restrictions would be impossible...This clerical gig was the best I'd ever done at having something that I can be paid for that would allow me to live. He cut me because I was the 2nd highest paid person in his employ. I understand the business side of it, but it's still cruel. I have nothing to depend on, and only a few various skills, no formal education beyond a GED and a few years of nursing school. I can't pass a drug test because I use marijuana for the pain as an alternative to the litany of opioids my doctors would happily give me. I unfortunately live in a state where it is still illegal. I'm sure everyone will say that this is a stupid choice for someone in my position, but I'll tell you that without my smoking habit, I wouldn't be functional enough to even have a job, let alone keep one. It's the only thing I've ever found that actually helps me enough to keep me going and doesn't give me a habit that could ruin my health and my entire life. I could write an entire book dedicated to my thanks to the Mary Jane for allowing me to move and be present for my children. I know it's no easy task that I ask of you, dear reader, but it's my heart, and I can do nothing else for it.  

I'm feeling quite pathetic right about now.

Quite low and trapped in a sea adrift the shadows of doubt and pain. 

I have no one to turn to. My parents will not help me financially. I cannot do state aid as I've said. I need some alternative beyond phone sex or cam girl (I've done both, I cannot do it again. It's not me. It makes me feel too filthy. Too manipulated by the greedy hands of faceless men.) 

If there's anyone out there that can give me a real, workable solution to this...Some kind of job that won't physically tax me, that I can perhaps do at home via the internet? I've looked into transcription, I can't quite type fast enough to pass the tests.... What else is there? I can sing, but HA, who's going to care? I might be a bit funny...but that's not quite enough to bank on.... 

What can I do??",11Aug2019,1

My mom has been supportive of my diet and all that, but my grandma has been... well... something.  I’ve recently become a vegetarian and every time she makes a meal, she accuses me of “not loving her” enough to eat the plate she made me, despite me being on this diet for a month.  A habit that I hate is that she will bring me food ALL THE TIME.  I understand that it’s out of love, but I wish she wouldn’t freak out over me not touching the plate of cookies she brought.  I wish I could do more exercise too, but I’m not allowed to go on a jog because “it’s dangerous to be outside alone.”  All in all, how do I convince one of the most stubborn people in the world to leave me alone and let me do my thing?

806,"sorry for the long ass title but essentially what it says on the tin. i recently had a conversation with 2 of my friends (a group of 8) where we all agreed and talked about how we’ve been feeling for a long time about this one friend. he turns every conversation around to what he talks about by interjecting both online and off, and tends to dump a lot of heavy conversation on us and then brush it off like we shouldn’t be stressed about being his personal therapist. he’s also gotten very (passive) aggressive and quick to anger without any of us prompting anything to actually be angry about. there were many very sincerely angry messages sent back and forth about whether or not a non dairy drink had water in it or not. he was the only person getting angry. 

we aren’t trying to cut him out of our group, but he’s gotten very unbearable in the past couple months and i’m not quite sure how to bring it up. i’m on the closest people to him and the least likely to get a flat out fit in response if i bring it up, but i guess the advice i’m looking for is how to bring it up to him and how to word things to keep the meltdowns to a minimum.",11Aug2019,1

I’m 100% not ugly at all. I believe I’m above average in looks and can be handsome if I dress well. I been told I’m good looking by friends, family and others. In fact a gay guy pull over and hit on me a couple of weeks ago saying “you’re so handsome, let me take you out please, if you got a girl she’s so lucky”. Gave me an ego boost but then nothing. I rejected him since I’m straight of course.

What can I do? I also notice that when I’m confident, I project it and notice people treat me better and girls seem to like that, but rarely I feel confident.

808,"So here's a very short version of a very very very long story. I had a really big argument with my dad that resulted in him forcing me to have my mom pick me up from his house, and effectively kicked me out (my parents are divorced). A few months went by where I did not talk to him. Eventually I was pretty much forced into talking where we got into another argument. He briefly apologized over the misunderstanding that led to everything, but that was not enough for me. I couldn't do it anymore. He gets way too mad over things and has anger issues. Overall, I'd say he was a narcissist. I tried telling him that I couldn't deal with it anymore and he needs to at least try to change, and I reassured him I wasn't coming back until he did something. He told me that I have no right to tell him what to do and I was ""being a baby"" and stuff. It ended with him leaving after I assured him I was serious about not coming back if he does not change. It wasn't even like a ""we can try this later"" exit, he left saying ""it was nice knowing ya"". I balled my eyes out after he left

A few months later after little to no contact other than when my dog at his place was sick, he tried talking to me again. He said that he's willing to try and work on his issues but he needs my help. I left saying ""I'll think about it."" I was left in a really confused state. On one hand, if he had said this months ago, everything would be fine. But he didn't. It took him literally leaving for months and effectively leaving me for good out of stubbornness for him to finally try something. Do you know how much that hurt me? I don't even know how or if to forgive him for that.

821,"I’m a 17m (was 16 at the time of story). So about last year in june I met this girl that I CRUSHED over like it was bad, A lot of guys crushed on this girl because she literally has such an amazing personality and she is so beautiful. So i started talking to her and we kinda slowly gained traction, she although had just broken up with someone so she wanted time to recover but she didn’t mind me talking and slightly flirting with her. At the end of July she had finally decided she was over her ex and ready to date me. So i asked her out on like July 29 or something like that, We dated for a while and did normal couple things. My love for her was not to have sex, I genuinely loved spending time with her doing anything. So at this point i was like this is amazing i love her so much I hope we stay together for a while, but around October - November we were kinda having some bumps in our relationship and she kinda fell into the wrong friend group. This friend group doing drugs constantly and having sex all the time, you know those kinda teenagers. So she slowly lost feelings for me and my heart was slowly getting torn into pieces. She broke up with me on the 7th of December, I didn’t want to do it because i loved her to much and she just finally come to the conclusion she didn’t want to hurt me anymore. The next month was a living hell, I never realized one person could be so depressed. I needed to find something to help my depression and to scared to tell my parents i turned to weed, Although i know i shouldn’t have I did (I have sense stopped). After the new year started I kinda came to a realization that i didn’t really care anymore, so I stopped smoking and ever sense I have not had feelings like i don’t know how to explain it. I’ve cried once in 8 months and i used to cry every time i tried to yell at someone (i’m a very shy person). I haven’t found anyone sense then that i remotely think is cute and i would want to date. Its now summer and my ex finally stopped hanging out with her old friends, she got some help and has fixed up her act a lot and i’ve heard from a few people that she missed me kind of, So i’m not sure if I should go back and maybe that would fix my emotions or is there anything i can do? (I know this sounds stupid because it’s my first serious relationship)

822,"Nearly a week ago I quit the sport I truly love, soccer. I quit my high school team going into my junior year of high school, I have a lot of potential but I started losing interest and passion for the sport and had simply gotten burnt out. I also wanted to try a new sport and work during the fall season. I wasn’t enjoying playing for the program anymore and the last straw for me was when the coach made me swing jv and varsity which is what I did last year and I know I massively improved. I hate playing in jv games because I’m not challenged anymore and it’s just boring. Even though I will still most likely play a lot in varsity. I started to dread practices and scrimmages all summer and would crack under the immense pressure of my coaches and teammates because of how good a program we are (we win a state championship nearly every year). I love soccer and I would like to keep playing but I really need a break so I quit. Now I don’t know if I regret my decision or not but I do know I miss soccer. I have the option to join back from my coach but I don’t know if I should take this and I’m running out of time stressing about this decision. This may be the biggest decision of my life because I’ve dedicated my whole life to soccer in the past few years. Should I continue with this break  and stop playing soccer for a while in general? Should I join the team again and possibly be unhappy? Should I join a club team or league and just take this whole season off from high school and maybe play next season as a senior? Is the glory of playing in a state championship game even worth it? I don’t know if I care enough. I’m very lost and confused right now and in desperate need of advice and help.

824,"**(May be uncomfortable for some people, very personal)**

I'll probably just start the story from the beginning, but it's pretty long. Please be patient with me, because even typing this out makes me sick to my stomach.

I'm 16 right now. I have a ""brother"" who is two years older than me. Through his teenage years he got very edgy and wouldn't speak to me about anything. I didn't really care and got used to it, since I had other things to focus on and knew that it was pretty normal. During the summer leading into my 9th grade year, we went on a family vacation, and I think I mentioned Overwatch or something which led him to start talking to me again when we got home. I was surprised but pretty happy, we actually had a lot in common so it was nice to actually interact with him again. This went on for a couple of days until he asked me a strange question.

It was early in the morning and my mom had left to go shopping. He came into my room and we starting talking about life, asking each other what we thought of our parents and the like. After a bit, it got a little weirder: he asked me if I was a lesbian, saying that I never seemed to have much of an interest in boys (I don't, but I don't really have an ideal label at the moment so I usually just say I'm not straight). Then, he asked me what it was like to have boobs, to which I, having become a bit uncomfortable at this point, said ""They're just kinda there, you know?""

Then, he asked me if he could see them. He was 16, I was 14. I froze, picked up my cat, and moved to the other side of the room, simply saying ""No?""

He apologized, saying he was sorry if he had made me uncomfortable and suggested that we go downstairs and play Roblox. However, before he left, he said, ""Don't tell Mom about this, okay?"" We stopped talking again shortly afterwards.

I went through 9th grade in constant fear of what he would do to me if I said anything. We went to the same school up until recently, and I had to walk to the bus with him every morning. I started going to therapy about a week after he asked me, but I didn't tell my doctor because I knew he would have to tell my parents. I did speak to a handful of friends about the incident, but I didn't say anything to anyone who could do anything until he pulled something else.

About a year later, I was getting ready to go to an art show where my mother was displaying her work. We had gone out to the store and left my brother alone home a few hours before, and I noticed that something was off. I had a certificate hanging on the wall near my window, but it had been moved right above my bed. There was a small hole drilled through it into the wall where our bedrooms were connected (his closet is right next to my left bedroom wall). I panicked, but asked my mother if she knew about it. He heard and stated that he had accidentally tripped and drilled a hole while trying to hang up a poster. (the hole: [https://imgur.com/Ju9bs0F](https://imgur.com/Ju9bs0F) [https://imgur.com/0MCiaNu](https://imgur.com/0MCiaNu))

Here's why that's bullshit:

1. The wall is a foot or two thick, so how would he have drilled into my room from his?
2. There was a hole in his closet in the same place as my wall. They were unconnected, which means that he had to have gone into my room and drilled in an attempt to connect the two.
3. The hole was perfectly straight. If he had tripped, the drill would have gone all over the place.
4. His closet is crowded as hell and only for storage, so why would he be putting up a poster in there anyways?

I kept my mouth shut, but I was anxious the whole time that we were at the gallery. On the way home, I asked my mom if I could email my therapist, and a while later, I told him everything that had happened. He did have to tell my parents, and called Child Protective Services as well (who really have yet to do anything).

On the way back from therapy, we got a call from him saying that he was in the hospital. He was lucky enough to have his lung collapse and got off scot free, receiving all the sympathy from people who didn't know better. 

More recently, he graduated. I ended up exploding at my father, having kept all of my resentment towards him locked up for the past year and being sick and tired of him not receiving any punishment. He suggested that we have a family meeting at some time to discuss it with my brother there. We agreed that when I was more comfortable with doing so that we would. However, my dad randomly started this meeting without any warning only a little bit later. My brother said that he knew what he was being ""accused of"", saying that my hatred towards him was unfair because he harbored no hatred for me (what did I do, exactly? We may never know!). Even reading out my diary entries from the day that he first asked to see my boobs apparently wasn't enough to jog his memory. He simply said, ""It was two years ago, according to you! How was I supposed to remember?"" When asked about the hole, he stuck to his excuse of tripping. After more passive aggressive shit from my side, I left saying, ""Oh, sorry! He was right the whole time! Can't you see that he doesn't remember? That means that it never happened! Just lump me in with all those feminists trying to ruin people's lives! I admit it, I just hate men so much that I lied about the whole thing! He's obviously correct, since he doesn't remember!""

Now, he's going to college. He's going to get a job as some sports broadcaster, get married, and rape his daughter. All I'll have to say about it is ""I told you so.""

Besides my case, he also has a bunch of weird pedo anime shit in his room, including figures of Madoka Kaname and Homura Akemi (both 14), a bunch of manga starring more little underage anime girls, and a Monika (DDLC) plush that he upskirted ([https://imgur.com/e26DM8b](https://imgur.com/e26DM8b)). My parents apparently do not take this as a warning sign.

Speaking of my parents: they get mad when I speak negatively of him because they're incredibly Christian and believe that I should forgive him at some point. They became a bit more understanding since my family meeting, but they still don't want me to tell the rest of my family about it and are basically leaving him to become a social degenerate. 

Basically, what I'm asking with this post is, how do I deal will all of the feelings of revenge that I have towards him? I literally want to murder him, I hate him so much. He's still going to college regardless of his CPS record (which I doubt the college has even seen), my cousins still love him, he still has friends, my parents still trust him, and it pisses me off. I hate seeing him happy, I hate when he likes things that I like, and I hate his weeaboo incel virgin ass behavior. I hate the fact that he has free range to rape, creep on, molest, ect. other girls once he leaves home because no one is holding him accountable for what he did to me. I hate that there's nothing I can do about it because no one actually cares about these kind of things. I hate that the only place I can go for any more advice about this is fucking Reddit. 

It's not even just about personal experience at this point. It's about protecting other women from him. But if I can't even do that, I'll feel guilty for the rest of my life.",11Aug2019,0

827,"I'm 15 and i've known my parents aren't in love since i was about seven. I haven't seen them kiss in probably four or more years.
 
My father has obvious mental health issues that refuse to be addressed (control freak, anger issues). My mom admits this but writes it off as ""just how he is"" or ""being his mother's son"" (my grandma was a very assertive woman) despite it making her miserable. My father disrespects boundaries (for example whenever i tell him i dislike being touched/hugged, he tells me to fuck off and implies i'm some heartless bitch,) and is a general asshole to me and my mother (will tell me to fuck off and call me a bitch / idiot without second thought when angry, and he gets angry very easily).

I don't consider him abusive, just an asshole. He walks around the house with such a strong and disruptive presence, and doesn't understand privacy or the concept of being disruptive (for example me and my mother may be watching a serious/sad show, he'll enter the room, fully opening the door, standing in a cowboy-like stance and just announce himself loudly for no reason when we are clearly engaged in something and any normal person would understand they are being disruptive.) This disruptive habit of inserting himself where he doesn't belong wouldn't be  so bad if his presence didn't make me extremely uncomfortable.

He also eavesdrops VERY frequently (at quite literally all times), randomly adding to a conversation (usually with some unwanted or obnoxious opinion) from the next room over when the people speaking weren't even aware he was listening. He doesn't understand that this is invasive, disruptive and creepy (i feel like i'm being watched all the time), and if he is called out on it will become very angry and tell me or my mother to fuck off.

He NEVER apologizes for ANYTHING and sees himself as a saint. My mother clearly feels similarly to me, but won't admit that her husband is a shithead.

It'd be far more healthy for us to have a home of our own. How to i make my mother face her unhappiness and face it head on, leaving a man she doesn't love?

keep in mind
•my father is almost 60 and my mother is mid-50s
•my mother is catholic and from the country and seems very uncomfortable with anything out of the ordinary such as divorce and being honest with herself  (only in terms of her own life; she is accepting of others.)
•my mother makes significantly less than my father (hairdresser vs successful salesman)


TLDR: my mom kinda really dislikes my father, i do too, itd be way healthier to get divorced than to stsy together, idk how to make her see how miserable she is, what do?

828,"Thinking about all the arguments and problems I had with my Ex. I realized a trend that went on after a while. 

So, it goes like this:

\-She does something that triggers an emotion. 

\-I get upset and tell her why she's doing this and what I'm needing at that specific moment. 

\-She responds either negatively or dismissive about it. 

\-I get emotional that instead of her working with me, she gets annoyed and avoidant. 

\-That talk turns into a long boring talk about me trying to tell her what I feel and what she did to trigger it.

\-She is now insulted, took everything I said as an attack. So she avoids me, disappears and straight up leaves me.

\-Now my trigger became an anxiety, seeing how the whole thing escalated to a tragedy, afraid that this relationship is going to turn to a breakup. I apologize and tell her to forget I said anything. 

\-She still stays quiet, holding that pissed off, dismissive, annoyed attitude. 

\-I completely give up on asking her to meet that first original need and instead I try to comfort her, talk to her, reason with her, satisfy her needs instead.

After a while, she says I'm all drama and I overreact and she can't tolerate that. I agree and admit that I have a problem, I can't hold my emotions but I tell her that she triggers all these things in me when she becomes so avoidant and unaffectionate. 

She says I'm still turning the blame on her when it's clearly me, the one who started the whole thing.

I've lived with other people before but he hasn't. This will be his first time ever living with anyone outside of his parents, before this he had a studio.

I already live in the 1 bd apartment, and I tried to move everything around so that he had his ""own"" spaces in the different rooms. I thought that would be enough but my boyfriend has this kind of extreme notion of ""alone time"" when he's gaming. 

Essentially he doesn't want me around at all when he's gaming with his friends, there has only been a handful of times that I've been at his place where he would go online with them with me present. When he plays, it's from like 7pm - 12 am.

So, this guy SUPPOSEDLY (everything from here on out screams scam and she sent money by bitcoin in almost every situation!) is 60 something from Sweden, his wife died in childbirth. When they first started talking he needed extra data packs on his phone so she'd send small amounts so they could talk. Then he got sick, then his aunt got sick and finally his son got sick and she was told the son needed to get a kidney transplant. Then her daughter found out (took account control) and since she couldn't come up with another $10,000 to help, his son supposedly died. She already feels terrible guilt about that probable BS. He supposedly was going to the Arctic to supervise work on a pipeline and earn $500,000 from this one job and on the way ""back home"" he supposedly got kidnapped by 3 men with guns in an Alaska airport.

Now they've brought it down to $5,000 but she can't get ahold of that much.

840,"Hi

I am a 20 year old student (male) and over the last few months I have completly lost control over my life and actions.
Lets start from when I began my studies. I used to go to uni regularly and learned for 2-3 subjects on a daily basis. I went to the gym every second day and I tried to follow a diet as good as possible. 
Soon the first semester ended and my second semester began. Everything started off very normal but I stopped hitting the gym. Soon I started playing League of Legends again (which I had quit 1 year ago after realizing I was addicted) and I pretty much got addicted again. I was playing for hours as soon as I woke up and just wasted week after week. I didnt do anything for Uni, for myself and it was all getting worse after.
Now this is the part where I lost control.
I tried to say to myself I would stop playing and go to uni instead and fix everything again. Didn't work. I couldn't even wake up early anymore, I started staying up late (until 2am) watching tv shows and youtube and slept until 10am.
In contrary, in my first semester I went to sleep at 00:00 and woke up at 6:00 every day. 
I started doing less and less and the more I told myself I would do smth, the less I did it. I didnt train, I didnt study, I didnt go out, I didnt read any books... 
Soon exam time came around and I somehow forced my self to write 3/5 exams which I hope to pass (and even for those I forced an entire semester of knowledge into my brain in 3 days).
Basically I now hate myself and I dont know why this happened to me and how to escape. 
It damaged my relationship with my parents and most imortantly with my-self... Everytime I say I want to change something, it just never happens. I heard that this could be caused by depression but I dont think I have depression.
The same goes for porn... I can stop myself from watching porn. I dont have a problem whith porn, but I hate to know I dont have a say over my actions. 

Has anyone ever been in a Situation like this and escaped? And how should I proceed?
I have semester break now and Im pretty much free until october, I will be working though. I hope that having a regualar schedule will fix me. But I dont want to fall in the same hole again.

For some background info: We live in south central Kentucky, USA in a ~600 square foot apartment on the second floor. I have about 12 houseplants in the house (including a large fern), all in the livingroom, so my initial thought was that it could be pollen or fern spores. My boyfriend also uses a vape, and I thought it could potentially be residue from that. There is also the possibility of mold on the table since it is slightly more humid - again, from having houseplants.

The issue I have with all of these though is the fact that it is *only* on that one back (interior) wall, on the opposite side of the room from the plants, and we have never noticed residue of any kind from the vape before.

Any ideas on what this could be, and what we should do about it?",11Aug2019,3

Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

847,"So I'm an adult. I workout, I go to work, I keep my house clean, and I put others first more than I did when I was a teenager. I'm doing everything by the book, but I still don't ""feel"" like an adult and adult society still scares me. I still feel like a 14 year old, and I'm scared that the people I work with and the strangers I come across will find out and start treating me with less respect as a result. I'm into ""immature"" things like anime and emo music, which doesn't help me feel like a grown up, so I've trading interests like those for interests like classic rock and cop shows, but I can't bring myself to enjoy either of them. Long story short, how can I trick myself into feeling like an adult? If what I'm going through is impostor syndrome, how do I get rid of it?",11Aug2019,1
848,"I am very much an introvert. This doesn't mean I don't like socializing or anything, I just need my alone time is all. My mother doesn't seem to understand that.

I'm currently 17 and am in that awkward phase of trying to sort myself out before I become an adult. I get good grades (I even did my grade 12 academics in grade 11, last year, due to the IB program. I have dropped full IB as I needed room for the vocationals that would actually help me towards my dream career), I work two jobs, save a lot of money, have a few healthy hobbies etc. I think I'm doing pretty well for a 17 year old, my mom thinks otherwise. Whenever I have free time, I like to stay in my room and watch a movie, play some video games, write (currently working on a custom D&amp;D campaign), whatever. I just want to relax by myself, especially considering I work 2 jobs where I have to interact with people all the time (one of my jobs is retail and that is socially exhausting, as some of you may know). Recently, I've been playing a lot of Hearthstone seeing as the new expansion came out. Since that game is a mobile game, if I'm not doing anything else, I'll play a few games. Sometimes I'll play at the table while I'm having breakfast or lunch, and this bugs my mom a lot for some reason. My family is incredibly dysfunctional and we typically don't eat together, it's sort of a ""every man for himself"" kind of deal, so it's not like I'm playing a game right in front of someone's face. That would be rude. Then, my mom turns right around and goes to the living room to watch the same 3 tv shows while she eats her meal. I little hypocritical but whatever. It's when she accuses me of having an addiction that bothers me the most. I believe I play a healthy amount of video games, no more than she watches TV. She assumes that whenever I'm not with the family, I'm playing Hearthstone. For the record, that is probably the most casual game I'm into, because I know I play a lot more super smash bros. She doesn't seem to understand that I'm introverted and don't want to hang around the rest of my family after spending a whole week bouncing between jobs. I also don't like being around her because she's incredibly toxic, but that's a different story.

Tl;dr: My mom thinks that because I don't want to spend my free time around the rest of my family, I must have a video game addiction. In reality, I'm just introverted and burnt out from working 2 jobs all summer.

853,"**Backstory:** My parents immigrated from another country when I was a 2 years old, leaving behind an aunt, uncles, cousins, etc and I never met any of them until I returned to said country last year (at 32) to take my mom (who was dying of cancer at the time) and visit. My mom and her sister in particular were close but growing up, I had zero relationship with her because we lived in the U.S and they lived in my home country. When I met her last year, so much warmth emanated from my aunt and I just instantly fell in love with her. She's in early 60s. 

So my mom died a couple months ago, and unbeknownst to me, she had been allowing her sister living in the home country to collect her social security in that country (she had been working up until 40 years old and was entitled to it). I think it ended up being about $150 USD. My mom was disabled and on a very fixed income herself, so it's incredible that she was able to still give her sister money. When my mom died, my aunt had to report it to the government and stopped receiving this assistance. I'm not sure about her and my uncle's financial situation, but I don't think it's great. She's the only one that supports them and she works extremely hard. The $150 USD that they received reduced their burden somewhat. 

**My question:** Should I take on the responsibility of sending her money now? My husband and I make decent money and sending $150-$200 a month to them would be soooo much more worth it than eating out or whatever other garbage we'd spend it on. However...I'm really nervous about proposing this to my aunt because I don't want to offend her. I'm having a hard time seeing this objectively and whether or not it's offensive. And how should I say it/bring it up? Also I'm slightly nervous about starting this precedence and being worried about what happens if/when my financial situation changes. She's a very warm and kind person but I just don't want to ruin our budding relationship by ASSUMING they need/want my help :-/

Even when I do want to make friends I don't really understand why I need friends or what friends are for. I understand that friends need to be loyal, trustworthy, honest and that they care for you, but that is just the bare minimum - other than that, I don't even know if there's m

&amp;#x200B;

When I observe other people's friendships I notice that some use friends as crutches to get through life, some have friends because they want to feel accepted and are looking for validation, some people cannot solve problems by themselves and need external help whether it is something simple like solving a math question or improving oneself. ""Friends should be people who make you into a better person,"" is what I've been told, but currently, I do not want to seek for friends because I need someone to help me get through life, or to let me know that I'm loved. So what should I look for in a friend?

I am 16 years old and interested in making friends. I have had friends in the past, but I don't think they made me into a better person, I was always burdened with their problems and their failures. I did try to help them, but they only dragged me down into their negative lifestyle. I enjoyed their company, and I miss them but I know that being with them only made my life spiral down. Anyways, if you noticed from the last sentence, I am no longer friends with them. That is because I had to move away due to my parent's decision and I think that was for the better because I am a much better person than who I used to be. I know myself now, I focus on making myself a better person, I read books and try to learn more about the world, and I've become more confident. I've found self-acceptance, self-respect, self-love and independence - the things my last friends took away from me.

I'm an engineer now, and I'm glad I went to engineering school, but I can't help but feeling like I wasted all of the social opportunities that college presented.   
  
I didn't meet any friends in college. I had maybe a few typical ""college"" experiences, but really didn't get out much. Now, I'm a few years removed from college, and I really regret it. It's not like I was spending all of my time studying or anything, I just didn't get out much (or at all, really.)  
  
I've always heard people say that ""college was the best time of my life"", and I really don't think that's necessarily a good thing, but I do believe that there's a lot of people out there that would say that college was a great time in their life.   
  
Now, and I don't think I'm ""weird"" or anything, but now I feel like I kind of missed out on learning how to socialize. Don't get me wrong, I work with some good people and I think we all get along pretty well, but they're all much older than I am. It's hard living in a smaller city with no friends while working a job with people twice my age. I feel like I'm back in the same situation as before, except this time I'm not missing out on the ""college experience"",  I'm missing out on my 20's. It's scary being someone who's never been in a relationship when the clock is ticking. I know that everyone will say ""oh, you're young, you've got plenty of time."" But I feel like this every year. Every year I tell myself that I need to get out there and do something.  And every year I follow that by inaction, because I don't know where to start. I don't have any real interests apart from gaming, and I think that's really contributing to my problem. I'm happy when I'm playing games with my friends, not necessarily because of the games, but because I like spending time with people. For some reason, I'm just so afraid of new connections. I'm afraid to fail, I'm afraid that people will realize that I don't really have any friends, I'm just afraid.   
  
And the situation gets worse. As I get older, even if I meet someone, won't they think that there's something wrong with me for being a virgin? For not having had my first kiss? For having no real friends?  
  
I think I look pretty normal, but I'm so afraid of people finding out who I really am. I don't want people to find out how *behind* I am, socially speaking. But it's just going to get worse as time goes on. How do I break out of this?",11Aug2019,1

868,"I'm turning 25, and five months ago my serious long term relationship ended so I decided to work on myself. These are the things I want to complete before putting myself on the market again:

# Applying to new jobs

I've been applying to jobs since the breakup, and I've gotten more interviews than I can remember, but no job offers. These interviews are at **least** 3 sessions long, and they are exhausting.

My dream was always to be a software developer contributing to the code base of a software product, but I work as a business systems analyst (internal/enterprise web applications) in a telecommunications company.

The reason I don't get job offers is because of the technical tests. I've worked alone since I graduated with no mentorship, and I work with different technologies. I study and practice these technologies in my spare time but it's not enough.

# Improving my skills

I've been trying to find the skills I need to demonstrate to employers, and study/do projects based off of that. Doing this after working all day with one technology, then often again after work and on weekends has been exhausting after five months.

I do feel confident I can do these jobs, and I learn very fast,  but I cannot answer their questions confidently. Usually I can answer the questions up to some obscure usage that I'd normally just look in the documentation and implement in a heartbeat afterwards.

# Living situation

I'm working from home in a small room living with my parents in a city far from the tech community, and it's very lonely. At my current wage though, moving out will put me in poverty according to my government. I feel like that's irresponsible.

On top of all of this I've been going to the gym, to therapy, and a weekly card game (long drive away) for socialising.

**TLDR;** My plan was to originally get a new job which makes me happier and comes with a higher wage, which then allows me move out responsibly. Then when I move out, that will also make me happier, and will feel comfortable dating again. The problem is I'm getting quite unhappy and exhausted in the meantime.

I'm worried I'm wasting my youth, and I feel like I'm trapped. I'm scared. I need advice on what I should do, and how I can do them responsibly.",11Aug2019,1

I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

874,"My(25f) younger brother(20) is such a frustrating entitled little brat and I have never figured out where his entitlement came from. Some background info: my parents sent both of us to boarding schools for high school ( financial aid covered most of the tuition) , paid for some college for me when financial aid didn’t cover, and let me use the gas card till I was a senior in college. They also took out a loan for my brothers first year of college. It may sound like we were made of money, but my parents made us both work starting at 14, pay for our own cars. My parents are middle/lower class depending on the year but have always kept a roof and food as well as not letting us struggle. 

Onto the story: my brother messed up his freshman year of college with failing a few course and letting his gpa get too low to qualify for any financial aid. He avoided telling anyone, and even missed a chance to bring it up with a summer course. My mom facilitated a convo with the financial aid office for an appeal as my dad was going thro surgery at the end of the semester and all my brother had to do was talk to an advisor to get an academic plan in place to get back his aid, without he can not get any money or private loan for college this year. He has continually cussed out my parents and my parents have been trying to have me help when I don’t know what to say. My dad had emergency surgery again this week and is suppose to be home resting. Well my brother ruined that this morning, when my mom asked if he had done the academic plan yet. He cussed her out, then my dad (who wasn’t involved in this current fight due to being out of it still). It got my dad all worked up and wanting to kick him out of the house.

He'll often accuse us of keeping information from him, like my sister's SAT scores, when that information has been shared and gone through in detail; he's just forgotten it.  He refuses help, won't ask for help or communicate what he's doing, forgets things and then lashes out at my mom and I for ""keeping things from him"" or refusing to help him (occasionally he'll also lash out at my sister as well, but it's mostly my mom and I). 

He's also controlling of me and second guesses all of the decisions I make and the reasoning for those decisions. One example is relating to my post-secondary education. So I'd like to preface this with the fact that I realize that a lot of people are limited in terms of choices for college and practicality of degree. I'm privileged enough that I don't need to worry that much about affording college relative to many of the people I knew from high school. Basically, because he totally didn't understand the college process, he gave me really shitty advice, which contributed to me picking the wrong area of study and applying to the wrong schools, transferring prematurely to a school that was worse for me than where I started, and now he continues to try to make my decisions for me in terms of education. He's accused me of keeping him out of my research multiple times, and each time I reexplain everything in detail. He'll ask the same questions that he has before, and continues to be adversarial for keeping my methodology and the schools I'm looking at from him. Because he doesn't understand the modern college process, this takes a long time and I do tell him the schools that are promising anyway.  He doesn't have any financial skin in the game either. Despite my mom not being the breadwinner for the family, she and her parents are the ones who have saved for my education, my dad isn't paying for any of it. I'm paying for the rest through jobs and loans.

He refuses to do housework, and leaves it all for my mom and I. Occasionally he'll make dinner, but that's it. When my mom, sister and I cared for my grandmother when she was in hospice, we were gone for months and when we came back, absolutely no house work had been done at all, except for dishes occasionally. I mention this because it's frustrating especially when he's such a contributor to the mess around the house, and because I think it's a concerning behavior in conjunction with the other ways he's been acting.

He also won't talk to my mom and tries to get me to be his messenger. This is not something that both parents do, only him. He does this to my sister as well, and these are often things that my mom has already brought up with him or have already been discussed, or totally random things that nobody else would have done. He's also making horrible judgement calls, like he's taking my Uncle boar hunting now, even though he's never done it before and has only ever hunted deer.

He's also started talking to me about politics since he found out that I was interested. He says he wants to learn from me, but he frequently will interrupt me, talk over me, or disagree with data that I present to him. He also has started saying things like ""we need someone like Putin"" which makes him even more stressful to be around because those are some pretty concerning opinions to have.

I think that he has something going on that's keeping him from remembering things, communicating, etc but I'm not sure what to do about it, and he's so adversarial towards me that I don't like to be around him. I love him, but I absolutely hate being around him and it's making me feel very conflicted, but I have no idea what to do here. He doesn't trust me, anyway, and I'm kind of uneasy around him. He's hard to read and predict, and is only getting worse as he becomes more hostile towards me. He is getting older (57) but he's been this way a long time, I just thought it was normal. I don't think it's dementia or cognitive decline. I'm not sure what to do and I can't find that much on this online. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My dad is paranoid and hostile towards me as I've built a better relationship with my mom, which used to be very strained since he'd impressed on me that she was irrational and out to get him. He seems like he's making strange judgement calls, is forgetting things, and thinks that everyone is out to get him. I'm concerned about his mental health, but I also don't want to spend time with him because he is so adversarial towards me and has created a very hostile environment. I have no idea what to do in this situation, which is why this post is so long, tried to include as much information as possible. I guess this is also an r/offmychest type post.

885,"It's my first reddit post. But I need to get this off my chest.
I was at work today. I'm working at a gas station, to make some more money. I am always alone there. There's usually weird guys around, but they always go away when I tell them to leave me alone.
So today this guy came in and stayed for like 2 hours, he wouldn't leave me alone. He tried to talk to me and also said that he wants to do ""things"" with me and have some fun. 
I should add that he was around 20 years older than me. I told him no and tried to ignore him. But he kept asking why I didn't want to go out with him. I stayed behind the cash register, so he couldn't come closer. But I was already scared. He left after a while and I thought he went home or something. 
After my shift I took out some trash and there he was again sitting outside drinking beer, he came closer. He touched my legs, also grabbed my hands. I wanted to go and then he grabbed me hard and touched my chest. I was so uncomfortable and ran to my car.
It's night now, but I can't sleep. 
I don't feel good. I almost feel uncomfortable now. I really don't know what to do.
I hope it's the right place to talk about this.",11Aug2019,4

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.


This is me if it helps:

889,"Relevant info

1a) Husband previously moved out with the exclamation that it was OVER. FWB acquired in his absence. 
1b)I care a lot about this FWB... legit a true friend. But not relationship material (he’s 2 decades younger than me.)
2)Husband now moved back in and re-committed to me, us, our child. He wants exclusivity for both of us. I like the changes he’s making so I agree.
3) With husband and child back in the house full-time, I no longer have the large amount of free time that previously allowed for my FWB visits,  so going to visit him too and it has not been possible. FWB has not noticed the change  because he has been out of town A few weeks on vacation . Basically I only see FWB guy at work now, but not every day.
4) FWB and I live far from each other, and I live super far from my office. 
5) FWB is a quality guy, sweet,  sensitive and not at all like the typical guys his age, who would be more likely to reply “aw okay....Next”. (He refused to let me just booty call him and insisted he buy me dinner and we hang out first.)  
6) If I had it my way I would *prefer* to inform FWB of this face-to-face; I value him as a person, and in general I think doing anything big via text is pretty crappy. But all attempts to get time with FWB this week (his first week back) were futile. Basically if I’m going to do it face-to-face, the only time possible would be one lunch time. (We have different arrival and departure times at work)

What should I do??? 

I am serious about showing exclusivity to my husband; but I would really like to let FWB go the right / best / most mature way possible. 

Thanks guys.",11Aug2019,1
890,"Hey guys, so I have a big tendency to spend a lot of time getting caught up in internet debates. I'm a pretty argumentative and competitive person.

Recently, since it's summer time, I've been getting in a lot of internet debates and often times it leads to people being condescending to me, and over time, it really starts to get to me. I try to be as respectful as possible, but others usually still end up being hostile.

Sometimes I constantly feel like I am competing with someone, and repeatedly hearing condescending remarks doesn't always make me feel great.

I think I take a lot of pride in the positions/opinions that I hold, and view them to be the correct ones. I think I also take pride in my knowledge and rational thinking. Nonetheless, on occasion, someone will indeed change my view on something. It happens pretty rarely, I admit, but it has happened.

Should I try to stop doing debating internet strangers? Or is there a way to stop them from getting to me? Is it because of some insecurity that I have?",11Aug2019,1
891,"I don't want to make this long and write my whole life story, so instead am just going to add major problems that I simply can't overcome and it really sucks.

I was into sports most of my life, weight lifting/judo I felt that this is my ""thing"" and I will be able to gradually develop a career in relate to sports.. but..

Then I started playing games, I noticed that I am naturally good at multiplayer games or MOBA's, every competitive game that is challenging enough and has a large player base I would be obssesed with it, I would not stop playing before I become the best or fulfill my goals in it, then my excitement and motivation fades and I start searching for somethint more exciting.

Even though I was spending a lot of time playing I would still do my workouts, eat healthy and keep myself in shape..

Few years later I started smoking weed and I think that was the point of decline in every aspect of my life.. I would start smoking and everything else wouldn't matter as much for me, gym became an occasional thing, my work and everything else would not mean much to me as I would seek that spliff and an exciting gaming session on a daily basis.

It's worth mentioning that when I fed up with a certain activity I stop abusing it, same applies with weed, I had a 9month break last year I started going to the gym and etc, but after 1 spliff it was all over again.

I just don't know how to replace these unhealthy habits/addictions, maybe it's because I try to avoid being in the present as I feel the biggest failure career wise, I never worked a job that I like neither I know what profession I would like.

I do also play piano and guitar, so sometimes I would distract myself from getting stoned.

I have an amazing and supportive girlfriend that I feel I don't deserve, but she sticks with me,so I want to make a change and become her husband one day with a healthy mental state.

How to replace or overcome these 2 super unhealthy habits/addictions ? As I said I tried it so many times already, but at the end of the day I find myself in the same circle playing rat race.

893,"I just graduated from college and moved to a new city a month ago to start my first job. Within two weeks I met with this girl on Tinder. We happened to work in the same company, but in different departments and buildings so we had never met each other. We ended up clicking immediately, and from then on we were texting constantly. I mean morning, during work, evening, before bed, the works. 

The weird thing was, she always said she was busy after work and was out of town during the weekends. We got lunch in the work cafeteria a couple of times, but I hardly considered that a date. We had a date planned a week after we started talking, but she cancelled it. I asked her to reschedule to another day that she had previously said she was available, but she said she'd be working late that day (she actually ended up leaving early that day, but still said no to going out for other reasons). Nevertheless we were still texting constantly.

On the third week, she finally told me that she had broken up with someone a month ago and was still recovering. She said that she didn't want a relationship but would like to be friends. She first asked me what I was looking for on tinder, before telling me that she was not looking for a relationship. Of course, she tells me this over text because that's how our whole fucking relationship has been.

Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but if you're on tinder it is implied that you are looking for a relationship unless stated otherwise. She did not put this in her profile or mention it at all up to this point. She let me think that we were connecting and that this relationship could go somewhere before dropping the bomb on me. 

Honestly, I'm so disgusted with this behavior that I'm not sure I even want to be friends with this person. She lied to me, how am I supposed to trust her? How can I be friends with someone I don't trust? But another part of me really likes her, and doesn't want to give up hope yet. The part that pisses me off the most is that even though she apologized several times, she never said why she did it. Why should I accept a half-assed apology like that?

I know she is going through a tough time too, which is why I am so conflicted. But why should that excuse her manipulating me into filling the hole some schmuck left when he dumped her? I'm mostly venting, but if anyone has anything helpful to say I would appreciate it. Even if you think I'm overreacting, I would like to hear it.",11Aug2019,1
894,"I've been having a pain between my shoulders and neck for 10 weeks (alternates between both shoulders). There was no ""real"" injury that I can recall. It can get as bad as 8/10 on some nights. 

I saw a neuro who sent me for a neck MRI, which was ""normal"". She then told me to see an orthopedist to check my left shoulder (it was usually just left side of the neck) Originally I did 2 PT sessions for my neck, but it felt worse afterwards. 

Ortho said it must be my left shoulder (left trap strain), said to do PT for that. The pain was so bad the first day of my appointment, I cancelled and went to an urgent care, which saw me for 5 seconds and said to followup with ortho. 

I went to PT a few days ago, and for the whole day my muscles on both sides were so stiff, it was terrible. Right now it's Sunday and the pain can still get so bad. Sometimes it's on the left side of my neck/shoulder, sometimes on the right side. I keep feeling the area for ""lumps"" and clues, but I all I feel is tense muscles. 

I live with my annoying family, and they don't believe me, and want me to take anti-depressants again. I was going to move out until the pain got so bad I was worried I would lose my job anyway. 

I don't know what to do. I'm going to lose my job because of how debilitating the pain is in general. I've been very unproductive. I can't enjoy anything anymore. Only opioids touch the pain. I'm scared it's cancer.

*****

My gut is telling me to:

- message my PCP+ortho again this week and let me them know how bad the pain is. 

- make an appt with another random doc if the others don't want a follow-up

- take a few hours off work again to see a doctor and again risk getting fired

- take more meds? Meds scare me, and I don't even regularly touch the ones they give me. I just know the pain isn't normal, and I'm masking it.",11Aug2019,3
895,"The title seems silly ""ask a guy if he wants your nudes, what guy would day no???"". Well it gets a little more complicated..

He has a coworker that I find very attractive and I'd really like to see if he is open to the idea of joining us. I figured I could start out by asking if he wants some nudes but I'm completely unsure how to go about it without making things weird at work.
