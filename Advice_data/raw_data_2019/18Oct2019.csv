2,So I am a giant procrastinator and it’s becoming a big problem for me and I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how I can actually get myself to do what I need to do.,18Oct2019,4
4,"Hello, I'm [24F] very new to Reddit, and I need some advice in regards to moving out. I currently live at home with my mom and my older brother, and I am a junior in college. I have the option to move 4 hours away, and live, rent free, with my boyfriend and his roommates. Whenever I visit them, I am really happy there and enjoy my time. I always don't want to leave when it is time to go. I feel like living there would be beneficial to me and my mental health. I get chronic and severe migraines 2-3 times a week, and a huge trigger is stress, of which I am under a lot of lately. I do not feel stressed like I do at home with my boyfriend and his friends, so I view it as better for my physical health in addition to my mental health. The best time for me to move would be January before next semester starts (I will be doing online classes since I am moving). But my mother doesn't want me to move out until July. The thought of moving and starting a new life with my boyfriend is very exciting to me, and the thought of having to prolong that for half a year after getting my hopes up makes me incredibly panicky and depressed. Here is a big reason my mom wants me to wait: she is having very major back surgery at the end of October, and the recovery process will take months. She will be in pain for about 6 weeks after, and cannot drive for about 2 months after. It will be me and my brother helping her. My father is severely disabled and lives in a care facility. My brother is engaged and will likely move out in the summer. Mom says she would like me to wait until July to move out, because of several reasons: she wants me to do a semester of online school locally to see how I like it, she wants me to save up more money, she thinks she will still need me here for her recovery process, and she wants to have her kids for half a year longer before they both move away. I have never felt like I could move out (locally or elsewhere) with my unique family situation, and now that I finally feel ready to, I am being asked to stay. I love my family very much, and I don't know what to do. I am beginning to feel trapped.

TLDR: I [24F] need advice with moving out. I currently live with my mom and my older brother. I want to move 4 hours from home in January, my mother wants me to wait until July because she is having major back surgery in late October, she will not be done recovering by January and will still need my help. The thought of waiting half a year really kills me, I feel like it would be better for my mental health to move. I don't know if I should put myself or my family first - am I being selfish for still wanting to move in January, or just doing what is best for me?",18Oct2019,1
5,"Hi! The past couple of  months have been a whirlwind of insanity. My family found out that my niece was molested by a close relative and my family just found out. She’s 10 now but was 7 when it happened. My sister and her family (total of 4) have been living with me and my two roommates for a month and a half. They both came home today excited to tell me about their school fundraiser. This is the most excited they’ve been since their lives were thrown into a blender. I don’t think I’m allowed to share the actual link, but I’d appreciate any help! They want to do well, and get the most donations. Would anyone be interested in helping?",18Oct2019,1

8,"Something happened to me a few months ago. Since then I've been having catastrophic thoughts and now they're getting really bad. People have tried to reassure me that I've done nothing wrong, but it doesn't work. 

I know I need to see my doctor, but when I was on medication for this for a similar incident it took a couple of months for the medication to work. 

My doctor also didn't want me to take medication indefinitely and sent me to psychological support. The problem is that I was away for a while when I got the letter and I had to respond in 10 days after the letter was sent. It expired and now I have to go through the process again. It's going to take around 4 months. 

I desperately need someone to go to or talk to. I'm losing my mind. I feel like my life is over before it's started. I can barely go outside because I keep thinking people are staring at me and it's worse when they smile at me. 

I keep thinking that everybody has seen me on the internet. I keep googling my name in different ways to see if I'm on the internet. I've been doing this all day as well as ruminating about this event. 

I'm going crazy. I desperately need help. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so anxious and scared. I'm just terrified. 

**Please help me**. It's like I'm stuck in hell. I can't take this anymore. I don't want to live like this anymore. What's happening to me? Please help me. It's like a demon is inside my head and he's tearing me apart. I can't take this anymore. I don't have anybody to turn to. I'm going completely insane. I feel so weak and pathetic.",18Oct2019,5
10,"I am going to try to keep this short, but it probably won't be. 

My boyfriend (24M), we'll call him Chris, and I (23F) have been together about 11 months. During the first couple weeks together we were out on a weekend night and he ran into one of his lady friends, we'll call her Ally, and didn't introduce me, stepped forward gave her a hug and everything. This happened on two occasions. I noticed they had ""couple-ey"" pictures together on Facebook, like if someone didn't know him it would look like they were dating. I asked a couple mutual friends who said they, Chris and Ally, were just really close friends and that nothing ever went on between them. Her and I oddly resemble each other as well but I'm trying to ignore that. 

Making the long story short, Chris and I have a super solid relationship, and not long after these instances happened, we had an open and honest discussion and I told him flat out to always be honest with me and that him making his own happiness is his priority and I will always respect that. At this point he even denied her and him being friends which I thought was odd but errkay. I told him,

""Look I trust you, but you never introduced this girl to me, when you've introduced me to all your other   
friends, you're best friends with her on Snapchat so you obviously talk a lot, you have a bunch of pictures   
together on Facebook but you deny her as a friend.. so in resolution of this, I think it would be a good thing   
to do to occasionally let me know what you guys talk about over your phone and social media, you don't   
have to show me your phone but just clue me in so it doesn't look like you're hiding something""

At one point later on, this girl Ally came up to me on another weekend when we were out and she gave me a friggin hug and said ""Holly (my name isn't Holly but for this sake), omg I don't know you very well but I know you make my friend Chris super happy"". At that point, it kind of calmed my anxiety, it was the end of the semester and I knew she was graduating and would be living 4 hours away. Hopefully I would never see or hear about her again. 

Fast forward 5 months and I notice that Chris has continued to talk to Ally but has not clued me in on zilch, besides this one random time in the car he mentioned writing a recommendation for her for some side job she wanted. I brought it up casually the other day when I saw they were chatting over social media apps and I said..""Hey, what's Ally been up to?"" and we end up having another discussion about the situation because apparently there was some miscommunication and he didn't realize the deal I thought we made. So I reinstate what I said months ago and he agrees.

Just yesterday, he shows me on Snapchat that she asked if she could 3rd wheel with us next weekend on Alumni weekend and get margs. AND THIS IS WHY I'M MAD:

Chris and I stopped going out and getting drinks like 9 months ago because he's always on top of his fitness goals and he ""doesn't like the scene anymore"" and whenever I've asked him to come out with my friends he says he isn't up for it. But now Ally is coming to town, so ""Let's go get drinks?""",18Oct2019,1
12,"I got in an “argument” with a stranger, and am struggling with not [and never] getting closure. 

How do you cope with not getting closure on an issue? This is literally a complete stranger.

13,"Before I start I'm just gonna say everyone in this beside me is white as snow(a bit weird I know but it plays a part)

I've known this guy from when I was like 6 and we've been friends on and off since then.Currently we're friends and have been playing online together with one or two of his other friends that I don't personally know.Out of all of us I know the most about the game we play (Dauntless) as I played since day one and they're now only just getting into it.Due to this they all die a lot more than I do.I make arrogant jokes saying stuff like: ""Just dodge and you won't get hit,works for me"" or ""How the hell did you die to (insert random enemy name here) even I didn't die to them when I first started"". Obviously jokes and I made them out as such but they garnered negative attention non the less.This is where the problem starts.I paid about 4 quid for a battle pass when I first started playing the game and thus had a lot of emotes,skins and items the rest of my party just didn't have.They attributed this to do with my race and my income.

My friend told the rest of his friends that I'm black which sparked them to start asking which corner shop I stood up to afford it.They know nothing about me or my family and just immediately assumed that we were living on benefits or something along those lines.
I just say I had some change from a refund from the PlayStation store and they dive in on me deeper with my friend egging them on.
Whenever I'd make a joke or say something they'd all leap back in with cotton picking jokes,father abandonment jabs and the likes.(with my friend giving them helpful insight into my private family life,a lot of which being lies like him saying one day I came into school with a black eye cause my dad punched me,which he'd never do and also never fucking happened)
I'll say these weren't all malicious but some definitely were and despite me making it clear they were pissing me off they let their anominity act as a shield from any real repercussions.It all rose into them making immigration jokes.I take shit like that very seriously as my grandparents had to immigrate to England with them being separated for a long part of it(a really hard time for my family though I wasn't alive for it) and I made it clear to them all to either shit the hell up or I was out,leaving them dead in the water as despite all their obviously unwanted humour I kept helping them.They stopped for the time being but it all eventually rose up again.I don't care about my friends friends but he's annoyed me as he didn't try to stop them ridiculing me just because of who I am and left his own insults up to his autism.
I'll say I know more than most about how people with autism are different from most seeing as how I'm also autistic but saying the n-word multiple times in normal conversation and even refering to me with it hardly falls under his level on the the spectrum.
Anyway I digress.The obvious solution would be to just cut all contact with them but for the most part he's a decent guy and I'd hate to cut contact for a third time.(previous two were before he started commenting on race).I don't have many friends and don't like losing the ones I have.I know this has been jumbled but if you garnered anything from this some advice would be greatly appreciated.Also I am deeply sorry for the formatting as I know that can drive many people to leave very helpful comments saying they couldn't read it and that I need to write better.",18Oct2019,1
14,"19 and I live with my family, for background. I recently found a woman interested in being my fuck buddy/ fwb, and I promised her I would buy her lingerie. She sent me a link to the fashion nova website and said she wanted that. But the problem is I live with my family and my mom has access to my bank records and can see what I buy with my card. It would be my own money since i have my own job, but what would be a sneaky way to get away with buying it and possibly more. They accept amazon pay and paypal, but my worry is what will appear on the statements. If the statement says something somewhat anonymous, meaning it doesn't give out what I bought, it would be fine. If she questioned the purchase I could just come up with some excuse, as long as it doesn't say what or where I bought it from. I was thinking of opening a new account with a new card that my family wouldn't know about, and buying things with that card every time I wanted to buy something without them knowing. Anyone know if this is a good idea? Help would be appreciated.",18Oct2019,0
15,"Hi, 15 year old guy here. So as of recently my mom has been a lot more irritable. I can't really relax much around her anymore, I feel if I make a single slip-up in conversation that somehow offends her she'll explode. Not much else to say I guess, what the hell do I do? It's starting to make me angry. I've been tolerating this for a while but I don't know for how much longer. It feels like she's angry at me constantly. I've been spending a lot of time outside recently just to be away from home because its stressful just to be there. It angers me because home is supposed to refuge from school, which is a essentially a prison and I can't even relax there. Last night I slept on the bench at the park and when I woke up my wallet was gone. I'm really angry and want to avoid saying something I'll regret, so tell me what to do please?",18Oct2019,1

18,"I am a 26/M and have been having multiple ongoing GI issues. As far back as I can remember, I always had diarrhea(sorry if gross) but up until about a month ago I suddenly felt constipated all the time which is something I never really had to deal with. I have a family history of colon cancer and I know that the rate of younger people being diagnosed with colorectal cancers is increasing and so my concerns are raised. I had a CT scan on my abdomen performed about a year and a half ago which appeared to show nothing abnormal. Blood tests and a urinalysis were done as well showing nothing unusual. I have not had any kind of scope tests done as far as a colonoscopy or endoscopy and the more concerning symptoms appeared within the last month or so (give or take some).  

The problem at the moment is that I am currently uninsured due to my financial situation. I also am not extremely knowledgeable of our healthcare system (U.S.) and am not sure how to go about seeing a specialist to conduct a colonoscopy. GPs tend to tell me not to worry as I am young etc etc with no tests run other than our verbal exchange. How could I locate a specialist or get a referral to see one and how much might it cost without insurance? Does anyone have any input on what my plan of action should be at this time? Any advise is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",18Oct2019,1

20,"Hello I bought a pickup in Texas and arranged shipping to be transported to ND. I did not go through a broker and went directly to the trucker he has all positive reviews from shipping websites so why not and he's a relatively local shipper. 

Timeline as follows

10/08- Pickup was bought and paid for, shipper was arranged for pickup of vehicle with all parties in agreement. 

10/11- told this day would be initial pickup date, never called and only said he wouldn't be there when called an hour prior to agreed pickup time. 

10/14- 2nd pickup date, repeat never called until I called him to hear him say it wouldn't be today and actually Tues before noon

10/15- seller calls be to say he wouldn't be there until 8p now, he did show up and loaded vehicle without issue. I called him and he said thurs he would be in ND for delivery. 

10/17- I got off nights at 0730 left a text saying to call and I would wake up and meet him. 1600 I call him as he never replied to text messages, I called at 1700 and 1800 with no answer and called at 1900 with a friend's phone and still no answer.

What should I do, am I just paranoid of getting burnt?

She never broke eye contact with me, and after the youth meeting thing adjourned, she walked to me and asked for my number. I’m pretty certain she likes me, and I think I like her too. My friends say that the telltale signs of a crush are there (phone number asking and stuff), and I don’t know how to go about this. What should I do?

Not gonna lie, was pretty gutted when I found out as I’ve always wanted a surprise party for me and the one time there is actually one, I’ve found it out :( 

Seeing as I can’t talk to any of my friends about this, I was wandering if any of you had any suggestions as to what I could do to surprise them instead??

For some insight, I’m 16 (just turned 16) and he is 15. We’ve begun talking a lot over FaceTime, staying up until like 4 in the morning and stuff like that. 

Last night while on FaceTime, I got embarrassed about some random thing and started apologizing, to which he responded “Don’t worry, its cute”.

He’ll also play the guitar and sing for me (which he is incredibly good at) adding that he thinks it’s ‘super attractive’ when someone plays the guitar. I don’t know if that detail helps or not.

It’s probably best that I add that he does have a lot of friends who are girls, though I’ve never seen how he acts around them compared to a girl that he likes. I’m honestly just super confused about whether or not he sees me as a friend or more, we’ve gotten into some pretty deep conversations about relationships and stuff like that. 

Or honestly, I could just be overthinking this entire dumb teenager situation and he could just see me as a friend, it’s too hard for me to tell.

If you guys have any questions I’ll try my best to answer then

Side note: Yes, I do have friends that I could talk to this about, though one of them had a little ‘thing’ with him about a year ago (she told me she was 100% okay with him and I ‘talking’ by the way) though I don’t exactly know how I feel talking to her about it.",18Oct2019,2

28,"Last year was my freshman year of high school and I made a friend with a sophomore (now junior). I am going to call her Goblin for the sake of this post.

Goblin is gay and I am bi. Goblin and I shared one class that was almost entirely sophomores, and quickly after the school year began, she tried to be my friend. I was so excited to make a new friend, let alone an upperclassman.

Goblin ended up having a crush on me, and I’m going to skip the whole story when she acts immature, insecure, and completely disregards my personal space, and tries to make a move on me even though I lied and told her I was ace/aro,

I really didn’t want to lose this friend at first, but she would go days without making eye contact with me because she was embarrassed and thought I hated her. This girl was so immature and insecure and continued to flirt with me awkwardly that I ended up really hating her and told me just to not talk to me ever again.

Goblin is EVERYWHERE in school. She gets her friends to chase her into freshman hall while she screams, she runs around the cafeteria screaming, she is in every frickin club and is friends with all the teachers.

I never really got over my hatred of her because she never gave me space or stayed away from me. She was constantly right there and always looking at me, so nothing ever dissolved.

Fast forward to present day, and she is still everywhere. Last year she would talk to my friends a lot and they found it really awkward, but didn’t want to be mean to her. Now she is friends with a lot of people in my grade, including my close friends, and spends most of her time with sophomores. She is constantly walking into my classes, and she is always saying hi to people. She draws a lot of attention to herself.

I am really mad at my friends for always hanging out with her because they all know what happened and how I feel about her. I get triggered sometimes when I’m around her (not joking or exaggerating when I say that I cry and breakdown and want to die). I want to say so many things to my friends about how I feel, but I know that none of them will actually do anything. I have a lot of other friends I could hang out with instead, but surprise surprise they’re friends with Goblin too.

I understand that I can’t control who people are friends with, but what do I do about this girl and what do I do about my friends? It seems dramatic to blow literally everyone off because of Goblin, but none of my friends seem to really understand or care about how upset I get around her. There’s not much the school can do, and I can’t make new friends because Goblin is friends with my whole grade. What can I do about Goblin and my friends?",18Oct2019,1
29,"I’m Male 182cm tall lanky slim framed and pale with a receding hairline so yea I’m fucked when it comes to looks. I’m a kissless virgin. And most  girls treat me like shit despite the fact they need makeup to look attractive yet they have that ‘ewwww how dare you even look at me’ attitude on them if I do. I don’t leave the house except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. sometimes it’s ok but other times it’s very difficult. I always get put on the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some fat young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking yet he had severe acne all round his mouth and was vastly overweight.  don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job and a girl and her dad was standing drinking the girl looked at me with a blank stare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s wha I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face, yet she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask, it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once. Also the there’s a guy who’s a higher up authority on my part  I work and he’s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I’m skinny. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh.  I have bad depression too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re snotty I take it personally. The most painful thing is when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s a complete douche. 5 years ago a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(",18Oct2019,0
31,"I am a recent college graduate in the California Bay Area with a useless degree (because I chose it when I was 17) and due to that I don't get a lot of job opportunities that pay above minimum wage. A friend recently recommended me to a position in the company they work for. I thought it was a god send as it pays 17$ and hour. However I recently learned that I would be essentially beta testing a program for that would replace cashiers in retail stores. Even before learning about this I have always been very anti-automation. I think it is the biggest problem facing workers today. 25% of workers are at risk of loosing their jobs to automation in the US; retail workers are at the top of the list and this program is working towards that. I have friends and family members whose only source of income comes from these positions. 

I realize that me abstaining from working at this company won't stop automation but just because I can't stop all of it doesn't mean I should be contributing towards it. However this is the only job I have even gotten an interview for in the past 2 months, and everything else I found pays barely enough for my bills, rent, etc. Is getting 17$ an hour worth compromising my morals?",18Oct2019,2
32,"Hi friends, I (M 17) will try to keep this as short as possible.

My father has always been a very abusive and angry man. Hitting my mom and older brother, emotionally abusing all three of us. Recently, he really flew off the handle and nearly killed my mom. No police report was made, but we got a restraining order and my mom was set on ending their marriage for the sake of her own sanity. But, she backed out, as most DV victims do. In that time, my brother left the state, CPS got involved, and my father's been tormenting me. CPS was no help, honestly. I'm not trying to say CPS is useless or bad people, but they simply can't help me much since I'm nearly 18 and I was simply a witness, not a victim, of the abuse. Although he has not moved back in, he's been showing up to the house, threatening me, telling me he will move back in, etc knowing I'm terrified of him. My mom keeps saying things like, he just loves you, just let him back home, he hit me not you, he's learned his lesson and he's being civil about this. My mom's falling for all of his Tactics, and I refuse to be taken down with her.

Here's my question: How the fuck do I get out of here? I have about 2.5 months left before I turn 18. I'm trying to get a job, my driver's license, and a cheap place to stay, but that all seems so impossible. I've considered car living and applying for welfare as soon as I am able to. I have so many concerns like, is it the right choice to up and leave with probably no money? Will I regret it? How am I going to pull this off and stay safe if I end up car living for a little while?

I feel entirely stuck and so many people say I'm being dramatic, saying my father is a good man, that he wouldn't hurt me, that I'm being selfish by not letting back home. I'm glad there is a thread that understands my fears, it's validating. Any advice would be greatly appreciated friends!

Also, I am in California if that helps with anything.",18Oct2019,2
33,"Need Advice

I made a really big mistake and I have no idea what to do

So I was dating this guy for a while and I really loved him but I was getting frustrated because he was always busy and never really had time to talk to me and when he did it was dry and he didn’t show that much affection. So I tried following my friends advice to take a small break with him. I told him my frustrations (I have done this before except this time I said that we needed to take a break for a little bit to work this out) he said he understood and for some reason (I can’t really remember) it kind of got extended till the end of summer because he said he wanted to get himself in check. It’s been way past that now and I even asked him near the end of summer what we were going to do and he responded with “idk”.

I would ask him for a while what we were going to do but I eventually gave up because I felt like a clown every time. He said he didn’t want to get back together because he didn’t want to hurt me again which makes me so mad because I’ve told him multiple times that it would hurt more without him.

My anger started piling and piling up so I was more cold and mean to him. When school started I was really distraught because all I wanted to do was to be with him but everything has started to change. My friend group wasn’t hanging out all together and he started hanging out with different people. It got to the point where even thinking about him hurt me so much. I would get literal heart burns thinking about him. So I followed my friends advice again and told him that I couldn’t be friends anymore because it hurt me too much. He accepted it and I find out the next day that he already likes someone else and I suspect they’re already dating. The worst thing is that she’s a close friend of mine and I know she knows I still have feelings for him.

I feel so stupid and that I’ve made so many mistakes and that all of this is my fault. I lost him and it’s all my fault. We aren’t even friends anymore I singlehandedly ruined the relationship I cherished the most.",18Oct2019,3
34,"So whenever I(f15) get nervous about something, my palms get sweaty, my arms and feet get cold, and there's this rock or weighted feeling in the lower middle part of my chest. And it makes it harder to breathe. I've been tested for anxiety a year ago and I don't have it. But whenever I have to go to my team practices as a part of the executive coaching team I always get this feeling and i often wait for my best friends to go into the building first or arrive first before I go in because I'm scared. 

Other times I'll have these feelings is before an interview, a talk with anyone of importance (teachers, people with seniority or of a higher rank), going to new things (a new job), before a presentation. 

And right now I'm just thinking of those team meetings and I have the weighted feeling in my chest and the not enough air feeling and I don't know what it is but I'm also panicking. Everyone tells me it'll be fine but I'm always scared. It's not bad enough for me to start crying but I've cried a few times after the events that provoke these feelings and it was an uncontrollable cry that wouldn't stop.",18Oct2019,4

39,"Hi all, this is my first post so hopefully I do it right.

I live in Canada (near Mississauga) and have played soccer competitively (Premier league for 2 years + high school soccer) but never have taken it too seriously, as I've always been a goalie for teams that have no other options for my age group really. I never took it seriously or really practiced much solo or worked on technique and haven't played as a keeper in about 2 years. This year I've decided to try and be an outfield player (Midfielder or Winger/Striker) and am just looking for advice as to how to improve my game as I'm not very well experienced with outfield and am upper house league level. I've also found it very difficult to find a team that is doing indoor (during winter) that I can play for due to me not being in Canada during time when teams had tryouts. I know having the ability to join practices or have games to play in would drastically help development.

I'm really lost and it's difficult for me to find a team or training program, I've been starting to go out to my local fields to practice routines I make off of you tube videos and the internet but its starting to get colder, and I don't think I can stay outside once that snow starts coming down.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you again!

Thank you all again!",18Oct2019,5

Never did I intend to cheat or cheat in general but nevertheless he came and took up my test while I only got through 1/3 of it before he took it.

It is part of our grade that we get 2 letters of recommendation for scholarships. I had planned to ask a teacher of mine from junior year, but I could never ask her in person because she had recently retired. My college-prep teacher had her contact information, so she did me a favor and asked the other teacher if she could write it for me. She said she would, and I was happy about that. So I sent her an email formally asking her whether she would be willing to write me a letter of recommendation, with my attached information sheet. 

She never responded. Tomorrow is the unofficial due date for the letters of recommendation. I'm thinking that I can email her back, but I don't know what to write. I wrote this so far:

""Hello (insert name here)!

Sorry to bother you again, but I was wondering if you received my email regarding my letter of recommendation request? I do apologize-""

48,"Okay, so, I am a 20 yr old in cosmetology school. Thing is the school is new, essentially all over the place; I started in May with a classroom teacher who taught me and 2 classmates, and a salon teacher/the owner (gonna call her S) who taught the advanced students. The course is generally a year long. The advanced class was much bigger, there were only 3 of us spring students, and one dropped out early. We were supposed to spend around 8 weeks in the classroom.

 After a month, S fired the teacher, and we were moved with the advanced students, and started learning with them in the salon. I was struggling a lot with things like braiding, extensions, updos, perms/rollers as I had never really done it. Fast forward to Sep, S rehired the classroom teacher to teach a big new class.

 Today, S decided to put me and my classmate into the new class, forcing us to buy new books because she changed the curriculm, and repeat some things over, so that we didn't miss anything important. This upset me, because this shouldn't have happened in the first place.  

I have no idea whether to quit or stay. If I quit, I will not be able to keep the hair kit (which is huge), and I feel I will disappoint my classroom teacher more than anything who tried very hard to help me &amp; told me how proud she was of my ""great"" progress.

However, now that I'm a sophomore, both activities have gotten much more serious. Varsity debate is difficult and demanding, and I prepare a lot for my tournaments. But I still like the research and debating process. For volleyball, however, I tried out for a club team in preparation for school volleyball in the spring. In my particular club, there are two teams for volleyball- a ""B"" team (which costs $1200) and an ""A"" team (which costs $2200 because it travels more). Luckily I was accepted into the A team. However, I have to choose whether I actually want to do the A team or not because the volleyball tournaments clash with my debate tournaments. I would definitely get much better and have an overall better experience with the A team because the level of play will be higher- but I wonder if it is worth the extra thousand when I might not even go to all of the tournaments. What should I do? Should I go with the B team so that I can also focus on debate, or should I go all out on the A team?

cut to about a week later after that incident and suddenly i find myself begging themselves to come back. they did come back, and we talked out why i left them in the first place. i really wanted to make this work, so for the past 3 / 4 days ive been talking to them like everything's fine again. but now its all the way to back to square one. even though we talked a lot of stuff out they didnt really apologize for what they did wrong (that made me leave first) and we're maintaining a FWB relationship (which i really hate). they also pretty much made it clear that even though we have an FWB relationship, its ""okay to have another S.O.""

57,"I noticed a guy at work seems to like to offer help and also teach random knowledge, but I’m  worried that I’m going to come across as needy and annoying. (If it matters, I’m a woman and we’re the same age). 

He’s an engineer, and I noticed that anytime we talk he would explain how something works or what something is, even if I didn’t ask (and sometimes I already knew, but I’d politely listen because he seemed to be enjoying explaining it).  

Once, without me asking, he spent an hour helping me find something I misplaced. Another time I asked what I thought was a simple question about a software program we use and he ended up spending an hour (after it was time for him to go home) looking up things on the internet to make sure he could give me an answer.  

As a non-engineer who works in an office full of engineers, I frequently come across terms I’m not familiar with. I’ve started asking him because 1) I know he knows the answer and 2) he seems to really enjoy explaining things and helping.  However, I’m worried that I will quickly come across as annoying.  I always tell him that he doesn’t have to help and to please tell me if it gets  annoying, but he said he doesn’t mind at all.  I have baked him treats in the past as a thank you. I also make sure to come to his desk at least once daily to talk about something and get to know him without asking for help so he knows I don’t want to just use him for help.  I genuinely do find him interesting and could even see a friendship developing. 

Basically, my question is, should I carry on asking him questions because he seems to enjoy it? If I ask him how he feels, he’d never admit to not liking it even if he didn’t.

70,"My boyfriends Brother and Wife are rude and don’t like me ....

So my boyfriend of two years has a brother he’s in the military. His name is Matt. He has a 6 month old child with and is married to this girl Ashley for about one year combined. He’s 22, Employed. She’s 30 unemployed and wants to be a stay at home mom. (None of my business).. Cause you know age means nothing but let’s just say that she is still kind of a stranger to me and kind of in a way to Matt because they didn’t really know each other before she ended up falling pregnant.  Anyway she’s constantly kind of being like a backhanded with things that she says, I’m very good at reading someone’s emotions and how they feel about me. And sure enough my feelings were right because I made a few posts on Facebook and the one post I had shared Showed up in my memories from two years ago and it was a joke about you know how military man apparently get married four days after meeting their girlfriend, not sure if anybody has seen a post like that but they basically make fun of people in the military for getting married So quick and getting cheated on. Mind you it was two years ago I thought it was funny, I just reshared it 😂 So she commented on it and was like oh if your boyfriend really loved you he wouldn’t need to wait to marry you, me and Matt didn’t wait because we know what we wanted.” Like okay I didn’t ask for all this sass and it’s not about you.. anyway... if the shoes fits. So of course I messaged her, apologized and said “I’m sorry you feel that way and clearly she was still pissed off as she claims. Then I’d say a month later I shared another post about divorce and said “divorce rate would be lower if people took their time to get to know their significant other and didn’t marry so quick “ literally another shared post from a throwback...again she commented freaking out and said I’m not an adult and that I’m a child. Okay? There was more but I forget. 

Fast forward to recently He and my boyfriend got into a fight, my boyfriend had a past with drugs and Matt really knew that and threw in his face and said oh you’re acting like you’re doing drugs again, you’re being lazy every time somebody asks you to do something.  Mind you, he’s been away for the military for about a year and a half. 

It hurt my boyfriend’s feelings a lot so my boyfriend just ended up blocking him on social media I’m just leaving the house because Matt was in town to visit family. Later that day I get a message for Matt and he goes oh can you tell my brother that I’m sorry and I just simply said why don’t you message him yourself with your own mouth. That was the end of the discussion at the moment. Then I came home to my boyfriends because I was at work all day and he just says  “Matt still hasn’t apologized to me and it really hurt my feelings he went too far.” 

So I admit this is where I might’ve went wrong but I took it into my own hands and I just messaged him and was like “how sorry are you because you came to me and telling me that you were sorry and my advice to you is apologize in person and you didn’t do that. “ Then a whole shit storm starts and he ends up messaging me saying to “know my place “ or he’s “going to put me in my place”  that “I’m not gonna jump through hoops to apologize he needs to grow up. “ 

(A little backstory is when he was fighting with my boyfriend in the beginning calling him lazy and thinking he was on drugs he also mentioned how my boyfriend “doesn’t do anything around the house “ and my boyfriend literally does EVERYTHING. he is the handyman , he cooks , cleans and does laundry he’s a really good guy. I call him my wife sometimes 😂 And so my boyfriends like “I work six days a week 12 hours a day which is true and that’s fucked up that you would say that to me. “ 

And Matts response was “That’s not what I heard I know you don’t work six days a week apparently you’re always broke, you and your girlfriend go out to eat all the time,  and smoke weed”
. (But like I said  he hasn’t been home in a year and a half so who is telling him this. ) we don’t have our own place but we both pay our parents rent, have cars, full time great paying jobs!! We will get there we are only 21-22! It takes time. )


(So I messaged his wife and was like “you know it’s unfair that he made these accusations to Joey, but it’s also crazy how he would even say those things to Joey because he wouldn’t know he does not have me on social media to know where I’m going out to eat or if I’m going out to eat or if I’m smoking weed” the only way that man could know what we do it’s our money and how much is through her. Because even my boyfriends mom said to Matt when he said this “who is telling you all this?!” 
Ashley. She also makes rude comments about things I say “ I wish I can be rich enough to not have to look at the check when I go out to eat or shopping “ and she goes “yeah you let me know when that happens that’ll never happen” rude as shit but still I held my tongue. 
 Or something innocent I say like when my boyfriends mom makes food the one time I said “woo!!! This food smacks!!!” Meaning yummy!!!
Ashley says “I freaking hate that phrase “ okay????? Who asked you? )


CONTINUED.... 

And I’m just like what the heck are you talking about you are the one who hurt his feelings so why not apologize? He then blocks me and  I get a message from his wife saying “stop messaging my husband, he blocked you for a reason you’re pissing me off. “ But anyway I still went and messaged him on Snapchat to de-escalate and said “hey I was just trying to say if you want to fix it then approaching him is the best way, he is sweet and you guys are brothers, ride or die, ride the waves high and low and it’ll blow over”  

I know I shouldn’t of so persistent to make the situation better but they both turned into jerks..

His message to me was “shut the fuck up ur dumb as fuck” exact spelling. 

I’m like ???? What a freaking jerk. I bit my tongue cause I’m not going to say things I’ll regret. 


Am I being dramatic or are these ppl pieces of shits 😂😂😂

Them not liking me effects me wanting to go over his house, celebrate holidays, all of that ..",18Oct2019,1
71,"To start off, by brother wasn’t always a jerk. He was this loving, caring, little boy who would play tag with you whenever you asked. And I was happy.


Then he got an iPad, and it seemed to reprogram his mind. 


He would still be lovable and adorable, but he started getting more angry to people for the littlest things. He kept telling me to go away whenever I want to play with him.

Then, a year later, more and more anger erupted, and less and less interaction with him was more common. I would be in my room, while my brother was on his iPad. 

Then my parents blame me, the oldest, to always play with my brother, but I don’t want to play with a person who yells at me all the time and tells me to go away.

But today, a couple years later, he plays his iPad every second he gets. Then, when I had to babysit for a couple hours, I was watching my baby brother WHILE studying for a quiz and finishing up a final worksheet for a unit. Thanks to him, I’m going to fail. 

But then, when I got a message from my dad saying: “In car now, on way.” And 2 minutes later, my brother picks up a phone to call him. I say no, because he will be home soon, he is in his car, then presses buttons. I had had enough bullshit, with failing and studying, that I tried to grab it out of his hands. He then stood up, got all in my face and said “WHATS YOUR PROBLEM?” Repeatedly. He kept getting closer to me and closer to me raising his voice...so I pushed **lightly** pushed him back away from me onto the couch. He then stood up and made a face at me that looked like I had murdered his best friend, and slapped the shit out of me and my severely broken arm. 

I then, after he stopped, went to the kitchen to get a paper towel to wipe my tears, and noticed he had WASTED paper towels by covering something up as a “surprise” for my mom. Basically, he got his brothers lunch ready, and hid it under 30 paper towels. I ask him “why are you wasting paper towels?” And he looked in my hand and saw the paper towel in my hand (the one I was using to wipe tears) and started yelling at me, yet again. 

I can’t take it anymore. I want my old brother back. I need advice.",18Oct2019,3
72,"Hey everyone! I've been in college for a couple of semesters now. I'm majoring in Civil Engineering and have just been getting General Ed classes out of the way. I've come across a couple of professors from my English Composition courses which have both been impressed with my essays. I brushed it aside from the first teacher but hearing it from this second teacher has really made me think. Civil Engineering has always been a major that I simply tolerated enough to do but now I'm starting to realize I just can't understand Math. But when it comes to English I'll always lose myself getting creative with how I can approach a topic or story. I also have a lot of ideas for videos specifically in Youtube and video editing in general

That said, my second professor, this semester, is saying I'm an ""excellent writer"" and gave me an almost perfect score each time. I would have ignored the second teacher's remarks as well due to the fact that I finished all my essays in a procrastinated rush (Maybe she's just over flattering). But this teacher has a Ph.D. in the field of writing and does scouts for shows like The Walking Dead which added some legitimacy behind her words. But now she's even going as far as to recommend that I could pursue Cinema as a major and English as a minor when I said that I just wasn't enjoying Civil Engineering anymore. Keep in mind I would love doing these majors. She even sat with me to look at the major's courses and I got really hyped up looking at all the interesting courses. I'm still on Gen Ed courses so it's not like I'm losing credits. But even now I'm still thinking, ""she's just trying to get more kids into the field of English."" (I'm really cynical) But yeah I'm lost, guys. What the hell do I make of this?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Professor recommends I should switch my major from Civil Engineering to Cinema and an English Minor. She's given me almost perfect scores saying the essays I've given show how passionate I am for English even when my essays are often rushed just before the deadline (adding doubt to if she really means it). Should I make the change?",18Oct2019,2
73,"Hi there, this is gonna be a long one, so strap in.

I'm 14, and in my Freshman year of high school. My parents split up at the age of 3. I was by my mother's house today, and I forgot I needed to mow 2 lawns. I mow my mother's, father's, neighbor's, and a lawn a street away from me. I go to a game session with my friends on Thursdays (we have off of school today and tommarow). Today, my dad angrily called me yelling about how I had forgot to  do the lawn. I walked home, and this is where it began.

Previously, we had had a 'discussion' of how I have to be better at mowing my lawn. in this 'discussion' he told me he would ""beat my ass"" if he saw anything wrong with my mom's lawn. He was apparently joking, though I took it seriously and hid in my room with my knife. After the discussion my dad said he would never actually beat me.

Today, I came home to him screaming at me, and him saying ""I don't know if I can keep my promise to not beat your ass today"". I mowed the lawn, and after I got home, he yelled at me for 20 minutes until my grandma came to pick me up, which he proceeded to then embarrass me in front off and scream at me in front of.

She is an extremely nice person, and I am lucky to have her. I am over by their house tonight, and I legitimately fear for my safety and I will refuse to be reasoned with, as that happened once before (explained above) and now we're here.

My grandma and grandpa are very conservative, as am I, and own many guns. I am going to try to stay by my grandparents tommorrow and for the forseeable future. I will defend myself in any way necessary. I fear for my baby brother, but he is treated much better than I, and I believe he will be safe for the time being. Is this the correct decision, I am not going to call CPS, as I know it can really fuck things up.",18Oct2019,1

76,"This is a copy/pasted from r/offmychest but I'd like some insight on how to help in this situation

My coworker, who I'll call Becky, is always complaining about her boyfriend, who I'll call Douche. She vents about how she does so much for him financially (paying for his bills &amp; utilities) &amp; physically (taking care of HIS kids &amp; getting them to &amp; from school), but he is barely giving back in the relationship. He's not physically abusive but he does say things to strike at her confidence &amp; fuck with her psychologically.

""If I was gonna cheat on you again, I would have done it a long time ago"" 

""Why don't you wear makeup like you used to?""

 ""You never dress up sexy anymore!""

These are just examples, but it's irritating at how poorly Douche treats Becky; he's mentally &amp; verbally abusing her &amp; I really believe she thinks she can help him. In my opinion, there's no helping him because Becky has been with for years &amp; he has cheated on her in the past. My other coworkers &amp; I have told her the same thing: LEAVE HIM!! She makes enough money to be on her own &amp; what she needs to do is stay single &amp; figure things out for herself. But she keeps going back to him &amp; ""settling their differences"" (i.e. Douche stops being a cunt for a little bit &amp; then goes back to his old ways).

One coworker offered Becky to live with her because a while ago Becky had had enough of Douche &amp; threatened to move out. But she said no, no, I'll be fine. A month later, same thing--- I offered Becky the spare bedroom in my apartment, she just had to meet with my fiancé so the three of us could talk. When the day came, she flaked out &amp; said when she was packing Douche started the waterworks &amp; cried about how much he &amp; the kids would miss her.

I've told her on numerous occasions she's being abused &amp; needs to leave &amp; don't let him use HIS kids as an anchor to stay together. But &amp; I don't mean to sound harsh, Becky doesn't fucking listen to reason at all, what I'm telling her is in one ear &amp; out the other. Nowadays, I tune out most of her complaints &amp; I end up sounding like a broken record. Worst thing is, SHE WANTS TO HAVE A BABY WITH DOUCHE!! I told her that's not the best idea with how poorly he already treats her &amp; imagine the baby growing up with two volatile parents who don't love each other.

I really don't know what to think anymore, I don't know if she's looking for attention or just wants someone to tell her everything is fine &amp; Hunky Dory between her &amp; Douche.

77,"My boyfriend [M21] of 2 years saw me make out with other guys at parties before we started dating. 

When we started dating, it became a huge source of insecurity for him. He’d bring it up a lot, make me apologize and reiterate why it was wrong. He’d ask leading questions and make me explain why it was wrong. He had never done anything like that. He even started talking to a girl behind my back because of his low self confidence.

I forgave that, but it has been so emotionally taxing to deal with the rest. I am now very insecure about sex because his hatred of the things I did made me feel ashamed of sex in general.

Now he’s gotten better, but at the expense of just wanting to never have anything about what happened brought up. However, I brought up how he treated me a few days ago.

He’s furious with me now.

78,My Fiance just purchased her first car. A chevy Equinox  just a touch over 100k miles. She was super excited and happy as could be as everything else she had before was a hoopty. Well she got a shiny hoopty this time.  At just over a month we noticed it was running kind of off. I checked the oil and put nearly a quart in. We had been doing alot of driving and we go up and down the mountains. About a week or so later we encounter a much noisier issue. We live about 70miles from the dealer we purchased this from so we had it towed to the next closest. They had to put in a gallon of oil but it still sounded like hell and suggested a new engine. The warranty company came out and said we aren't covering this as it was a lack of lubrication. We contacted the dealer and they do not want to do anything about this either.

80,"Hi Reddit. Long time reader, first time poster.
I'm starting to wonder if there's something wrong with what makes me happy. 
(I'm on mobile so please do forgive the poor format)
For some background, I am a 16 year old boy. I've been homeschooled for two years (now in my last year) and spend most of my time alone. It wasn't always this way, but I have an odd schedule between my mom and I's work schedule. 
For the issue:
I have a not big, but not small collection of  figures, Funko pops, stuffed things, and the custom items I sew. I make oddbody furbies (long furbies) and sell them on commissions. I know they're creepy, and I think they're hilarious. Something about them and making them into weird funny stuffed animals makes me happy. I feel like there's something extremely wrong with this. 
Most of the stuffed things I own are sharks (my favorite animal), as they bring me comforting memories from my childhood. The funkos I own are all music artists I fancy and whichever ones I happen to pick up from movies I like. I have 21 total. I won't continue to bore you with my odd collection, but the point is, I feel there might be something really wrong with the fact that I collect this stuff. Most 16 year old boys don't keep strange clown and Edward Scissorhands figures, or spend their free time sewing strange furby creatures. 
I want to know, is this bad of me? Should I not be doing this? Should I get rid of this collection, is it really strange? 
These strange things I own are one of the few things that make me happy, and I feel it shouldn't be that way. I feel like I'm too old to still want these things, but I guess I'm afraid to ""grow up"" per say. 
I genuinely can't tell if there's something wrong with me. If I need to get professional help and stop owning these things? I know there are others like me that have inanely massive collections of these things, mine doesn't compare to. But I still feel there's just something wrong. I'm not afraid of others judgement, more so simply wondering if this is unhealthy of me.
I know this is a very miniscule problem compared to most posts on this subreddit, so if you take the time to read this whole thing, or even respond, I am very grateful to you.",18Oct2019,1

82,"So, if this is not an appropriate topic for this forum, please do tell me where I should move it. Thank You.

____________________________________

So, I attend an ASD Peer Support group on a weekly basis. 

There are around 10 members with three of those members being part of a clique. I have had  problems with this clique for about a year now.

When I first started attending this group the clique were cordial with me. They invited me out for coffee on three occasions, I thought we were going fine as they were laughing at what I was saying etc. Anyway, one week after the final coffee meeting, we go on the train to a local city as planned. The main honcho looks irritated/annoyed, doesn’t talk to me on the train or during the trip etc.

I send her a text afterwards asking her what was wrong, and apologising if I had done anything to offend her. She did not respond. Two weeks later she deleted me from Facebook. 

So, from the next group meeting onwards she blanks me entirely. Her two friends talk to me. Though with increasing time the friends stop talking to me, but still greet me.

A year later, the clique is as strong as ever and does not talk to me. They do odd things like leave the room when I am there, stop talking, have conversations with one another whilst I am sitting there and do now include me, or they invite others to their houses without asking me. They also snigger and look at each other when I am talking. 

I still do not know what I have done to cause this and am still very confused!! 

So, anyway. 

About two weeks ago we were playing scrabble. They all abstain, (this has been their tune for three weeks), I was getting increasingly frustrated at this as I felt that they were not participating because of me and it came across as a sort of “we are better than the rest of the group” vibe as they do like to set themselves a part (they do things such as get a taxi of their own when the group goes on an outing, or tour about on their own, go to a different cafe etc.) So I said “why are you attending this group if you are going to be anti social and abstain from every single activity?”.

To which the head honcho looked at her main buddy with an irritated look. I got no response.

I left the group for the next week. 

So what happens? 

——————————

I received a text from the facilitator of this group yesterday. She asks me to come 15 minutes early so we can talk. I say by phone but she says no.

Irritated I agree. 

I turn up today. The clique are already there, so I assume she has already talked to them as they have spoken to her about me. I don’t feel that this is fair as she didn’t take on board what I said to say but went and got their opinions first!

We go in, we have a very heated and tense conversation for about 30 minutes. Basically, she told me that my comment was rude and offensive. 

We discussed the behaviour of the clique whom she defended by telling me that they can behave whomever manner they wish. So i’m thinking “ok so they can behave how they wish but I get a chat because I ask them why they are not playing a board game?”. 

She doesn’t agree with anything that I say. I then tell her that i’m not keen on banter, I don’t do it and won’t and don’t have to participate in it. She tells me that they will not stop it and that it is friendly. I tell her that it is not friendly with acquaintances (at best). 

She tells me that they felt uncomfortable. I say “you are making me feel uncomfortable and unvalued in this group with your conduct”. 

I stay in the group for 30 minutes, then storm off with frustration and anger as I was going to lash out at her and the group.

_________

So, now i’m up feeling upset. I don’t actually understand the point of the conversation. She didn’t discipline me so why did she make me come 15 minutes earlier to talk about a comment which she thought was rude? Why does she strictly defend everything these members do, yet I am not allowed to be rude or awkward with them? Why can they be disgenuine and passive aggressive with me? 

I don’t know why these people have stopped talking to me. I feel that they can do what they want, and that she will discipline me if I complain. I don’t know why she protects them so much and will not consider my views or feelings.

I am not sure if I should continue attending with the manner that I am being treated?? I have been told that this clique has been strong for years before I came along, so my relationship with them will not get better. 

NB: I have talked this leader on three occasions regarding this clique and their odd behaviour around me. She implies that my views are wrong and defends their conduct. To me this is odd as I would think that a genuine facilitator would want to have cordial relations within a social group? She does nothing to facilitate this or breakup the clique. She has a very hands off approach except when it comes to them.",18Oct2019,0

85,"Hi guys, so I've started working after finishing school in May. I joined my current company in July and so far my bosses have been great. I've been so grateful that work has been flexible enough to allow me to complete my university applications (I finished my bach degree but the past 3 years I've been striving for another course and am hoping to get into school again to do this course). However, this being my 4th month, I've been starting to make a lot of mistakes in the smallest things like getting clients' names wrongly or drafting something really off-tangent in a letter, and even checking numbers wrongly which my bosses always pick out. I'm grateful that they were willing to point these out to me so that I can learn and they have been very patient in not screaming at me when I get these small things wrong.   


But I'm not sure if I'm distracted from work or having high expectations of myself? I feel guilty that I am being a burden to the company and to myself/my bosses for being in this (possible) slump situation and I don't know how to get out of this rut.

88,"So I found a black thong in the wash that wasn’t mine. Obviously my first thought is that my husband is cheating on me. 

So I confronted him about it, and he showed me a butt plug and said he got the thong to keep it in place. He said he likes to imagine that he’s a woman when he’s jacking off and the butt plug helps with that, but that he couldn’t get it to stay in place. He said he wears my tights and other lingerie items too. 

I posted about this on a trans sub, because a man liking to think of himself as a woman seemed like maybe a transgender thing to me. They seemed to think it was a kink. Which lead me to discovering feminization and sissification kinks. 

I’m basically trying to figure out if this a believable story? I want to believe his story but I’m scared of being gullible idiot. But I’ve never once even suspected him of cheating before this. He’s awkward and nerdy and always tells me he doesn’t know how he landed a woman like me / that I’m out of his league. There’s never been any unaccounted for time that he’s been gone or anything. Had I not found this, I never would’ve even remotely guessed he might be cheating. He claims he never has and never will. 

I just need some opinions on this. I don’t want to talk to my sisters or friends, because if he’s being honest that’s something I wouldn’t want to share with them. What do y’all think?",18Oct2019,4

95,"I’ve (M18) asked this girl (F18) to homecoming, but I wasn’t really sure if she liked me more than just friends. To be clear, I am perfectly fine either way. 

So last night, we were hanging out with a group of friends. They were all talking about what they were wearing to homecoming, and I realized I haven’t spoken to her at all about dress color or anything. It was getting about that time to go home, and so I asked her if she would want to get together this weekend and maybe sit down and talk about the plan for the dance, like for lunch.

The moment I asked I could tell she was off put by the question, probably even weirded out. She said “Ok” and that was it. She then actively avoided me as we all walked back to our cars. 

I told one of my friends what happened while he rode in my car, and he said that I was fine and to let it sit. I had never asked a girl out before, so I was a little bummed out. It wasn’t like I was asking her to be my girlfriend, and we had hung out in group events before, so I didn’t know if I did something wrong. 

I get home and I get a call from my friend. He says that I need to text her to apologize. So, of course, I do. I basically say that I messed up, that I don’t want things to be awkward, that she can just text me the details of the dance, and that I’m still excited. She later texts back and says not to worry.

Fast forward to today. I asked my friend if he had heard anything from the rest of the group. He said that one of her pals told him that I caught her off guard, and that they know I like her.

I don’t really know what to think, or how I’m going to talk to her and not make things awkward for the dance. Any advice would be appreciated.

97,"Last month I just turned 25 years old and shortly before that I absolutely had everything together in my life. I just graduated college in May, I had a dream job with very good pay, I had an amazing girlfriend who I would have celebrated our one year in October of this month, and I had perfect health. Flashback to June of 2019 is when everything quickly fell apart. I was hanging out with friends one night and I was pressured into doing doing THC dab when I never smoke or do anything of such like that. I was a pretty depressed person at this time and I wanted to do anything to get my mind off the present and just feel good for a moment. So I did if. My mindset was, it’s just THC it can’t bother me that bad even if I have no tolerance for it, man was I wrong. Shortly after taking it time was skipping, it threw me into a panic attack, and I was incredibly sick and nauseous. Doing that dab brought my anxiety disorder back into my life, friends said it changed my personality, and I have daily headaches that last entire days. A lot of hobbies I used to do I can no longer do. Anything that involves heavy concentration or brain use, even writing this starts to give me an unbearable headache and I have to take breaks just to finish it. I can no longer drive because I get incredibly bad motion sickness and physical activities also bring about terrible headaches and nausea. It’s been 4 months since that happened and I’m still struggling to get better and heal. 

I was unable to work while I was in this condition and I ended up quitting my job before they could fire me. I stayed with my girlfriend at the time because she took care of me, took me to doctor and ER visits, and kept me company when I was in such a dark place in my life. She ended up leaving me in September because of all of this. Since this happened we couldn’t do much of anything. Social interaction, sex, daily panic attacks, and going out places were very taxing on me and I couldn’t be the boyfriend I needed to be with her. She felt really neglected and brung it up several times but I wasn’t in the right place physically or mentally to solve the problem. We are still friends but I feel daily guilt and sadness for doing all this to her when she always thought so highly of me and loved me so much. It breaks my heart and I want to get better to possibly amend things with her. She deserved so much more from me and that guilt still kills me. 

So here I am, October 2019. I lost everything I had. I’m living with my parents again until I can get back on my feet physically and mentally. My anxiety is mostly under control but the daily headaches, nausea, fatigue, brain issues, and dissociative like problems are lingering. All I keep telling myself is just keep going day by day and maybe one day these symptoms will fade and you will be your normal self again. Maybe one day I will be able to get back everything I lost and start life anew. I learned a lot from this experience. I learned how much everything I had truly meant to me. I saw the beauty in life that I never saw before. I saw the happiness that everything brought me that I never took into consideration before. I want everything back with this new perspective on life but my health and brain is holding me back. I’m crying every night because my life would be so much different if I hadn’t made that decision that fateful night. All I can think about most days is my ex. How she is enjoying her life without me and moving on while I’m stuck at home recovering. I don’t have the best support system so I feel really alone in all of this. 

Despite all my sleep issues and having trouble eating I’m working my hardest to beat this. I’m trying to exercise daily and sleep as much as I can within the limits of what my health allows me. I’m focusing on loving myself because I realized I can’t enjoy my life and love others if I don’t love myself first. I’m excited for a new start but I’m also terrified. That these brain issues or physical symptoms are permanent. It’s been so long. I have seen little improvement except for my anxiety disorder clearing up. All of this is so overwhelming. I just want my life back...",18Oct2019,1
98,"Some background, my bf and i are in our early 20s and we live in his parents place (we pay rent). his younger sister is 19 and she only works 20-30 mins by commuting so she’s old enough to do things on her own. 

we are planning to buy a car for ourselves since we use the family car sometimes. but now that we plan to buy our car, his younger sister keeps asking us if she will always get a ride home or to her work whenever her parents can’t. 

Is it our responsibility to pick her up and drop her off whenever she asks? I don’t like the idea of revolving our plans around her because we’re not her parents. Am i wrong for being annoyed that she’s expecting us to give her a ride all the time?

100,"Hello, I'm a 16-year-old boy who lives with my mom (my parents are divorced). Recently, I found a little oddly shaped bump on my mom's forehead. When asked, my mom says she ""bumped it."" Suspicious, I tried to get a closer look but she kept dodging her head so I couldn't get a clear look. Thinking that I was worrying too much I put it off. Two months later, the bump is still there. From what I have seen, it looks like a type of basal skin cancer. Which is the less dangerous of the skin cancers? Again, I could be just worrying too much but it looks familiar to what I've seen on the mayo clinic. We're not poor so it's not like we can't afford to get treatment, so I don't think that's a reason why she doesn't want me to see what it looks like. Also, during the summers, she almost never puts sunscreen on and she gets really tan.  So things may be in favor of my assumption.

The reason why she doesn't believe it is cancer is that she is a Christian scientist. Basically, she believes that disease and sin are not real and that through prayer and god all things will be healed. Which is a load of BS.  If you want more details on Christian science heres a disturbing article of the history of Christian Science,  [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/06/christian-science-church-medicine-death-horror-of-my-fathers-last-days](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/06/christian-science-church-medicine-death-horror-of-my-fathers-last-days)

101,"Hi everyone, i hope this is the right place that i can reach out for advice or any type of support. Somewhat long post ahead. My parents own a small mini market which opened up about 1 month ago. The whole process has been ridiculous, as we had our General contractor bail out half way thru the project and my dad was naive enough to pay him in advance. The contractor had agreed to wrap up all construction by December of last year, and by November of last year is when he walked out and didn't come back to finish at all. Between November and August, my family and i worked on the remodeling of the business to get it ready for inspections and keep the ball rolling. Between that time, we were still paying rent and my parents were no longer working. Sometime in May, my parents came to me and told me that they had zero dollars and that they needed to get more in order to get the project going. I am financially tight on money as well as i have been lending them my credit cards to pay for equipment and anything else, yet i am the one to pay for the monthly bills. Back in May, my parents shared the idea that i could buy their home and pull out the equity it had already built up in order to get some money going. So i bought my parents house and got about $60k out of it. We were okay money-wise until they opened up and needed to buy merchandise. The money quickly ran out and now i am greeted with another ""We ran out of money"". I don't know exactly where to look for or what to do to get some more money and keep this whole business from sinking down.

106,"*Sorry for formatting and grammar. I’m on mobile and very tired/sick.*

I’ll start by saying that I’m a 15 y/o guy. I go to a small religious school, and I have about 6 or 7 “close” friends (basically, ones that I feel comfortable opening up to).

Recently, I’ve noticed that I really want to have physical contact with my guy friends. I want to hold hands with them, hug them, etc. Unfortunately, hardly anyone reciprocates; those that do only hold out for a few seconds before feeling uncomfortable.

I would say that this feeling has been going on for a while now, maybe 2 or 3 months. Also, I don’t view it in a homosexual way. I’m straight*, and all of my friends are straight as well. So, I’m not trying to hit on them or anything. But many of my friends say that I come off as pretty flirtatious (more about this below).

Everyone thinks I’m joking, but I don’t think that’s the case. I’ll admit that it probably did start out as a joke, but it quickly turned into a comfort for me. Again, no one felt/feels the same.

I do see why it comes off as homosexual, though. In July, I admitted to being bisexual to 3 of my close friends. At first, they thought I was joking (again) but I told them I was serious and they understood. It was a phase though, because I became less and less attracted to guys as the end of August rolled around.

Now, I sort of feel this bisexuality coming back. I would be fine with a romantic relationship with a few of my male friends, but obviously they don’t think the same way.

Some of my friends have told me that they genuinely find it annoying, but I can’t stop. I totally admit that that is my fault, and I need to stop it. But I want to know why I feel like this. Why do I want to touch my friends? Am I really bisexual? Etc.

Thanks in advance for you responses! Have a great day :)",18Oct2019,1

110,"(Disclaimer: This is a mobile post, sorry for any unorganization. Also, I originally posted this to [**r/relationship\_advice**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/)).

&amp;#x200B;

Hello. I am very codependent in my relationships; I believe this is due to abandonment, trust issues, and low self-esteem. To make a long story short: Mom left the state when I was 11 y/o, told me she'd come back, never did, got married and started a new family and life. There are a few other issues, but that's the main spiel. I also have just moved to a new area, and my car is on the verge of breaking down, which makes it difficult to makes plans with my friends that live further out now. I also have VERY little money, as I am in between jobs.

My boyfriend is a good person, and is overall accommodating in our relationship; however, he is also very much independent. He makes a lot of time for me. He has a very busy work schedule. When he is not with me, he enjoys hanging out with his friends (on occasion, not all the time), going to the gym, going on walks by himself, or getting general tasks done that he couldn't while working.

I fully acknowledge that it is natural for someone to need time away from their partner. I know he can't miss me if I'm always around. He's a grown adult and he needs time for himself/others. Logically I know this. For some reason, my mind translates this as him not wanting to spend time with me. It ranges from feelings of either (usually) sadness, anger/passive-aggressive tendencies, and or acceptance. Acceptance happens the least often.

Thoughts that occur when I'm sad: ""He's falling out of love with me"", ""He'd rather be doing *insert task* than hang out with me"", ""I did something wrong"", ""what's wrong with me"", ""of course he doesn't want to be with me, no one does"".

Thoughts that occur when I'm angry: ""Fine. I don't need him anyways."" ""Alright, go. Have a blast."" ""Why do you want to spend time with them? Aren't I enough?"" ""You should want to spend time with me. I'm your girlfriend.""

The acceptance kind of goes without saying. That's the off chance where my emotions line with my logic and says ""He's his own person with his own life, he should go enjoy himself. He loves me and he makes lots of plans with me.""

In my circumstances, what can I do to allow myself to be content when I'm alone? I'd like to busy myself with tasks, but am not sure where to start. For example, I feel I would enjoy going on walks/trails, but I live in a junky area where I fear the worst when alone. I also acknowledge the way I behave is totally toxic, and would like to stop taking out my internalized issues on him.

tl;dr:

What can I do to feel more fulfilled when by myself, and how do I stop my toxic and emotionally manipulative behaviors towards my boyfriend for wanting to simply live his life?",18Oct2019,1
111,"**This program is one-year, studies global issues and affairs.**

They require: CV, Transcript, Statement of Purpose, Writing Sample, 3 Letters of Rec, FL Proficiency

Right now, I have a few options for major(s):

1. BA Mathematics, BA Philosophy, Econ Minor
2. BS Quantitative Econ, BA Philosophy
3. BA Economics, BA Philosophy, History Minor

* Of course, the first two give me a higher quantitative background, and while I understand this doesn't apply to a subject like Global Thought, it'll help me demonstrate expertise in growing fields (data analysis in social science) and give me a good backup for other careers. However, my GPA is pretty ""out-there"" to say the least. I have a 4.0 MAJOR GPA in Philosophy, while my overall is around 3.2 due to a couple fails in math and mediocre GenEds FR/SO year.
* The last one obviously seems the most applicable to this program, but my transcript would look a little weird if I took Linear Algebra and Time Series and just stopped suddenly lol.
* However, I need to work on my GPA, so the last one might be better for THAT reason, AND it'll help me focus on getting a couple research/publication opportunities more applicable to this MA program.
* Otherwise, I will have pretty good GRE scores (slightly lower than Columbia grad average, but pretty good), a pretty good writing sample, and some terrific CV projects.

Sounds good right? The problem is, I haven’t the first clue about church productions, like anything at all. I’ve been playing music at this church for 2 years and I’ve gotten a lot better, but gospel music is pretty difficult so I’m still learning. 

I love playing music. I never thought of myself as running sound and now this came up, plus I’m, like, chronically broke since I’m in college. It’ll be easier to not have to learn all that music, but i know my musician ship is getting better the more I’m playing. I feel like even if I were getting more money, I wouldn’t like what I was doing because I wouldn’t be doing what I loved. However, it would give me experience on a new side of the music business. 

So, any advice? Any insight, pros and cons, whatever you may have. Both will help me, one is what I want to do but am not good at, the other will give me a new opportunity to learn a new side of the music business and give me more money, I’m just kinda stuck.

133,"I’ve been out of high school for about 3 years now and that’s essentially where all of my friends sprouted from, along with gaming, and having jobs. 
I moved 14 hours away because I didn’t like my hometown, my parents, and I typically felt like the odd one out constantly and under appreciated. My real dad committed suicide when I was 6, my dad who has been around since I was months old isn’t very personally attached to me - but I could always thank him for introducing me to video games. Let alone, his kid, my sister is his soul child and I always saw and felt it - out, again. 
I moved to be with my boyfriend, who is nothing but great and beyond, and so are his parents. They’re wonderful, I feel like family. 

But through all this - I’m having a hard time fighting the loneliness of not having friends anymore. I got a job weeks ago, and no one there really seemed interested in hanging out or going out and doing anything, especially since I don’t really know this big city that well. I got another job, and that was a total loss - I didn’t even get to do what I signed up for so I quit that one because I was sinking into a hole with it. 

All of my friends in my hometown started splitting and moving since we all got older, I used to be booming on PS4 with people, but I barely ever get an invite now. If I ever find anyone to play with, there’s never another invite after the one day we play. No one will join a party or game if I invite. It’s all starting to put me into a deep, deep hole. 

I’m only 20 (F) so I can’t go to bars. I have no idea how to connect here. I get jealous of my boyfriend because he has made lots of friends at work, and plays games with them and talks to them, and I don’t join in, well, because I don’t play they’re particular game or I can’t vibe into the conversation they’re having. So I get stuck and lost in this world and I’m not sure if I’m going crazy anymore or if I should move back, but it was worse there than it is now. I’m so confused. I just want human interaction.  

I need another job, but with how the last two played out, I’m really hoping I can find people to connect with. 

TLDR; How do I make new friends in a new city? A completely different environment with no one you know?",18Oct2019,1
134,"So I’ve come across a very confusing fork in my road of life. I currently am 18 and working a crappy part time job. I live with my mom and isolate myself in my cramped room. My boyfriend of about 3-4 months is moving into a house and he wants me to move in when he does. It’s about 30-40 minutes from where I live now. I really want to move out because I’d love my own space and I’ve been DYING at the chance to move out because my family and household is toxic. However, I’m not happy in my relationship. I feel crappy just going with it just to move out but I’ve been wanting this chance for forever. I’ve already bought stuff for the house that I could return still and get my money back. I don’t know what to do. I know I should do what makes me happy but I don’t know what that is. I’d be happy moving out but not with him, but I’d be happy having money to myself and still be able to do whatever I want. What should I do?

136,"I’m not sure if this subreddit is exactly where this post belongs, it’s really hard to find specific ones in the crowd. 

I’ve been getting into a lot of trouble. The learned behaviour from toxic family members –and those who learned it before the others–has caused strain on my relationship, because I don’t know otherwise. Without the outdated traditions I have almost successfully tried to break out of, I am only half way of becoming less toxic. I have been told I am manipulative, and constantly play the victim. I want to know if you have been through situations like this where you’ve tried to justify yourself through your past, and it only backfiring on you because you pulled out the “victim card” or “past card”? 

Lately, especially during these months, I become more depressed and unmotivated to work, or study. I can barley think clear, and I have a lot of personal, financial, anxiety disorder–and lots of other issues that everyone has. My problem is I can’t think about anything, not the future, not my present, what I want in life and how to reach it. I don’t think about the effects of my words either when I argue and it hurts people. I can’t see my wrongdoings, unless I’m told. And if I don’t learn how to do it myself, or catch myself in mistakes, I’ll always be the same.

137,"Before this starts let me say I have really bad social anxiety,  I have really bad grammar and if you need more context I more than happy to answer.... Thank you for understanding. 

So lets call her Kate. 

Kate and I have been friends starting when she was a senior in high school. Always chill and we were never a thing. It wasn't until she ended up in the hospital over the summer that I would visit her more than her own family and her own boyfriend  (I am a kid who has no social life and she was really my only friend.) therefore we became really close and got along really well. (I might add I was also already close friends with the boyfriend before)

She eventually broke up with her boyfriend and I would be the person who got stuck in the middle of EVERYTHING.This put a lot of stress on what I already had on my plate.  Well after the breakup we would still talk and hang out on weekends so I was fine.  


I would like advice with two things:

 She became the main tie to the friend circle. I never intended on catching feelings but I did. I told her and she brushed off with not a clear answer. She starts talking with a 17 y/o kid and I just took the hint. Lets call him Jack. Jack is a big F-boy who tried to get with my high school freshman  sister. I haven't told her any thing of what her ex said, or that Jack tried getting with my sister. But I don't want her to get her heart broke again as a friend.

I also have Screen shots of Jack flirting with other girls while Kate has clearly shown interest in him by having things on a snap chat story with hearts and all.

She has really fallen for this guy and has because of it she hasn't talked to me much in the past month spending a-lot of time with Jack. I carry most of the conversations. I have tried telling her that I have a lot on my mind and she INSISTS on trying to help, but she doesn't know that it's her actions that really affect a lot of my mood.

I have tried ghosting her but when I don't answer to her she ends up calling, showing up, or coming back.

Do I tell her I about Jack? Do show her the Screen shots? Or should I just say this isn't good for me and leave.",18Oct2019,1
138,"hi there, i'm 15 and thinking of converting to catholicism. the thing is, i'm completely lost on how.

i should say that i was raised atheist and my mother is against religion (due to her own personal reasons, i'm not entitled to disclose), so i never really had the idea of (the) God(s) in my mind until recently. but i'm pretty sure i'd like to convert. there's something about religion that seems appealing, i can't quite grasp what it is though.

so the point i'm trying desperately to make is, i need to know where to start. the bible(s)? i don't know anything about that. churches sort of make me uneasy, so i'd rather not go. unless that's wrong? can i convert to a religion and not go to church? is the idea of more than one God not acceptable either?

140,So for my sixteenth birthday my mom bought me a nice ring that is very symbolic and meaningful. I love the ring and I wear it constantly as in almost everyday. I’ve had the ring for a little over a year now and I’m generally a very responsible person so I haven’t had trouble keeping up with it until the other day. I’m very involved in school activities and I had to do something that required me to not wear any jewelry so I took of all my jewelry(including the ring obviously) and went and did the activity. Afterward I got my stuff and went home and the ring wasn’t in my stuff where I thought it was. I’ve been looking for it for about a day now and I can’t find it anywhere and I’m beginning to worry. It’s value is probably around $250 so I could probably get my hands on another one if I had too but I honestly don’t think my mom would notice I just feel extremely guilty and I don’t know what I should do.,18Oct2019,2

I’m still pretty young so I never really knew that you shouldn’t trust anyone in a workplace until now so i’ve recently found out that some of my coworkers have been complaining about me and some things I would say to them as a joke of course and I thought I could trust them as friends. clearly not and my manager spoke directly to me addressing their concerns and she gave me a verbal warning. She also gave me a print out of the verbal warning and when I read exactly what my manager thought happened, 4/5 of them were completely wrong and a complete misunderstanding. 

I’m super scared to tell her that it’s all wrong again because when she first talked to me about these issues i told her my side. clearly she didn’t listen to me and only listens to the other workers who complained about me. I have this verbal warning on my profile now so if future employers check they can see. But to me it’s so unfair that everything is wrong and a misunderstanding. My other coworkers that are actually my friends tell me to go to HR, but on the other hand in previous experiences of former employees, whoever reports anyone, especially my manager to HR, they end up getting fired or quitting because HR always tells my manager who complained about who. 

pretty much i can’t trust most of my coworkers, can’t trust my manager (everyone at work hates her), and i can’t trust going to HR

152,"fist time posting :-) 
All through out college I’ve had a difficult time meeting people and making friends. With most of my former high school friends I’ve slowing been losing contact with or have been cut out completely.
Last semester my, at the time, group of close friends decided to end our friendship and then they all began to hangout without me.  This whole downfall of our friendship is quite complicated to explain but in short I was struggling mentally and imposed a lot of self isolation and when I would actually have to leave my apartment I wasn’t exactly being a good friend or fun to be around so I can understand why they needed their space. 

So over the summer we go our separate ways. I spend the time working on myself and really focus on being better mentally and as a friend. 

Fall rolls around and I haven’t seen or talked to them in a couple of months. I currently have one friend that from the group that often feels like a pity friend who means well but only wants to hangout if I ask her first. I want to reconnect or repair my friendships but I’m not even sure where to begin after not talking for months.

Anyways, one friend mentioned it to me, and I tried to laugh it off but it bothered me. Even if I hadn’t lost another dog prior to this it would have left a bad taste in my mouth. I decided to brush it off.
The other friend tries cracking jokes with me about this later, and this is where I’m in the wrong. I didn’t tell her I was uncomfortable with that kind of joke and I just... lost it?
She said(paraphrased) “haha what would you do if I kidnapped your dog?”

162,"

So I went into a Family Dollar, after seeing a clearance sign from the street. I didn't originally plan to go there, I was actually shopping at a different store across the street, but when I saw the sign and just barely missed my bus, I decided to go in and kill some time, and see what I wanted. I went in and after being in the store for at least 30 minutes, a woman, who later claimed to be the assistant manager, told me to leave my bags up front. Since I had been shopping in other stores I had my purse and two other reusable bags holding my previous purchases. I was kinda of offended, not because she asked, but because she waited so long to ask. I told the ""assistant manager"" (she had no name tag, and no way to identify her or what type of employee she was) that I was done shopping and I was leaving. I headed towards the door and she was in front of me and offered me a shopping cart and asked if I wanted it. I told her again, I was done shopping. As I was about to exit. The metal detector started beeping, and she said why are you beeping? I said I don't know. Then she said, you must have taken something, why are you beeping? Then she pointed at Christmas ornaments that were in my bag and said what about those? I said I bought this somewhere else and I have the receipts for everything I have with me. Then I put my stuff down and started pulling my items out so the ass manager could search my stuff and check to see if I took anything. Then she started saying oh that's not necessary. I told her I wanted her to know for sure that I didn't take anything. She then kept saying that it was necessary for me to take my stuff out and she did this while checking out customers, even though she wasn't the only employee in the store. I put all my bags individually through the metal detector, and none of them beeped. Then I realized the beeping came from the shopping cart she put right in front of the detector. It has a metal bar attached to keep people from leaving the store and sensors on it. I'm sure she knew this. What type if lawyer deals with this type of situation? She changed her tune very quickly once she saw the ornaments I had were not even sold at family Dollar. Thing is I actually work retail, and I would not outright accuse someone of stealing, if I saw them take something, there is a correct way to handle it. What do you think? Sad thing is I was pricing things I was planning on buying later, but couldn't carry now, since I don't have a car. Why did the ass manager change her tune so quickly? Also since I work retail I can see signs of theft, and I wouldn't be surprised if the ass manager herself was a thief. She obviously knew I wasn't stealing, it was like she was putting on a show or something. She never said she would call the police, never bothered to make sure I didn't actually steal. Why make the accusation but not follow up and check? Clarity?",18Oct2019,2

I got a job to buy him stuff like his favorite food, clothes, toys, snacks, and whatever else my little cute prince would want. Hes very gentle and loveable. He never bites, scratches unless its accidental when hes excited, and I love him so much and he loves me back. I always take him on walks right after i come from school. I became more social with him around. I got to know the group of moms and people in my neighborhood. My dog means everything to me and i would often cry whenever I think about him leaving me. I love him so much but my parents are the opposite. They hate him because hes basically a dog. They never care for him and they usually kick him around, leave him outside for almost the entire day if im not there to stop it.

To travel there, it would cost around $2000 and even though many would gladly drop that amount to see their family again that they hadn't seen in years, I'm not that thrilled at the idea of dropping that much money to see them. Like, I don't think they're worth 2k, as horrible as that sounds.


My parents are talking about us going to travel there for Christmas + New Years (paying for my own ticket, since I have a part time job and could afford it), but honestly I would rather just stay here in Canada than spend $2000 to see them.

Should I just suck it up and go travel to see them or just do whatever I feel like doing, i.e, just staying in Canada for the holidays?

168,"I’ll try to keep this simple and to the point.
I live at home with my mom and step-father. They have fought and fought for the last 10 years but because of large amounts of debt, my mom cannot afford a divorce and relocation all while paying for my sisters college. What makes this worse is my step dad is a mentally unstable drug addict. he kept his drug use, mostly meth, under covers for almost 15 years before we found out about 5 years ago. Since this, i feel like his use has increased and has driven almost completely off the rails. when he’s on, he’s the nicest person you’d ever meet. He’ll give you gifts, take you out, buy vehicles and other expensive items. But when he’s coming down, he becomes an absolute egotistical, manipulative, racist, psychological abusing, ass hole. And what really makes this bad is he is very smart. I wouldn’t say he makes very wise choices but he does plan out these very elaborate ways to fuck people over. Anyway, This weekend my mom is going out of town to our hometown with one of her very few friends for an annual festival where her favorite band is performing. Well ever since my step dad found out, he’s been trying to get her to do other things with or take him with her. He threatened to follow her if she didn’t let him go with her. That eventually turned into him making what i would consider to be death threats towards my mom. over the last week he’s offhandedly mentioned he “cleaned all the fingerprints off of his gun” and has been “doing some long range practice”. this event takes place on the bank of a very wide river.  Well that event is this weekend. my mom left with her friend this morning and as of right now my step dad is still home, packing. i went into the garage a few minutes ago and saw two of his hunting rifles set out in travel bags. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. Do i report it? who do I report it to? Is what he’s doing even technically illegal? Making threats towards my mom is nothing new for him but because of the fact that he’s a complete pussy, he’s always been “all talk” but i feel like he’s close to snapping. 

TL;DR: Drug addict step-father is threatening to shoot my mom and may be serious this time",18Oct2019,2
169,"I'm currently a sophomore in high school and feeling crushed in just about every way. School is the leading cause of all this and I have no clue what to do. The pressure and stress stems from what now feels like an unreachable goal. I'm hoping to be the first college grad in my family, and as the oldest sibling I feel an immense pressure to lead the way. My parents are supportive and want to help in any way possible but they can't, coming from an uneducated and poor background they can't help me with any advice, processes, and schoolwork. Even though it's just HS I feel incredibly unprepared and like I won't be good enough to pull through and graduate college. Right now I'm only taking dual credit pre-calculus, ap psych, and doubling up on science. But now I'm not sure I can make it. I struggle to do well with the amounts of homework given, it takes up almost my entire day and I rarely do anything outside of school. My grades are all high A's so the counselor brushes me off saying I'm fine and to just keep doing what I'm doing. What she fails to see is I'm a total mess, I've contemplated things I shouldn't and I can't control my emotions anymore. I've just lost all hope, I don't see a point in trying so hard when in the end I'm at a risk of failing and losing it all. 

My pre-calculus teacher is perhaps the worst teacher I've ever encountered. She teaches using flimsy unhelpful note sheets and hours of homework daily. I spend more time trying to teach myself the subjects than actually doing work. Test review for a short quiz took 10+ hours in 2 days. As the entire damn time I was still teaching myself material I should already know. Due to credit requirements I cant leave this class, not to mention that it'll show on my college transcript that I dropped the class. As someone who plans to major in CS this is killing me. I have to get through this class to fulfill future math requirements. But I just don't think I can at this rate. I'm sleeping less than 6 hours a day, I let other classes hw build up to keep track of this class alone. Ap Psych is at least interesting and rewards the hours you put in, but no matter what I am not learning in pre calc. Following is my biology teacher, she is one of the nicest and best teachers I've had, but combined with everything else I can't keep up. Junior level biology(not even ap) shouldn't be such a step up from my regular classes work. But my teacher holds a reputation for dropping gpa's for a reason, her classwork is a huge step up from any non college course offered at my school and is chipping away at me. If I followed a normal pathway and took general classes in order I wouldn't struggle with a single thing. I would be learning math i did in middle school. The discrepancy between HS and college work is what has scared me beyond belief, I feel a sense of despair every time another assignment is given as I know I'll have to put it off till later. If I can't handle such simple workloads now how can I expect myself to do better and harder work later?  

Quite frankly I'm losing my mind. I'm consistently anxious and stressed out. I don't hate school I hate myself for not being able to keep up. I don't have time for recreation, clubs, or extra curriculars. I'm friends with some incredible people taking harder course loads than I who are completely fine. I struggle with doing just about anything as my mind state is in a deep dark place. I find it hard to enjoy things because I know that at the end of the day I'll be slaving away at hw for a chance at success. I have problems with technology addiction and have worked so hard to keep it under control. The most used app on my phone nowadays is a graphing calculator and math help apps. But even through all this my efforts feel for naught. It's not a distant future where I see myself just quitting out of mental exhaustion. Essentially I'm asking for life advice. Anything whether it be time management help, resources for school, ways to control all these bundled up feelings, what should I do? Anything you think could even help in the slightest is appreciated, I feel lost and like I'm sprinting away from everything just to reach a dead end.",18Oct2019,7
172,"So, I met this guy this summer. He was very into me and I tried to push him off, because I had problems and I was scared to be in a relationship due to trauma (been raped 3 years ago, which caused me anxiety, depression, PTSD, vaginal problems, etc etc).
But he kept insisting saying he wanted to help me. I decided to give it a shot.
He was very nice, and always respected my boundaries. He talked about wanting kids, possibly moving together, but I was like: Oof, let’s slow down, okay? I really love you, but I need to take it slow on some things, and have a serious discussion about it soon. He kept telling me he loved me, and many beautiful things...
At first, it was great. And boy, was he good in bed. Sweet Jesus.
But, I got overwhelmed in life, by many many things, and had a mental breakdown. He wanted to help me, but I saw it kinda broke him. I knew it was my fault even though he was saying it wasn’t. 
Then, I tried to talk to him, to understand what happened, he got angry, of course, and said contradictory things to what he previously said. He is an honest and intelligent person, very rational. I never sensed a lie coming from him. Even on questions tha embarrassed him.
And I saw him a couple of times, because his roommate asked for my help, and I decided not to talk to him and respect his privacy. But he was always trying to get my attention or the attention of the conversation. It was either hot and cold. And now, I am feeling numb and lost and confused, because I dunno, he said he loved me, then he didn’t, now he has contraditory actions...",18Oct2019,2

my mom has been verbally abusive for years. the last week or so was alright. she said some things but i didn't really let them get to me, i brushed it off and told myself she was in pain and she let it out on me. NBD.

today my family was going on a walk and my mom was behind everyone else. i backed up a little to give her some company. i know shes not in a good place mentally and want to be there for her. we started talking and she mentioned that im always embarrassing her. she said that everything i do brings shame to the family. this hurt because i get very good grades, i volunteer, i havent smoked or had sex or drank, basically been the best daughter i could have.

she then said she didnt want me and that i should stay away from her. she said not to talk to her.

wtf? i was the one person out of my family to hung back to give her some company. a couple months ago, she did a college course and I DID ALL HER ASSIGNMENTS. I make her tea and help her around the house. I didnt do anything to deserve this.

179,"I’m 18, and I’m a lesbian. I haven’t seen or spoken to my dad in years. I cut ties with him when I was 13. I haven’t seen or spoken to him outside of getting insurance information since. 

The last time I saw him, he was very anti-LGBT, and I have no way of knowing if his views have changed. 

From my 12th birthday on until I cut ties with him, every time I saw him, he’d ask me, completely seriously, if I had a boyfriend. My dad had a vasectomy when I was little, and has no other children. While he doesn’t seem to mind that I’m a woman and can’t “pass on the family line” in the traditional sense, he has always been adamant that I have grandchildren eventually, claiming that he “wants his genes to live on”. 

The major life event that actually gave me the courage to cut him out of my life was nearly dying. I needed chemotherapy to treat my disorder. Before I received the treatment, I was told that it would probably cause lasting fertility issues. I didn’t care then, and I don’t care now, but my dad did. He didn’t want my illness treated if it meant I may have trouble having children. I would have died without it. 

My dad has always thought being controlling of the women in his life was okay. He’s on wife number four now based on the insurance cards I’ve been given. My mom was the first, and my parents divorced only ten years ago. 

Recently he has reached out to me again, and I’ve been making an effort to at least be civil and not ignore him. 

I really don’t want to see him again, but I was advised by my grandparents that I should try at least answering his texts because I will need updated insurance information in January. My mom lost her job recently, and has been having issues finding a new one. It’s happened several times before, and as I have a medical condition, I can’t afford to be without insurance. I was under 18 until recently, and previously my dad was required to give insurance information. 

So I’ve been answering his texts, and for the most part, much to my relief, he hasn’t been prying into my personal life too much. 

However this evening he sent me this text: 

https://i.imgur.com/GdYtgMt.jpg

One, he definitely should have phrased that differently, and two, I don’t know what to tell him. I have no way of knowing if he still hates the LGBT community, and while I don’t currently have a girlfriend, I also have absolutely no interest in men at all. Knowing how much he values biological grandchildren, I don’t imagine he’d like it if I said “because I don’t want one”, although that would be the truth. Maybe I should have just said yes. I was hoping he would just drop the subject.",18Oct2019,3

182,I tried making a post on this sub asking for advice on something but it doesn’t let me,18Oct2019,4
183,there is a kid at my school who would follow me around and stuff. he would sit in my friend group and annoy everyone in it. he talks about things he should not talk about (like private stuff) and does not get work done. he is annoying (very) and becomes really suicidal when he does not want anything. he is an overreacting person and nobody wants too be his friend. any advice to just leave him? i don't want him to get hurt.,18Oct2019,5
185,"Has anyone ever had a friendship  where you work hard to please them and entertain them because you didn't want them to lose interest in you? And then one day you burn out from how tired doing that is making you so you distance yourself and the friendship goes to shit? well it's happening to me.

I'm not sure what spurred this on but at one point in our friendship, they began to lose interest in me. Out of desperation, i tried to do my best to make sure they wouldn't drift, and it included doing activities and helping them even though I didn't necessarily  want to ( and getting nothing back) and sacrificing doing stuff I enjoyed to spend time with them. It, looking back, was very mentally unhealthy for me because I pushed all the blame on myself, for not being entertaining and fun anymore and being boring and that I needed to pretend I was someone I wasn't, and it worked for a while.

After a while, I felt so drained mentally, from stressing out over our friendship and trying so hard, it  became toxic for me and I decided to stop. I started to focus on other things in my life, and after drifting a little\*, I began to start to enjoy doing things that I had previously given up before in order to spare time for them. We drifted, but then they began to trying to get close to me, right when i finally felt relaxed, almost roping me back into stressing and caring everyday about them. Because of this they started becoming obnoxious to me, even the little thing made me annoyed and I wanted to drift even further so wouldn't have to deal with them. But, due to our previous closeness it wasn't easy to drift, and the pressure kept mounting on me.

It got to the point where I snapped and we argued and we talked it out (?) and they wanted us to go back to being as close as before, but after everything even though we supposedly ""made up"", I really don't feel up to it, I'm fine with being normal friends but i don't want that same level of closeness, however if i start trying to drift again they'll call me out or we'll get in another argument..., there's also the problem that we are in the same friend group is it bad that i don't want to be close with them anymore, possibly not even friends?

&amp;#x200B;

\* keep in mind because of my desperation, the friendship's closeness had escalated to ""unnecessarily (almost abnormally) close friends"" and that became the norm for us, so when I say I drifted we just downgraded to ""pretty close friends"" so it's not like I was ignoring them or anything, i just didn't force myself to talk to them as much",18Oct2019,7

187,"This post is gonna be a little detailed because it’s such a unique situation. I also don’t use reddit a lot so if there’s a more dedicated sub for this please let me know.

Late last week I saw a Reddit post from a friend of mine that read like a suicide note, openly posting suicidal intentions and it even ended wishing everyone goodbye. This obviously concerned me a great deal, but when I frantically messaged her about it (as soon as I saw it about an hour after it was posted) she denied making it. She claimed her account was hacked and that she was gonna report it as fake, and she deleted the account. I know the hacked story isn’t true, and even when talking on the phone with her right after I could tell she was feeling depressed and not as lively as she usually is, but despite this I went along with the story, telling her I believed her. 

The suicide note was passionate and posted to a personality disorder sub, for a condition I didn’t know she had. Because of this, I don’t want to push the fact I knew it wasn’t true. She’s pretty open, so the fact that she never shared that she’s going through this makes me know that it’s serious and not want to bring it up again, and that she might be embarrassed or think that I would think differently of her for her depression/condition, which I obviously wouldn’t. I know that suicide rates are significantly higher in people with the condition she has.

Since the post she’s made offhand comments that terrify me and even if not directly suicidal, they feed into her idea of no self worth and put her down. She's also made comments before the post that have suicidal themes, which I only now realise. I haven’t brought up the suicide post since because I don’t know if it would act as a trigger for a depression attack or something like that (I know almost nothing on mental health so I’ve been trying to avoid references to the post, depression, suicide and Reddit since), and the more time that passes the less I can legitimately bring it up.

I’ve known her since February and she never gave off signs that she was depressed or suicidal. Because I also almost never use Reddit, this was the first post I have ever seen from her. This makes me even more worried, since I have no idea if she’s made similar posts in the past. We’ve joked around on topics that looking back I don’t think were the best for someone with these thoughts.

The fact that she acted so surprised when I said that I knew her Reddit also worries me. She clearly forgot that she gave me her username, and probably thinks I stalked her/violated her privacy or that I’ve seen another personal post that she made in the past which would embarrass her. She may also think that I had seen a post in the past and didn’t reach out, which would definitely feed into the idea that no one likes/cares about her, as she claimed in her post. Because I think she might think I stalked her too I’m worried that she thinks negatively about me now and won’t listen if I try to help or express concern. She uses reddit a lot, so I also feel like the fact she lost her account because of me/I know of her situation might have had a negative effect on her that maybe contributes to the depression?

It’s serious enough where I start to get a little anxious if she hasn’t replied to a message after a few hours and I’m terrified of what might happen if I don’t offer help soon, since I'm definitely the only person who knows she feels this way, and I know something will happen at some point if I don’t help. But I also know she will continue to deny it if I express my concerns, and I don’t know how close of a friend she considers me so she might brush it off. How do I proceed given the situation? Is this even my place to try and do something?

**Tl;dr:** My friend posted a suicide note last week on Reddit, denied that she posted it and I went along with it. She has made comments since that worry me and I want to help but don’t know if/how given the uniqueness of situation.",18Oct2019,2

189,"ok yea boys this is gonna be a long one. I have no idea where to start so I apologize if this post is a little scattered. 

A little bit of back story: 
-My dad worked in construction and my mom was a stay at home
-my mom cleaned the house, never assigned my sister and I specific chores tho may I add, while my dad was gone(important), but he eventually ended up getting laid off and started staying at home
-mother got into pain killers among other activities while dad was gone and got him hooked and rose hell when he got back
-house went to complete shit because mom hoarded and started meth and dad was stuck on prescribed meds
-dad now gets government pay and has been for the past like 7years(important)

I (F18) live with my dad (M51) and my sister (F21) and her boyfriend (M20) in a new house we bought a few months ago. We lived in a duplex before and I had my dad PROMISE me not to treat this house like we did the duplex. I’ll be straight up we took SHIT care of it. and I’m scared because the SAME thing is happening here. 
My dad sleeps in the living room because apparently his back hurts to sleep on a bed, (yet he doesn’t go out of his way to try different types of beds. only memory foam) so he has made the living room his bedroom. He does not take care of even his blankets, goes the longest he can without washing and usually only does if something has spilt on it. I don’t even think I can tell you if he has ever washed his pillows. His shirts constantly have stains from him passing out in his recliner. He literally eats ice cream as meals. He buys me chips for dinner. When I tell you guys he has been up for about 1 day in the past 4 days I mean it. I honestly could go on but I’m leaving it at that to hopefully get my point across. 
Obviously I start fights with him about it all the time. Am I proud of that? No. Am I aware it doesn’t help? Yes.  but I genuinely do not know what to do. Anytime I bring anything up to him he basically turns it into a pity fest saying that I think he has a shit dad and he is a horrible person and he is lazy and doesn’t do anything. That he does so much for me and I do not respect him at all and if i did i would not talk to him the way i do. 
Not sure where to add this but my sister and I work 40 hour weeks in food service, like when I come home i don’t want to step in and have to clean up dog piss or shit, that’s another reason I get so upset. I will admit I do not do shit around the house either, other than what i see, but I literally work a full time (when i only applied for part time but that’s a story for another day) and he stays at home all day and he cannot simply put the dogs out and MAKE SURE they go potty? he argues about having 4 dogs is too much all the time when it genuinely is not. you feed the dogs all at once and you put them all outside together, especially when it’s this fall weather they will stay and play outside for HOURS! it’s not that hard. 
I am just lost. I do not want to live with him if he cannot see that the way he is living IS lazy and disgusting. I always feel so drained and unmotivated. I also am too embarrassed to bring any friends over because of it. 

Do I need to just suck it up and start cleaning the house myself? Do I move out? Do i find a different way to confront him about it? Please anything will help.",18Oct2019,2

193,"Pretty much the title.. I am 20yrs old and work in retail. I met my ex at this job over two years ago and as the title says, he sexually assaulted me. It’s something I tried to block out for a long time but eventually had to face. Somedays it bothers me more than others, but especially the days we work together. We work in the same department and because of his seniority (I’m a rehire who left shortly after the incident and came back recently) he will usually end up running the floor. Meaning I will have to report to him should I need any direction. 

He only works two days a week, one of those days being Saturday, and while I haven’t been scheduled any lately I am working 9a-4p next weekend. Since the schedule came out I’ve felt sick to my stomach. Just thinking about it makes me so anxious. I know I will have to go up to him to find out where I need to go, what I need to do, etc, but I won’t be able to. I can manage when he’s a few registers away, but having to have direct contact with him? Having to listen to his voice, see his face, see his hands, I just can’t.

I don’t know what to do, I’m still in my probationary period so I can’t call out. I’m honestly scared to go to anyone in HR because from what I’ve seen he is very well liked and respected in the department. I also don’t want to explain to any of my managers what happened to me because it’s still embarrassing and I feel ashamed. 

What should I do? The only HR manager I have a lot of trust in has no control over my schedule, and the one that does gets on very well with my attacker. Should I just tell her the gist of it without name dropping him? Should I just suck it up and try to get through these shifts with him? How can I shut myself off emotionally when I’m in the same space as him? I’m just at a total loss. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",18Oct2019,12

203,"So basically I got a solid relationship with my brother me14(m) him15(m) though a lot of the times he just gets in weird moods where he does dumb crap to annoy me like making annoying squeky noises and always jumping around my personal area, it usually quickly escalates because if I don't tell.him to stop right away he pokes me on the neck something small so I get back at him and he goes far hitting me much harder then I tell him not cool or something like that and he starts talking crap to annoy me.
 Until I go to my mom who is a yeller, and I am fairly certain she is bias towards my brother because yesterday for example I was brushing in the bathroom and he came in to brush his teeth to, I'm annoyed he says move your brush I need to spit and proceeds to wait 20 seconds to spit as I keep nagging him.to.spit so I hit him lightly on his neck and he pushes me into the window and it breaks. My mom yelled at both of us mainly me for not telling him to leave the bathroom right away and that I have an anger problem she brings up everytime we get.in an argument and she always finds a way to point out something I did wrong. As for my dad he is cool but gone for work 5 days a week and exhausted when he comes back from the plane so I don't bug him. My brother also always calls me stupid and basically roasts me for disagreeing with him and frames the concept as so easy and how could.i not agree with him. Also if we get in trouble we both get.punished  so natural I don't want to tell on him if I get in trouble to. Which empowers him, and also my mother if she usually has an assumption about the argument she sticks with it and quickly yells about other bs so as to not be proven wrong.

An old high school ex is trying to follow me on social media. We were together for a school year, where he was my first boyfriend. 

It's been years since I've seen him. Though we did talk online once in the past to touch base, not in a romantic way just to check in. I haven't talked to him since and am a bit surprised by him reaching out. I'm not sure if I want to start talking again. 


Looking for thoughts and advice.

209,"So i’ve known this girl for maybe 12-13 years and she’s been one of my closest friends ever since then. Around five years ago she moves to North Carolina and we lose communication. Around two weeks ago she hits me up and we start talking cuz e we haven’t talked in a long time. Later on she sending hella signals and I ask her if she wants to be more than just friends and she says yeah. A little backstory, my stepsister is also friends with this person and has been friends with this girl, but I’ve known this girl for a longer. I’ve sort of been getting a hunch that her and my stepsister are coalescing to play with my feelings and hurt me. It doesn’t seem like that at first but my stepsister is very manipulative. A couple days back I ask this girl if she’s OK with sending pics she says yeah so she sends some shower pics and I ask her if I can save them if she says yes. Now, she and I’ve gone over this that with me she has no limits but I recently checked my saved messages and it seems to be that she deleted them.

The problem here is that girls, and people in general, think I’m funny because they notice me in a group, but when it becomes 1 on 1 I sort of shut down and I struggle to be funny :(

What can I do about this? There is a girl that I’m pretty sure likes me but I haven’t really talked to her one on one. She only really knows what I’m like from how I act in a group of people. I just have trouble starting a conversation and continuing it while still being interesting and funny. I try to just relax and be confident but it’s tough. Thoughts?",18Oct2019,1
213,"TLDR at the bottom.  


This is absolutely crushing me and I don't know what to do. I met \*Sarah\* at work and we were hanging out as friends. I have been deeply longing for a friend for many many years and when we first met we just hit it off instantly sharing many of the same passions and overall similar vibe (so I thought). I understand many people will be thinking ""bullshit"" just cos i'm a guy but it is true, I really just needed a friend and had very little physical attraction to this girl. She invited me for a bbq with her husband \*Trevor\*. My wife is a homely person so she stayed home and I went by myself. Sarah put her kids to bed early so the 3 of us drank, talked and pretty much had a decent night. Trevor went to bed and Sarah and I sat up talking and did weed and mdma. A few hours later she went to bed with hubby and I slept on the couch.   


Some time during the night she came out to the loungeroom where I was asleep and started pulling my pants down. I woke up and kinda laughed and said ""what are you doing"". She said ""shhh you will wake Trevor"". Now Trevor is a big buff guy, at least 50lbs heavier, and no doubt would beat the living fuck out of me, so I just lay there stunned and didn't resist. Not to mention having the kids asleep in the house. She hopped on top of me and tried to get me aroused by grinding on me. This kinda half-worked,  I must admit it was a little erotic to be honest, probably because things like this never happen to me in my life, but really I was not getting that aroused and she was struggling to get me erect enough to put me inside her. There was a lot of genital contact, she was obviously quite aroused, but we didn't actually do anything. She didn't even try to kiss me. At the time I thought my lack of erection was because of all the drinking and drugs but in retrospect I feel it was because of a snowball of emotions, fear, guilt, confusion etc. so thankfully it never eventuated.  


So she gives up and lets me sleep, thankfully without waking Trevor. I return home the next day and say nothing to my wife. I love my wife with all my heart and she suffers massive anxiety so I feel it's best for all to just keep my mouth shut and move on. Sarah and I continue to be friends but she occasionally asks me if I will have sex with her sometime. I tell her I don't want this friendship to be about sex or drugs, I truly just want someone I can talk to (I am quite introverted and rarely find people I connect with). She meets my wife at our own bbq and mentions to me that she is cute so she starts talking about threesomes and figured that maybe if my wife would agree to being a part of it, maybe we can all have some adult fun. I talked to my wife and she kinda sounded ok with it but not really, stating it makes her feel really anxious (understandably). I told Sarah that there's more than likely no chance this is ever going to happen.   


Maybe a month later Sarah rings me and tells me she was just at the doctors and has HPV. I quickly Google what HPV is and my heart breaks for her cos I think she now has cancer! Turns out it's the non-cancerous strain so I relax and she's very ""whatever"" so she was never fussed to begin with. Now a few months later I notice I have symptoms of HPV and I'm FREAKING OUT. My wife has now surely contracted it as we've made love many times since then. I feel sick to the stomach and have no one to talk to about it. I have recently begun to realise Sarah actually has many narcissistic traits and was probably just trying to use me from the start and really had no intention of actually being my friend. She cares ZERO about my marriage and has since broken up with her husband.   


I have spoken to various counsellors but that didn't really help with them really just saying ""don't say ANYTHING, keep it to yourself"". That's not fuckin helpful at all. I have not slept properly in months and this is really taking a toll on my physical and mental health. I have thought about opening up to my Mother in Law but once I let this out I know I can never take it back. I am yet to muster the courage to tell my wife but I know it's almost certain she will find out come her next pap smear test. My thoughts are to tell her maybe on the day of the test? Maybe go with her and say ""there's something I need to tell you before you get this test done"". I am willing to go through any marriage counselling, whatever she wishes to keep us together, I just worry deeply that this may shatter the trust in our happy marriage.  


Please offer any advice you can that may help me deal with this situation.  


TLDR; Married woman sexually assaults me. I now have HPV and most probably my wife now does also. I am freaking the fuck out cos I love my wife dearly and want to grow old with her.",18Oct2019,1
214,"Before I talk about this friend I need to clarify that the things I’m gonna talk about only happen sometimes so I don’t want any answers saying he’s not your friend. However, this fucking asshole (I’m writing this in the heat of the moment) can be the most selfish, arrogant, hypocritical, and just difficult to deal with. For example, we were having lunch today and someone brought up movies. Older movies to be exact, i was talking about how alien was one of my favourite movies and how it was explaining how it was iconic to my other friend who hasn’t seen it. This friend (well call him Justin) says his favourite movie is Halloween but then adds on with “way better movie and way more popular then alien, u should watch it instead” I just told my other friend that they were both pretty good and he should watch each of them. For some dumb reason “Justin decided to add on by saying “Halloween is still better and you could probably skip alien” it may sound like he was joking but I know when he’s joking and he most certainly was not. I Didit say anything but I was pretty annoyed at him. Later today (literally just happened) we were playing 2k 20. I’m not the best but I just play the game because it’s what my friends play. Basically I drove to the net and got the ball, I pump faked under the basket and then went up thinking I was clear and got blocked. This was the second time this happened this game and each time it happened he said u should have passed it out to me but in a very condescending tone. I then explained to him that I didn’t c him and that by the time he had called for it I was already going up. He continued to say “you’ve just gotta see me pass it out next time or else I’m not playing with you.” The next time we got the ball he through a bad pass that got intercepted so I said “oh you gotta see that next time.” To be fair I was mocking him but it was only because I was a bit annoyed with him today. He however got pissed immediately and said, and I quote, “no it’s different, I was just spamming the pass button, you’re just a fucking idiot who doesn’t know how to play this fucking game!” I just got off after this but my question is how am I supposed to deal with him, it’s been years and I’m yet to figure it out. Once again I’d like to clarify that I don’t want any he’s not your friend answers because most of the time he’s a really good guy who tends to come through for me. Thank you",18Oct2019,1

233,"Kind of a long story, but my partner and daughter were living in a house that I was renting for a great price because the owner is a family friend.  The house was too big for us, 5 bedrooms. There is also a 2 bedroom mobile home in the back.  So the owner told us he had a family of 10 that were homeless and the dad has ALS. He was going to move them into the 2 bedroom mobile home but we volunteered to move to it so they could have our home. They were all staying in 1 bedroom, not a 1 bedroom house, a single room in someone's apartment.  So needless to say they were insanely grateful.  They didn't have anything so we left them a bed and donated a crib because there is a little one on the way.  The owner is a saint and he is letting them stay there for next to nothing.  

Anyway, my partner lost his job and we are just surviving, but we have a home and everything we need.  I have a lot of toys and clothes I want to bring them but every time we bring them something they are so appreciative, today the father stood up from his wheelchair just to shake my partners hand.  The only problem is is that I have more to give them and we know they need it but we don't want them to feel like they owe us anything.  I don't want them to feel like a charity case.  We just genuinely have enough things to share.  How could I bring things over to them in a way that makes them feel comfortable knowing we are here if they need anything. 

Once we start making money again we are going to send groceries and buy them what we can and just do it anonymously, but right now we are barely able to feed ourselves so donating things is all we have to give right now.  But hopefully that changes. 

I was thinking of going over there and saying "" would it be ok if I brought over some toys and clothes? My daughter has grown out of them and we were going to donate them.""? Or something like that? Any advice would be appreciated!

235,"I have been ‘dumped’ by someone I have been dating for a 2 months after they went on a date with someone  else who apparently they don’t want to pursue , but it was  enough to make them realise they don’t want something exclusive with me. I ignored her for a couple of days and during that period, this happened , and when I got back in touch she told me quite plainly she didn’t like the trajectory we were on . I can’t tell if she’s just hurt at being ignored as she denies it , but , the only other time she has had doubts is when I did  something similar for 24 hours + . 

I’m in my early twenties and she is a life years older . I like this community an awful lot and this is my first post . I’ve had a few relationships and I think I feel quite crazy about this woman. She apparently just kissed the guy. I’m wondering whether the same strategy one would use to re-attract an ex girlfriend, I.e. the no contact rule etc . would make her miss me and want to pursue me or whether it would just push her away more . 

Any good advice would be highly appreciated. I’m utterly crushed that suddenly she is talking to me with such less affection and more distance. It’s confusing to me because it seems as if she’s being truthful about not wanting to pursue that other  guy any further, and yet suddenly now it seems as though the lovely chemistry and moments we have had were fake or a million years ago.  

The only silver lining is perhaps I’m thinking consciously or sub consciously she is reacting to me ignoring her . Perhaps she felt desperation or helpless at the fact that I didn’t respond to a message for a couple of days, which is a little while relative to our usual texting. I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts on all of this.

237,"A little background:
I am a senior in college graduating at the end of next semester and the girl I’m interested in (let’s call her Grace) is graduating at the end of this semester. I am applying to schools and jobs that are many states away from where I am and she is too, but there is a lot of overlap. So it’s not impossible that we end up at the same place out of coincidence. Grace has had a boyfriend from high school that is and has been a long distance relationship through all of college. She never talks about her bf unless I bring him up and when she does talk about him it’s only complaints. She seems to hint a lot at wanting to break up with him saying things like she’s “ always afraid to let go of things”  or afraid to “move on”.  We have a great chemistry and have spent a lot of time together over the past two semesters. From what she’s told me they go through regular phases of not talking to each other for days due to him needing space and generally not wanting to talk to her.

I feel like I could make her a lot happier than she is In her current relationship. We’ve become really close and I love being with her, but I feel selfish for feeling this way. I don’t know if I should tell her how I feel especially with her potentially going away in 2-3 months. I feel like it’s unfair to her to tell her this because she is in a relationship regardless of it being a good or bad one from my point of view. I know that I don’t know the ins and outs of the relationship but the general sense I get is that she’s unhappy with it.

I’m very conflicted over the whole situation, but I know that I feel a love for her and don’t want to let her slip through my fingers and become someone I ask myself “what if” about for the rest of my life. I feel like the only thing keeping us apart is her being afraid to break up with her boyfriend because she is unsure if I like her or not and me being too reserved to tell her how I feel.

After a long road to recovery and being Sober I learned a lot about DUIs. At this point I can give you legal advise based on my experiences. Through it all I learned how to beat the courts and get the lowest possible punishment. My last charge was a felony DUI in CA in 2019 and I did 60 days in jail and 4 months on house arrest.

240,"I recently moved to another state, I have been a nurse for over 6 years now and I've been on the hunt for a job.

I have very bad social anxiety and I am very shy although I try to battle it.  In my last job as a correctional nurse I never had the official title per say but I was in the ""charge"" nurse seat multiple times to help my boss out since people came in and out the door frequently.

243,"My long distance boyfriend and I got into an argument recently.

First off, it makes me uncomfortable to know that he is talking to his ex girlfriend (which it makes me sound very hypocritical, considering that my best friend is my ex but our friendship is completely platonic). I trust my boyfriend, but not his ex.

Second, I’ve been stalking his ex through social media and I’m working on not doing that anymore. I have realized that it has come from low self-esteem and lack of confidence.

Third, my boyfriend wants me to not say “I love you” as often because it will lose its meaning over time if it is said too often. He also doesn’t like it when I start to think that he doesn’t want to continue the relationship anymore. He has told me, “If I wanted to leave, I would have done so already.” These things really terrify me. I’m an affectionate person when it comes to me dating somebody that I genuinely like and am serious about.

I would really like to talk to him about these things, but I don’t want to come close to breaking up again. I’m very serious about this long distance relationship and really haven’t felt anything like this in a long time. Please help!!",18Oct2019,1
244,"Sorry if it’s bad grammar. Late at night and I’m trying to for a year of feelings into one post 

I am a 17 year old girl, and up until tonight I lived with my mom and dad. 
To give back story, my parents relationship ALWAYS seemed good. My dad worked week on week off at a mine (this kind of comes in later). Lots was hid from me for many years up until this February. Fights, abuse, you name it. I have two older sisters and they knew more but never told me because I was young and to be honest I don’t think they knew how bad it was. My dad has been struggling with mental disorder(s) (depression, diagnosed. We are not and will never be sure if there were more issues) since before him and my mom even met, he says since he was just a kid. He had a rough childhood which was the root cause of everything. 
When my parents met, I think my dads mental illnesses were out of control. He had never seen a doctor until many years into their relationship (20 year marriage, 21 year relationship) and recently decided (August) that he no longer needed medication (he was only on meds for around 6 months, maybe less) and decided that weed was the way to go. Everything in our family took a nose dive when this decision was made. All my sisters moved out because they are older and beginning families and careers so I was left alone with a ticking time bomb of a family. 
In the past ~8 months I have heard my dad scream at my mom, hit my mom, as well as financially abuse her (made her quit every job she ever got). At first I thought I could fix him. I tried everything. I would sit for what felt like hours and bawl my eyes out to him and tell him how much I loved him and wanted him to get help and he never did. Wouldn’t even see our family doctor. For months I played his game of guilt and tried so hard to fix the unfixable. My mom did too. She did everything to make him happy but he was a control freak. He would tell her she was “too fat” so she lost weight. He would then tell her she was “too skinny”. She aged and she was “too old”. He contacted prostitutes multiple times. To say the least he was a horrible husband. 
More recently, in the past ~2 months like I said he stopped taking meds and started spending $1000 or more a month on marijuana thinking it would fix him. He thought everything he did was normal. He wouldn’t talk to my mom for weeks. He barely spoke to me. And this most recent week home he did not speak to me once and spent his time screaming at my mom in our garage and threatening her with scissors and throwing entire side tables at her/holding them over her head. He left the house in a fit of rage and my mom called the police a few hours later. They found him and brought him to the house and he told my mom he will never be coming back and the police said he isn’t allowed inside our house without a police escort. He hasn’t sent me one text, and I don’t expect one either. Where do I go from here? Do I just figure things out as they go? I feel so alone and I just want my dad back. 
I don’t know if I should be mad or sad or what. I want to be strong for my mom and family but I don’t know how to be. I don’t want my dad back in my life because I don’t think he deserves it.

First things first: I know I'm and introvert which doesn't make things easier. But my girlfriend is more of an extrovert but she does a great job of respecting that trait of mine. But she does want to go out some times. If it's a nice dinner at a restaurant it's no problem. But if we go shopping or she wants to visit a bar I get some problems. 

Just to clarify: I don't think I have social anxiety. I don't panic or am scared. The only feeling close to that would be a general unease. What bothers me is that I get annoyed by all the people around me so fast that it's obvious to my gf who then can't enjoy the trip anymore. 

I know that I can't change that I'm an introvert and I don't want to fight it, but I also want to make make my girlfriend happy. So:

252,"I graduated this summer and have been job hunting since. When I found this job in my field, got an interview and then got a 1 week paid trial I was over the moon. However, the trial has been quite difficult so far and I’m having second thoughts. 

On the first day, myself and the other intern got shown around, had a meeting with the boss about his expectations and that was it. There has been no brief, no tasks set, no deadlines, no direction. Maybe it is a test to see how we can work independently, but I can’t emphasise how little we are spoken to. We have been trying our best to keep ourselves busy but it has been very hard to keep motivated for 8 hours a day without any goals or feedback. There is also no space for us to work/talk as the office is absolutely tiny with only 5 computer desks. Wages haven’t been discussed wage yet but it will probably be around 20k a year. 

The commute is also getting to me - I’m getting up at 6am and getting home at 7pm for a 9 - 5 job, spending about £20 a day on transport. That would be fine if I felt the job was worth it, but at the moment I’m questioning whether it is.

I really don’t know whether to go for this job or not; on one hand, it’s in my field and a year of relevant experience would look excellent on my CV. I doubt I’m going to get another opportunity to work within my field in this small city. But on the other hand, I am genuinely worried about the sustainability and lack of structure of the job.

**I'm 23 and my fiance is 26**

  So I've always known my Fianceé has had depression and anxiety (I have it pretty bad too.) And we've always tried to help each other the best we can. But I'm becoming increasingly worried that we won't have a future where we wont be happy. I am not going to say I am not ending it because of the depression/anxiety because it is a part of it yeah but in the way where he refuses to accept help anymore. He has always told me he is going to try and work together with me but he never tries. I can only do so much for him and he needs to take at least one step to get better but he wont do anything. As well as over time I've sadly noticed that he is not the person I thought he was. I still love him and care about him very much but the more I think about our future together and what I want for my future the more I dont see it working out between us. And yeah, that happens sometimes with partners. It sucks but we all live. However, he has severe depression and suicidal thoughts and has tried to off himself a few times while in our relationship. He has also told me on multiple occasions that he would not be alive if I wasnt here and whenever he says things like that I become terrified that he will try to commit suicide if I leave him. 
The relationship I was in before my current, everything was great for 3 years until I had to end the relationship. And when I did something snapped in him and he harrassed me for months until he eventually committed suicide and blamed me for it. 
I can't go through that again..
I've had so many deaths in my life the past couple years including the people closest to my heart. And if my current fianceé killed himself I'd blame myself again and I dont think I will survive that.
I could ask his family to take care of him and give them a heads up but the thing is, his family is basically non existant in his life. They either have no money and cant support him themselves or they just dont give a shit about him. He's literally been homeless before and they did nothing.

If anyone has any ideas please let me know. I dont want to drag this on longer then it has to because it feels like I'm just taking advantage of him and his love.. idk..

258,"Kia Ora from New Zealand!

Hey guys, would love some helpful direction on this!

Short Story: 

Unable to get hold of/reply from a landlord which is in the possession of my $1000 USD security bond in California, now that I'm back home in New Zealand.

Long Story:

I was staying in California for 3 months while working with my company (California and New Zealand offices) and I was able to secure a room on Craigslist. It was a 3 bedroom house and the majority of my stay it was just me and the landlord. While it was great at the beginning, the landlord-tenant relationship really started to deteriorate in the last month of my stay. While I never argued and tried to calmly resolved any issues, I was getting blamed for numerous things around the house such as:

\- Leaving moldy food in the fridge. I was accused of lying for leaving a blacken cantaloupe/melon in the fridge, frankly I never buy nor eat melon!

\- Damaging furniture. The room I was staying in was furnished and had an old desk and cheap desk chair. The desk chair had a big 'clunk' in it whenever you shifted your weight, again, my fault apparently.

\- Damaging a clothes washer. This one takes the cake. I had just returned from an amazing American roadtrip to be told that I used the washer last, and because of me it was broken. She explained to me that after I had used it, when she went to collect her load the door was locked because water was still trapped inside. She then went on to tell me that she had to hire a plumber ($$$) to come and fix it. Now, the reality of what happened, and I overheard this while she was drinking wine over dinner, is that she actually got her SON to come over to fix it, and it ended up being a collection of her plugged up socks over the years!

Now since we had a written agreement, it stated that after I had ended my tenancy, the landlord had 21 days to return the deposit. It is now approaching that 21 day period and I am unable to get hold of the landlord. Email, phone call + message and paypal payment request - no response. I did suggest a cash return a few weeks prior, which seemed like an option, but on the day of my departure the landlord said we agreed on paypal/bank transfer.

Now I'm not too familiar with local California small court laws, but now that I am back in New Zealand can I even attempt to make a claim?

Any help would be greatly appreciated! I'd be happy to answer any questions for more info.

Cheers!",18Oct2019,1

A guy used to go over to my neighbor. 
In summer,  I saw him many times looking at my house, as if he were spying on me, even my mom said that. I caught him staring at me and then I heard my nme being said. He was looking hypnotized and me and had a little smile on his face. 
 -At the end of september, He came near my house to say ""Hi"" to me .I then received a private call with his voice asking ""Are you, Casey?"" I said bye and cancelled the call. It was pretty creepy
- A few days ago. He salutes me near my house again after he got out of his car. 
ATTENTION!!
I got a lot of private calls from someone that was saying nothing and only listening to me
I received a lot of Whatsapp messages from a just-created account saying things like ""Sexy, I like your accent, your voice. ""
I asked him to identify but he said that wants to remain anonymous at this time to keep the mistery.
 He said he wants to meet me at a coffee and he also said: "" I don't ask you to come over my house! We meet anywhere you want restaurant, cafeteria, just to feel safe.""
And a lot of other stuff.
 I decided to get my sim card out of phone and change the number with another one that I had and used sometimes
Surprise!!! Next day I received calls on this new phone number. This time it lasted a few days again.
I saw him yesterday again and he only fluttered his hand to salute me, probably  because my father was around

262,"Hi, So What I need is not really relationship advice but something that is driving me mad for the better part of my day for quite some time. I really hope the better sex in this subreddit would give me some clarity on this.
I (Male 22) have been driven absolutely crazy by this Girl(22). We were in the same college and the same class but never really had any meaningful conversation during our time in college (I am an engineer btw). But this girl (let's call her X) had been giving quite elaborate signals for some time. She belongs to a very conservative family and Had a long term boyfriend (On/Off relationship type). Now I am a very typical dude who doesn't understand when a girl is giving me signals hence I said elaborate signals. Now She was the type of girl who always had guys around her, so naturally I presumed it's just attention seeking trait from her end. This went on for almost a year and I never initiated anything (was dating someone in between). Now Towards the end of our college time she broke up with her bf and naturally by then she had piqued my interest (I mean I had literally ignored her and never tried to know her more but she still always tried to in some way be around me (Lol I seem like a narcissist but Hey I was dating another girl) So I started talking to her, went on for few months,  but she always seemed uninterested and I always had to initiate conversations. One week before the college ended , I asked her out (She was a local and I was staying in that city for college) she ended that with let's see. Now Obviously I thought it was just me overthinking  and she never was really interested. But then I started seeing her driving by my place (This is getting crazy, I know). Now my friends thought I was going delusional and Even I thought the same, but these stalking episodes didn't stop. Thank God for technology I made couple of videos of her car with her in it driving around my location (My snapchat location is on) just to prove I am not going mad. Now during this stalking period she was completely ignoring me after I had asked her out. College ended, I left to another city for a Job and she left to another city for her training (3 months) Now during these 3 months We actually started talking and flirting proper. But even then her behavior was aberrant, whenever our talks used to get too romantic she used to suddenly start ignoring me and eventually we used to go back to talking. This went for 3 months by the end of which I was completely exhausted by this bullshit (Because whenever I talked about my feelings for her she remained completely Nonchalant and which made me look like a fool) and blocked her everywhere because I was getting too involved and this seemed like fun and games to her. Curiosity got better of me and when I returned to my college city (1 month after I blocked her) for collecting my degree  I unblocked her and waited for her to stalk me again . And she did it again for the 2 days I was in that city (made videos again). Now I was fed up so I called her up, she kept cutting my calls and after 3 days of calling her and confessing in texts how I feel she replies with What's wrong with you. I am like what the fuck is going on. Now I am just confused whether X was mentally retarded or a jobless Player or actually had feelings but her conservative background held her back.
TL;DR:- A girl Stalks me, gives me all the virtual signals of interest but ignores me, acts like she doesn't give a fuck, acts completely Nonchalant when I try to actually start something.",18Oct2019,1

264,"Hello reader.

My name is Brayden, and I have a very hard decision to make in school. I am currently in Algebra 2 Honors/Trig, but it has been terrible in the quizzes category. I just took my first one, and it was the hardest quiz of my life. I transferred in shortly after I was in regular Algebra 2 with a 98.4%. I have done very well with the normal math, since I consider it easy, but the actual jump between honors and regular is insane. It also drops my grade 10% (ie to an 88.4 for 1st quarter). You don't have to believe me, but I go to a very difficult private school, and I guarantee you that this class is harder than you might think an Algebra 2 Honors class is. I wanted to try and take AP Chemistry next year, but it cannot be done without concurrent enrollment within Precalculus Honors. I want to be an engineer, hopefully with something like computer integrated manufacturing (Using programs like AutoDesk) and want to learn to code. The issue is that I feel as though colleges will weigh to heavy on if I do honors math and science. As much as I want to do it, I think it will give me a lot more stress and possible hurt a lot of my grades. Its not that I don't think I could bring up my Algebra 2 Honors grade, but I know it will be very hard. I don't like the current teacher, and I heard PreCalc Honors with the same teacher is even worse. All of my other classes apart from Chemistry are honors, but I don't think they will matter as much when applying for an engineering or computer science program at a college. I really want to apply to a good college, since I got a 4.14 freshman year and have around a 4.4 sophomore year (without math/science honors). I am really stuck between decisions, and I need to make one fast. I guess what I'm saying is that I don't really know if it's possible to get into an really good college with taking normal math and science throughout the entirety of high school.

268,"My oldest sister (26) has a history of mental problems. She was diagnosed with depression in high school and received therapy for a few years. My family believes she also has bipolar disorder/anger issues. 

She still lives at home with my parents. Usually, she acts 'fine' but will occasionally have what I consider extreme episodes where she will scream, make threats, and act semi-violently. My problem is that neither I nor my family know how to deal with her. She has been this way since she was a child. 

I've learned to completely ignore her in order to not make problems worse. This makes her even more angry but talking back or responding to her in any way always makes it exponentially worse. For example, she got mad at me for a stupid reason (asking her to clean up her mess). She came to my room screaming at me and cussing me out. I chose to ignore her and she eventually left. A few minutes later she comes back and I still stay silent. She continued to yell and then pulls my hair, rips pages out of my hw notebook, and pours my water all over my textbook.. Basically, if I choose to ignore her, it makes her more angry. However, if I choose to respond in any way, it makes the situation 10x worse. Anything you say to her, she will use it against you. It's impossible to reason with her at all because she always thinks shes right. If I continue to ignore her, she thinks that what she is doing is okay and continues to do it. 

Just the other day, she got into a fight with my dad because she was trying to give him her old (rotten) salad. He didnt want it and sort of got mad since this is something she always does. He said he did not want to get sick and did not want the salad. Her response was screaming for him to ""shut the fuck up"", ""you fucking dickhead"", ""how dare you talk to me like that"", while my parents were calmly trying to calm her down and reason with her. 

I have several videos of her having these 'episodes' that I always record incase something bad happens. I wouldnt consider her to be violently abusive (mainly because I think shes too scared). She will often make threats but never acts on it. The most she has done is pulling hair and breaking multiple doors and locks in our house for purposefully slamming them repeatedly. 

Theres countless of more things she has done that I cannot include without the post becoming too much (includes holding a knife up to me, trashing my brother's room, threatening to kill my parents in their sleep). She will deny the need to get help and sees no wrong in her actions. 

I'm likely moving out next year for college, but I'm scared for her and my parents. In the end, shes an adult. She is incapable of doing anything on her own without someone telling her what to do. She expects everything in life to go her way and really has no life skills. I dont see her moving out anytime in the future despite my parents telling her to do so. I'm concerned that even if she does, she wouldnt be able to make it: has no savings, cannot make her own decision, too lazy to help clean or wash dishes, doesn't know how to cook, etc. I dont know what to do and neither do my parents.

The very extreme episodes only happen a few times a year. Its typically smaller ones of just her yelling and insulting us or petty things she does like hog the shower or step on my shoes. These can get very annoying and energy draining to put up with daily.

Whats the best method to deal with her? If I cannot ignore or respond to her when shes mad, how do I go about helping her? Right now, my main concern is to avoid trouble with her. We have tried multiple times in the past to get her help.. any advice please?",18Oct2019,1

277,"Hi there, I’m looking for advice on what I might be able to do to help/encourage my boyfriend in making some new friends. 

He is in his late 20s, and we live in a big city. He already has a lot of friends who live here from his student days, but the problem is that they are becoming increasingly flaky. I know that this is somewhat normal as you get older and life moves in different directions, but I can also see that this bothers him. I think it would be really good if he could make some friends now, as an adult, that share some his current interests. 

We live in a big city with a lot to offer, so there are plenty of opportunities for meeting people. I think one of the challenges is that he usually doesn’t get home from work until 7:30-8:30 in the evening, so weeknights can be tricky. 

Some of his interests include biking/bikes, aviation, mountains/hiking, and photography. 

There is enough room in the budget to take a class or something along those lines, but it’s hard to find one that accommodates his work schedule. 

Since moving to this city (we were long distance for a couple of years, so he was living here without me), I’ve begun making some friends using Bumble BFF. However, I can’t see my boyfriend using this as a way to meet people. He can be shy at times. Plus, the dynamics of male friendships can seem to be different.

279,"  

I do not claim that I am a smart person, I understand that there are a lot of people who are way more knowledgeable and able than me. This is why I make myself to basically know more about things, trying to gain more knowledge through different means. It talks effort to be a smart and knowledgeable person and this is why this friend of mine annoys me to no end.

So, I have a friend, let's call him J, that might be the most ignorant person that I have ever known, if there are people who are more ignorant that him then I might just lose hope in humanity. There are a lot of stupid people in the world but this person that I am talking about has the worst kind of dumb. He is that kind of person that thinks that he needed to be and was the smartest person in the room despite lacking the knowledge or the ability to follow the basic train of thought to be one. Every single time, people, such as me or some of my other friends, aka, his friends, mention something obscure but factual, just to make small talk. He would simply deny the information, likely because he did not witness such things in his 20-something years of existence, even when said information was supported by citations and proof. And so, most conversations quickly turn into a frantic search of prove and citations, turning fun small talks to a test of ""finding where I found it."" While sometimes, he would just say “I will believe it for now.” In a condescending tone.

It is not like he would do the same thing whenever he mentions something, though, he just expects us to believe it. We are in the same college together, and he is that kind of person that type an under-worded essay, getting a bad grade and blames the topic of the paper, often complaining about there is no way to explain things that he writes in the paper because it is just how things are, there is no need to elaborate, but we all know that it is just his inability to form complete train of thoughts that causes this conclusion.

He would also make unrelated logic jumps that objectively makes no sense, claiming that it is true and unable to understand when people are trying to explain why his points being fundamentally untrue.

What started all this:

Have you guys heard of the pirate and gold coin puzzle? It is a puzzle that involves 100 coins 5 pirates in descending order in terms of hierarchy. You are the captain and you would need to manipulate the other pirates in order to keep your life and get the most coins. Not going to spoil it but the answer is quite drastic, as in you get much more coin then you would think. I asked this during a road trip, the answered was revealed after some time and people have different opinion about the puzzle. There is another friend, C, who did not like the puzzle because it was pretty unfair towards the other pirates and kind of shows the ""cut-throat-ness"" of humanity if we only used logic in this world. I think this is a unique take on the puzzle and it makes sense. J, after hearing the point about empathy, immediately deny the answer and claim that the one and only answer for the puzzle is the equally split the coins as all the pirates participated in the pillage, and I as the captain should treat the pirates as equal. We can see that he was already misinterpreting the point of C and basically misunderstanding the point of this, or any logic puzzle: logical deduction. But no, he had already made up his mind that it was the one and only truth and blamed me for poorly creating the puzzle, (which I did not, I watched it from TED) and said that I should replace the pirates with unthinking, emotionless robots splitting data chips or something; because, for some reason, he thought the fact that pirates are thinking, feeling human beings would affect his deduction on this logic puzzle.

He suddenly started talking about the Trolley Problem while putting his own twists in it. He started a scenario for us to choose between 1 loved one and 5 strangers. We all have different answers while I secretly struggle to understand his point. He claimed that the pirate puzzle, and thus, I, was stupid, because I should not ignore the emotional factor of the human condition, he said that he would kill the 5 strangers in order to save the loved one because he thinks that the loved one was more important in his mind, leading to him, his word, logically choose the loved one over the 5 strangers due to the emotional connection towards the loved ones.

First, he was ignorant about the point of puzzles.

Secondly, he accused me of being dumb through to his misinterpretation of my other friend, C.

Realizing his logical fallacy in his point “proving” the “poorly” constructed puzzle. I confronted him about it, leading to the third point: his reaction.

I pointed out that there was actually a fallacy to link emotion and logic together as they are two completely separate things. I said that, in his case, logic has nothing to do with his choice as logic was not the reason why he chose the loved ones instead of the 5 strangers, because if we are only to consider logic, the 5 strangers always win against the 1 loved ones as 5 people always wins against 1 person, 5 is more than 1. However, J added extra information into the problem of whether or not the people that we are saving/choosing to kill were close to us; whether we are emotionally connected to the people are we are choosing. In J’s case, he chose the 1 loved one over the 5 strangers because he was more emotionally linked to that person. His emotion overrides his logic, leading to his choice of choosing the loved one instead of the 5 strangers, and thus his question was more about taking an emotional stance or a logical stance, apple over oranges.

He denied my point, claiming that, without paraphrasing, it was “logical to choose the loved one over the strangers because he was more emotionally attached to the loved one”, proving that emotional considerations should be included into the pirate puzzle. We could not convince him away from his decision, even C explained more clearly about her thoughts on the puzzle, and I pointing out there are multiple logic jumps in his conclusion. However, he had already decided that his was speaking truth and kept making dumb jokes blaming me for not making the pirates into robots. It seems to be his only take away from this exchange.

It is his stubbornness in order to maintain his falsely gained sense of pride and his ignorance annoys me to no end. I don’t blame anyone for not knowing things, I offends me when someone do not know something and refuse to learn something new, even when hand fed to them, while inventing things from thin air just to explain something that they do not know in the first place, having the audacity to undermine others for making putting him into unfamiliar situations, I guess it is called insecurity.

**I might be overacting and kind of a hypocrite to ask, but is there anyway that I could prove/ make him understand his own ignorance and maybe make him more humble about himself? He is kind of my friend and he had been acting like an asshole and I am kind of embarrassed for and of him.**

P.S. He started something new since we got a facebook group. We mostly send memes and jokes and funny pics in the group but when someone posted something funny or interesting, he just replies “NOPE”. Also, apparently he learned it somewhere that the Japanese make the best stuff, I won't deny that since it is kind of true, but he kept talking crap about other countries like Germany which also make really good things too. He especially love talking crap about Benz and BMW while kept harping about Nissan for some reason. When we ask why, he simply answered ""because (anything other than Nissan) is shit."" followed by some laughing with a hand chop gesture.

P.P.S. He started talking about politics recently.",18Oct2019,1
280,"English isn't my first language so sorry for any spelling or grammatical errors.

I'm a 17 year old, turning 18 the 28th, girl from norway.

Drug abuse is a huge problem at my school. Many kids at my school (16-18) take illegal drugs such as weed, molly, mdma, lsd and other hallucinogens. I hang with a group of people who do all kinds of drugs and it's only getting worse. A bunch of kids are planning to take cocaine at a party next week and the whole situation is such shit.  Our school has acknowledged the situation and is taking strong actions, but the process is still in it's early stages. So far, the school hasn't done other than trying to find out who abuses or uses drugs, by asking students about information.

I had a period this past summer where I smoked some weed. It wasn't bad, I never smoked more than once a week, but never too much. I haven't smoked more than 20-30 times. My friends, however, have taken a lot more than just weed. Molly, ecstasy, LSD, shrooms... My group of friends are all sort of known as druggies. They talk loudly in the halls about drugs they've taking or are planning to take. I've been offered many kinds of drugs, but I've limited myself to weed, as I never wanted to really fall down that rabbit hole of drug abuse. 

I recently decided to quit. I realized what was happening around me and how terrible the situation was turning and figured that I didn't want to be a part of that. Not to mention I was breaking the law, and as I'm almost 18 I didn't want to get a drugrecord or shit like that. So I decided to quit. It's been hard, sometimes I'm tempted, but I'm done with that stuff.

As I mentioned earlier the school has asked other students for information. Someone ratted me out, saying I smoke every day and come high to school. This is an absolutly untrue statement, I've never smoked during or before school and I only smoked once a week or less. When I smoked, I smoked in the weekends. Not to mention I've quit. My teacher took me aside and asked me about these claims. She has done this once before, but I denied every claim. This time, I decided I was going to be the bigger person and admitted to everything. I told her about my recent drug use, how much I used, how often and how I've quit.

The problem is this... She doesn't believe me. Multiple students have reported me for abuse, everyday use and comming intoxicated to classes. She takes their word over me and I'm pretty much in deep shit. I will most likely have to take drug tests in the near future, but I'm all clean so the test will be negative. Because I'm not 18 yet the school is obligated to tell my parents, which I understand. What the school doesn't understand is that my family will disown me. They will cancel my 18th birthday (which sounds silly, but it's a big deal in my country and I've been planning it for months), most likely throw me out and our relationship will be ruined forever.

I've been compleatly heartbroken over this whole situation, I'm terrified of what will happen next. I'm clean, so there won't be any problems with the law and stuff, but loosing my family is my biggest fear. I really don't know what to do next. I can't talk to any teachers or advisors as they're terrible at maintaining confidentiality, but I can't talk to my friends either, as they were most likely the ones to rat me out.

I decided that the best thing will be to tell them myself. I'm planning to tell them how I used to use weed, but I quit and I'm not planning to go back. This way they hear my side of the story, the truthfull side of the story, first. They will be pissed, and I'll be in deep, deep shit. But I don't know how to go about talking about it without having it turn into a fight. How can I talk to my parents? How can I stay calm in the situation and keep it from escalating?

Thanks.

  
TLDR; My school confronted my with worries of drug abuse, which I admitted to doing in the past. I've quit now, but my parents will be contacted. How can I talk to my family without our relationship being wrecked?",18Oct2019,2
281,"I’ll try to keep it short and simple but it would mean a lot to me if you read it all

College began 3 months ago and I immediately hit it off with this girl who seems (to everybody) like the perfect match.

We are very similar and share the same outlooks and attitude towards life. She’s much kinder and outgoing than me

We’ve been hanging out/dating with things like skating, sports, and (our competitive games) of ping pong for about 2-3 weeks. Tonight was a wind ensemble concert 

For the most part we live our own lives but when we are around we try to wrap our interests and plans together

When I ask her out it’s always alone, when she asks it’s sometimes alone

She flirts with me more than I her

She has another guy friend she’s closer with, but hasn’t made any moves, so I have no idea where I stand

282,"Hello, some parts of this post may sound a little difficult to understand, so I'm sorry if it does. This may not be the right subreddit to post something like this, but I just wanted to find a place to have someone hear me out, because my mind has been spinning a lot lately.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently 21 years old. Since I was young, I wanted to join the military like my grandfather. However, when I finished high school, the recruiter said I wasn't able to join due to having an autism diagnosis (I'm high functioning). It was depressing to see my dream get crushed like that, but I didn't fret and instead went to college to study Digital Design. Overtime, I found that I enjoyed taking the programming classes, so I switched to Computer Science with the dream of becoming a software engineer. I was lucky enough to intern at a few IT places. Unfortunately, as a few semesters went on, I found out that I was going to be dropped on financial aid due to changing majors.

&amp;#x200B;

It was stress-inducing for me to the point I couldn't sleep at nights, but I figured I could just pay the last classes out of pocket. This was at the same time when Hurricane Michael hit our home town (I lived in Panama City, FL), and it was certainly a strange experience to see the place I grew up in be turned to a wasteland. Overtime, when things seemed to lightening up, it turned out that both my grandparents (whom I was living with) were diagnosed with cancer, my grandmother having to undergo chemotherapy, and I simply had to leave under family pressure. 

&amp;#x200B;

I moved down to the Everglades with my dad, whom I had a very bad history with, considering he abused me as a child in ways I wouldn't want to explain. He was married to a very nice woman, however, and they had a decent house in a beautiful neighborhood. At the time, I still had the goals to become a programmer, but I couldn't get myself to pass the entrance exam to this coding bootcamp, causing me to lose faith in myself. At the same time, I just couldn't feel content in such an environment. What made my blood boil was the fact that my dad wouldn't take accountability for the damage he caused to me during my childhood, leading to my serious anxiety and depression that I struggle with today. Instead, he decided to shift the guilt on me for simply cutting him out of my life for four years. (Really, asshole?) To top it off, he still had some of his old habits, and overtime, his older self would slowly manifest to the point I was just not comfortable there, anymore. In fact, I felt incredibly anxious being around him. Besides that, I worked an apprentice as an electrician, which I soon lost, due to several incidents within my first few weeks. I was deeply upset about it for days, because I saw so much promise in it, and there was nowhere to work beside restaurant and hotel jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

I chose to move in with my aunt, after that, along with her daughter and husband with their child as well. Of course, they couldn't keep me there for long, so I tried to be quick about getting my own place. (I helped my cousin's husband build a website for his tech business which was fun) I worked as a ""marketing associate"" for this one start-up, but had to leave due to transportation issues and a foot problem that hindered my walking (It was a door-to-door sales job). Eventually, after four weeks, my aunt said it would've been best to go back down there with my dad. However, I didn't want to go back down there. On the flip-side, my friends and I were talking about getting a house together back in my hometown, which I was all for, so it made sense for me to choose coming back

&amp;#x200B;

So I moved in with my other grandparents not far away from my home-town (they're my mom's side). I became content here, and aimed on getting my truck back and going back to college. Since I got here, I worked at a nearby pizza joint where I'm still at, but have been pay issues due to ""system problems"", so instead they've been loaning me money. I'm angered by it, and so is my family because they think I'm getting ripped off. At this time around, both of my friends duped out of the house plan, and my big brother came back from the Marines. Just today, my grandma soon came to talk to me, saying ""something's gotta give"" and I need to work something out soon.  


Back when I was down there in there in the Everglades, I considered working as a truck driver for CRST which was the only recruiting company down here. Of course, family said negative things about trucking and truckers I met on Reddit said not to go to CRST, since it was strictly team driving. From my end, I thought it was going to slow me down from pursuing my dream in programming. However, since I'm back up here, the only recruiting company around is C.R. England, which I've been told is a better starting company. I'm currently prepping for the DOT physical and the permit tests, before they book me to Salt Lake City in UT.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't lie, it does sound fun to drive across the country and make a living, but it's not something I want to do with my life. However, it feels like the only chance I can take to get out of the chaos that has been this entire year (the Hurricane destroying my town, moving out, grandparents having cancer, moving place-to-place, family pressure). It certainly feels depressing to see I won't be living my childhood or college dreams, I won't hide that. I've considered taking my life for the first time, because if you're alive and not living, then what's the point?

284,"First off, a small bit of backstory: I went to a small high school. Some of the teachers there played a major role in helping me (and a number of others) get to where I am today, both academically, and as a person. It's not uncommon for grads to periodically return to the school to visit and talk to these teachers. I've done this once or twice per year for the duration of university. I'm in my fourth year of uni now, and while I no longer recognize any of the h/s students, I still go back to chat with these teachers now and then.

Last time I was there, a random guy &amp; girl were sitting in the hallway. She asked who I was (fair enough, I don't go there) and I told her I'm a grad. We talked about who was in my year (a couple of people there have older siblings from my time in that school) and I guess she looked me up on FB to see who we both know. I consider FB to be the modern-day phone book at this point (useful for contacting people, but not really something people care about) so I accepted her friend request, we talked for a couple of mins, and I moved on. 

A day or 2 later she asked if I had snap, not really knowing her or wanting to engage, I said no. Nothing further. Later she messaged me asking to hang out when I'm home. This was something I definitely wasn't comfortable with, and I realized I had to be fairly blunt in saying that. I told her without any fluff that I wouldn't be comfortable nor do I think it would be appropriate given the age difference (and I barely even know who she is). She gave an awkward ""oh"", and I figured we were done. 

Canadain Thanksgiving comes around, she messages me saying ""happy thanksgiving"". Harmless but I chose not to respond, as I don't want to start a convo and this is beginning to frustrate me. A couple of days later (today) she messages me again ""hey"" and now I'm kinda stuck. 

I feel I've made it fairly clear that I don't want to talk. I realize there's the easy option to just block and unfriend her, but I want opinions on whether I should say anything first. She hasn't technically done anything wrong of ill-intentioned on her part, but she's also not taking a hint or backing down. It's possible that we might run into each other if I go back, and while it's going to be awkward regardless of what I do now, I don't want to be rude if I don't have to.

Any thoughts or ideas on what I should do would be greatly appreciated!",18Oct2019,1
285,"Turned left on a green but didn't yield to a vehicle that was coming straight ahead. We collided and now my car is completely totaled. Cops were already on the site (they were investigating an accident that had happened earlier on). 

I was okay, a few bruises. Thank god, the person that I hit was okay, minus a little swelling on his foot that he fixed up with an ice pack. 

I'm 18. Never been in an accident before. Am usually a very careful driver, but I guess I was out of it today because I did not see the car zooming straight towards me and instead made a very impulsive, last-minute decision to follow a car in front of me that had already made its turn. 

My insurance info is still laying in the car somewhere - couldn't find it in the midst of all the chaos happening around me - so the officer ended up having to give me a correctable ticket and told me I could get it dismissed once I manage to find the insurance documents. 

Another issue: My car's been towed, but I don't where it went. The tow truck sped off right before I could get down their info and everything! I only know the name of the tow company, which I called earlier and they told me that particular car was ""not in their system"". And the best part is, my insurance docs are in there so if I can't find my car I won't be able to get rid of that ticket!

For anyone who has been or is familiar with car accidents/simlar experience, PLEASE HELP!! How do I proceed from here? How am I going to find out where the heck they towed my car?

290,"So 3 days ago, a guy my age in school asked to go travelling (interrailing) with me in the summer and I said that I'd be quite interested in going ahead with it, and we've discussed it a small amount, but nothing concrete.

This guy doesn't have many other people in our year that he could go with, and he'd quite like to go. Just yesterday, I got asked by some other friends if I'd like to go travelling with them, they're a lot more adventurous and I think I'd have a much better time so I'd prefer to go with them.

I'd feel really bad if this guy had nobody to go with but I can't let that get in the way of my own desire, so I'm not sure how to break the news to him.",18Oct2019,1
291,"Okay I want to make this short but it is kind of long so I apologize. Basically, I went to visit my “best” friend on the day she gave birth to her son but I’ve been feeling guilty about going ever since. 

	My “best friend” and I have been so since about junior year of high school. After her and her long time broke up shortly after high school, she kind of became a different person. I think she just really hated not being in a relationship but she kind of became someone else in the pursuit of one. At the time I had been single and open to whatever for about 2 years. When she started dating she was going through a lot of guys that were all dicks. She was out of their league but I figured what’s a couple of rebounds I guess. 

	During this summer she introduced me to her apparent male ‘Best friend’. Him and I exchanged info when we met and started chatting, sending memes, nothing serious. I realized we had a lot in common and figured I had a crush. I was super nervous of crossing any kind of boundaries or girl code so I told her right away and told her I’d forget about it completely if she felt it was uncomfortable or something she would rather I not pursue. She pushed me to pursue him only saying that she thought he liked her but not much else. I ended up feeling like I loved him and told her but it didn’t work out due to distance. 

	I was going to college out of town and while there two things happened concerning boys I was talking to. The first was this guy (which she used to absolutely hate) who we will call Jake and I started talking romantically. However since it would be long distance it didn’t work out. He was still really hung up on me and when I confided in her about if I should distance myself she said that he didn’t like me like that. I didn’t question it as anything beyond a good observation at the time only to find out that she knew this because she started dating him “behind my back”. I didn’t say anything about it but I thought it was a little fucked that she didn’t bother to tell me anything until he was her boyfriend. 

During this time she cheated on Jake with an ex and with a guy that she claimed was just better than Jake. I still really liked Jake as a friend but she put me through going on double dates and such knowing she was not being faithful to him. I never said anything though.

	After this I met my now boyfriend. I should mention right before meeting my boyfriend she was trying to set me up with a friend of a guy she was super into. The guy she was talking to ended up having sex with his ex and cheating on her (they weren’t officially dating) so she decided she liked the friend and when I told her she could date him she told me that she was “tired of being a second choice to me.” I was kind of shocked she said this but It’s important to note. 

	After a couple of times hanging out with my boyfriend and friends (including her) together I noticed she would be extremely rude to him. Insulting his intelligence, and keeping a very condescending attitude. Despite that he paid for me AND HER multiple times for outings, she continued kind of being all around rude to him he was never anything but nice. I never said anything to her about it but my boyfriend and I both took notice as did other friends. After a month into my new relationship my Ex of 3 years and at the time very close friend sent me a message saying he was uncomfortable with my best friend flirting with him and felt it was disrespectful to me. They had recently met because she was with me when I happened to stop by to say hello (we were neighbors) and apparently had friended him on social media’s and begun to message him often without my knowledge. I confronted her about it but she told me I was acting crazy and jealous. She then told me that she was only messaging him to manipulate him into taking her with him when he came to visit me and that she was having a shitty day and didn’t want to talk about it. But since we were exes he never did that and we weren’t close in that kind of way (which she knew) it didn’t really make any sense I decided to drop since I felt like I was upsetting her. 

	So this kind of thing went on but she ended up being stung along by a new guy for over a year. The new guy ended up knocking up his ex and at this point she told me she felt behind on her life goals. She dropped out of community college and was not in a relationship like she’d been looking for, for over a year.  She said she was getting to old to start a family (she was 21 at the time). This guy tells her that he “wished it was her that he got pregnant instead of his ex” which she found charming... 

	In between this time and I may edit and remove this later but against my judgment thinking I was being a good friend I took her to get an abortion. She said she didn’t know who the dad was but thought that who it likely was, was an asshole. 

	fast forward like 6-7 months to my birthday. We were celebrating out of town, my boyfriend paid for a suite as my gift for an out of town day. At the last second she backs out and says she cant drink. I knew she meant she was pregnant and the day of my celebration she confirmed it. I thought it was with this guy she had been talking too but when we got back she brought up this completely new guy no one had ever heard about. From the get go according to her he was controlling, gaslighting, etc. I never heard one positive this about him and he was upon us all meeting kind of an ass. He’s 10 years older than her and they met at Target.

Me and my boyfriend got in a fight around this time and were taking a week apart with literally zero contact. He had no idea where my headspace was concerning our relationship and heard nothing from me while I was taking mental time to think things out clearly. We are both very private out of respect for each other. Especially my boyfriend. I told her but only trusted her enough to literally say “we were deciding if we were going to stay together or not.” This was because over time I began to notice that she always seemed happy to hear when things weren’t going well for me. So I had stopped confiding in her almost entirely at this point. 

Around this time we had also been planning a girls trip to the beach for ONE DAY. At the time she had gotten to a point where she couldn’t work as much due to being pregnant and her baby daddy was pissed that she was “taking a vacation” so he blew up social media, her mother, and she texted us how pissed she was at him being a child and going behind her back to her mother. Turns out he also messaged my boyfriend (who hadn’t even told his best friends we were fighting) about how I told my best friend we were going to break up and how we were taking off to the beach because we didn’t want to be around them. That his girlfriend is so lazy, and like a paragraph of more shit about HER and how were going off without him. At the very end he tacked on a little ”but I just wanted to check in on you since no one cares about how we feel”. It was obvious he just wanted someone to talk shit with. My boyfriend found it disgusting and our mutual 3rd friend told me to tell her right away, saying how shed be pissed if her boyfriend did the same. I messaged her the screenshots my boyfriend sent me and basically just said how I was upset and felt like my privacy had been invaded. 

She messaged me back the next day saying how I was acting crazy and their was nothing wrong with what he did.  (Even though it was a huge problem to her when he sent the same types of things to her mom and all over social media) 
To be clear I said exactly that I was mad and was specific that it wasn’t that she told her boyfriend it was that he acted like that information was his to share and that she was defending it that upset me. I was equally clear in my initial message that I felt a boundary had been crossed as her baby daddy was giving an idea to my boyfriend like if I was going to dump him at a time when we were not in contact of one another. (He should of heard from me how I was feeling not a guy he mad met once looking for validation from him.)

Anyways she never apologized but I let it go. She told a mutual 3rd best friend she didn’t understand why I was so mad that “my boyfriend knew I was going to the beach”. She was ignoring everything I was saying and trying to make me sound crazy to friends. I just let it go but after that moment I lost all trust and faith in her.

I am really bad at knowing when to walk away from people. So while I distanced myself I left a line of communication open from her to me. I still wanted to be there for her even though I didnt trust her to do the same. I guess I want to be her friend, and avoid abandoning her but I don’t trust her to be my friend anymore.

This week she gave birth to her baby and not really thinking much of it I went to visit the day of. however the last couple days I’ve been feeling guilty about it. I dont know what to do and I feel like I’m a “fake friend” I still love her like family, I just dont trust her as a friend anymore. 

TLDR: My best friend is more like my ex best friend but I don’t want to stop being there for her. 


I want to keep distance but I know at this time in her life she really relies on me a lot. 

Am I a dick for feeling like this but showing up the day her son was born? 

What should I do?",18Oct2019,1
293,"This is going to be long so buckle up. I’m in college and live in a four bedroom apartment with 3 other girls. One of my roommates I actually lived with last year and she is (or at least was) a close friend; when you share a closet sized room with someone, you get to know them. We’ll call her Jade. My other two roommates, we’ll call them Amber and Leah, I met in class and we became good friends, Jade and I were looking for two roommates, they were too so the four of us decided to room together. 

At the beginning of this year, things were good. We all got along and would do homework together and occasionally hang out on the weekends. 

Anyways, as time goes on Amber and Jade get closer. Awesome. I’m glad they like each other because I’m the one who brought them together in the first place. But overtime I start feeling a little left out because they started hanging out more just the two of them. That’s fine, I’m not the type of person to get upset when two of my friends hang out, and I’m definitely not the type of person to ever comment on it, but internally, it did hurt my feelings a little. I felt left out. 

Time goes on, and Jade starts being way more cold to me. Our conversations virtually nonexistent or very short. I still try to reach out and ask what’s going on, but I don’t get much of a response. 

This past weekend, I asked if they wanted to go to a movie night with one of my friends, they all were busy. That’s fine, I just figured I’d reach out at least. The next day, Amber jade and I are all at home on Saturday. I hear them around the apartment, and I know they hear me, but they don’t talk to me. I’m just in my room alone, and it wasn’t until I heard them in the living room that I came out to try to talk to them. Again they’re just cold and stand-offish. Overall, it’s just awkward. The conversation felt like pulling teeth. Jade seemed in a bad mood and I asked her what was up and she was like “something bad happened last night and it’s just a lot” and I asked if she wanted to talk about it but she didn’t want to. Oh well. Then we’re sitting there, and they, in front of my face, make plans to go to their friends apartment, didn’t ask me if I wanted to come, they literally just pretended I wasn’t even there basically. Ouch. Can you at least exclude me behind my back? But like always I just gritted my teeth and didn’t say anything- don’t want to stir the pot. 

The next day I made a study date with my friend, and we went to a coffee shop. In some weird twist of fate, I see Jade at the same coffee shop and immediately turn around. I just wasn’t in the mood for the awkwardness, we could just go somewhere else to study. I’m not sure if she saw me, I turned around so fast. Then something funny happened, on Leah’s story I see she’s at the same coffee shop, then I check snap maps and low and behold all 3 of them are there. Why deliberately not invite me, ya know? 

For the past week, I’ve been out of the apartment pretty much all the time. It’s doesn’t feel like a positive space, so I’d rather be elsewhere with people who make me feel good. Maybe my distance is a part of it? I don’t know. 

This leads up to last night. I came home and the three of them are in the apartment. Leah doesn’t even say anything to me, just throws me a peace sign. I ask “how’s everyone doing” and Jade says she’s tired, and nothing else. Then she gets on her phone and doesn’t even make eye contact with me. Amber at the very least asks me how my exam went but that’s it. 

I went into the bathroom to brush my teeth, and while I’m in the bathroom they all shuffle into ambers room.  

This is all extremely bizarre to me because last year I was really good friends will all these people, and all of a sudden I’m getting the cold shoulder and I have NO idea why. Genuinely. Usually I feel like I’d have some sort of idea as to why someone might be cold to me, but I cannot pinpoint any type of situation that could lead them to treating me like this, when everything was fine a short 2 months ago. 

I feel like I’m a good roommate. I clean up after myself. I pull my weight. I respect when it’s “quiet hours” and people need to sleep. I never have guests over too late. I’m always open to talk whenever anyone needs a shoulder to cry on. I try to invite them into things going on in my life. 

On top of all this, a member of my immediate family is  terminally ill. I haven’t told anyone, but it’s really bogging me down. I need a support system right now, but what I’m getting is what feels like a bunch of mean girls who won’t let me “sit at their table,” but except I live with them, and except I would’ve considered them very close friends at the beginning of this year. 

It’s so strange. I’m confused, pissed off, but ultimately sad. Should I talk to them, or just go about my life? I have a small circle of friends out of the apartment and I keep pretty busy, so I dont exactly need to even be at my apartment hardly at all really, and part of me thinks I shouldn’t try to reconcile things with people who can’t even communicate an issue they apparently have, and are so willing and quick to treat me poorly. 

What should I do?",18Oct2019,2
294,"Hey everyone,
So there’s one friend in our group and we love him but he always uses the excuse dude I’m smart I just don’t try. He has nothing to prove that he is smart and he always says it. He hasn’t passed math since freshman year (currently seniors) and never does his work. He has no amazing test grades and his only thing to his name is he got 100% in a CP physics class that has a very very easy grading scale and allows retakes for anything. If he doesn’t like a class he doesn’t do any work and has had mostly Ds throughout high school. We really just want to show him that being smart isn’t only trying in classes you like because in college he would absolutely fail everything and want to show him why he needs to change. We also are just tired of him parading claiming he’s a genius",18Oct2019,2
295,"Throwaway account. Very stressed about this stupid thing that happened today.

So during a passing time, I (male long-term sub, but certified and trying to get a full-time position in this district) was standing in front of my door like I normally do and a student (male, 9th grade) I had last year comes up to me and greets me. He went in for a handshake or something, but for some reason, I hugged him instead. 

""Yeah, that's cool. You can hug me,"" he said. Or something like that. 

This is a problematic student in many ways. His behavior is totally out of control and I know for a fact that he spends most of the day being scolded for just absolutely nuts/hyper and disruptive.  I had him last year briefly for a different class and I learned that using the carrot rather than the stick was much more effective at getting him to behave normally at all. So, I'm wondering if he sees me as one of the only teachers that he has positive interactions with all day.

The hug itself was awkward and totally accidental/absent-minded. It was one of those things where as I was doing it I thought to myself, ""Why am I doing this?"" Like, I went on autopilot and hugged him like I would a friend. I kind of pulled away about a second into the hug because I immediately regretted it so it was not a long embrace or anything.

Teachers and students definitely saw this exchange, but no one said anything. I have this nagging suspicion that I totally fucked up and a teacher is going to either report me or at the very least think I'm a weirdo/bad at my job.

Really stressed about this. Oh, plus, I'm gay. Not super open about it because I'm a private person, but let's be real-- it's pretty obvious after talking to me for a few minutes that I am indeed gay.

Should I be worried? Should I do anything? Should I say something to the teacher that definitely saw it and just explain that I sort of forgot where I was for a moment?

Also, I cannot stress enough how I have zero sexual interest in this or any other student I have or had. Because, gross.",18Oct2019,16

297,"I've been to therapy before for general anxiety years ago after my parents sent me to a kind of counselor for some kind of career guide type of thing and she referred me to a psychologist after we had talked about how the reason I didn't want to get a job was because of my anxiety. Once I was in therapy for a few months, my parents and I got into an argument and they asked why I was acting so different towards them, I told them that my therapist basically told me to stop holding back the things I really want to say to my parents because I've always been practically scared of them. They hated the idea that I was talking about them with my therapist. Mom was so furious that she made my dad call the therapist and ask what I had been saying about them. After the therapist obviously refused to discuss my sessions with my dad, he just told me that I wasn't going back because it was too expensive. 

I played devil's advocate and hoped that maybe it was just too expensive. But the way our insurance works is that you get 3 free sessions in a calendar year. So when the new year came around I got really brave and I asked if I could go back and dad said no. He wouldn't even look me in the eye and he mumbled about it being to expensive and stormed out of the room before I could even respond. 

I'm getting desperate. My mental health has declined drastically in the last year. I think I've always had OCD but I just never knew what it was. It feels like ever since learning what OCD really was this year, it's gotten worse. I have no idea how to cope with it. I know that mom won't understand, she gets mad any time I express any type of worry even though she knows I have anxiety.

Mom and I have never ever gotten along. Our relationship is practically non existent other than the fact that I live with her. I have a hard time discussing my health in any way with mom because she's a nurse and she seems to have the mindset that ""the patient is always wrong"". I got bitten by a dog once and asked if she could give me a tetanus shot and she refused insisting that "" we don't give tetanus shots for dog bites"" and only reluctantly gave it to me after I had a literal panic attack over it (which I later learned was all tied into my OCD). 

I had a doctors appointment made for this week for a cough and mom wasn't able to come with me so I was hoping that maybe I could ask my doctor about my options with therapy/counselling or whatever. But mom rescheduled to a time where she could come with me and I don't know why. I'm 23 years old, I don't need her there. I don't want her there. 

I have no idea what to do. Every single day is worse than the one before. Every few weeks my OCD shifts and I worry about something new. It's like once I stop worrying about one thing, my brain finds a new thing to worry about. It never stops. OCD has stopped me drinking tap water for nearly 4 months now, and I'm scared to shower. I'll go through a huge bottle of hand sanitzer in a week. Leaving the house has become so difficult that I refuse to even try anymore. 

I don't know what to do.",18Oct2019,5
298,"I’m a 19 y/o male who goes to college and recently started talking to this girl. She goes to the same college and I instantly fell head over heels for her. She’s a real sweet, intelligent good-two-shoes type girl and was also a virgin. After about a month and some change we were hanging in my dorm last week and I took her virginity, we mutually enjoyed it and she seemed to have started reciprocating those feelings towards me. About an hour ago we had sex again but this time I didn’t use a condom. She wanted to see how it felt without and I vehemently denied it because of course pullout game is a myth but conceded because I was blinded by my own feelings and lust. So of course, we had sex and before i knew it I came inside her. It welled up before I could stop it and when I told her she started crying and my heart broke. I mean the second time she’s ever had sex and I went and came in her, what the fuck are the chances. We just got back from going to get plan B at a local walmart and talked in the car for a while before parting ways for the night. Did I fuck up? What can I do to fix it? Is this it for my (relationship?) with her or could it be salvageable? I’m in love with every aspect of her and it physically pained me to see that I made her cry. I’m not blaming her for a thing, it’s my fault that I didn’t dig my heels down and used a condom. I was the sexually experienced and the older person (by half a year). This was my first time going in raw and I made sure she knew beforehand, so in all fairness this was a likely outcome that could have been easily prevented. I just need to know what to do next, and if she’d even want to be around me anymore.

tl:dr I came inside of what might be the love of my life, what should I do next? Will she still want to try and start a relationship with me? or have I fucked everything up with her??",18Oct2019,3

I recently have gone through an 'episode' of quite severe anxiety/depression, it is something I have struggled with over the years but always been able to manage it. This time, it was really bad and I was signed off work. I am now back at work, but have discovered how selfish I have been in dealing with my issues and not my incredible boyfriend's. He is now so fed up of being in a constant negative cycle (which honestly I can't blame him for), and is now incredibly unhappy. I am so scared to lose him, he really is my best friend and someone who I want a future with.

What are the first steps in to showing him that I want this, and I want us. I have offered a load of plans for the weekend, but he has stated that he wants space (again, I cannot blame him for this).

Additionally, I am starting yoga and jogs/runs (when the weather is not torrential rain) to try and use exercise as an outlet.

310,"throw away for obvious reasons. I’m 19(M) just found out my girlfriend 20(f) is pregnant. Right now we’re having heavy issues. For starters we had some roommate issues in our apartment and threats were made against us so we decided to get out of the apartment. We are in the process of getting a new apartment so until we get everything ready we’re staying at her parents house. So we had a hunch that she was pregnant. we went to the store and grabbed some pregnancy tests and went back to her parents place.  We went up stairs for awhile and she disappeared, i knew what she was doing. I fully expected her to come up with a negative one, and boy was i wrong. after awhile of freaking out and her crying we went down stairs and she took the other one. Another positive test. So at this point we know she’s actually pregnant. We have yet to tell anyone that she’s  pregnant. I am open to her getting the baby aborted 100 percent. We’re both so young, not been together for awhile (8 months), and we’re both definitely not financially stable enough. I keep telling her these things and a bunch of bad things about it but she is really starting to lean towards keeping it. I just turned 19 a few months ago, i want to keep being a college athlete, i want to keep going to school, i want all the same for her aswell. i’m just confused she knows it’s not a good idea to keep it and she knows we’re not ready for this but she doesn’t want to abort it. I don’t want to force her into an abortion either but its not the right thing to keep a kid knowing it’s going to have a shitty life. We talked about giving it up for adoption but i’m worried that she will want to keep it as soon as she gives birth to the kid. I just need some help. I don’t know what to do. Calling my parents is NOT an option for me either. I need some advice about how i can talk her out of this or any advice you can give would be helpful!",18Oct2019,1
311,"To give background on myself, I'm 18, currently halfway through my first college semester and constantly under a state of headache and self loathing. My mom is a 2nd generation Vietnamese who had graduated from university, and my dad is 1st generation Vietnamese, which they both moved to Canada to pursue a better life.

Right now I feel that I'm at my lowest point in my life so far mentally, only falling asleep at 3 am loathing the next day in my life.

About 16ish years ago, my parents constantly were working to secure our family financially starting from practically nothing, into starting a restaurant together and succeeded; Today we live pretty comfortably and take it for granted, as well as I'm grateful. Around when I was 8 was when they started to really get their hands full with working full time on the floor, as well as managing the business, my little brother and I stayed with my grandparents for as long as they worked. Typically their day starts from 8am to 10pm. 

Naturally I started to get into playing online games to fulfill that loneliness I suppose it might've been to let the time pass by after school. Games ate into my grades pretty badly and after a couple of phone calls from my teacher my parents moved me to a private school from grade 5 to grade 8. 

This was where mentally I started to go downhill, When I was 13 I got into microtransactions and racked up bills on my Mom's credit card up to 2 thousand dollars here. I admitted to doing it not realizing it was wrong at the time, and not having the greatest concept of money at the time, guilt didn't strike me; then I did it again. Another 1 grand. After this my mom vented to her asian circle friends, which word spread like wildfire and I was friends with many of her friends' kids. This hit me pretty hard overhearing about this stuff from conversations between my friends parents, and kinda fucked me up mentally, developing anxiety from this.

Eventually I make it out of middle school, and decide to join some of my close asian friends at their catholic secondary school for grade 9, where I get through the year but I wasn't very focused on school. At this point I still don't fucking know why but this was when CSGO became a big thing as well as gambling. -$1000. Being ashamed of my own grades as my close friends were in a majority of my classes, towards the end of that year I had started to skip my english class as I didn't enjoy reading novels and considered it a waste of my time. I decided it would just be best to start anew at a different school.

In grade 10, I felt pretty optimistic about starting new, but I didn't fill out my course list that year so it started in the first semester where I had Mechanics in the first block, and absolutely nothing until Math in the last. Eventually not being able to fill up my spares that semester after talking to the school councillor a numerous amount of times, I naturally fell back into the habit of skipping. In combination of which everybodys friend circles had formed, I felt very out of place even after trying to make a couple of friends which I still talk to sometimes, this played in a part of me skipping, being lonely.

The school obviously noticed me skipping often, and I was falling into depression. I walked home most days from school, ordered dominos and a 2 litre pop almost every 2nd day. I wasn't very active either, eventually this led to me becoming overweight too quickly and developing type 2 diabetes (runs in the family.) This is what I would consider the lowest point in my life, running away from school, home, family, I didn't want to do school, I really had no clue what I was doing with my life... Eventually the school put me into self paced online schooling from Grade 11 till I graduated, gradually also losing weight here.

Due to skipping practically an entire semester in grade 10, I eventually graduated a year ago, though a couple months late with a bare minimum finally finished with school. Went on a trip with my friends which was much needed for me at that point. I wanted to take a year off, and my parents were okay with as long as I went to work.

After taking a year off, I felt pretty refreshed as I was going to the gym 5 times a week, trying to think about what I wanted to do as a career, I fell upon something related to graphic design. But here was the catch, my parents had saved up an RESP for me to go to college, but the program I wanted to do was a 2 year program. The problem with that was the government only returns what you put in and you lose all your interest in that account. My parents pressured me into doing a Civil Engineering program for 4 years so that they could get the grant and secure my future working for the government. I felt like I had to make it up to them for all that I put them through. 

Now were back more than halfway through the semester, I practically am failing my calculus course (indirectly due to the teacher teaching the material in a way I cannot grasp) but getting above a B in my other 3 but courses (being extremely boring and uninterested), mentally strained and constantly loathing my next day. It's safe to say my school anxiety is back and I am going to drop that calc course. I talked with my parents saying that I most likely won't continue doing this program as I don't enjoy it at all. Nothing in life gives me genuine enjoyment anymore besides occassionally talking to my close friends, although they're also busy with school and work. Video games arent the same anymore for me as well. I stopped going to the gym for about a month now being to busy with studying and lack of energy from stress. Every now and then I break down in the middle of the night wondering why I was such a disappointment to my parents and those around me and the guilt everything I'd done leading up to this point.

I do know what program I want to actually take where I'll be motivated due to my self interest in the actual courses, another problem though again being an 2 year program where the RESP thing comes into play, and I would have to move away from my family. 

I just feel so empty nowadays.",18Oct2019,1
312,"I posted this on /r/hair as well but I need AS MUCH HELP as I can get, here is the gist:

Essentially, I have a HUGE interview in a few hours for a job and I decided tonight would be a great night to dye my hair black as my hair was dyed blonde previously and I thought it looked bad. So I put the dye in my hair, and here is where the accident occured. You are only supposed to keep it in for 25 minutes, well after I put it in my girlfriend distracted me and we started cuddling and watching TV for like 40 minutes with the hair dye in, I know stupid mistake. So when I took a shower to get the hair dye out, I was shocked to find that there are H[UGE STAINS all over my forehead, back and fingernails that will not come off.](https://imgur.com/a/RyDn30h) I have tried many things, lemon + baking soda + dish soap combo rub I did a huge thing of it on my face and it didn't work at all. I tried rubbing more dye in to reactivate it before scrubbing it off, didn't work. I tried MANY MANY things now including rubbing alcohol and it WILL NOT COME OFF AT ALL. I have to be at the interview in 3 hours and I do not know what to do and I am freaking out. PLEASE HELP.

It might be kinda hard to see in the photos because I DID manage to get the black to fade a bit, but it's still very noticable and awful. It's also on my fingernails and even nail polish remover won't get it off.",18Oct2019,3

317,"Hopefully this hasn’t been posted too often, I couldn’t find anything when I was looking. 

Anyway, I have trouble forcing myself to sleep at night, and was wondering if anybody had any tips for me to help force myself to sleep?

I notice this mainly occurs when I’m extremely stressed and/or have spent the entire day working/studying. 

If I have been studying or working all day and it is bedtime, part of me knows it’s time to sleep but the other part wants some time for myself before I pass out, so that’s what I always end up doing instead of sleeping.

Sometimes I also don’t want to sleep because I don’t want to wake up, and I don’t want tomorrow to come. By staying up (in my mind), I am more or less delaying tomorrow. This usually happens on sundays or if i have a big/multiple assignments due and I’m worried I won’t finish in time.

My dad has called me out on this multiple times when he gets a new car or something and I just put it down. he always told me that I put everything down and its starting to happen more often again.

And you have malicious gossiping neighbors and also now somehow a few stalkers that follow you even on subways? And now you have an irrational fear of applying for jobs and leaving the house because everywhere you go there's always a rude or judgemental comment thrown at you from random strangers that don't even know you and people with human nature that enables them to be sadistically hateful without caring that they look like animals? And was your degree maybe slightly useless because you didn't know ""society"" and ""politics"" existed, because even though you had jobs in college the adults then were generally civil to you until you graduated? And when you go back to college to continue another degree, the professors look at you as if you shouldn't be there because ""you're an old dislikable adult now, you don't have a pure soul or human emotions anymore and don't deserve to exist, you should be focusing on taking care of others or all of your family members, let the children live""? etc etc But at the same time they demonize you for not thinking of yourself and trying to take care of your coworkers and family members by saying that you're full of yourself and a bad dislikable person, even though you thought silence was enough because words cannot describe everything within the silence and time and the cosmos? And they mock everything you say and do, every movement you make, even though you keep to yourself? And they tell you to stop faking being who you are, that you're just an old scumbag and a bad person who doesn't deserve emotions? And you don't really think you could survive in society because it's eat or be eaten and you don't want to eat and don't know how to eat others? And after seeing that ""human nature"" exists, you feel that you don't want to defend yourself from malicious people and would rather allow them to kill you in order to let hatred win, and your desire to live in such a world has greatly diminished and this feeling would remain even if you got a ""decent"" job somewhere, because with every job comes parameters of existence and politics? And maybe sometimes now you put on an arrogant air because you like seeing how quickly people can judge someone and want them to hate you and malign you and also because you have a slightly morbid subversive humor? And you allow your sanity to slip because there's no more anchor of logic and because you no longer want to prevent your sanity from slipping?

**Good day to you!** I´m new to this reddit thing and thought I might just share what´s been lingering in my heart. I (21f) have a pretty average life. I got a good job and colleagues, a great mom, sister, nieces and nephew, a great friend, financial stability. You could say I´m doing fine but for some reason I feel I don’t know how to say it but like I feel empty? As if something is missing. I´ve been feeling kinda down for the past few months. I couldn’t even enjoy my vacation to the fullest. I´m not really an affectionate person and have no experience in love. But I also don´t feel the urge to look for someone. I don´t want to sound like I´m complaining because I know that there are people that have it much worse, which is why I don´t like talking about my feelings or ever complaining. I rather swallow my problems. But I thought it wouldn’t hurt writing this here and maybe it can start a conversation with some people and maybe help someone as well.

At first it was just me and my friend but back in July he said there was a girl who wanted to live with us because of family and money issues. I initially thought they were dating or he at the very least had an interest in her. We've been living together since then. her and I haven't really spoken too often but we've gotten along well. Lately I noticed she's been talking to me more often and I started thinking she has a crush on or something but I didn't really care. About 2 days ago I was watching TV and sat on the couch and watched with me. She started getting closer to me and I felt really uncomfortable. she was sitting in a way that felt really dirty to me and I didn't know what to do. We were sitting next to each other like we were dating but we aren't so I felt weird. she kept pulling on my shirt and stuff...  I felt uncomfortable so I said I was going to bed and I left the room.

For as long as I can remember the sound of snoring and chewing/eating has bought me so much stress I rarely try explaining myself to people cos majority of the time they won’t understand. It doesn’t just annoy me it brings me anger to the point where I will cry and shake with anger and even consider self harming.
So the problem now is that sharing a bed with my boyfriend is affecting my sleep. He’s the most wonderful thing that’s ever happened to my life and I love him endlessly, and regardless of anything that’s going on or will happen, that won’t change. 

He helped me out of my eating disorders that had taken over my life and where getting dangerous. Honestly I couldn’t have done it without him and would still be starving and throwing up and all that stuff. 
When we first met he never snored and I thought “perfect!!” He’s perfect in every way. But recently he’s put on a bittt of weight, and he now snores.. very loudly. And it is destroying me.

Ive tried and tried sssso many times to put him on a diet, eat less or just something!! We even signed up to the gym together, but he hasn’t been in 2 months.

“If he’s not going to loose the weight and change his habits, then I’m just going to go right back restricting my food again”

339," 

Hi. I hope I can get some help here. 

I've been a long time lurker here. I have some relatively harmless (in comparisons what others have to go through) addictions but I'm actually here to talk about my friend. He is 22 just like me and he has a serious heroin problem. He went to a good treatment facility for 14 weeks and he kind of liked it here and we all thought it was helping. He went back to using right after treatment, though. He was released in July and he has since been trying to kick it again. He is going back to uni to study and all seemed well. But his relapses happened more and more often. This has also made his social anxiety come back (which his doctor chose to treat with benzos even though he was addicted to Xanax for like 2 years, but that's another thing). He has now been consume-free for about a good week (or so he says). He still lives with his parents. Actually, no, they kicked him out yesterday and he had to sleep on the streets. I live in another city and so does his other good friend. Other than the two of us and his amazing parents he has no one. His parents have been so supportive and really giving it their very best effort but when I met his mum last week she said she doesn't have much strenght left to deal with this. I guess now it was too much. His father caught him begging people for money in our hometown yesterday. This was the straw that broke the camel's back. My friend said he didn't use heroin or anything but his parents don't believe him (which I understand).

I'm sorry, I feel like I am rambling. I am very unsure what to do now. Have any of you ever been in a similar situation? What did you do to get out of it? What kind of help does my friend need? What do I do?

He asked me if he can stay with me but I just had to move back in with my parents for money reasons. I have an apartment in another city that I have sublet to my best friend (let's call her B) who is also the other good friend of the boy who got kicked out (let's call him A). B would definitely let A stay with her but the city is 1hr away from our hometown where A has to go to uni - and A is completely broke, does not even own 1 buck. Public transport is expensive here so going back and forth would cost him around $30 a day. So that is not an option.

I tried calling A's mum but she's not answering. I'll try again later because I think she's busy. Do you guys have any sort of advice to offer? My mind feels very scattered so I am sorry if this was a pain to read. I appreciate any responses!! Thank you

edit: if you need any additional info please let me know. I am the closest friend of A and I am on very good terms with his parents, especially his mum. We have been more in touch recently because we want A to get better. They do listen to what I have to say. I just don't know what's the best thing for my friend right now? I think he should maybe go to inpatient treatment again because he'll have a roof over his head and people to watch him. I'm really scared for what's gonna happen if he's gonna be on the streets by himself. We will lose him to the drugs and streets then, I am sure of that. How do we prevent this?",18Oct2019,1

This triggers migraines on multiple occasions, and this does not happen as frequently when I am on vacation and have laid the books aside for a while. 

Worse yet, I have to bend my neck downwards to read my papers (as people often do when on the phone) and it causes me a ton of distress. Particularly since many of my professors have hunched backs after many years of studying Physiologically it looks absolutely horrible and it puts me off and is unmotivating because I really don't want to end up like that. I already have muscular health problems (muscular dystrophy). 

I try to stretch my neck regularly, do some mild yoga, move the muscles. I even use a ""reading board"" (I am not sure what it is called) to keep the books standing vertically. I try to sit up straigt and avoid huncing my back whilst reading, albeit I cannot avoid bending my neck downwards. Avoiding huncing is also very tiresome after a while.

344,"Hi everyone

I'm a male, 34 years old, married to a wonderful woman whom I love very much. We have a son nearly 2 years old. We both have good stable jobs, a nice house and is living the good life.

I do however feel that i don't get enough out of life in the everyday situations.

I get home from work around 5pm, then we have dinner, go for a walk, i play with my son while my wife packs his lunch for the next day. At around 7pm, our son is off to bed and my wife and i can finally sit on the couch and relax.

However, in the evening, im so bored i often go to bed very early. Im too tired in the evening to really do anything, but again im bored.

When i go to bed, im tired, but not sleepy so i lie in bed for 1-2 hours watching netflix/youtube before drifting off to sleep.

I know that instead of going to bed, i should play PlayStation, wrench on my motorcycle, take the MTB for a tour or just do something other than sitting on the couch looking at the clock.

Any suggestions to stir up the evenings and actually do something instead of just....sitting there?

A year ago i was very active, riding my MTB 4 times a week, was in great shape and all that, but the days just gets filled with work and obligations. 

I guess all parents must feel the same way :-)",18Oct2019,0

I wanted to change the spelling of it, or instead  stick to a name that is still strong and significant to my Dad's side of the family. I cannot use my mothers maiden name because she has negative ties with her maiden name and I don't want me to be a constant reminder of it. I talked about it with my father a while back, and he was fine with it, replying with ""Just take some time to think about it, it's a big decision"".

I was ready to talk about it with my parents on what I can change it to, but at a bad time where my grandparents are ill, one with heart problems and one with dementia. Whether they live for another few years, or pass away in the near future, i'll feel guilty with the name change being ""too soon"".

347,"First, I'm sorry for my English - it's not my native language and it's very hard for me to speak.

I'm 27 years old, live in small Russian town (Ulyanovsk). I came to reddit because i'm really don't know with whom to talk.

One weak ago i quit my job. Past 3 years i worked in one of the biggest russian media site. My job was editing video, then i was chief of video production. 

But once upun a time, in january 2019, I'm just wake up and decide - 'I need to be an fronted-developer'. So I start learning, and it was very hard times. 8-hours at work, then came home, eat dinner and working on coursers till midnight. Day after day, month after month, learning and learning. It was very hard times, when I didn't go out, didn't meet with freinds, didn't play games of watch movies - only studied all my free-time.

So in august I get my first job as junior frontend-developer. It was very cool, I get a lot of practice,  but then I started having health problems, so i quit my job, so i can have some mental rest and time for myself.

But now i sitting at my desk, look at the wall and thinks ""what should i do in my life?"". I understand that programming is very hard for me (guess i'm not so clever), it's not so interesting, and it's now what i want to do.

My dream is to be a motion-designer and 3D-modeler, it's my hobby, i like it much more. But it's very hard to find this kind of job. And i spent so much time to learn programming. It was really so hard for me, and now what, it's all was to no  purpose?

I'm understand, as frontend-developer it would be easier to find good job, but God, a lot of people studied computer sience in university, so they always would be better than me. And development - uh, i guess it's not for me, i will never be a really good programmer, just because i love art, creative professions, and i'm not an engineer at my mind.

So I don't know what to do. I don't know what work sould i do.

I felt like this was ment to be towards me and that my manager did that on purpose. He did not say it directly to me but it was more so to be indirectly.

351,"I recently took a management position at my work after being warned by multiple people that it’s not worth it. Which it has not been. Over the passed few weeks I have, without any formal management training, done my best to keep things in order. The owner of the business and the two previous managers gave me little to no direction on how to get things done but expect it all to be done perfectly everyday. So with the owners criticism in mind I have made minor adjustments to the way things have been done. None of its ever good enough and when I ask for clarifications or for her to look over my plan my boss just says “I don’t know”. The employees are another problem. Morale was incredibly low before I started but now it’s rock bottom. No one cares. No one does there work properly and if you ask then too they roll their eyes at you. 

The owner is basically a mean girl. Her and the other front desk person are like a little team that go behind my back and talk shit about me to the employees creating even worse morale. 

I am the only manager in the building and I’m basically just a middle man between the owners mean girl team and the regular employees. So if one group does something the other group Doreen like I am the fall guy for both sides. 

It’s basically like being in high school.

My boss refuses to fire our bad employees which puts so much pressure on our few good ones that have to pick up the slack. 

Both sides seem to hate me more and more everyday and I’m done with it. I’m very over it. I’ve been trying to keep an entire business afloat while keep everyone happy with minimal direction or training and people are just pointing and laughing while I flounder around trying to keep things running smoothly. 

Here’s the thing though. The business is a doggie daycare, and while the people can fart right off, I love those dogs. Like a lot. A lot a lot. And I think if I ask my boss she will demote back to regular peon. Which I want I want. I’m done being the middle man everyone is mad at, I don’t care if the business implodes. I just want to play with my dogs all day. 

I can’t sleep because I worry about what tomorrow will be like. Every day is depressing.

But I worry the damage has been done and that everyone will still not like me when I have turned in my gun and badge. I think it’s best to just quit but I love these dogs.

And yes it is financial feasible for me to quit and I do have another job waiting in the wings",18Oct2019,1
352,"Throwaway account, because a tad personal

So, by nature I can be a 'Type A' personality in that I push myself to get the best out of life, you could say it is being a perfectionist. Obviously, this is more strongly presented in some areas than others, but I always stuggle with the idea of knowing if what I have is good enough or should I keep working towards better? 

I have two examples. 

I have the long term goal of going to business school. B-school is, by nature, very prestige based so it lends neatly into this problem of mine. This past year I was accepted into my lowest pick school only, largely due to grades not being up to par for my higher ranked picks. I ended up turning it down because I didn't feel this low pick would get me to my long term goals and that if I studied just a bit (a lot) more, my higher end goal schools could start opening up. However, I have some family members who think I am foolish for not being okay if the good option presented and having to work so much harder just to get to a great option. How do I know if I should keep on working or 'settle?' 

I don't date a ton and I haven't been in too many long term relationships for a number of reasons (such as being a tad reserved in personal social life, focused on career etc) but one of the major reasons is that I am just very picky. Prime example was this past week I went out with a nice girl (I am a hetro man) and the date was fine. However, that the thing I thought it was just fine and not great. We got along decently but didn't have a ton in common and while she's cute I wasn't really 'wowed' by her at all. She seems to be interested in a second date, and since friends and family are telling me I should try at very least since I haven't had a serious relationship in almost 3 years, but I'm having a hard time shaking the gut feeling that I am just settling for her and it'll be a waste of our time.",18Oct2019,1

354,"First off, sorry for the throwaway.

I've had some issues with my employers. Context leading up to my current situation:

* About 2 months ago they promoted me to 'manager' of their small shop.
* The managerial position entailed some additional responsibilities as well as an agreement for a stable salary with a standard amount of working hours, as opposed to pay dependent on the number of shifts covered.
* The first month passed and they decided that I hadn't fulfilled my managerial duties, so they payed me for my shifts and nothing more. This was announced to me on the day I was to be payed, without any previous warnings or complaints about the work I was doing. (I see them in person once a week at the very least so they definitely would have had an opportunity to voice their concerns)

We are now approaching the end of the second month and they have posted a sheet in the store saying that certain shifts that were covered (some by me and some by others) will not be paid cause in the schedule they were given, those slots didn't have names in them.

I can understand that their store isn't doing too well and they are struggling, but making cutbacks from your employees salaries/wages is just not right.

I could just quit, but I feel like some payback is due. I've been trying to think of ways to sabotage them but they're either insignificant or ones that would get me into legal trouble. Can anyone assist on this matter?

P.S. this is in South Africa. The shop is a sock shop, with collectible socks featuring pop culture/current events/unique designs. We also stock some shirts and other small items but it's mostly socks.

TL;DR: Looking for ways of getting revenge (that wouldn't get me into legal trouble) on my employers/their store, because they are making cutbacks by shortchanging staff even though I've tried to talk to them and reach a mutually beneficial solution, like agreeing on a lower salary that they can actually afford to pay me.",18Oct2019,1

356,"TL;DR:
-Anxious of the future
-Taking the present for granted and not taking advantage
-End up looking back with uncontrollable nostalgia

———————————

I’m sitting with my breakfast listening to “2000’s hits” on Spotify. All these songs remind me of elementary, middle, and high school. What I consider “the good times”. I imagine most people experience nostalgia but at this point it’s kind of starting to feel like an illness in my case. 

All through school, I always looked back at previous years in reminiscence but never had my foresight wavered by it. When I left high school, it hit somewhat hard. I hadn’t graduated, there were lots of opportunities and friendships I missed out on, and things didn’t go exactly the way I’d have liked them to. Lots of Rites of Passage missed. I’m not surprised I felt so nostalgic.

I found myself spending the first few years after high school meandering alone without purpose in a new town. They were not great times but I lifted myself out of that rut and eventually made something of myself and now have a life. As tends to happen, that rut got farther and farther away and now it’s been about 7 years since then. Although I wouldn’t consider it a good era, I now find myself feeling nostalgic about it as well.

Time seems to be spinning out of control faster these days and I find myself feeling reminiscent of the most insignificant of times. I’ve come to the realization that I look to the future with a vague anxiety, I don’t savor the present, and end up with a baggage of what could’ve been of the past.

In general, I’m a very anxious person which puts me off from so much but at this point, I feel like I’m not grasping what’s presented to me and I end up haunted by it. It’s a never ending offset in my outlook on life and I don’t know how to fix it. I’ve lived so many days that have felt like endings when they should have felt like beginnings.

I’m not sure how to ask for advice on this but if you have any kind of advice to give, it is greatly appreciated. Thank you.",18Oct2019,3

Problem is that she is dealing with depression plus a lot of other things and while it sounded like she genuinely wants to help them she has much going on in her own life and well yeah that she doesn't feel like she will be able to help without putting even more stress in her life.

361,"Hi, reddit, alt account here because people know me on my usual.

I was laid off from my first job early this year due to a really nasty downsize my old company went through and have been unemployed since. Despite constantly applying to new places, I've only gotten 1 interview in the last 5 months and was promptly edged out. Many of my other applications have been sitting unopened (I applied via a job searching website).

This morning, I got a text from a company I applied to almost 2 months ago asking to schedule an interview with me and, although I'm really eager to get out of this rut, I'm also really worried. This company had one of the lower salaries on offer and I'm stuck thinking that, if they contacted me so long after I applied, who's to say that the other places with better benefits won't contact me, too? What if I say yes to the lower offer out of desperation, only to receive the higher one soon after I sign a contract and am, therefore, unable to take it?

On the other hand, with the horrible, depressing slog unemployment has been so far, I don't want to just drop an opportunity with no real alternative in sight.

I've decided to go to the interview and do my best on it, but the anxiety and FOMO I've been getting are both screwing with me.  Is there a concrete way I can tell if a company is ever going to contact me and, if there isn't, are there ways for me to deal with FOMO when it comes to job searching?

TL;DR

*I've been jobless for 5 months and recently got a text from one of the lower paying companies I applied for. How can I tell if I should just take this one or wait for the higher paying companies to get in contact? Failing that, how do I deal with feeling like I'm missing out on job opportunities during this dry spell?*

Thank you guys in advance. I hope this post doesn't come across as terribly whiny or something along those lines. I just really need some advice to soothe my nerves because this unemployment spell hasn't been very kind to my mental state. I hope you all have a great day.",18Oct2019,1

One of my favorite things to do is to chat with random people I dont know, because I love to get to know different people. However... my parents are the type that thinks that every person on the internet is a pedophile, a creep, or a stalker. They're now threatening to take away my phone and sell it.

371,"Whelp, I've been on Reddit for two years but I haven't really used it until now. I want to maybe expand my socials for art and other stuff, but I'm not too sure where the proper places to do this are. I know r/art is very active, but it's very competitive. Of course, with art, that's always gunna be a factor, but I'd like to have a small community to post my works in so more people could see em.

Also, if anyone has some advice on art based colleges, I'd love that as well! Particularly in the New York Region, since I'll be moving in with my partner there soon. If anyone has any portfolio, application, even scholarship advice, that would help me out greatly.

372,"Before I explain my problem, let me give you some context. I go to an extremely small and extremely religious high school. There are only about 15 students in my class, and about 40 in all four years combined. My school is also Christian, so homosexuality is generally frowned upon.

I have an obsession with touching my male friends. Not in a sexual way, but I always find myself wanting to hold hands with them, hug them, etc. It brings me joy and a feeling of security to be physically close to my friends. Unfortunately, most people do not reciprocate the feeling. Every once and a while, one of the guys will hold my hand for a couple seconds, but then back out after becoming uncomfortable. This makes me a little bit sad.

This has been going on for about two or three months. My friends think I’m pulling this whole stunt as just a joke, and they tell me to stop when I try to touch them too much or too many times. I totally admit that I shouldn’t be touching them if they feel uncomfortable, and I follow that rule most of time (although I still really do want to hold hands). However, I would feel genuinely happy and safe if I could just hold them. 

I have had a history of bisexual/homosexual behavior. During the summer, I felt attraction towards guys, some of which went to my school. I told three of my closer friends about this while it was happening. Again, they thought I was joking at first. Soon enough, they understood that I was telling the truth. This bisexual period was a just a phase though. I felt less and less attracted to males until the end of September, when it disappeared completely (or so I thought).

I also have kissed one of my guy friends (in a game of truth or dare) and told my friends that they looked cute or attractive before (although I told them I was only saying it as a friend). If some of friends were gay, I would date them. But they aren’t; they are all straight. Let me clarify that I am not trying to make a move on them; I’m only trying to have a more connected relationship as friends.

This brings about a few questions:

Why do I want to touch my friends in the first place?

How do I tell them that I legitimately want to hold hands without making them uncomfortable?

What can I do to stop having and/or acting on this feeling?

I don’t expect anyone to answer all of these questions, or answer any of them in depth.

With that said, have an amazing day kind strangers!",18Oct2019,1

So I was dancing with this one girl and kept leaning towards her face after a couple of seconds she turned her head and put her mouth on my, and when we started kissing I notice that I was touch her lips, there would be time where I felt like I was kissing my hand and I couldn’t get a handle on it.

379,"I've been trying to leave my current job for a while. Stress is high, the door is revolving quicker and quicker each month and I'm terrified I could get terminated at any moment.

I recently interviewed for a new job and they loved me and it seems like a way better opportunity for growth and to work with some really good people.

The only problem is, they made me an offer that's around $2,500 less per year than what I currently make and my insurance rates would almost triple. They've guaranteed me growth and pay increases, but idk how much of that is just a ""sales pitch"". I've asked for more money, but the likelihood is slim that I'll get it and we have a kid on the way.

I'm not sure what to do here, if I should take the job for my mental health, or stay miserable where I'm at, but be a bit more financially secure. If it was just my wife and I to consider, I'd have already said yes, but again, there's gonna be a kid in the picture soon.

381,"Hey everyone, I'm a 16 year old male looking for some help with an issue that I have locked up inside my head.
So long story short, my friend and I parted ways on bad terms - really bad terms, to the point where my parents were a bit fearful of my safety if I was to come into come into contact again.
So, his issues: no one knows exactly but he is a sociopath, a compulsive liar, and has a history of stalking, blackmailing, pressuring people, victimising himself and threatening to commit suicide to multiple people. And naturally seeing how I was his friend for a good two years, I've experienced the jist of it.

He left my school several months ago, and I blocked him on virtually everything around the same time. However, I feel this anxiety and somewhat paranoia if I start to go into thoughts such as what if he finds a way to stalk me or worst of all, try to kill me?
We all think he's a psychopath, and he's just generally a scary person.

I know I shouldn't be worrying but it's just a background thought that I can't shake. How can I resolve these bad thoughts and worries that I have?
Any help will be appreciated, thank you",18Oct2019,3
383,"I’m kind of a lonely person I have school friends or whatever, I’m ugly as shit and have been called such multiple times especially recently. I’m worried that I won’t ever be able to date, because of how ugly I am. The thing that kinda set me off to post here were me seeing a lot of my friends date being called ugly several times, and getting depressed by the constant “my gf/bf made me this” posts. I’m a senior in an all boys school, and my first time seeing women regularly in a long time will be when I go off to college. So as some more background socially I’m a 6’2 lanky Black Guy,  My Voice doesn’t match my body and neither does my face and on two different occasions very recently my self esteem has been thrown into a fucking blender the most recent thing happened Monday 


I was chilling in the library watching some friends play PS4 when out of nowhere this other kid comes up to me while he’s FaceTiming a girl, the guy said “I got a man for you.” I cover up my face because I already know what’s about to happen but he pulls my hoodie off and she’s like  yelling “ he’s ugly as fuck” that made me feel really bad. Then he comes back 5 minutes later and she’s repeating “ Get this N_gga off my screen he’s fucking ugly.” That basically fucked my self esteem and ruined my whole new outlook on life that I had

And then an earlier time a guy in class who’s kind of a dick but also not tried to put me on with his cute ex girlfriend, my stupid ass decided to send him some “good” pictures
She said something really fucked up about how I looked and I think I cried. 

My appearance is really all I have in terms of even attempting to make the first move. I’m fucking cripplingly shy and uncomfortable around women to the point that If I see one walking down the same street as me I have to walk across the street or across the grass to avoid eye contact or being close until they pass by. I’m ugly so I feel like It’d basically be crushing or awkward to talk to women in any context, I don’t know what it is but my uncomfortability around girls in terms of conversation makes them feel creeped out by me even when I’m just placing an order or something. I think my appearance has something else to do with it. Or they get all weird and start talking to me like all awkward with this awkward fake laughter and fake smiling like I’m a baby. I hate that too it’s like they pity me. 

In terms of personality I don’t know what to really say, It usually depends on my audience but I can be relatively funny, like I’m not funny to other black people most of the time, but if you’re any other race my humour is pretty charming apparently, it’s subjective really because I don’t think I’m funny at all unless I unintentionally do something stupid that came from my upbringing of not being allowed to leave the house. But yeah I’m relatively funny apparently, I try to be sensitive to people’s feelings, I tend to be chill unless I’m stressed. But I’m usually only like this around people I know. When I’m around strangers I’m too nervous to even look around when I walk unless there’s someone with me. And I can’t even go most places unless someone invited me to come with them. I can turn most of the depressing stuff I talk about off around others because I don’t wanna be an emotional terrorist. 

I don’t really have that many standards other than the fact that I don’t want to date inside my race.

I also feel really depressed and resentful that the only people to acknowledge my appearance in a positive are my relatives, it really depresses me, that I’m only handsome to them, I especially resent being told that they love me. It really upsets me. I just want to be loved by someone not related to me.

In terms of a relationship I just want some wholesome shit, I just wanna be chosen by someone you know? I just wanna hear “I love you.” I just want that strong emotional connection shoulder to cry on type shit. I see so many couples in malls or on Reddit but I don’t know why it’s been so hard for me. I know you have to make friends with girls first and I have but college is gonna be a whole new set of people and if I don’t get my romance game right there, then I’m gonna be single forever and I just couldn’t fucking do that. It’s the only thing I want in life, to be loved, nothing else interests or excites me, nothing I do really fills me with emotion one way or another, the only other reason I’m going to college is to get away from family and maybe find a major that has decent money in it that doesn’t involve math.

385,"i lived in my hometown my whole life. everything i know and love is there. the plan had always been for me to go to college in the major city an hour away from us, i was supposed to live with my sister (22f) but that ended falling through because of some problems. i didn’t want to go to college in my hometown. it isn’t like i wasn’t happy there, i just thought it was time for me to leave. i have another sister, the one in the title, that lives in another state with her husband. we’ve always had a close relationship and they have an extra room for me. i ended up moving there. i came for college, but before some reasons that aren’t really important, i have to do online schooling until next year. i’m barely on campus and when i am, it’s just to study. i’ve tried joining clubs, programs etc but there’s really nothing for me. i don’t have anyone. i’ve downloaded bumble and used the bff thing to find some friends but it just doesn’t work. 

i’ve felt nothing but homesick. i’ve had to pull over so many times because i get so overwhelmed. i went from a relatively small city to a huge one with traffic all hours of the day and roads i don’t know. i’m a pretty new driver too so it’s all so much for me. i wake up almost everyday dreading getting up, going to a job i don’t even like, then going home. i don’t have a life. 

my sister doesn’t make matters better. we have a very different look on life. we’re different but i love her and she’s made living here survivable. but it’s not enough. i told her i was homesick and that when we go back to our hometown to visit in a couple of months, i want to stay there. i don’t plan on coming back. she thinks i should wait it out, she said that when she first moved her after she got married, she felt this way for a whole year. she thinks i should just wait for things to get better. 

my thing is, why? i have no reason. i’m not happy here. i don’t want to wait. i want to go home now. on my way to work this morning i cried so bad. every thing here sucks. i was happy at home. i’m not happy here. it’s a no brainer to me. i talked to my friends and they think i should come back too but my sister thinks i’m giving up. maybe it does get better? but is it worth my constant sadness to just wait it out? i miss everything 

TL’DR; i moved to a different state and moved in with my sister. i miss home. it’s only been 2 months, sister thinks i’m overreacting and thinks i should stick it out for the end of the school year and maybe see if i wanna go back in the summer. i don’t see the point, i want to go home ASAP. what should i do? is she right, am i giving up to early? or should i just do what will make me happy?",18Oct2019,0

388,"For as long as I can remember, I’ve cared about the opinions of other people. As early as grade 6 (when you are roughly about 12 for those non-Canadians out there), I started to care about what people thought of me. I did things simply to blend in to the crowd and try to seem like I was an exceptional guy. Fast forward to high school and I got good marks and joined sports teams and student counsel. Why? Because I wanted other people to think of me as this exceptional person who was at the top of his game. I’m now in my third year of university with straight A marks and an outstanding co-curricular record, but I never feel like I have enough because of the way that I think. People always want more from me, and for the first time, I feel like I have nothing left to give and I am now lying or inventing a reality to fill in the gaps.  

I’ve lived a life constantly searching for me because I’m afraid that people will judge me if I don’t keep trying to change or keep trying to get more for myself. It’s as if there is a black hole inside of me that is preventing me from being happy about the way that I am. I’ve achieved so much but it feels like it means nothing. I’m writing this post today because I want to change and because I’m starting to feel the negative affects. I feel like I’m starting to lie to fill in gaps where people think little of me. I feel like I need to be at the top of my game, but I just don’t see the benefit anymore. These lies are eating away at me and starting to hurt the relationships in my life, like the one that I have with my girlfriend. I’ve told her a bit about how I feel and she recommended that I start to go see a therapist or get a psych assessment. 

I’ve tried talking to therapists, but I feel like I need to make them think that I’m okay instead of just letting my feelings out. I’ve started to email counsellors and therapists to set up new meetings, but I can’t find any strategies to just open up to them. 

I know this sounds like a stupid problem to have. But imagine looking at your life and seeing success, only to realize that none of it was done for you, and all of it was done for other people. It makes you feel really freaking hollow. 

TLDR; I truly believe that my self worth is tied to the way that people think of me and I need to learn about some strategies to change the way I think. Does anyone have any strategies or stories that they could share to help me start to overcome this?",18Oct2019,2
389,"So my friend Kayla’s birthday is tomorrow and she  wants to go to another city to celebrate great I’m down for that, problem is that now they want to go to a club, now the thing with me is that I don’t do clubs despite me going out to bars and dancing actual full size clubs don’t do well for me. 

It gives me high anxiety and pretty much I just said I don’t feel like going, at first I did then I changed my mind and she got upset at me for doing that. My other friend pretty much told me it won’t be the same without me but I said in response “what can I do that  y’all can replicate?” Telling me “it’s the thought that counts” 

look I love my friend and I’m happy she’s celebrating her birthday but I’ve been getting shit in both ends simply cause I don’t wanna go, I don’t wanna force myself it isn’t gonna be fun time, she said she was trying her best to make things “comfortable” for me and that nothing she will do will make me happy. 

Which puts me in a dilemma cause all because of a damn thing that I wanted to do there a chance she might not want to plan things with me anymore even after all we’ve been through together as friends. I asked if she was disappointed in me, all she said was “I don’t have anything else to say to you” 

What hurts me the most is when my other friend was like “oh welcome to trying to do things with these niggas that involves money”   Bruh I’m not rich enough to do anything I even want to do all the time, I don’t have the luxury to spend money like that all the damn time between car payments and school and work I can’t.   I hate feeling shitty for something i never intended  to do, I’m not out here trying to actively hurt my friends I just don’t feel comfortable and my insecurities prevent me from doing a lot of things like clubs and money.

390,"One of my biggest struggles in life is the fact that at times, I can barely form proper sentences and uphold a verbal conversation. I'm pretty confident and outspoken when writing, which is what seems to convince people to hang out and is proof that I'm not braindead, just not good when actually speaking. 

Over the years, I narrowed it down to two things. 

1. I stumble over my words. I tend to speak very fast, usually without noticing. This, in part, stems from the fact that I also tend to get spoken over, so I think I subconsciously learned to say my piece as fast as possible before getting interrupted again. Whenever I notice that I'm talking too fast, I try to slow down, but that feels unnatural now, like forcing yourself to walk slower than you usually do for ""no good reason"" so I usually speed it up again before I know it.
2. I feel like I can't properly sound vowels and consonants anymore. It's hard to describe. I've spoken words since I was born, obviously. But more and more, it feels like I can't get the words and sounds right. Strangely, this happens more when I speak in my native tongue but to give you an example in English: If I were to try and say ""The transformation of societal values"" I would probably end up saying something like ""The ta-- transermation offotietal valyes."" It almost feels like my mouth is ""out of practice."" And of course, once I get self-conscious, I fall into the same trap as when you think about how to tie your shoes while you do it - it gets worse.

I know this is very general and there might be factors to this that I'm not even aware of, but do you have any advice for me on how I can improve  on those two points? Like, some kind of training or practice or something? Tjat wpiöd ne great- Tjamls",18Oct2019,1

I’ve been with my husband for 7 years, married for 4, and we have a one-year-old (14 mos) son. After my son was born, unsurprisingly, our marriage shifted focus to raising him, making him happy, and revolving our worlds around him. We love him and he is absolutely wonderful, but I think we have lost our drive to keep each other happy along the way. 

We both work full time and my son stays with my mom during the day. My husband gets off work 4 hours earlier than I do so he picks him up in the afternoon. By the time I get home, I cook, we hang out for an hour or two and then it’s bedtime.

Our son refuses to sleep anywhere but in bed with us. It’s a literal nightmare most nights, he fights and screams relentlessly. We’ve even moved his crib in our bedroom, but he will only sleep in it for 2 hours before he’s up and screaming. I get up with him at night, all night, 3-4 times per night. My husband sleeps through it (which is fine, he’s a very heavy sleeper and we have discussed this plenty)

I feel like our work and sleep routines are what is doing us in; making us feel unappreciated and unhappy. My husband doesn’t like getting out of the house or leaving our son with anyone, so we are never really alone just the two of us.

\- It's only been 1/2 weeks ago since I saw them, so to me it's just not 'worth it' to spend all the money, just to see them in that short amount of time. 

I know it sounds like I only care about the money and myself, but I'm not the type of person who hangs out with everyone once a week and spending so much money. If it's been like 2 months ago then I would probably do it.

But do you guys get what I'm trying to say? If you do, how can I say to them that I don't wanna hang out 'yet' (or maybe an excuse)?",18Oct2019,1
404,"Hi. So my boyfriend (20M) and I (20F) have been together for almost 3 years. I am very much in love with him, and very attracted to him. We have a wonderful relationship, and see our futures together. 

He has this cousin, who is around 23 I believe? He looks just like him, but has dark hair and darker features instead of blonde features like my boyfriend does (which I love!). I met him at a family Christmas party last year, and did my best to contain my shyness, because when I find myself attracted to someone, my face starts to get super red and there’s nothing I can do about it. Unfortunately, I found myself attracted to his cousin the more I spoke with him, and I blushed a few times. Of course, my boyfriend knows what it means when I start blushing like that, but (thankfully) he didn’t see it that time. Now that the holiday season is coming up and I’m inevitably going to have to see his cousin and sit with him at the dinner table, I really want to brainwash myself so I don’t have a crush on his cousin anymore. I would be so mortified if he said something to me and it made my face turn red while I was sitting next to my boyfriend and the rest of his family. This is so dumb, I don’t want to be that girl who is attracted to her bf’s family members!! How do I get rid of this stupid crush?

TL;DR I have a crush on my boyfriend’s cousin and I need to get rid of it before I start seeing him at family holiday parties, but I don’t know how.",18Oct2019,1

407,"Stopped into a local convenience store for a popsicle/good humor style frozen treat after sustaining a minor fall at the park. Dinner with family was happening in a couple hours, so I allowed my child to choose between 5-6 different treats I know he likes. All my child wanted was the larger sized sundaes and pints in the same reach in case as the others. 

I didn’t make it about money but about spoiling appetites - and frankly the options I allowed were very generous.

Child kept asking for the mini sundaes and pints. I kept redirecting and asserting calmly why I choose the treats he could pick from. Child still asked for the bigger ones. 

I offered my child one last chance, again pointed to the bigger ones so I then said, no, we’ll come back another day for those, right now we’re. It getting anything. 

Child fussed, pleaded, and wouldn’t leave the case. I picked my child up while flailing and hitting me. Took it outside and while my child was in tears I explained again (simply) my point. 

Child calmed down. Seemed to get it. We hugged and I reminded my child how much love I have and thought what I was offering was fair and the refusal to accept that felt like I was being taken advantage of. 

I felt like my child got it. We went back in and picked out one of the original choices.

408,"Hey reddit!

i'm a 22 yo male and i study at my local uni.

The problem is that i've been missing already 3 days of school because i can't go without taking a sh\*t before because i feel like i'm going to sh\*t myself.

I think that it's because when i get nervous i normally feel like i have to go to the wc and this happens everytime i'm heading out of my house.

My uni is about 40 mins away (could even be an hour if there's traffic) if i go using the bus , but i've been using a lot of taxis latley, which takes around 20 minutes. The problem is that i can't afford to use a taxi everyday because of the cost.

The reasons of my phobia are 2:

1.- Some times i get this sudden violent desire to sh\*t  and sometimes i feel like i can't even get to my bathroom (which is around 30 feet from my room).

2.- Fear of the same of sh\*tting myself in public, it has happened to me before (the last time was when i was 16).

I don't know what to do, i'm thinking on taking some laxatives because in the last 5 days, i haven't gone to the bathroom enough.",18Oct2019,2

Anyway fast forward 3 years, she kind of decided she wants to be friends again, party of that she's also moving to the city that I live in after university.  She's apologised and I've forgiven her BUT I have to admit I'm scared she's going to do the same thing again so I'm not sure I want to be close friends.

I'm also worried she's not going to be there for me in the future when I need her, and she's only friends again now because she's in the same city and wants some friends.

418,"I've been struggling the last few years to reduce my passions to a few things that I love and want to spend all my time on. 

There's so much that excites me and the more I learn the more I realize I don't know. I'm trying to learn and do so much that it can be overwhelming especially while in University full-time, working two part-time jobs and having practice multiple times a week. If I could I would spend all day learning about new things but that's just unreasonable given my life style and the society we live in. Buying the necessary tools and memberships for each hobby is also expensive.

I think it would be healthier for me to become an expert in a few things rather than trying to learn and do everything. I am really just curious about everything in life and have been my whole life. I probably have an arsenal of things I can do well, a few things I can do very well but nothing that I'm an expert in. 

I just don't know what to pick. If I choose to focus on one thing then I feel like I'm missing out on a whole bunch of other really cool things I want to learn. 

Surprisingly enough, my love life is amazing. I have been entirely loyal to one partner for over 10 years and don't care to explore others. I'm entirely content and satisfied with my relationship and just wish I can have a healthy relationship with my ""hobbies"". This curiosity is only an issue for academics, sports and the arts. When it comes to people I tend to know who I like and stay loyal as a friend or partner. 

If anyone has any advice on how I limit my hobbies to three: one to make me money, one to keep me in shape and one to be creative. I heard this a while ago and don't remember who said it but I have been struggling to reduce my hobbies to just three despite currently being in school, working and being on a team. University is too limited and focused on one topic, I work in fast food (not exactly a hobby), and I participate in many sports and go to the gym almost daily. 

I understand that this is a confusing situation because there's nothing actually wrong and I'm in a lucky position but I'm curious to know if there's some way to find what's truly important to me, besides explore more because I've done all the exploring I possibly can. 

Thanks in advance to anyone who took the time to read all this and reply.

Her phone data got turned off because she couldnt pay. I dont know what to do, because I could pay 1000 and break the lease. which would be cheaper than covering her for a year and constantly being angry she doesnt have my money. I feel like i am being taken advantage of, and right now she owes me about 500 from two weeks and still hasnt paid. Shes my best friend, but i dont see any good outcomes of this.

We been texting for about a year now..
She always ask me to call her but every time I find some silly excuses  not to call her.

The second reason is that I might bore her while talking..cause I dont really talk to many girls..

445,"I \[21\] feel like I've wasted two years of my life as a liberal arts major for a career that I'm not fit for. For clarification, I enrolled in college immediately after high school, like the typical college student. I originally majored in accountancy, however only because my mother said it was good to fall back on in case of economic hardship. I switched it to political science and philosophy in hopes of becoming a lawyer specializing in a specific branch of cause law, after the pre-law adviser (who was a Poli Sci professor) told me everything would be alright, that the degree and everything will work out for me, that getting a career will not be that hard if I truly put my mind to it. The problem is not that he was wrong, but that I've had a significant change of heart.

Over the past two years, I've demonstrated to myself time and time again that I'm not meant to be a lawyer, and I would be miserable even if I was a decent one. I've embarrassed myself in multiple presentations, and really don't want to be involved in legislation and politics after seeing how people treat each other. I just want something logical and straightforward, not a career where I have to exploit every profitable route for my or my client's best interest. It just seems out of touch with me now.  
I love philosophy, always have. I felt that the philosophy department was the closest to home and understandable people (the professors) I could get to in my entire university. However, most philosophy majors end up becoming a.) lawyers or b.) professors. And it's not that I can't find out what to do as a philosophy major, but I'm just not the stellar exemplar who's engaged in their community, politics, academia, etc. that should be pursuing these majors. I'm not a member of the Model UN. I'm not going to be writing in a philosophy periodical any time soon. I'm never going to be a lawyer.

 My situation is so cliché of those that wasted their time indulging their ""passions"" or going forward with a degree only because they wanted to do it, not because it was practical. I want to reiterate once again that people can be very successful with liberal arts majors even in business environments (evidenced by my mentor, who has a BA in Poli Sci, a JD, and is basically a sales manager for a very profitable company making close to six figures a year without working ten-hour shifts). I'm just not one of those people. 

My question really is how can I move forward feeling what I do? How can I tell my family, to whom I've told of my prospective career as an attorney over the past two years, that suddenly I don't want to be one anymore? What should I do? Like most people, I want to live comfortably. Not outrageously rich, but well-off in case of any economic hardships. I don't know how to confront the professors I once eagerly told that I would pursue an honors project, that I was devoted to this career path. I just really feel like an embarrassment, but I know someone else has gone through with this, which is why I'm posting this. 

I've thought about which fields I would flourish in. I gravitate toward STEM majors because of the growing careers in those fields, the scholarships, and job security. In particular, I was thinking about math, since I have done quite well in past math classes. I received a score of 30 on the math portion of my ACT, without really studying and without taking calculus, although it doesn't involve it that greatly. Moreover, it is pure deduction and I would be able to exercise my logical faculties that I would normally luxuriate in philosophy and logic. Overall, it seems very straightforward. I've heard a career as an actuary is quite desirable, due to the salary and balance between home and work. I'm not dedicated to being an actuary, but just a thought. 

I'm kind of done with liberal arts for the time being insofar as it reminds me of my lost prospects of becoming an attorney. I just want to be useful, to go into a burgeoning job market where I will not only appreciate a comfortable income but job security as well. I've also thought about a government career, and am fascinated by it too. I've thought about going into the military for a while, and was so intrigued once I had the opportunity to go on a military base recently. Not just for the career, but am just interested in it.

I'm not really sure of anything anymore, but would appreciate some advice if possible.",18Oct2019,1

Also it might be a long read I hope it won't bother you too much - if you read it  till the end THANK YOU !

Okay so there is this girl that I find cute and interesting .Here is the backstory : we never talked or texted before, I know her cuz we live in same town and we are also kind of neighbours,  we live 10 min apart , that being said we know each other simply cuz of those reasons but we never talked before . I know her brother and few days ago I was walking trough the park and saw her with her friend and she was looking at me twice waiting for me to say hello and i did -this may be irrelevant 

I followed her on Instagram like 10 days ago  and watched couple of stories , yesterday I woke up and bam , there is her message in my Dm, keep in mind that she never followed me back yet .


Text itself was pretty strange tho,  it was not like hi what you doing or something like that, she literally asked me something about my grandpa and she started the message with - Eej I have a strange question, I responded in about hour since i was sleeping at the time she sent it ,so here is the Strange part - she left me on read,  like she totally ignored my reply,  it's been two days now , I never got a response, I'M CONFUSED AS HELL. 

Okay so what is this , It took me like hour to respond so maybe that could be reason , maybe she is playing with me ? 

She actually posted insta story last night which means she must seen it by now ,honestly Idk what to think 
Why would she bother to text me over such thing , she doesn't follow me which means she had to find me on insta and send it",18Oct2019,1

I just feel like I can't ghost him cause I don't want to end up lonely since our friends know him better than me.

Basically I got started in IT a little over a year ago after the IT Manager here and another higher up executive found out I’m interested in it. I was in a different department at the time. I proved that I could learn by doing side projects for them and a role was created for me which is mostly like a Helpdesk/junior sysadmin role. 


They found out I knew HTML and CSS and decided to give me a new project. It would save them loads of money. It sounded like it would be as easy as designing a pdf template but it turns out there’s actually custom code I would have to manipulate and put in to get what we need. I’ve tried my best to learn it but it’s only been a few days and I haven’t gotten much done. 


The other executive I mentioned made a “joke” by asking “wow this is all you have done in x days, what have you been doing?”  She told me she was just joking but it really rubbed me the wrong way because I have been trying my best, not to mention I also have to deal with my other responsibilities on top of this.

It](https://lot.It)'s enough to live on, but not enugh to ever get anywhere with life's expenses. I basically have to choose between saving or buying things I need like a new stove because I can't even boil water right now.

The people that work there tend to not think things through and it gets old. At first I just put it out of my mind because it's just a stupid pt job I can quit any time. But I really need the money so want to stick it out as long as possible, and these peoples' stupidity hinders doing the job in the most effecient ways.

&amp;#x200B;

There's this guy who thinks he knows it all and thinks only he can see how to expedite things. Which causes him to hinder true expedition. He's convinced I'm an idiot because he mistakes kindness for stupidity. I'm just kind and don't ever say anything to him. I will be pushing dishes and he will literally come up beside me and start working to push dishes like I am working slow and this will somehow speed things up. But the truth is- I am going slow because he is in my way. Now I could try and explain that, but he won't hear it. So I just continue scrubbing something I planned to scrub maybe 5 seconds until he gets out of the way and then send it through. So of course he then says - \*Hey don't scrub that so long and just send it through!\* To which my only response would be - Brilliant idea, Ed... But I don't want to be a prick so I ignore it.

&amp;#x200B;

People just suggest the dumbest things and think you're dumb if you don't do it that way. We'll need to restock one cup rack because there is only one empty spot. So you pick up one cup rack and start to carry it over and someone is shouting, \*Take the entire cart of cups!\* But why roll a cart of cup racks stacked ten high across a busy kitchen, restock one rack, then roll the cart of nine back?

&amp;#x200B;

We stack pots and pans up on a cart and this cart has wheel that don't turn and it is too wide to get through the aisles and it gets stacked so high stuff topples if you move it. It takes me 60 seconds to just physically take the pots and pans off the cart and walk them to where they go. But if I take the entire cart it takes about 7 minutes because I have to man handle this cart due to the wheels and width and I have to navigate a busy kitchen with it while trying not to topple things over. Of course two or three people are always talking down to me - ""You know you can take the whole cart right?""

I met a girl on Instagram. I like her a lot, and she goes to my school. We like the same things, have the same views, and get along really well. The only ""issue"" is that, I'm a senior, and she's a sophomore. She's currently 15, turning 16 this November (It's October 18 now). Nobody has found any real issue with it, (except my ex, who gave me shit about it with snarky remarks), but everyone I've told about that said she's probably just jealous.

474,"2 years ago, I finished a master degree in political science. I tried to pass on entree exam the canadian public function and failed, hurt at lot back then. During those 6 years at university, I never knew what I would do later with it in my life. I never had a clear vision but I thought stufying hard enough would open every doors.  Why did I study political science ? All I knew is that I loved politics, loved to listen to my teachers' story and smoking the ganja after the classes. I never got socialy or professionaly implicated at school. But I enjoyed lessons and research

Free times what spent mostly at the gym. I love training and reading on it, it's basically all I do since Im 22 years old and now I'm 31. So after failing one entree exam (that could lead to a nice paying white collar desk job) I decided ""fuck it"". So I became a personnal trainer in a small gym in Quebec city. Since then, I work there and I'm trying to build my clientele, which is hard but it is slowly working.

I suffer from body image problems and used steroids for 5 years to compensate since stopping 6 months ago. I also suffer alot from anxiety, which wakes me up almost every morning. Since stopping, I can't make my mind up about wheter or not I made a good choice by becoming a trainer. I love helping regular people get in shape and healthy, it's an amazing feeling. The pay isn't that good (but i dont need that much more money) and there are no social benefits. So every morning I wake up anxious about my future, that 401k account Ill never have and so on, even though i don't need more money now. I recently started seeing a psychologist so I don't know yet what will come out of it.

After her YWAM trip last year, she kinda stopped replying to my messages/will reply a day or even a week late, and if I don't message first, we don't talk at all. She says it's because she has this social anxiety and feels like if she doesn't reply with the right thing, I'll hate her. She also mentioned this goes for everyone. 

I know that this is a real issue people have, but if you knew my friend, you'd even think it's weird for her, of all people, to deal with that.

So am I a horrible person for not really believing her? Especially since I see she's posting non stop on her social media? Is our friendship over?",18Oct2019,1

478,"I'm posting this because it is causing me more mental anguish than it really should.

I have a gas-powered Ryobi thing that I use all over my yard.  It is very useful, and I call upon it many times.

Well, the last time I went to use it, like two weeks ago, it wouldn't start.  I actually felt sad.

So, I looked up videos on how to fix it.  I read forum posts on how to fix it.  I ordered parts to try and fix it.

I only made it worse.  It's completely hosed now.

Now, the actual engine part is fine.  The body of the unit is fine.  It's just some random wire or connector or something that is preventing it from starting.

There is a small-engine repair place near me that I can take it to.  A new one will cost $90.  Even if the repair place can fix it, it may cost as much as a new one.

But, if I buy a new one, what do i do with the old one?  Just throw it away?

tldr at bottom

My roommates, who also happens to be my sister and her boyfriend, are top tier leeching pieces of shit. Which I am done with. They begged me to move with them, which turns out it was just so that I could pay the deposit on the house for them. They took the master bedroom without asking me, have 2 animals they they neglect both of them medical attention, and both don't have actual jobs, my sister thinks that It Works is an actual job (she's barely made any money and has had to take multiple loans). At this point she would owe me $1450, but I want her out. Which would take care of the majority of this money. 



She needs to get out  she does not contribute at all to this house, and frankly has screwed me over multiple times. She and her boyfriend make constant messes which I end up cleaning when I see, because I'm apparently more mature than them. But then when dishes or recycling pile up and i ask them to help out they throw a huge fit and remove the recycling can from the house and throw the mess everywhere(yes this actually happened, i also had to clean this up.). I'm done. They take up all the space, and make so many messes but can't take responsibility for anything. I just don't know what to do here.


 I want her out of this house since she has not contributes whatsoever, made me move with her and pay the deposit, and also promised to help me learn how to drive, which after 2 years is obviously not happening, and I will have to drop $600 on driving lessons. I don't know how to handle this because one, she's my sister. Two, she is so immature that any criticism she just freezes up and has an attitude and blames EVERYTHING on who ever else she can, and I wouldn't doubt if she tried to just get me to move out so that she can get my money or a free place for a bit. The other issue being that her name is on the lease with me, I make enough to cover rent on my own, but i cant get her removed unless its for legal reasons or everyone agrees. But honestly at this point im considering calling the cops or taking her to small claims court for the numerous times she stolen from me and abused me. Im 20 years old, and shes 24, and I really dont know what to do in this situation. 


Thank you for reading this, and sorry, I am very angry I think you can probably tell.

485,"Throw away so I don't tarnish my main account with this massive fuck up. I just don't know where else to turn and hope someone can point me in the right direction.

 I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I've had depression for many years but did the typical thing and just kept it to myself. Been on the meds, they did nothing for me. I left the UK five months ago to move to Indonesia with the best of intentions to get better, to beat this. I wanted to get fit, both physically and mentally, I had bits and bobs to be doing online to keep money coming in, I wanted to start meditating, volunteering, finally learn guitar. I achieved none of these things and just stagnanted, regressed to an even worse state I was before I left. It was all in my head but I couldn't take the next step and execute it. The last few months have taught me  that it's probably not just depression and I'm more than likely bi polar spectrum and really need to get help. 

I put that there because as much as I take responsibility for all of my actions and I know I'm the only one accountable for getting myself in this mess, I don't want it to come across as if  I'm a backpacker or a drunk. I'm just an idiot. 

I calculated my departure wrong, I re entered the country for the first time without a visa on arrival that can be extended. I have overstayed by one day and have to pay a fine before I can leave the country. I have missed my connecting flights and will have to rebook. I will also be fined an additional day tomorrow. I am penniless and have already borrowed from my parents who really can't afford it and my friends who I have let down with my lack of communication, as again, I did the typical thing of pretending everything is alright and shut off from them. 

The immigration/airport staff were not helpful. They told me to get the money or get in touch with the embassy. I have looked online for information and the embassy here in Jakarta doesn't open until Monday. I have looked for any information of who to contact back home with no luck and I'm honestly just at a loose end as to where to turn next. I'm rolling the dice here as know these posts can fall flat on their face but if anyone has ever been, or known someone in a similar situation, please let me know what I can do next. 

On a deeper level, I feel this is punishment for many years wishing I was dead. I moved so far away from those thoughts and those feelings this year but I feel as though I am being pushed into a corner. I've only had three hours sleep and this all just feels like a bad dream.",18Oct2019,1
486,"So, I broke my foot. They cast it and decided to wait and see. Got a re-check and the fracture shifted enough to warrant surgery. I'm living on my own, in a 3rd-floor apartment (one flight of very steep stairs) and having just moved have not made any friends in the area yet. No family or romantic partner around for 300 miles (in the Midwest USA). Ride-share services aren't available in my area so I'm driving myself even though it is dangerous and ""technically"" illegal. I have not met my neighbors, nor do I have the opportunity due to my schedule. My mother will come for the day before/of/after surgery as I get sick when I get put under and she can get the time off, but after that I'm on my own. 

* I can order groceries and have them delivered and just consider it the cost for stupidly breaking my foot, but I can't get them up my stairs because I can't put any weight on my foot. Any ideas on how to get bags of groceries up the stairs when I can only crawl? 
* Same concern with packages; as much as I hate using Amazon right now I'm relying on them to get me the necessary non-grocery/specialty stuff at my doorstep. Cat litter is currently the biggest dilemma, even in a small pack I can't just put it in a backpack to wear and crawl up, I'd tip over and roll down the stairs. 
* The recovery time is about 8 weeks. In that time, I'll have to do laundry, clean my place, take the trash to the complex dumpster, all the usual stuff I took for granted when I was able. Any pro-tips on how to do activities of daily living?
* I can't put any weight on the foot; so I can use crutches to get to and from my car, I have a scooter in my car I get out so I can move around school/work that I kneel on.  I have a wheely walker thing I put my knee on to get around my house, but does anyone have any suggestions on how to get around easier? 
* Recipes, easy ways to feed me? I cannot tolerate gluten or lactose, am mostly plant-based and unprocessed just due to ease of what is in the food and fast food that doesn't have either often makes me sick so most frozen and prepared meals are out. I'm used to meal-prepping a week in advance but I haven't had the time, energy or ingredients since the break. Honestly, I've sunk into a depression about this which is also kicking my butt.

488,"Even though I'm outgoing and talkative, I feel like most of my friendships are fairly casual. I don't ever really talk about myself, my feelings, my struggles - even with people I've been friends with a long time. What's the best way to start being vulnerable and open with people, and finding people who I can confide in?

I think I'm fairly guarded about my emotions - most of my immediate family is. I've only ever had one person who I would consider a confidant, and that relationship has sort of atrophied since we moved to different places. I can talk for hours about philosophy, religion, mythology and a number of other topics I have a passing interest in, but I find it hard to talk about things that bother me, things I struggle with, etc.

For example, I've been struggling with procrastination at work. I semi-recently got a ADHD coach, and began taking medication for the first time - but I haven't really talked about it with any of my friends. I'm not sure if I'm ""supposed to"", really.

489,"So I’m asking this question because today I think I slightly messed up. :( Anyway here’s the little story.. Keep in mind she’s 19, I’m 21. 

There’s been a girl at work for quite a while that’s been giving me a lot of across the room eye contact but we really never spoke. 

I know for a fact that she finds me pretty attractive (I know I look good) and I’m pretty sure I’ve been her ”workplace crush” for a while, and I think she knows I find her attractive too, given the amount of eye contact and I always find her working next to me etc. Even though we can work whereever we want. Anyway recently I’ve just been trying the ”dont give a f” attitude”, not in a rude way of course but I’m trying to get rid of my social anxiety which mostly comes from caring what people think of me. So I just talk and don’t really think everything through which has been working out quite good so far.

So I decided to talk to her today because why not? Turns out it was her last day at work and we talked quite a bit. I realized that she’s also a little awkward/shy but doesnt show it that much, just goes quiet mostly.

At the end of the day I sat down in the lunch room because I was pretty much done with everything. She enters the room and sits down in front of me and wants to talk to me. We have a little conversation and talk, lots of like really deep eye contact which was nice. Some awkward silences here and there, from both sides (sometimes I wouldnt know what to say, sometimes she went quiet, you get it) 

But I just can’t stop thinking about one thing, she told a story about her family already making christmas events on facebook when it’s not even halloween yet, and I got kind of lost in her eyes and said ”I dont really celebrate christmas” and as I said it I felt so stupid lol, then I continued, in a very hesitant and obviously awkward way ”I mean my family isnt that big so we dont celebrate that much” etc.. Then at one point I also said that christmas is my favourite season. Feeling like a f***ng dumbass as I’m writing this but that’s where I lost my confidence. My brain almost went blank, the ”not giving a f” attitude went away pretty quickly afterwards and the silences became more. 

After this my friend was also finished so we went all 3 together to the bus, it was OK. I realized I said some things in a weird way because I was overthinking everything I said, it was cool though. On the bus was probably the worst part because there was a lot of silence and thankfully my friend stepped in a bit to help. But I think we all knew it was a little awkward. We talked quite a lot just not consistently and I’m not sure if I was showing I was uncomfortable. 

So I’m 100% she thinks I’m awkward to some degree. I mean I talk pretty confidently except for some parts that sometimes get messed up when I’m nervous, I act really confident around everyone else though, I’m definitely not someone you would think is insecure. 

So my question is(if you’re female); If you talked to your ”crush” and it turns out he’s a little awkward, like I was, how would you react to it? Would you lose interest? What would you think? 

And what do you think, since she’s no longer working at my job, should I go for her?

(I’m actually thinking of DMing her on instagram in the following days. But is it worth it? In case she thinks I’m just awkward and doesn’t like me any more. I have nothing to lose, really, but I’m just trying to get a different perspective because there’s a great chance I’ll make a fool of myself.)

Thank you!",18Oct2019,7

492,"My SO and I moved across the country in August due to job relocation for him (I am also employed FT in our new state, but took around a $15k pay cut due to cost of living being cheaper here). We had a lot of moving expenses, as is pretty typical, and are still working on furnishing our new place because we didn't want to spend a lot of money at once. In addition to the move, I unfortunately got a few new medical bills to pay that are pretty pricey. Insurance helps a lot but the bills are still large.

The big problem: we're going back to our home state for Christmas. Plane tickets will run me about $500 or so. I'm worried because due to expenses here, I haven't been able to save money so far. I do have a pretty decent saving account, but I haven't really been able to add much of my paycheck to it (I work in education, so I make pennies). Presents are...well that's what I'm worried about. My parents, my sister, my SO and his family (_and_ our anniversary is right after Christmas...), and my closest friends.

Presents on top of the flight on top of the bills (and my best friend's birthday is coming up). Money has always stressed me out and now I just don't know what to do. If I tell anyone, the answer will always be, ""oh you don't have to get me anything,"" but isn't that just the polite thing to say? Especially when I know I'll be getting presents.

What can I do? I feel very stuck. I should note that aside from medical costs or things for the house, I don't spend any money on myself. We barely go out to eat, I don't buy anything unnecessary at the store...I basically pay rent, buy groceries, and gas for my car. I got money from family for my birthday but honestly...it's getting put towards rent, etc. ): I feel like I need to pick up another job. We don't live outside our means, I think it's just the timing of things- it's all happening within a few months.

493,"incase you can’t tell from this post, i am a 14 year old girl. yes, this is likely very petty, but it’s been bothering me a lot and i need to ask what to do. i basically only have two friends, one (who i’ll call milly) who has been my closest friend for over a year, and another (who i’ll call sarah) who has kind of joined me and milly after recent troubles with other friends. for a tiny bit of background, we all used to be part of a bigger group of about 6, but because of the argument sarah had with another person in this group, we ended splitting into two, to where we are now. 

at first this worked really well, and all three of us were happy with this. recently however, i have been feeling really shit about everything. it’s all the little things they do that are piling up that get to me. being around them feels like third wheeling, because of how much they seem to love each other’s company.  they always walk ahead of me, next to each other, and it takes special effort to walk with them and be included in conversation, and it almost seems like they make a special effort to get ahead so they don’t have to talk to me. milly changed sarah’s name on her phone to include loads of emojis and stuff, where as mine is just my name. they always text each other but it seems like they can’t even be bothered to open my texts sometimes. there are a few more things, but i think you get the point. i also might add that i’m a snowflake and i cry a lot.

 i started getting upset about it, and they asked what was up. i hate telling people what’s wrong, especially if i feel like the problem is in my head and will fix itself, so i told them no to worry. on this day, there was a fair in our town, and i was still a bit down about the whole thing. i tried to talk to them as we walked down to it, but they didn’t seem interested to talk to me. i walked behind them, with them ahead like it always is, and i started crying as i listened to music. they looked back a few times, but it felt like they were looking right through me, and they did that thing where people look at you, and you know that they are talking about you. they didn’t ask if i was okay, or even drop back to talk to me. the second i’m on my own, i start bawling my eyes out, and even though they could see i had been crying, they didn’t mention it. 

during the fair, they met up with someone they both know, but i don’t. they walked together in a three up ahead, and i just kinda wandered behind again.

for the next few days at school, i couldn’t control
my emotions at all. i was basically crying for four days straight. i broke down crying in one of our lessons after they moved away from the table where we normally sit together. in all fairness, sarah was close to having a panic attack, so moved away because of that, but that made my stupid insecure brain decide to let all my tears flood down my face. they kept looking at me throughout the lesson, while i was crying, albeit not very hard, and only came over when i had to leave the class from sobbing. i told milly what had been bothering me, and she told me that they didn’t mean to upset me etc. i spoke to sarah about it a bit later, who explained they had only been putting in the extra distance between us because they didn’t want to have their day ruined at the fair since i was upset and hadn’t told them what was wrong. i feel really guilty about ruining their day, and likely everyday since. 

after this, nothing changed. they still do everything they did before and still seem to ignore the fact that i’m crying at pretty much any given point during the day. i walk around school with tears in my eyes, and have stopped bothering to hide it at this point. i realise that i’m incredibly insecure, and the idea of losing milly as my best friend scares me so much that i’m trying to throw blame around for why it’s happening. i understand that this is my fault for getting so petty about it, and not being able to deal with the fact that they get on better than i do with either of them, but i am really starting to struggle. i have been having a lot of anxiety since this started, and i’m struggling to keep it under control. i have been feeling sick, have had a headache and stingy eyes pretty much constantly from my crying. they are basically my only friends, and i’m so incredibly scared to lose them, and i feel like i’m only making things worse by getting upset, since they clearly don’t want to deal with me. what do i do? i’m at a loss. i’ve tried talking to them, i’ve tried putting in more effort, i’ve tried being more positive, but none of it works. have i lost milly in terms of her being my closest friend? is there anything i can do to fix this? sorry for this long stupid post, but thank you for reading it, and any advice is greatly appreciated.",18Oct2019,6

I don't know why I do it, but I often read stories of fellow people whose partners have cheated on them and how they've caught them etc. and it makes me even more paranoid and I don't know why I keep doing it to myself because I am really scared to get into relationships to the point I want to stay alone forever rather than be hurt like that ever again. The possibility of having a partner who'll cheat on you is so high and you'll never know if your current S/O is faithful or not. The worst thing is though that often cheaters do it for no apparent reason, even when the communication is great, the relationship is perfect and you spend time together often they may still cheat. Some people are just not good with monogamy, maybe they find thrill in cheating and don't care about their partners feelings, hell maybe they even like to hurt people like that! She may love you for 5 years and all will be great, one day she'll be out and see someone prettier than you and just go and fuck him. This society is fucked, I am scared to love and trust.

Everyone has to work these schedules and I agreed to this after taking the time to think things through..now it is partially difficult because I live in Central Time and the job is in eastern time (I live right on the border of the timezones) and I decided that it was doable. Hard but not impossible to work these hours. I wake up at 5am central time and make the 45 minute commute so I can be there by 730 promptly. 

Today I noticed a change in my schedule that it wasn't one of those previously noted shifts. I was told it was a maintenance shift which required me to be there 30 minutes earlier than everyone else. I have that shift twice next week, then for a whole two weeks in the start of December. This would require me to wake up at 4 instead of 5 to make it to work on time cutting down on my 6 hours of sleep to only 5. I asked my manager if he would be willing to make an exception (was not expecting a yes, this was just to have it out there that I asked and this is a problem) and his response was as expected ""everyone else makes it on time, I don't see why you can't.""

I am contemplating going to HR and asking about a workplace accomodation that is supported by doctor's orders that my sleep should not drop less than 6 hours, because the continued decrease in sleep will start to cause stress on me and the baby.

Around 5 years ago I met him in a game of halo on Xbox and we became really good friends for our love for Xbox. I was shy at first but he helped boost my confidence and we played as much as we could with each other.

My problem is that he is on his way to meet me tomorrow. I have never shown him my face as I’m self conscious and think negatively of myself. He use to beg me to show but I never did. We remained good friends for the whole 5 years despite him not knowing what I look like. He has sent me his face on several occasions without me asking.

How can I tell him I really don’t want to see him at this point in time?

Earlier he messaged me and said he was on his way to see and sent a picture of a plane. I confirmed he was going to me through his friend. His said it will all be okay and that it will be fine but I disagree. I told him I don’t want to see him in real life yet but he doesn’t care and said it’s too late and that’s he’s coming.

512,"So about 2 years ago I hit hard time and I couldn't afford to pay my rent and my girlfriend's parents said that I could move in with them. At first it was great, they really liked my company and were super welcoming but I feel recently I cant do anything without them getting angry with me. My girlfriend wants to move out but I always say its not a good idea because its so much cheaper living with her parents and they cook for us, look after the kids etc it just saves me a lot of time as Im a manager and work long hours.   


Last night I came home and her mum made a pasta for dinner and it was on the stove in what I thought was a kind of 'help yourself' sort ot of way. Im dieting at the moment so I didnt want the pasta so just picked out the sausages that were in there and had them to myself. About an hour later she called us down for dinner and I said Id already eaten the sausages that were in the pasta and she flipped. She started saying how selfish I was etc even though I said id cook some more sausage and add it back into the pasta. I was furious and stormed out. I know it sounds petty but she just freaks out over small stuff like this all the time.   


Her dad is quite laid back usually and me and him have a sort of 'what's yours is mine' sort of agreement. And last week I went fishing with my friends and used a few of his rods. I didn't think he had much planned as my wife was working so I assumed hed be looking after our kids. Where I was fishing I had no signal and when i got service back i had 14 missed calls, it was her dad \*sigh\* i called him back and he was furious as he found out I took his rods and he had plans to go fishing that day too. But he literally never said any of this to me and he was annoyed that he had to look after the kids. I felt that it was complete over reaction and that they are just picking on me now.   


I do want to move out a bit but I have managed to save so much money since moving in with them and dont want to have to pay someone a lot of money when I can just live rent free but I feel like its getting to that point now.

516,"Full disclosure: I am not a doctor, nor any kind of expert on mental health/disabilities.

Some things are obvious. If someone regularly coughs up blood, you do not need to be a doctor to recognize this person probably has a medical condition of some kind. My friend's situation is not *that* clear, but enough has happened to make me seriously think he might have some kind of disability.

I have only really hung out with him in a group of people.

I am fully aware that being a little socially awkward is not the same as being disabled. I am very awkward myself sometimes. Having known this guy for a year though, so many things stand out as hallmarks of his personality, that I don't know if he can help it.

First, he has a really hard time picking up on social cues. I'll give one example. We were in line once to get food and he kept talking to this girl standing next to him. She was giving one word answers, she wasn't making eye contact, and eventually even made a phone call which was obviously intended to divert this guy away. He did not pick up on any of these cues.

Second, knowing what's appropriate and not appropriate to share. We were once talking about prom, and he thought this was a great time to talk about his bondage and dominance fetish. It was uncomfortable for the rest of us. I am usually open to hearing about most things, but this guy's sex life is not one of them.

Third, comprehension. He has a hard time understanding what people say. In a group of people, one of us might make a statement, and he will respond with something totally different. Tied to this, he tends to ramble, for long periods of time, without realizing that no one is following what he's saying.

This stuff used to be really frustrating for me, but now that I don't think this is his fault, I don't think it's fair to be frustrated. But I also don't know what to do. Hanging out with him is something I wouldn't mind doing from time to time for the purpose of ""I'll hang out with you so you're not alone."" But I also think he makes a lot of distractions when he's in the group. I won't say I'm frustrated by him, but when we're talking about prom, I want to talk about prom. Everyone else in the friend group does too.

I also know that he comes from a broken home, his parents are on bad terms with each other, and he has one sister who doesn't have time to talk to him. Maybe the guy just never learned the basic social skills? But a lot of this is stuff you shouldn't need to learn. No one ever sat me down and said ""when you're hanging out with people, don't randomly start talking about your sexual fetishes."" That's something most people are kind of just figure by themselves.",18Oct2019,1
517,"Hello all, I am a 23 year old college graduate who lives at home in Texas with my parents, they love the fact that I’m at home and I have no pressure to leave.

518,"Hey! I need some advice. 

I just converted to Islam recently. Since the Islamic faith calls for praying five times a day, my teachers will need to know that I'm Muslim. How can I tell them so that it's chill and there's not gonna be much of a reaction? I don't really want my teachers to have a reason to call me out (like: ""Hey (me), you can go pray now) even though that most likely won't happen. Also, how can I start telling more of my friends? They're going to need to know eventually.

And before any of y'all say ""talk it over with your family"" or something similar to that, I'd like you to know that my family is unsupportive of other religions (even though they do maintain respect for those religions, they don't like them/link them to extremists' actions). My family is NOT an option.

Quick side story: My sister got an application letter from some sort of university in Oregon. My mom freaked out saying ""if you were good academically then these stupid LIBERAL ARTS colleges wouldn't be talking to you!"" and it went out of control. She furthermore criticized my sister's choice of speech and debate category. She claimed that ""people who perform that piece don't go to college and end up begging on the streets"".

519,"(reposted from r/relationship_advice ) 

To preface this I am NOT mad at my partner. I am not upset at him or anything like that. We had been engaged for almost three years and our relationship was very health and happy. We had our struggles due to both fighting mental illnesses but we had a big fight and now he needs space. But he’s living with the person who possibly assaulted me and he knows this. He is trying to make his peace with it but does not forgive said person. But it’s hard not to feel that way when they’re literally living together. 

Our friend had been in an abusive relationship and we had tried to help once or twice to intervene but it never worked. Said friend would always talk about how deprived he was sexually and voiced that he was interested in doing sexual stuff with me and my partner constantly. Not romantically but purely sexual. At the time, we were okay with this but me and my partner always agreed we wanted to be there together and weren’t comfy with doing things like that without each other there. We both upheld that, until I was pressured and low key guilted into committing a sexual act after my partner left for work. I was constantly told about these desires to do sexual things with JUST me and not my partner present. In person when we were alone, through text, it was constant for a few months. 

The entire time I just put on a video and just tried not to cry. I did things with one hand and the other held my phone, and I honestly disassociated the entire time it was happening. I could feel my body just go numb. Our friend was enjoying it and even tried to touch me, but I clearly said “please no” and “it’s fine” every time he tried to get touch me. I remember feeling sad. And angry. And hurt. I remember when it was done I washed my hands and cried in the bathroom. Said friend took me home and texted me that he touched himself the entire way home thinking about it. It made me uncomfortable but the only thing I could think to do was laugh so I sent a “lmaooo” and spent the rest of the day processing what happened. As soon as I felt okay, I told my partner. He was furious and broken at first about it but not at me, at our friend. They didn’t speak for weeks. He was very supportive of me and never made me feel guilty or like it was my fault. The fight we had was about other circumstances, but he still is living with the friend that disrespected not only me but him. He says he has nowhere else but needs space. 

I want to give him that space, but I won’t lie and say it’s heartbreaking to have the love of my life staying with the person who hurt me like that. I’ve been trying to say that but my partner says he’s made his peace with it and is trying to move on and heal. But the effects of that situation still leave me broken and having panic attacks almost every day. 

We talked a lot and said we wanna call this a break and slowly try to start over. We want to work on ourselves but he wants to take things very slow and not set any goals. I want to set goals, but we’re trying to find compromises and it’s working okay so far. 

I don’t really even know if what happened is by definition assault, but I did not enjoy the situation and did not want to be touched. I was pressured to do something outside of my boundaries. It has ruined my self confidence and mental health. I have made therapy appointments and doctors appointments and I’m trying my best on my end not to get so upset over it. It’s making it hard to work and to go outside because I feel like everyone can see what I’ve done and how I’ve ruined the best relationship that’s ever happened to me. 

Is there a way we can give space without him being in the same house as the person who did this to me? Is there something I can do in the meantime to not feel so guilty about what happened to me? Was it even assault? Or how can I help my partner understand how terrifying it is to have him staying with said person? 

note: my partner has untreated DID and that’s the main thing he’s worried about and scared about. i 100% support him because it’s a big change for him. he’s planning to go to therapy for his DID here soon once benefits roll in

I did not say no. I was afraid to. I was quiet the whole time and shaking. It seems that apparently because of that it’s my fault (from comments on other subs) but my partner never has made me feel like I cheated or did anything wrong because of how the situation happened.",18Oct2019,1

I’ve been living with him, basically, out in the country, and he’s confronted me with a request of more time alone with his family now, at the real request of his mother. His mother loves me. but, I understand, and I’ve only been here on his request for no alone time to help with his brothers loss. My problem that arises, is that I have nowhere to go where I can receive help after my car crash injuries, and no vehicle to be helped with.

I know I am smart and if I was really on top of my shit I could get straight A's but for some reason working has been hard for me ever since a big move. I often get sad and use sleep as a coping mechanism and it's a never ending cycle. What makes it worse is that I have a twin sister who is essentially the version of myself I wish I was with a 3.9 gpa.

I was supposed to apply to this scholarship, Questbridge, and it was my one shot as a low income average student to apply to a bunch of prestigious schools. I even told some of my friends about it. But just like me, I ruined it for myself. I missed both the deadline and extension. My parents want me so badly to go to one of these schools but I feel like I've thrown it away. I don't have the gpa for it either way (3.6) but at least then I would've done something good for myself. 

Then today, I was supposed to catch up on my classes and come into school to give my teacher some late work to turn one of those C's into a B. No kids are at school because it's a teacher work day for teachers to finish grading and this teacher said as long as I came around 9 or 10 he would give me half credit. I ended up getting there at 10:45 because my mother had to take me and she was slow out of the house and it appeared he had already left. 

Along with other things like leadership in my music extracurriculars not going how I wanted them to. I feel like such a failure. I feel like I know where I should be, (essentially where my twin sister is) but I feel like I have dug myself in a hole and I don't know how to climb out. I only know how to dig deeper, apparently.

523,"Ive been working at my current job for about 9 months now. Ive made some good friendships; new people routinely show up. Most leave soon, but some stay and eventually they make friends with groups at work and alls well. However, this new guy shows up about 3 weeks ago. I trained him, and for the most part he seems normal-ish, like the rest of us. He has a few quirks and a couple are sorta annoying. He air guitars and seems to sorta quietly sing some death metal or screamo shit in public. For example, we are at break, having polite discussion, then you here it, slowly building up in volume as he enters the room  ""rrrrraaaauuuuuUUUAUUUUAUUUAAAAAAHHHH!!!"". And suddenly the quiet atmosphere of the room is broken, and it sounds like someone is summoning the demons of selzar in the breakroom. This guy, we've taken to calling ""Crackhead Keanu"" cause thats a rather apt discriptor, isnt a bad guy, hes nice-ish, if a bit clingy, but hes also rather strange at times and creeps us out. He invites himself to after work events, which we hadnt invited him to, because we didnt know him well enough yet. Hes taken stuff without asking, nothing big, but you should ask before helping yourself to a persons during work snack, like the rest of us. And hes constantly up our asses or invading our personal space. 

TL;DR : To sum it up, how do we tell a person with poor social skills, with a rather interesting personality, that hes barking up the wrong tree, and that we cannot appreciate him, in the way hes looking for because we think hes going to drug us and sell our kidneys?

529,"Hi,

Bit of background:

I've been in my current job for around 3 months and have noticed a culture of gossiping, backstabbing and general two-facedness. It's like nothing I've experienced in work before! 

I seem to have this one particular person who was once friendly with me and I know that she talks about other people negatively all of the time. But, an incident has now happened where she no longer speaks with me unless necessary. I have also caught her talking negatively about me and have on one occasion been told that she has said things about me. I am male; if that even make a difference but thought I'd mention it.

Now; I am pretty laid back and let most things go over my head. One flaw I do have is that I have severe anxiety about speaking my mind, opinions and thoughts. Even to my family and partner. I tend to just agree with everything and cannot confront people at all.

Today at work, our boss walked past us, a group of around 8 workers, and I he waved so I waved back. One co-worker jokingly called me a 'bum licker'. As in, I am sucking up to the boss. The person mentioned above shouted ""well there's one on every shift!"" and smiled. 

I knew this was a dig at me but said nothing. In fact, I still don't know how I would have dealt with that situation to be honest. And this is my question. Yes; I know it seems very minor, but I know this person is talking about me behind my back and yes again; who cares right?! Let them. But there comes a time where I cannot take anymore crap off people and I need to stand up for myself.

What should I have done? How should I have responded to her?

But today she's just down... she told me she feels fucking depressed and I already run out of words to say to try to cheer her up.

545,"(Sorry about formatting, on mobile)

I know, I sound like a total idiot. But my friend’s mother just passed away and I’m trying to help her out so she’s able to arrange things and process everything without having to worry about some of the everyday things.

When I reached out, she asked if I could walk her dog while she’s out going through her mother’s things. Of course I said yes.

But the thing is, I’ve never had a dog. I’ve been around dogs and hung out with my friends while they walked theirs, but I’ve only really had the responsibility of letting dogs out to quickly to pee while babysitting.

I walked her dog (say, Betty) yesterday, but I kept feeling like I was doing things wrong. Maybe I’m just anxious because I really do like this pup and I’m scared I’m going to hurt her somehow. It also doesn’t help that Betty is a new puppy and is just starting to take to commands. I’m sure I looked like a fool, her legs kept getting tangled up in her leash, I accidentally went by some construction and I suddenly got nervous some debris (just little rock’s but still, ow) would get lodged in her paws. So then I carried her, but I was worried I was holding her uncomfortably, but she didn’t yelp or squirm.

So basically if anyone could help me out with:

-how to pick up dogs
-how long should I let her leash be
-how can I reenforce/be consistent with basic training (most of it was from a “puppy hotel” while my friend was on vacation. I don’t feel like asking a bunch of these questions to my friend would be appropriate right now)
-do you normally have dogs sit to wait at crosswalks
-how do I redirect her without tugging the leash painfully (it’s a standard leash and collar)
-how do you give non-food positive reinforcement
-anything else you can think of

Betty is a retriever/poodle mix if that means anything",18Oct2019,1

558,"I don’t even know how to describe this to you, but today my mother said something that deeply hurt me. Perhaps she didn’t mean to, but it made me break down crying afterwards. She said that I need a jaw surgery, because it would dramatically change my facial features. 

Now why exactly this caused me to break down? Because two months ago I had a very beautiful girlfriend, who had previously rejected me, but I started working out, gained a lot of confidence and went from a skinny boy to a relatively nicely built dude. The stars aligned in such a way that it allowed us to meet once again, and her opinion changed about me. We dated for a 3 months and it was the greatest time of my life. We had so many intimate moments, it was amazing spending time with her.

It seemed that my life had changed, I went from a skinny, self-conscious loser to feeling like I’m on the top of the world. But then something happened. One day when we were hanging out in my car in the middle of the night, cuddled up, she told me that perhaps if I would look nice if I had a few surgeries done on my face. This obviously upset me, but I didn’t react too much - after all, she’s my girlfriend and she loves me, that’s all that matters, right? But apparently this was just the beginning. She told me a month later that she doesn’t love me anymore and the intimate moments that we shared together - it would never happen again. She also later explained to me that she was intentionally trying to get in an argument with me so she could abandon the relationship. 

This absolutely devastated me. I lost all my self-confidence, stopped feeling handsome, and I’m even afraid looking at myself in the mirror anymore. Life was an absolute hell for me. 

A few months later, I was slowly recovering from the breakup. Now I should mention that my mom had no idea about the relationship I had with this girl. We used to secretly meet while everyone was asleep in the middle of the night. But today my mom told me exactly that. I didn’t prompt her, I hadn’t mentioned anything to her. She was just looking at me and told me in a very casual manner - you would benefit from a jaw surgery.  

I never thought there was anything wrong with me, but these past experiences that I had caused me to become extremely depressed and lose all my confidence. I don’t know how to deal with this anymore, because the emotional impact this had on me is simply unbearable. Everyday I am overthinking about the way I look, something I never really cared about too much. Please help me escape my emotional prison.",18Oct2019,1

In my culture, I'm expected to finish my schooling, get a ""good"" job, and lift some of the burden off my parents. But I was very suicidal at the time, and I was scared I would finally go through with it. I decided that for the sake of my safety, I had to pull out and seek help.

He looked well-groomed and was wearing a fairly chic outfit but still stunk (sorry). He clearly wasn’t mentally there. He seemed very lonely and lost and dealing with some psychological problems. Also, he then pulled out a Chantré bottle, and as an a*dict myself I know this is the cheapest way to get drunk in Germany, and he chugged it down. What could I have done? I just went about my day.

So my other cat refused to eat his food. We figured it's because he doesn't like the brand or red meat. When my other cat finished her bowl, she ate 90% of the other food and was fine all evening. My parents said it would be fine when I remembered there was another dose of cystease in it.

They also forgot to tell me she didn't eat her breakfast at all. She's been lying around all day and has been very quiet and lethargic. This is unusual. She even refused to eat the food we put down for her dinner and went back to her spot under the bed. 

I'm worried she's overdosed on the meds and it's my fault for not taking the food away. She was at the vet 2 weeks ago for cystitis but everything else about her was fine.

It seems to me like the universe is playing some shitty no punchline joke on me. I got the short straw with my genetics.

I served in the army for 3 years and showered with countless of dudes my age. I can safely say those are concrete physical flaws that put me at a clear disadvantage in some facets of life, and that spills directly into all of them. I never really tried putting any reason behind why I am the way I am, but after meditating on it I figured it these might be the culprit: My parent's divorce at the age of 4, my father being absent half my childhood, my mom's shitty ex-boyfriend, bullying in school, my body and general lack of loving relationships left me a mental illness ridden lifeless husk. When I do feel some emotion I'm incapable of showing it. In social situations I feel like I'm acting out characters I've seen in movies. People say that I'm either hilarious(defense mechanism) or a robot, and they have no way of 'reading me'. China wishes it could put up walls as high as I do.

580,"My fiancee is going to her friend's bachelorette party next weekend and she told me there will be a strip show. My fiancee told me that she will not attend that specific event but I am still really bothered. 

There have been several instances in her friendship with a few of the girls that have thrown huge red flags. Her friends all all engaged too. A year ago they went on a trip together and apparently the first thing the girls did were take off their engagement rings when they went out. My fiancee says she didn't do this but went out with them anyway. Apparently on the trip her friend met a guy that she could not stop talking about afterward - about how cute he was but its too bad she cant have him. She even went so far as to take 'couple' pictures with him and get his number. She never told the dude she was engaged. This was really troubling because I don't think her man has any idea about this and she just talked about it as though it were no big deal. My fiancee was apathetic about the whole ordeal as well.

I may be just being paranoid but I am genuinely disturbed that she considers women that behave like this to be her good friends. They are not respectful of boundaries and I fear they will peer pressure my fiancee into going with them regardless. I don't want to be controlling and tell my fiancee I don't want her to go, but I'm not sure how to handle this in the most respectful way.

In addition, I do not think the other girls' SO's have any idea about whats going to happen at this party. Should I message them and let them know or mind my own business? I've heard so many stories about how most women cheat at these sort of things - even the bride to be! My thought is that if one of those guys knew about the strip party and I didn't, I would appreciate one of them telling me.

Now, this specific peer has moderate-to-severely invasive learning disabilities and has been placed with several special ed teachers and at one point in time there was a whole instagram page made by student council members mocking them for how “odd” they acted. 

I didn’t say anything because I knew they didn’t know any better and was intending to ask an adult what they thought, but then this peer made a separate group chat and added everyone in the social group chat into that group chat for the “fun debate.” 

Then another person who does the activity, who I’m not on particularly good terms with, sent a whole long paragraph in the social group chat and basically said that they 

1) shouldn’t have added everyone to a separate groupchat
2) were being ableist with the debate topic 

I thought by sending this in the groupchat, they were being disrespectful instead of sending it in private or asking the activity’s facilitator about it.

591,"I posted this on AITA a week or so ago, and it was deleted due to their rules about abuse. 

But the gist of it is this: I was abused by a relative when I was younger and never told anyone. Years later, this same person assaulted me when I was sleeping. I woke up in the middle of it and literally ran for help (Other relatives were outside having drinks). I told my mother about it and she basically blamed it on him being drunk.  Her words were ""I told him he needs to stop drinking"". After that conversation I told my mother and everyone who knew about it  that he was basically dead to me. I don't want him around and I don't wanna hear his name.

So a few weeks ago, my mother tells me she's letting him move in with her because he has no where to go. (he's a perpetual fuck up and everyone has always babied him or felt bad for him. When he's not in jail, he's living off of a relative or some poor girl he impregnated). Me and my siblings have all left and my mom is recently divorced, so it's just her rn. I haven't spoken to her since she told me that.

 When I first had the conversation with her, I was just pissed. Even without knowing about the childhood abuse, I told you what he did to me recently and you still think it's okay to not only maintain a relationship with him, but to move him in your home? And still expect me to come visit? Ha! I was honestly just planning on shutting down and never speaking to her again. 

But now that I'm able to think more clearly, I don't know. That's my mom, you know? As much as I am hurt by this, I know that she isn't trying to be malicious in doing this. She just wants to help, because that's how she is. My mom has always been the type to give someone a space to lay, whether it was relatives, friends of me and my siblings, ect. She'd invite someone off the street in for a shower and something to eat. So I know that part of her just wants to help out our relative. But I just don't understand why she never thought about how I would feel or how it would affect me? 

I just don't know how to handle this. I avoid talking about anything heavy and I don't like being emotional or vulnerable in front of people. It's the reason I never told anyone what happened as a kid. But when I told my mom about what happened recently, I felt like it was such a big step. Like a weight off my shoulders to actually say ""____ did something to me"". And even when she blamed it on the drinking, I still felt like ""At least I said something"" because it took so much for me to speak and I was honestly proud of myself.

And I know a part of this is on me. I'm the one who doesn't cry or get emotional and doesn't let things affect them. So maybe that's why she thinks I'm over it already or wouldn't be upset. But I am. I'm really fucked up about it.

I guess I just need advice on how to have this conversation. Which may be a dumb thing to ask. But I don't talk to anyone about anything remotely serious. I'm the one who is the shoulder, who gives great advice and loves to help people sort their shit out. But I process and deal with my own emotions by myself. I have almost never had a conversation this serious and I genuinely don't even know how to approach her about this.",18Oct2019,0

594,"So to give some background I’ve been friends with this guy since I started collage. He’s always been a little sexual when it comes to women and even went so far as to undermine people relationships to get some. He seemed fairly nice at first so I wasn’t fully aware of the extent of his issue to recently. 

Not that long ago he tried to convince me he was the son of the the devil, and that he was possessed by the devil. He claimed in-order to feed the devil he needed to absorb people’s energy through sex. He also said if he didn’t have sex he was going to die. 

After this incident I didn’t feel safe talking to him directly since I’ve lived with and around people mental illness pretty much my whole life so I know how scary delusional people can be. I contacted out local behavior health facility at the advise of a therapist, tracked down some others whom heard him say similar things, and reached out to his family. His family was furious, they acted like I took the decision from them or something when all I did was ask for a wellness check and report the incident. I was rather furious at the time that they cared so little about the fact he was delusional and a huge risk to others. Using that to persuade someone to have sex is considered rape even if they say yes here because you’re threatening your own life, so even if he was lying to get laid and not actually delusional. He could end up in serious trouble if someone called the cops instead. I was rather furious with his family for taking this so lightly rather than acting on it so I’ve been keeping my distance. 

Recently he told me he started getting help and we started speaking again however after hanging out with him. I found out that he’s been lying to his family. Basically because I contacted others about what he did, I guess they don’t want me or anyone reporting to the police. He also told me he lied about what happened because he didn’t want to be under “lock and key” 

I’m not sure if I feel safe around this individual anymore but I do want to get him help?

599,"TLDR; ""close"" friend belittles me, esp. in front of my friends and bf, trying to seem more cool. Frames it as jokes. Can't cut her - tightknit friend circle, people will feel I'm overreacting. Need a way to show more dominance in conversation. What can I say / do to achieve this??

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a friend, who is part of a very tight friend circle I've had since high school. Every time I come back to my town (I moved away years ago), I always meet up with them. Everyone knows and is friends with everyone. I love everyone in it; even though we grew apart over the years, I still care deeply for them.

HOWEVER. One girl is quite intense, and tries to dominate the conversation in our group (has been the case since HS, so people are used to it and let it slide). And since she would often make hurtful remarks towards me in HS, I grew a thick skin, rolled with it, and decided to be the group clown (and roast myself before she could get to me). She would push boundaries more, mainly in front of others, presumably to appear ""edgy"". She acts very differently with people who either dgaf about her existence, or are generally more ""alpha-ish"". 

Coming back home these days, and being in my 30's, I now see how toxic this dynamic is, and need to bring it to a halt. She still tries hard to put me down in front of others (maybe even subconsciously), and makes belittling remarks. When I introduced my bf, she exclaimed to the group that ""she's SOOO happy I at least brought him, cos she reeeeally didn't wanna come out to see me"" (in 2 years?!) cos it was raining outside, but she was excited to meet him. She said this 3 times now, and every time my bf felt really uncomfortable, telling me he feels it's not right, even as a joke. I didn't notice until he mentioned it.  I'm that used to it. But it's true. What bf-stealing hog would make these comments?? 

Anyways, here's the deal: I can't just cut her. I mean, sure, I can try, but she is (unfortunately) an integral part of our friend circle, and my best friend in it is actually her best friend. They are tight. My bff knows how I used to feel about her in HS, but these days I feel I have no real right to cut her considering I haven't been around, and THEY keep the friend circle going. So my question to you lovely chaps is: how can I let her know I think what she's saying is unacceptable to me?

But here's the catch: I want some slightly unconventional advice. Not the typical: ""just talk to her"" (f that) or ""just talk to your bff, she'll understand"" (true, but doesn't resolve OUR dynamic with the witchlady) or ""cut her"" (that's what I'm going to do anyway, but she will ALWAYS be there at parties and group gatherings, etc. What can I say that that ISN'T along the lines of ""that's rude / inapropriate"", cos I don't want to give her the power of knowing that in any way influenced me. I want her to know she is nothing, she's insignificant, her opinions don't matter. Any psychological tricks or words of wisdom? Thanks so much in advance!

602,"Hi

I'm from Canada and don't quite understand US laws but that might be making this more confusing for me. 

So through my Uni I was sent to NY as an exchange program and I get credit for my internship and I take two classes. Anyways, my first internship didn't work out: I was very honest with my school about what was going on, how it wasn't a good fit, and how I wanted to change sites because I was paying a lot of money to be in NY and be doing the internship. There were labor law issues and they weren't treating me fairly. I was advised to ask them to change their behavior and see if they change, but I didn't want to stay there since I was running out of time to find a new position. I told my work I was having issues, suggested what I would like to do, and talk to my school if there were any high-level things that needed to be done. In this time, I found another internship at a much better place that is aligned with my values. They did change a bit but not enough to make me want to stay, as I am paying to be an unpaid intern. 

I went to leave my other job and they wouldn't take the time to talk to me when I asked and I ended up asking to start in the upcoming week, giving me less than two weeks to notify my unpaid internship site. I told them as soon as I could and they didn't take it well, insisting I stay longer because they depended on my help. Whatever. It didn't make sense to me to give them 3 more weeks of time when I wasn't learning much and I had committed somewhere else.

My director then contacts me (after speaking to my boss) and accuses me of giving my uni back in Canada a bad name, how I am unprofessional, being dishonest to her and my boss, and lying about what the issues were (that there weren't issues and I just didn't like my job). It was very heated but I replied with a very honest and heated email about how that is simply not accurate. Stressor here is that I'm afraid my previous boss is going to be completely dishonest in her grading of my work at their site--I was a very good intern. 

My new problem is that HR at the new site contacted me saying they need two more weeks. I would have to complete forms and training one day before I start, but its two more weeks. I am really worried about telling my director this because it is unfair to other students who are working--but until last night, I thought I was working on Monday morning at my new site. It is going to be worse to not tell her, but I am really afraid she is going to pull me from the program and fail me this semester. I'm also pretty stressed that HR is taking so long and the potential it could fall through, meaning I wouldn't have an internship. I confidently left my last one because I had a start date, but now I'm worried about failing.

I don't know how to approach my school now that they have accused me of lying, ruining their reputation, and calling me unprofessional. Being transparent is the best approach, but after I put my semester director back in place after she accused me of such things, I feel like she might retaliate and either pull me from the program (due to me not working for two weeks) or reflect it in my internship grade.  

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: by trying to manage my academic semester in NY, I somehow ended up in a very messy situation that could result in me failing. I am afraid to be honest with my director after being accused falsely and I don't know how to handle the mess.",18Oct2019,2

605,"Hi. This is super specific so let me just spell it all out.

When I was 15 (currently 24), I began my first sexual relationship with a guy a couple years older than me. There’s a lot of details I won’t go into, but he was borderline verbally/emotionally abusive to me. He said really terrible things to me and made me feel like a purely sexual object.  I ended it when he had sex with my best friend.

I was doing food deliveries recently, and happened to deliver to this guy. It was the first time I’d seen him since I was 16. I was absolutely freaked out. We locked eyes and I said “enjoy your food!” and got out of there. I felt sick to my stomach the whole rest of the day, and I couldn’t get him out of my head. Then, to top it off, I delivered to him AGAIN a few days later. This time, I knew it was him and I managed to ask him if he remembered me. All he said was “yeah, from high school, right?” I said “sure.” And left. 

I keep remembering things he’d done or said to me, how he made me feel. But I think the worst thing is that I can’t stop hoping he still thinks I’m pretty and fuckable. Like I’m a 24-year old, college-educated woman who is in a healthy, happy long-term relationship, but all I can think about is if this asshole who used to fuck me when I was a kid would still find me attractive. I keep having fantasies where I jump his bones and cheat on my boyfriend (which I would never actually do).

606,"Long post ahead, sorry in advance but I'm hoping to find some solid direction here.

So I recently bought a new truck to replace my POS car. I decided to trade my car for a motorcycle via a guy who messaged me on Facebook. I'd been trying to sell my car for over a month and it was a trade a little in my favor so I agreed to go for it. We met in public and traded each other titles. I asked if it was notorized and ready to go and he gave a reassuring ""Yep! All good brother."" So (MISTAKE #1) I didn't look closely at the title, I simply kept it in the envelope after confirming it was indeed the title for the motorcycle.

Fast forward 1 week and a guy offers me cash for the bike so of course I jumped on it since I needed the cash more than the bike. The gentleman and I exchanged cash for the title in the envelope and the bike without looking over the title (MISTAKE #2) . All is well that ends well.

Not quite.

Fast forward another week and the guy who bought the bike gives me a call and tells me that he tried to transfer the title and it is in fact NOT NOTARIZED.

 (the title has been signed with intent to sell by the original owner, just no notary stamp) 

So I get a hold of the guy I got the bike from and he proceeds to tell me that HE DIDN'T LOOK AT THE TITLE EITHER AND WAS GOING OFF THE WORD OF THE GUY HE TRADED FROM. That's right, there's a 4th person involved now. I ask the guy I got the motorcycle from for the original owners name. I received ""look him up that's what I did"" and immediately my number was blocked and I was blocked on Facebook (this has me suspicious).

So now all I have is the original owners name and address. I've sent Facebook messages to to people with the same name just to see if it's him, I've called numbers associated with his name and address all to no avail. My last resort is going to the physical address in hopes that he is there. I intend to do this after work and attempt to get him in contact with the guy who now has the bike in his possession.

Is there anything else I can do to try and either get a hold of the original owner or get the title transferred? Can I get a notary to just stamp the thing since the title is signed for selling? This is my first time selling a car and holy shitvthis has not been a smooth process. Any and all advice is incredibly appreciated, I'm almost to the last of my options.


TL;DR - traded my car for a motorcycle, sold motorcycle, motorcycle title isn't notarized and can't transfer to new owner.

She thinks that everyone is out to get her and that people are hacking her phone because of graphical glitches it has and just normal iPhone bugs. She thinks there’s bugs in our house and that our WiFi is hacked by our neighbors. The other day she told me that a computer van showed up at their house and brought equipment in that hacked our WiFi. Today she had me take apart the smoke alarms in our house because she though there were bugs in them. She started to tell me that the speaker in the smoke alarm was giving us cancer because it has “EFM” on it. I tried explaining it to her and even pulled up a google page showing a similar one that says it’s just a buzzer. She tried telling me today as well that my friends dad installed a microphone in my car when he did some work on my car and that I shouldn’t trust them. Everyday it’s something new. Anytime I show some sort of doubt to what she says or try to explain to her that everything is normal she gets really mad at me and tells me I’m going to regret not believing her. I’m so depressed and am having suicidal thoughts. Everyday is like a new episode. She has caused us in the past to cut our relationship with our extended family. I love and miss them tons but she would be devastated if she knew this. She hates them. My brother won’t disagree with her like I will and tell her what he truly thinks even though he has agreed with me on my opinion that she’s going crazy.

Then two kids in class told me I would be a good lawyer. The problem is, I was considering being a lawyer then decided on engineering. I have always been good at math and science, but no one has ever told me I would be a good engineer. A bunch of people, however, have told me to be a lawyer, friends, peers, and family alike.

So now I’m considering applying to law schools, or undergraduate schools I can bounce off to go to law schools. It’s too late to ask different teachers to write me recommendation letters for early action (deadline is November 1st). For my engineering schools I asked science teachers, for this I would need to ask English and Social Studies teachers.

But that’s not an issue, just a small hiccup. The problem is, what if I get accepted to an undergraduate school?

I stopped eating, I dropped down to like 105 pounds (I was 125), I was going down whole pants sizes. They noticed my pants were smaller when we went school shopping, she talked about it, but they didn't even question it. I started to cut, there was blood all over my sleeves and hoodies and nothing was said. Finally I broke when I found out she told her friends about what happened with me and my ex and I ended up telling at her and coming clean about eating and hurting myself. She didn't seem to care though, she's determined I'm not sorry or upset about what happened and that I ""need to stop the.cutting shit"" or she was gonna send me to my grandmothers. 
I did start dating another guy, he makes sure I eat (I'm back to 124), sleep normal good times, and he always makes sure that I'm mentally okay. My mother still only sees the past and nothing has changed with her.

A few days ago I had a breakdown, talked to my friends, they reassured me and one of them offered to dye my hair after mentioning that I might just say f*ck it and get it done. After this I told my dad I wanted to dye my hair at some point (cough tomorrow cough), he didnt care and was pretty supportive, just wanted to know what colour.
But he did advise I dont tell my mum, and that I talk about it casually at some point with her...which I had already expected and I'm not sure how to tell her.

I'm planning on doing it through a text since face to face is a lot harder, she'll shut me down immediately and I won't get the chance to make my point of view heard.
In addition to this...I plan on texting her AFTER the hair has already been dyed.

I know, this seems really irresponsible and she will hate it, but I just figured she wont approve anyway. Whether I get my hair dyed or not, she will be annoyed, and if I give her the chance to stop me then she will.
I just think that having the ability to express who I am through my appearance is something worth taking the hit for. 

It's not all my hair, just the ends, and my college doesnt care at all about dyed hair- if anything they encourage us to express ourselves however we want. And the friend dying my hair has a ton of experience.

I understand that she'll likely take my phone once it's done, and that I'll be in trouble, but so much of my childhood and teen hears have already been restricted by her- it feels like my early years are wasting. I see my friends and other people my age go out all the time while I'm stuck at home. I want to go out with people and have fun and stuff but thanks to my parents I rarely get the opportunity. 
It's just hair. It wont kill me. It wont hurt anyone.

He lives on a side street and does not walk her on a leash and she doesn't have a collar on her either. Sometimes she will run out to bark but she always comes back.

This lady who lives nearby traps and neuters cats and rescues dogs, will rehabilitate them and find them owners and asks for donations to finance this. At the moment she is living with over 30 animals in her house. 

Yesterday she saw the Chihuahua running down the street. She knew whose dog it was but was frustrated that he doesn't walk her on a leash or have a collar on her, plus he doesn't have money nor a car so he doesn't take her to the vet; she says her nails are too long and her teeth are bad. So to teach him a lesson, she purposely took her on errands before returning her to his owner at which point she found him crying, and she berated him. He gave her $20 to thank her for ""finding"" her.  I found all of this out because she posted it on Instagram bragging about it. There are a lot of poor Cuban and Haitian communities nearby and she likes to post about how she is helping these animals despite her ignorant neighbors' objection, and will often tag her posts with derogatory remarks.

635,"**Context:**

Roommate and I have lived together for almost 3 years now and have been friends for over 5. I consider her one of my closest friends. She has been in a committed relationship for 2 years now. I just got out of a 6 year relationship with my girlfriend last month.

She's pretty much over at her boyfriend's place 5-6 nights a week and I totally support that. It's the phase in life she is currently in, no fault to her, and she should definitely be doing it. I'm not in a great headspace right now, our home is big, and most nights I'm just by myself in our place. Some people would definitely love this, but I've always considered my roommates to be like family and I'm also just not in a good emotional state right now. 

A few months back we had dinner and she had told me that she was planning to move to a different city.  Sucked to hear I would lose one of my closest friends, but I supported it. Initially, I would move out after she found a new job. (I was in no rush, was in a good headspace and loved living with her). Recently she has become more serious about finding a new job, and definitely wants to leave in the next 6 months. 

**Problem:**

I had dinner with her last week, told her what I was feeling and dealing with, just especially after the breakup and that it was no fault to her (she should be living as she sees fit), but I was thinking of moving in with 2-3 of our close friends who probably would be home more often. Our lease is over, and we are month to month now.  I told her I wouldn't move out anytime immediately, and that I would definitely give a heads up, and if she really didn't want me to move out, I could cope. I just didn't know if she was going to get a job in 2 months or maybe it would take 8 months. She was a bit upset and started acting flustered, ending our dinner early and saying she has to go find a new job since she doesn't know how her housing situation is going to be, and feels like she has to get a job ASAP.

Next day I casually reach out to a few places, they have viewings and I show up. I find a few pretty good places. I come up with the idea that maybe she can move in with me and our friends for a few months in this new place. I understand the difficulty of moving so I would offer to help move all her stuff as long as she just packed it. I would also own the lease so that if she were to find a new job in her new city, she could bounce on her own accord, and I'd find a new sublet. Thought it was a good balance of me being with more people, and her not feeling time pressure to get a job and having to deal with moving her stuff. 

I texted her that I wanted to talk about something, and we met up that night. I prefaced it with 'if you don't want to do it, we can totally drop it"", but gave her the suggestion. She was really upset, a bit defensive, and asked me what my expectations of a roommate were. I told her that I had no expectations of her as person, she 100% deserves to spend time with her boyfriend and that is of no fault, but I also have a right to be in situation that makes me feel comfortable. She said, ""pro-tip, just text me next time"". She said that me having this one on one conversation was making it awkward and uncomfortable for her. I apologized for making her feel like that, and that I only wanted to do it face to face because I genuinely considered it serious (something affecting my roommate and her timeline to move out), and it was my way of showing her respect and that I cared. 

Night ended, wrote her a note apologizing for making her feel uncomfortable, but it has been over a week and she is still being very cold and icy. Not honoring prior engagements we made, and at this point I'm just not sure what to do anymore. I just lost my best friend of 6 years and I can't imagine losing another person so close to me.",18Oct2019,1

I don’t particular enjoy the marketing field, nor do I really connect with my team. Leadership isn’t a quality my managers have and they are really just unpleasant to be around, especially since I am not developing professionally in a field I could see myself in. 

Recently, I have been thrown a lot of stuff my way and a little overwhelmed with work. I feel that I am not well respected around my team and that’s why they just “pile” busy work on me. Therefore I miss some stuff, resulting in my boss being frustrated. My boss really doesn’t work with me at all and never speaks to me unless they are in need of something done urgently. 

This week was the last straw when I was blamed and humiliated for something I am not even responsible for. But my boss “assumed” it was my duty.

642,"I’m 18f. The friend is 15m. For context, we are both white. We live in a rather segregated city. I never knew him to be racist. He always seems to treat people of color well in person. But a few weeks ago, we were discussing a crime that had taken place, and he kept saying, “I bet it was a black person who did it.” Not for any good reason, mind you. The crime happened in a white neighborhood, and the victim was white, so if I had to guess I think it’d be more reasonable to say the perpetrator was white. But my friend is so convinced “crime = black” that he jumped to that conclusion and wouldn’t budge in his conviction. I was appalled. 

This line of thinking would bother me coming from anyone, but it’s especially troubling from this friend given that his dream is to become a police officer. He’s a regular volunteer at local police station, and he’s talked about someday becoming a cop for as long as I can remember. I think the last thing this city needs is another racist police officer. Also, I can’t help but wonder if he learned these attitudes from the cops he works with, which would obviously add a whole new layer of problems here. I do believe most cops are good people, but c’mon, he has to have picked that up from somewhere, right?

Boss told me I was now promoted and I would see the changes in system on Monday.

He pushed the date by 2 months - “expect to see it change at the new fiscal year, oct 1.” Before oct 1 I asked if everything was prepared and he said yes. Oct 1 passes and nothing changes. He tells me it’s almost done and will be back-dated and back-paid to oct 1.

Now it turns out he is required to post a job opening internally and externally and leave it up for 30 days, interview other good candidates, and THEN he plans to pick me.

645,"So, I didn’t know where else to come, and I stumbled across this sub so I decided it was best suited here.

I’m a 16Y/O male, and I have genuinely fallen in love with a girl. We love the same music, have the same hobbies, she is such an amazing person. She is somebody I would happily spend the rest of my life with.

I’ve been told she feels the same way, every night she always tells me not to stay up too late, and we message until one of us falls asleep.

Whenever I see her I get such a warm fuzzy feeling inside, and yeah, I’m not really sure what else to say :P

But yeah, I’m just looking for any advice, thanks in advance :D",18Oct2019,1

Now, I am past the grace period of 6 months, but due to my lack of training I am being held for my poor work but as I lack the training I am not held too much against this. My supervisor has provided my information and other aids to help with my performance but as I go through this month, I feel that I may not be able to get to the right place of performance. I am starting to feel that after all of this, I may not be qualified for this job at all, this hurts me because this is my first full time job in a field that I wanted to work in and I don't to lose it.

I thought ""oh it's fine, not doing this one thing won't destroy my grade"" but it added up, and quickly. It's now midterm and I have an F.

Every single evening, bar none, they argue. But it’s not just normal couple bickering. It’s REALLY loud shouting. I’ve never heard two people fight like it before. 

They’re not speaking English so I don’t know what they’re fighting about, but it’s been going on for weeks and weeks. EVERY night. It’s usually between 8pm - 1am, it can vary. 

I have also heard some “slamming” noises. I don’t think they’re physically fighting, I just think they’re slamming doors and stomping around. But I can’t be 100% certain.

The thing that bothers me is that they have a daughter, a little girl who is about 2. The fighting is SO loud, there’s no way the kid is sleeping through it or not hearing it. 

Surely it can’t be good for a kid to hear their parents screaming blue murder at each other every night. But is it something I should contact the police/CPS about or should I leave it alone?",18Oct2019,1

653,"Last night/this morning, I (23F) got into a fight with my SO (27M). It's not the first, it was one of the many. I've seen red flags for years. Pointed them out and got them nipped in the bud, even though they occasionally came back.
It started out as the, I guess ""huff and puff"", slamming things to get my attention, and huff some more. I hadn't done anything wrong, but everything was wrong. Everything quickly escalated to things being hit, punched, thrown and kicked. All I could do was lay in bed sobbing as I listened to how awful I have been. How awful i had been, without realizing it. But, if i pointed out anything awful he had done, it came right back to me.
I promised myself that if he blew up like he did this morning, i was done. And i am. He took off and called and talked to me, begging me to stay, I told him I wouldn't be here as his partner, but his friend, I guess. But he needed help. He threatened his life, especially when I wanted to call the cops, someone, to save him from himself. But me saying that made him want to end it more. I talked him into seeing a doctor today, they confirmed his PTSD from previous life experiences. They gave him some meds and a specialist to talk to.

My thing is, I'm stuck in our home. I don't know what to do. I have friends who are willing to come get me and pull me out of the situation, but I'm flat ass broke, in the negatives broke (yikes, I know). I don't get paid until the beginning of the month because I can't afford any of the processing needed to go through with divorce.

654,"Little bit of background, I'm an Asian-American. I thought I was born in America up until I was like 12. Apparently I was born abroad (in Asia) and we moved here after I was legit 4 weeks old - so I've never really 'cared' for being born abroad. I see no difference in an American-born Asian versus me who ""lived"" abroad for 4 weeks. 

But recently, on my official bios for work &amp; Wiki page (I'm an editor in media/tv), it shows my birthplace and introduces me as ""Asian-born American"" and for whatever reason it's making me insecure. I feel more foreign, less American, and feel like people will view me inferiorly &amp; not take my work/art as seriously. I feel like I'll be called out for being an ""immigrant"" or some shit, and I don't really identify as an immigrant. I just wish I was born here, and was seen as 'American as possible' - honestly when people ask me I just tell them I was born here or that I've lived here my entire life - I try to brush around that question. I feel like it invalidates my identity a little bit, I feel less than my Asian-American colleagues who actually *were* born here and I almost kind of hate that it says my birthplace at all on my Wiki page / bios.

So yeah, idk it's just a little something that's been irking me. Just curious if any of y'all are like that too, have had these thoughts before, or have any thoughts on how to positively think about this. Don't know why, but I feel super insecure about this lately...",18Oct2019,1

I'm a teacher banking on public service loan forgiveness,  but recently discovered some of my years teaching don't count because I consolidated. Note: I asked specifically if consolidating would affect my loan forgiveness,  and they said no.  I'm an idiot.  Anyway,  I am very  frustrated with my work: losing sleep,  harder and harder to shake off the day,  utter boredom,  anger, and brokenheartedness over all of it.  I'm interested in non traditional things.  I started a small business working with cremation ashes last year,  and I also began growing mushrooms on a small scale.  I have a few different ideas with both of those businesses,  but it's a leap. Teaching four more years after this one,  and 50k of my loan will be forgiven.  Granted,  I never imagined this impossible ballooning of my loan debt. But  if I make some money at least, and I feel like I have a few great ideas,  I can suck it up and pay off the debt all on my own. I'm married,  my husband makes more than twice what I make,  and we can live on his salary,  very frugally.  We have two young kids. 
I want everybody to tell me to just leave at the end of the year and take on my loans alone.  I'm just too nervous to do it.

659,"Throwaway because my friend in question knows my main

Okay some background info- me and my friends are in school together and my sick friend (let’s call her Carol) just recently got out of hospital (she has a lifelong medical condition so she regularly has to go in for checkups and operations) and despite our huge group, everyone expects me as her “best friend” to look after her. But I’m just not comfortable with it!

It all started when after a couple of days, she popped out of hospital after god knows what. Instantly she started doing my head in (and everyone else) it’s not like she can’t walk, talk or anything that needs any proper attention yet I still have to look after her. It’s just small things that build up, touching me, dragging me back, trying to hold my hand to wait for her and just walking extra slow. I don’t mind waiting up for her or waking a bit slower, but I’m just not comfortable with her grabbing me and touching me and stuff.

She’s also acting weird. She keeps making weird facial expressions like sticking her tongue out and making weird sounds (not of which caused by medical condition) and it just gets on my nerves. It’s like she doesn’t know what don’t touch me means and she just can’t keep her hands off me!! 

Everyone else is making me wait around with her too. Like they all make me walk with carol and do everything with her and get annoyed at me when I don’t. “You should be looking after her OP, you’re her friend!” But so are they too, but what responsibility do they take? None.

Maybe I’m just annoyed at everything but it’s just getting on top of me. I just feel like that person who pushes around someone’s wheelchair. They never get any attention and after the novelty of everyone wanting a go pushing, they just leave it all back to that one wheelchair pushing person. And they just get taken for granted. No thanks no nothing.

Reddit, I need your advice. I don’t want to be horrible (believe it or not, I’m not a confrontational person, I just keep it bottled up and let it all out on a reddit post) but I don’t like being taken for granted. Please help!",18Oct2019,1
660,"Me and my partner of two years want to buy a property together and after an AIP we have been looking at houses for 150 and less.

I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/djp0xq/hello_would_love_some_help_with_my_20_immature/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) post this morning. Well shit has hit the fan.


 She was giving me a ride to a dentist appointment, and then started telling me I don't help around the house. When I asked her ""is this really why you're angry?"" and she said ""well there's a lot more."" And I said try me. She listed off all of these very insignificant things, I then told her that I was working on every single issue she listed. She then blew up at me, calling me a bitch, and two faced, she tried to kick me out of the car in the middle of the freeway. I asked her ""is this really how you treat your family? Do you even care that you're screwing me over at all?"" We got to where we needed to be and I was having a really bad anxiety attack at that point and just kept asking ""do you even care about me? Do you care that you are screwing me over and that I have no more friends or family because of this? Do you care that I am so close to relapsing because of what you do to me? Why are you doing this to me??"" probably a bit much but I was panicking so oh well, but she just stayed silent the whole time and said she said that out of anger... But that is still not okay she still didn't even apologize and just sat there. And then I needed to get out of the car to call my partner about this, and she makes a call, and starts crying for herself, like fuck you dude.


I could have gotten my own place exactly a year ago but she begged me to stay and help with the deposit and she would pay me back she just needs help. I told her i trusted her but now I'm regretting it. I should have known since she was so abusive when we were younger, and she stole hundreds from me back then too. It is a lot easier said than done for me to just go away. I don't have a license,  I don't have a car, my work is 1.5 hours away by bus, oh and btw she bribed me into getting this job by telling me I'd get $250 as a sign on bonus, welp that was a lie. If i just left I'm screwed. I don't know what to do any more. I trusted her and I cared about her, i gave her the benefit of the doubt because she's the last family I have, my dad kicked me out, my mom is dead, and any other family is out of state. She has completely screwed me over and doesn't give a shit, I'm just so disappointed, i thought i could trust her, now I have to lock up all my stuff and put a lock on my door.

I'm just tired of being taken advantage of, and being yelled at for something i didn't do. They don't have jobs and stay at home playing video games all day, and when i ask them to clean anything they throw a fit. I think the main part of the issue here is that she is so self centered that she cant see anything bad about herself.

667,"Sorry if this gets long folks! -

Background:
My sister and her husband got knocked up when she was 17/18 and he was 15/16. They now have two kids and have had (a guestimate) two breakups/breaks. At this point they have been together at least 6 years. (I will call the sister's husband ""Chad"" in this cause safety.) Chad happens to be extremely close childhood friends with my long term boyfriend, ""Mike"", who I met through my sister. I have always been weary of Chad.

Chad has made inapropriate comments to me and Mike about me for two years and the comments increase every time he drinks. 
I used to hang out with my sister at her place frequently with Mike. 
The comments went from ""inapropriate man on the street"" level to small amounts of inapropriate touching and questions/hypotheticals. Usually occuring just out of earshot of my sister and Mike. He openly confessed to Mike that he had feelings for me.  Then it increased to blatant lies and hypotheticals and ""jokes"" to Mike about trading my sister for me. When he got drinking the lies would become more vocal and graffic. The following morings when he would sober up he would claim ignorance and alcohol. When confronted by Mike and I that he needed to stop and inform my sister of what was happening he would refuse. The final straw was him claiming he had sex and made out with me while at a party two years prior while Mike and I were newly dating. He again claimed the next day he was lieing and used alcohol as defense. 

The party he referanced is the one and only time I have ever gotten blackout drunk he was well aware of that fact and he used it to his advantage. 
All I remeber is being very very scared and failing to walk up stairs. I am 100% certain nothing happened.

My boyfriend and I no longer accociate with them unless necessary because of him. 

I can't tell my sister (Chad keeps giving her half truths and lies), my boyfriend can no longer stand Chad's behaviour, and I am more scared than ever of him. 

But I don't want to loose my sister of my nephews but I am afraid I might just have to wait till they all grow up.

669,"Sorry this is so long. I feel silly asking this. She and I are both bisexual. I'm having a hard time figuring out when a friend who is a girl could like you as more than that. 
We met on tinder, she had to clarify with me that I had a boyfriend and was looking for friends while we hung out that day. So we've just been friends since then, I think about a year now. I thought she was really cute and interesting but I was focused on my bf.
I moved away with my boyfriend and came back after he and I broke up. She was my only friend back home (I don't have many) so I spent a lot of time with her, like sleeping over multiple times a week for a few months. She I and were both very into ""self help"" and ""spiritual healing"" blah blah so we talked about that kind of stuff a lot and I thought kind of connected, I wonder if I felt that more than she did though? She tries to fix people so probably just 
On valentine's day she got me roses and candles. She was like hesitant to enter the room and seemed nervous. Stupid me made a stupid face and was just like ""omg thank you"" and put them in a vase. Mind you I told her earlier that day I was at the store and so I wonder if she just thought I was getting her something for vday, like friends who are girls sometimes do.
And when I slept over we slept in the same bed. And one night she had her fingers in my hair and her leg kind of on me but i quickly scooted away (i thought maybe she was just doing it in her sleep and would be weirded out if she woke up and knew I was awake, letting her do that). She's talked to me about how she really likes dating girls and thinks she shouldn't date guys for a while, tells me about girls she likes a lot but I'd take that as a sign of disinterest. A lot of friends that shes had have had crushes on her so I think shes just a naturally flirty person. I'd say shes charming and sociable, shes cute, idk I think I just must read into things? 
I've thought shes dropped hints that she wasnt interested in me, she said ""once I think of someone as a friend I cant not think of them that way"". She talks to me sporadically, idk why we talk much anymore bc since she got a boyfriend we haven't hung out and hardly text. Her other friends seem a lot more relevant in her life. I can't tell if I seem like I give off too much of a ""trying to hide my liking you"" vibe or if she did like me but when I responded the way I did, was convinced I was only interested in her as a friend. People I've dated have told me that when we first started talking they had no idea I was interested in them (and I was usually gushing over them on the inside so that supports my good at hiding how I feel theory). 
Idk what to do. I'm scared to ask because shes dating someone rn (a guy who she says shes going to leave soon, we talk to each other abt mainly relationship stuff) and also I think it would alter the friendship. But we're not that close anymore anyway.",18Oct2019,2

671,"A bit of backstory: I moved to the US for quite some time with all my family. Dad was had a great relation with everyone and his marriage with mom was good. He moved back to my home country because he said he was getting bored of living in the US. Alright fair enough. He called us for the next couple of years to keep in touch. 

After a decade or so, I had to move back to my country for personal reasons. Reunited with him and mom. At first it was refreshing when I saw him even though I didnt have much memories as a kid with him but we went out as a family for a year or so. That didn't last long though. He changed in a way where he was an alcoholic and would sometimes hit my mom in front of me. Garbage thrown everywhere after fights and one of those fights that tramatized me was when mom begged me to call the police and I didnt do anything just stood still. My moms friend came into the house and hit him to defend my mom. 

After thst experience my mom filed for divorce and recognized he had a kid and a second wife behind her back. It was the final straw. We managed to live in the same household without problems for the next couple of years. At this time I don't care for a relationship with my 'father' and even though he helps me out with bills snd stuff, he was never there for me or asked me out to go out somewhere like a fucking park or to eat ice cream. Never taught me basic life shit when I needed it. He only came to my aid recently as my depression as hit me the hardest this month. But it was it one time thing, he doesn't know what Im going through at this moment. My sister says he cries when he talks to her. I find it hard to believe and if he really were like that, he would support me. He also sometimes has skype calls at night (to try and be subtle) with his wife and kid. He loves his kid and talks to him like hes the best thing in the world. It makes me sad he gets that treatment while I eat shit.

I had to learn shit by myself like learning how to clean my room this year because I was tired of not knowing how to do it for so long and I do want to learn other like cooking as the only food I eat everyday is from fast food resturants and its getting tiresome honestly.

Is there a way on how to be a better man and possibly have a father figure? I honestly feel so abandoned and after talking to my therapist, I realized that abandonment really was the root of my low self esteem and possibly why I distrust so much of people in general.",18Oct2019,0

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",18Oct2019,0

I facetimed Rain randomly two days ago and her friend was in the back and said, “Ew, disgusting faggot.” And then I messaged her, saying that it wasn’t cool to call me that, and I obviously cursed her out. So a couple days later I start getting messages by her friends, calling me a bitch, faggot, etc. And I blocked them obviously, and a couple hours after that one of their brothers texted me and said he was going to beat me up if I didn’t text Rain’s friend an apology, so I text her the apology to which she accepts rudely and as a precaution I didn’t go to school today. Well her friend posted on his story basically saying, “Imagine talking shit about my friends and when I’m about to pull up you get all scared and don’t go to school you a bitch🤡” so that was a good decision on my part.

674,"I believe someone has purposely tampered with my bike.

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of back story:

A little over 2 weeks ago I started cycling to the train station for work. I use the secured Bike hub there which you need a fob to get into and has CCTV too.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Well, today when I came to collect my bike both of the tyres had been let down and were flatter than 2 pancakes. I tried to use the pump available there but it was broken.

&amp;#x200B;

A man then entered the hub and I joked about someone letting the tyres down as they where both flat and he said that was odd and I might be right. When he asked if I had tried to pump them up i told him the pump was broke. He seemed shocked and commented that he had used it less than 24 hours ago, and offered to have a look

&amp;#x200B;

He was puzzled as to how the pump had been taken apart, fixed it and then proceeded to pump up my front tyre for me. I thanked him and said I could take care of the back wheel. Wish I hadn't now, as I couldn't pump it up! 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a small, skinny 5 foot nothing 22 year old female with noodle arms, and I just didn't have the strength to get this metal pump to, well, pump. I ended up getting a lift back as I didn't want to walk the 4 miles home in then rain. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have just checked the front tyre which is still solid (5 hours later) and noticed the plastic cap on the bolt of the tyre is hanging off and the bolt is heavily scratched. The plastic caps are missing off of all the other bolts and they are scratched up too. The bolts weren't loose. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a new bike I have owned for 3 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Clearly, someone has tampered with the tyres, the bolts and possible even the pump, but I just can not understand why. 

&amp;#x200B;

And why do it in a hub with CCTV. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Were they just trying to ruin someone's day, imagining them having to walk home pushing their bike. Were they attempting to steal something? Its an electric bike (cheapest you can get mind) but I had taken the battery out and to work with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also question if it was just blind vandalism, attempted theft or if they had particularly targeted me, because as far as I could see none of the 20 odd other bikes had been messed with. Should I be worried?

&amp;#x200B;

I have reported it to the hub owners, but I have to wait 28 days for someone to review the CCTV and my case apparently.

&amp;#x200B;

Any insight?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Bike tyres had been let down, bolts had been messed with and communal pump possible broken? All in front of a CCTV camera. Why do you think someone would do that? should I be worried?",18Oct2019,1

His baggage sure is heavy but I dealt with everything the last two years and yes it was very difficult and I promised I would be there for him and he was getting better we have a lot of good memories together.
But now things seem to be getting worst,mostly because of his family but he takes it out on me he's verbally abusive when his depression hits and he keeps saying he wants to die but thank god he only says it and not do anything rash. 
On days his depression is dormant he's actually very soft hearted and loveable. And I know depression changes people into this ugly monster that they are not and I feel guilty because all this has been mentally and physically draining me.

683,"Without getting into details--this is someone I don't know, but I know a victim very well. 

This sex offender was a teacher (female) who sexually abused 3 male students, one of whom when she was out on bail. She ultimately served a little over 4 years in prison for her crimes. I know that she groomed and manipulated her students who were particularly vulnerable (failing, addicted to drugs, without emotional support) and left all her victims with severe trust issues and needing a lot of therapy. My close friend actually got addicted to spice because she introduced it to him and kept supplying it to him when he was on juvenile probation for weed. This was when he was 16-17.

She was released on parole a month ago. I searched her on Facebook and saw she had a profile--this is against Facebook's policy, so I reported it. Nothing has been done yet. She is befriending her previous students. Mind you they are all now adults, and none are known victims, so that is not against her parole conditions. It just seems odd to me. 

If she just had a Facebook I wouldn't report it to the registry. It's the fact she's going around friending her previous students, with more ""evidence"" I have that shows she truly doesn't understand the gravity of what she did (comments she made in a civil suit saying the boys led her on, she had no malicious intent) etc...it makes me think she's warming her way up to contacting previous victims, including my close friend.

689,"About 1 year ago I met who I now consider to be my best friend and soulmate. She was on visa to my EU country from a non-EEA country.
She potentially broke the terms of her visa by not being able to achieve a certain attendance for an education course, although she passed the end of course exam. She had low attendance because of homelessness due to being kicked out by a family member here and due to crippling stress-related migraines.
Similar to her relation here, her family back in her country appear to have disowned her due to her not complying with their conservative religious lifestyle.
She burned through all of her savings while trying to keep herself in the course here.
She first attempted to overdose on pills two weeks ago. She tried again the day before yesterday, the last day of her visa. She discharged herself from hospital today and attempted to make a flight to her home country potentially to not overstay her visa too much (had a medical cert from the hospital) or possibly to obtain more effective pills to kill herself quickly as regulation is lax in her country. She was too ill to even get to the plane.
Although she resents me doing so, I have been attempting to book her an apartment for a few months but the attempts have ended with scams or suspicious locals disagreeing with an unrelated male representing a female.
She also doesn't completely trust me as I have failed her at various times (usually punctuality related) such as this morning missing an agreed meet with her in the hospital by sleeping through the alarm.
If she goes home now she will probably kill herself.
If she stays for any length of time she may get marked as over-staying and then be denied the future ability to immigrate to a liberal EU/ North-American country. She will then be stuck in her country. I'm also worried that if I can't or she won't let me watch over her constantly she will take the chance to kill herself here becuase she associates this country with her only really happy memories.
All of her liberal international (although extremely shallow) friends have cut off contact, her only other sister who also escaped the destiny with the family also cut off contact. She has no familiy who will accept her back home other than to implement extreme control over her as can happen to single women in that country, no friends there, no job, no accommodation and no money.

I asked the suicide hotlines, they just listen and don't really advise.
I went to the police to explain some of the situation and ask advice, they didn't know but they sent a squad car to assess her, she said she was fine but only attempted the day after.
Immigration solicitors, her appointed social worker or possibly psychologist are not available probably until Monday.

I don't know how to save my friend  who only ever wanted to love and be loved but instead was her whole life abused by her family, romantic partners, and a system at home of controlling religious bigotry and superstition and more generally by a system that looks down on those born the wrong skin colour.

I’d just gotten out of a terrible, *terrible* relationship and I was honestly wasn’t expecting much to come out of messaging this guy. We were just flirty and catching up.

Well then he asked me out to dinner at a deli nearby our homes and I’ll add that I paid for mine separately. It did sort of feel like a date and we’d been texting in and off since then.

But then this guy texts me the other day and tells me he bought one hundred dollar tickets for a football game. I guess he wanted it to be this large romantic gesture but I was a little shocked by it.

691,"My husband has been wanting to buy a gun for a while and I am opposed to it, especially considering our situation. He tried to kill himself last year and is a newly recovering alcoholic so I don't think it is a good idea right now. He doesn't have a track record for being the most responsible person as well.

We talked about it and he sort of convinced me, but I told him before he brings a gun home we need to have a contract written up and have certain agreements before that happens. One of them being he needs to take a gun safety class before buying the gun. So yesterday I notice he is really late from work and I checked up on him to see where he was (we share locations). I notice that he was at the gun store. He stopped by there after work without telling me to buy a gun.

When he got home I didn't want to make any assumptions that he would actually buy a gun without telling me. So I asked him what made him late and he said he got held up at work. And I gave him a look, so he gave me a little more and said he went to the grocery store to buy me something. I asked him if that was it and he said yes. So that's when I got upset and I confronted him. I let him know he was lying and that I knew he went to the gun store.

So he said yes, he bought two guns. And then he tried to play it as he thought I said it was ok. But then I told him that if he thought I would think it was ok why was he being sneaky...and then he told me he wasn't. So he basically tried to play innocent.

I was upset and just went to a coffee shop to work on things. I told him I was upset because he promised he would stop lying to me and I can't trust him. I'm just confused. Maybe he didn't do anything wrong. Maybe I overreacted. I have no one else to talk about this with so that's why I post here.

But I found out 6 weeks before our wedding that he was lying for 5 out of 7 years of our relationship...that he was drinking alcohol when he told me he wasn't. We have been married for a little over a year. I just found out two months ago that the lie was deeper. He had actually been lying to me for our entire relationship. He was never sober. He knew that I wouldn't go out with him if he drank, so he lied to me so I'd go out with him.

We slept together and then went to cuddle again and finish the movie. He asked me to text him when I got back home to make sure I made it back safely. 

Then for the next two weeks we were messaging basically everyday. If I didn’t message him first, he would message me. We couldn’t really find a time to meet up again. He works in the entertainment industry and often has after work events or concerts to attend. And i’m a grad student often in classes until 9 at night.

Anyway, he finally said that he didn’t think he had the time for a relationship and so he was just looking for something relaxed instead. I tentatively agreed to this, thinking that maybe a FWB situation could turn into something more and met up and slept with him again. 

But then a few days later I was thinking about it and messaged him why he only realized he was too busy AFTER being on the dating apps. So I called him out for it and he apologized for sleeping with me and then figuring that out. I just told him he should try Tinder instead. It’s been a week and I haven’t messaged or heard from him but he watches all my Instagram and Snapchat stories still. (When we first met up, he had told me he couldn’t stop looking at my Instagram.)

Until yesterday when she sent me a DM on Twitter saying that she was sorry and wants to reconnect with me, I told her that after two months she never said anything to me and now she wants to reconnect and be friends again.

Another thing to add is after the fight 2 months ago she sent me a DM saying that “friends are just temporary” after calling me her best friend prior to that, and that hurt like shit because I never had a “best friend” before and it was so nice to have her

So told her that it’s hard to trust her after that, and she said she misses us being friends and hopes we can reconnect.

The pain  distracts me from the weight on my chest, at least for a short time, so I can try to calm down a little. It doesn't work all the time though. Within 2 - 2,5 years I cut myself 66 times (yes, I keep count of it because it somehow tells me how bad it is) and the ""record"" for one day was 15 cuts. This was a very stressful situation and I didn't know what else to do. Normaly I stop after 3 to 5 cuts but I try the hot shower first as often as I can, which helps most of the time.

Sometimes I cry out of nowhere without knowing why. I haven't slept much the last nights because my thoughts didn't stop and I even cried because it nearly drove me crazy. I had to stay up all night and get some sleep durring the day because nothing seemed to help. 

I often think about random situations I thought to be embarrassing for me and instantly hate myself for my behavior back then but also for thinking of this without a reason. After all my self-esteem isn't that good in most situations and I am nearly physically unable to talk about my feelings with someone. It is like there is a wall in front of me thats teling me no, thats too much. This is also why I can't say no to someones request if they ask me in person. Over text it is still hard but I can do it most of the time. Still I think that people are judging me for every little mistake and I feel like I have to be perfect or otherwise I am a failure. 

I know that those thoughts are stupid but I can't stop them and honestly I wanted professional help for quite a while. But I don't know how to tell my dad about this. I am afraid that he will brush it off as some phase or tell that I should be able to handle it myself. 
He sometimes did that about some of my symptoms, he kinda said that it was something stupid to do/to be afraid of and I couldn't make him understand that I knew it was stupid but that this won't change anything (e.g. when I feel physically unable to do something because I am afraid or think that it is wrong/that others will judge me for this)
And I can't talk to someone else about this because I don't want anyone to know about my problems. I even tried to write him a letter but I can't force myself to hand it to him. I know he loves me and doesn't mean anything bad about the things he said but I am so afraid, I don't know what to do. 

So, how can I address this topic?

Tl;dr: I got a lot of mental health issues including panicking, overthinking and cutting/hurting myself to calm down and want professional help but I don't know how to tell my dad",18Oct2019,1

Hi there!
I am almost 19 years old and a student in college. Ever since I moved in on campus I’ve had a complete and utter mental breakdown. I have been pulled into a full-force depressive episode that has been going on for about 2 months now. I am starting group therapy as well as getting my meds adjusted. I am also in the process of dropping out of the University I’m attending. Anyway, due to my severe mental decline my eating habits have become sporadic and unhealthy. I throw up every since time I eat, even if it’s a handful of pretzels and mixed nuts. I am currently living off of over the counter anti-nausea meds. I am hardly existing anymore. The pain I feel in my stomach is never-ending. I wake up feeling so heavy and weak. I guess what I’m trying to get at is, does anyone else experience these severe physical reactions due to poor mental health? I have a bunch of appointments set up next week with my PCP, pulmonologist, and trying to get into the gi doctor as well. My therapist and psychiatrist have hit a dead end and don’t know what is going on. How do you handle these painful symptoms? Am I supposed to wait for my mental episode to be completely over? I sleep for over 16 hours just about every day, I am basically a shut in. It seems hopeless, but I’m trying to hang in there. I could really use some advice or personal tips! Thanks!",18Oct2019,1

Before, I payed this no mind, until I started going over to friends houses. There, they were actually a family. What's even worse is that in public or when we have one of their friends over, I have to act like I'm really close to them, and that they are the perfect parents. If I don't, they get really mad. They all don't help me in life. I know that it's stupid, but recently (Please don't judge) but I've been playing a game, where I make dream families. That family is John Krasinski and Emily Blunt.

725,"So I’m pretty new to this friend group and I’m starting to be introduced to their drama, which is a good thing because they trust me but at the same time I just want to tell them to stop being assholes.
One thing about this friend group that is important to know is that we have a dynamic where we all make fun of each other.  It’s not mean or bullying and everyone is on board with it, most of the time.  I wasn’t there for the actual incident but A was apparently making jokes about B and B was finding them mean.  It’s very easy to say something that you intended to be funny but was perceived as offensive so I don’t think A tragically messed up, but regardless I feel like she should apologize to B.  

B was at the lunch table and said to A, in front of everyone in a very civil manner, how A’s jokes made him feel put down.  He wasn’t rude at all, but A was taking it as a joke and not considering B’s emotions at all.

Later that day we were talking in a group chat that didn’t include B and A was saying they felt bad for how they handled lunch.  I didn’t say anything yet, but other people in the group were saying how he was overreacting and eventually they came to the conclusion that they don’t want to be friends with him anymore.

I personally don’t think this constitutes abandoning a good friendship and I want to tell A to just suck it up and apologize.  I don’t think she’s a bad person but I think she did something kinda mean and now people are misleading her.  I think my points are valid, but in the past I have only made things worse by interjecting my self into other people’s drama.  I tend to be very...blunt and that just tends to escalate things.  

Should I just stay out of this or can someone tell me how to nicely tell A that she should probably apologize?",18Oct2019,2
728,"I’m sorry if this subreddit isn’t the appropriate place to seek for help with a problem like this one but a life is at risk and I really don’t know what else I can do anymore. 

A little background info: My best friend and I are both high school students. We’re both suffering from mental disorders (I currently trying to cope with depression and she has major anxiety) and she has helped me get through every day when I had similar thoughts as she does right now. Freshman year wasn’t like this. We had classes together and we stuck together like magnets every single day and life was honestly so much better than what it has become now. We’ve always had mental stress and emotional instability but this year for some reason was the worst. My friend was never that good at academics, and that was one of the major reasons she feels no hope for the future. This year, her anxiety kicked in so badly that she couldn’t go to most of her classes and she eventually stopped going. She told me all the medications her therapist prescribed her doesn’t work at all. After she stopped going to school because it’s physically impossible to (she starts shaking and crying involuntarily), I don’t see her as much. I barely see her once a week. 

Her family is probably the biggest negative influence on her.  dad is honestly a literal jackass—he always degrade her and her struggles, never thinks in her shoes, sees her as useless and literally told her “she can go die in a hole” and “why can’t u just be normal.” Her mom understood her a lot better and gives her the help she needs like going to the therapist with her and makes sure she gets the time she needs to go to class and surround herself with others but often times, she says harsh things and refuses to consider how my friend is feeling. 

She has mentioned many times before of considering thoughts about dying; she even told me the methods she was going to take—mainly overdosing on the anxiety pills she was given. During the past, I know she wasn’t going to do it today and I just help her get the thoughts out of her mind, because honestly, I’m suffering from the same situation and I don’t even know what to do with myself. This time, however, I can tell she’s serious and I’ve never been so scared. When should I call the hotline? Should I call it now? But she hasn’t done anything and doesn’t seem like she will do this this instant but I just know it’s constantly on her mind but I just don’t know when she will actually do it. I don’t know what to do, I really don’t know. Please help me. Please. 

Here are some of the text she sent me so u have an idea. Thank you so much for any help or advice u can give.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

732,"My Dad passed last week. In his will he has left everything with me and I am his executor. He did not own a great deal, some finances for retirement, bike, old car, small possessions. 

Some context: He left when I was a child and we have more recently had some rocky years but we were finally starting to figure things out. He lives in the family home but had a clear space that was his. I don’t live in the area and it’s a day travel for me to return. I’ve already taken a week off work and have paid for accomodation to be with him as he passed. 

I have requested as a family we sit and discuss how we move forward with his estate - I’m willing to return items that were gifts or items of sentimental value and have made clear I don’t plan on taking everything he owns and leaving. I’ve been told that his mother cannot deal with the conversation right now and to come back in a month. 

I would be understanding of this but I’m beginning to feel uneasy. Things have been moved in my dads space and it’s already looking a little emptier. I have been openly told that one family member has been taking things that were ‘his’. Multiple family members, including his mother, have made claims to items saying they were theirs. They have been asking me to sell them his bike, with one family member also claiming my father had been “offering to give it to him” and wouldn’t speak to me after I said we were looking to hold onto my dads bike for the immediate future. A family member had been holding onto my dads Will after taking it from his room when he was sick. He has given it to me, but has been heavily involved in my dads finances when he was ill in a way that makes me feel uneasy. I haven’t been given time in my dads space alone and any time I’ve asked to get something (clothing for burial, medicines to return) I have been accompanied and then quickly hurried out. I have been told not to worry about the estate, they will clear it out. 

Legal advice has been to stand my ground and press with legal proceedings if they refuse access. I don’t want to do this, but I feel in my gut if I leave things a month they will have already dealt with things. I see how it looks from an outside perspective- distant daughter, elderly grieving mother etc. Should I press once more to discuss the estate and insist I will need access? I’m still happy to share items and leave what we can in place as I said above.",18Oct2019,2

734,"Let me just start this by saying I am not in any immediate danger and am changing the locks to our apartment. But here it goes:

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 6 years. The first year or two were pretty great, as most relationships are. He’s funny, personable and friendly. That’s what got me. The first time he put his hands on me I reported him to the police. He was arrested almost immediately, spent a month in jail, and released because “no face no case”. I didn’t want to testify. If I had, he would have been away for a long time and I did not want that. 

His family was mentally abusive to me the entire time he was locked up. His aunt would call me and tell me to tell the judge the “truth” that he didn’t touch me. to this day the fact that she basically intimidated a domestic violence victim kills me. I loved her and respected her. Anyway, his family tried to convince me it didn’t happen the way I thought it did. The only person out of his family that was supportive was his sister, because she knew the real him.

I can’t really explain what was going on in my head when I decided to get back with him. Desperation I guess. So basically our relationship has been a rollercoaster ever since. We’ve had amazing times together, and also absolutely horrifying times together. 

I am so fucking upset at the fact that I am a statistic. I’m even more upset that it’s killing me to think about living without him. I feel like I am losing my right arm. 

Two days ago we had an argument and I yelled at him and got too close, and he open hand slapped me across the face so hard that I fell down backwards. He also told me he hopes my mom gets cancer so I know how it feels? (His mom just beat breast cancer), and my moms a heavy smoker. So I decided that was it. I’ve had enough. I know he doesn’t love me. I told him we are done. 

He’s away for the weekend so I’m changing the locks and planning for the future. I don’t make a TON of money so preferably I would like to stay at this apartment and make him be the one to move out. Where I live the rent is soooo expensive so I’d really prefer to stay in my cheap apartment, but at the same time don’t want to be tortured by the memories here.

I would really appreciate advice from someone who has been in this situation before and has tips on keeping your mind off of your ex, and how you cope with possible PTSD from the relationship.

736,"Since I moved to my new apartment six months ago I've been noticing slight oddities here and there and now i'm starting to freak myself out. I feel like maybe i'm over exaggerating but I can't help the way I feel. Can you hear me out and share your comments please?

**Background:** I live on a large lot in Costa Mesa, CA with three properties, I am the middle property with front door about 15 meters from the sidewalk. If you are standing on the sidewalk looking at the lot you would only be able to see the front unit, you can't see my car or front entrance.  I am very close with all the neighbors on this lot. This is known as a safe neighborhood but I am maybe two blocks from the freeway and it isn't rare to see the homeless every once in a while.

**Incident 1-** I know this is stupid. One of my hanging pots/succulents went missing 2 weeks after I moved in. It was hanging outside about 8 feet from my front door along with two others. The two others were much lower and easier to reach so I don't know why they didn't take one of these. Maybe it was a friend playing a joke, maybe it fell and the person cleaned it up. Most likely- it was stolen. NBD. It's odd to think someone would walk the 15 meters up the drive and in to our little nook entrance from an unpopular residential street but I guess it happened and whatever.

**Incident 2-** A week later I made a spare key and hid it in a magnetic key box hidden in a hard to find electrical box. Even if you straight up opened the electrical box and searched, it would still be hard to find. A few weeks pass and I have to use the spare key because I locked myself out. The magnetic box is there, they key is no longer inside of it. A little odd.

*\~three months pass and I don't notice anything else, I am not on alert at this point\~*

**Incident 3-** Someone went through my car. The glove box was open and all contents on the passengers seat. Nothing was stolen because I don't keep anything in the car. I park my car in the drive 3 feet away from my front door it isn't easily accessible from the street. This must be the ONLY time I have left my car unlocked. Not surprising that someone searched an unlocked car (my bad) but surprising still that someone came all the way up the lot.

**Incident 4 -** I put my laundry from washer -&gt; dryer in the garage last night at 10 pm. Fell asleep. Woke up at 6am to retrieve the dried clothes. They are gone! I don't lock the garage because I don't keep anything in there. There would literally be nothing else to steal besides the washer or dryer itself.

Today of course I am angry because of losing my bedding and pretty much all my workout clothes and pants. I don't have many clothes because I was traveling the world homeless three years ago and I sold them before leaving. I've been trying to build up my wardrobe for the past two years. I did cry about it.. 

**The Question -** Should I be worried that this is the same person messing with me? Should I do anything? I had a stalker before I moved to this new apartment and haven't heard from him for the last 8 months (living here for 6). It's a lot more complicated than just calling someone a ""stalker"", I actually welcomed him in to my life then realized he was not completely there mentally due to a traumatic brain injury and he doesn't act in logical ways and is also very aggressive at times and I saw red flags and he made if very difficult to get away from him when I wanted to. Stalker doesn't seem like the right word, but he does come to mind when thinking who would be messing with me, if someone is. All these small weird things are getting to me. 

I think I just wanted to vent and also ask for advice? Should I file a police report? I just bought security cams on Amazon.",18Oct2019,2

744,"I just moved into a beautiful and very expensive apartment in an old heritage building that has bad acoustics. Unfortunately I can be a very noise sensitive person especially when I'm stressed or irritable. I don't think having a conversation with the neighbors will help as it is mainly the owner who is the source of the noise and there is no way I could tell him to be quiet in his own building. He is naturally a loud person with lots of energy and his place is frenetic with a lot of activity and people coming and going. I am eternally thankful that he generally keeps it quiet from

Ok, so there's this girl that I really really REALLY like. We've been talking these past few weeks and earlier today I had decided it was finally time to ask her out. However, I do terribly in things like this. I tried to go talk to her a few times...she noticed it.

So, I got a few buddies of mine to help me out. They tried getting the attention of this one friend of hers that was talking to her at the time...they succeeded, BUT she went with him after my buddies and I was just left stranding.

A few minutes passed and then one of my friend's girl walked up to me and told me she overheard the girl in question talking to a friend. Here's what she heard: 
""Do you think he likes you?"" Said a friend of hers
""If I think so? I'm damn sure""-the girl

I have no idea what to do, no idea what to take out of this. Basically, I need advice.",18Oct2019,2

751,"Hello all,

I've been thinking about my behaviour when I was still little lately and I can't really make a rhyme of it all. So I created this throwaway account to try and get some input.
English isn't my first language, so please excuse me if I haven't worded some things correctly. I'm doing my best.

When I think of my childhood I'm thinking of a happy childhood.
What I also think of is how sexual and manipulative I used to be as a little child. 
For example my sister used to be in a sports club I also had to join and there was a brother and sister duo there as well. I manipulated them into doing sexual stuff like kissing and touching each other. They obliged but refused to do anything further. It's not like I didn't try to make them do anything more though, but wasn't successful luckily.  That was way before I even knew what sex was or anything like it. We were all about 8 at that time. I remember being especially thrilled by them being siblings.
I feel disgusted now even typing it out.

I started masturbating at around 7 years of age and while doing it I always had fantasies of guys dominating me or even raping me. That was the only type of fantasy that would get me off, even at that young age.

Every chance I got I'd try to manipulate boys about my age into engaging with me in slight sexual ways without ever letting them ""do the whole deed' or even touching me properly.

Meanwhile I was an extremely late developer, getting my period introduced with a pill by a gynecologist at the age of 15 and finishing to grow my boobs at the age of about 24.

Since my teenage years I've never once had a sexual contact I wasn't invested emotionally in and I can't imagine doing so.
I'm not interested in casual sex or one night stands. I have to have an emotional bond to the guy I'm sleeping with.

I feel like I'm leading a happy and normal life but whenever I look back at my childhood I can't avoid remembering the ways I behaved back then and feeling uneasy about it all. 

Is it normal for a child to behave like that?
If not how can I find out what might have been the reasons for me to be like that?
Is it even important?

753,"We started talking a month ago, we have mutual friends and I commented something on one of his posts and we started chatting. It was like an instant connection, we are so similar as people (pursuing so much, like the same weird things, similar preferences), and we both started sharing details about our lives that we haven’t told anyone. We have hours of phone calls logged and messaged every day for a month. Sexting, flirting, everything. His was the first message I received in the morning and the last I would see I night. 

We’re currently so far away from each other, him in Toronto, me in Florida. Due to our studies, we will be graduating at the same time. I will be in Canada for the fall and spring semesters next year, not for him, but so I can work on my research and get a change in scenery for my studies. The earliest I could be in Canada is May, I’ve never had a happy birthday and think that a week to myself wandering through museums and enjoying good food would be the ideal, traveling through Boston, NYC and Toronto. I’m also planning on transferring to a northeastern college after my year in Canada because I hate my current uni. So I could potentially close the gap a bit. 

We’ve had conversations about what we are several times but now we don’t know how to continue or what to call ourselves. Do we hold onto each other and see how we are in person in a bunch of months or do we let each other go and meet in person as a restart? It hurts so much for the both of us that we’re far away and can’t experience each other in person. Do we become friends until we meet in person? How would that even work?",18Oct2019,1

I have just been through freshers week and the first useless week of my course. I have social anxiety and I did not go drinking once. I do not even know my sexuality, if I am straight or bisexual or something else. I don't feel like I know myself at all and my perception of time is really variable but the days seem to slip away mostly. I have only really made a connection with one other person so far, I have tried with others but they seem disinterested. What I want is not what other people want as far as I can tell. I think like a child even though I am 19, I want a friend, someone I can relate to and confide in time but I think the clay has set for everyone else and I feel very alone. I have not had a friend for 7 years, I have missed out and I will never get it back.

I have tried meditation but the shit in my life just runs over and over and I had derealisation the last time I tried it. I do not feel this is even the university I was meant to go to, it was my insurance, and 2 marks separated this university from my other university which I feel I should have gone to. Even if that doesn't make sense, of course I was not meant to go there otherwise those marks would have came, but this keeps coming back to me. I don't know if I hate life or if it is just a fact that I do not feel anything about. I have tried one of the societies, I went to a taster session the other day, that was fun, but I think it was only fun because it was with the person I have already mentioned.

There are very few girls on my course, and meeting them any other way is practically impossible, I do not drink and I am incompetent around crowds. But I do not even know if that is what I want, I have felt attraction towards many girls and a few guys, strangely for the few guys I have felt it towards it has been stronger than any of the girls I think.

One solution I can think of is Tinder, but seeing how girls behaved during freshers week idk if I can ever relate to one of them again.

I went out with Jake, an old friend of mine and we ended up sleeping together a couple of times (we were tested and used protection).

761,"Hey guys,   


My girlfriend and I recently moved to a big city from a small town so I could pursue some higher education. This city is notoriously expensive to live in but fortunately I had some friends who lived there who were looking for a new place. We managed to organize a shared living situation that is affordable for all involved.   


Unfortunately, after only 2 months into this living situation things have become very difficult. There is constant conflict between roommates, the city is extraordinarily expensive to live in and I'm not happy with school. I had a great job back home and I'm really upset that I gave it up. My girlfriend has been working excessively to help pay the bills and I can tell this is straining our relationship. It's becoming pretty clear that moving here was a mistake and not the right choice. The house relies on us (though we are not part of the lease) to effectively pay the rent. If we left, it would really screw our roommates over. There is constant conflict, but these people where once childhood friends and I can't leave them high and dry.   


What do I do? I think a conversation about moving away is going to end up very negatively and strain my friendships, but not changing this situation risks my own happiness and the happiness of my girlfriend.

777,"So, couple hours ago I got caught looking at my neighbor's exam. My professor made me get up from my seat and move to the front of the classroom. I finished my test, then he told me to meet him after class. Of course, I denied having cheated, but I have no doubt he knows that I was cheating. I got off with literally no punishment however, he told me my grade won't be affected and that I'll just have to sit in the front row for the next midterm, and that was it. I don't know why he didn't report me to the Dean, maybe it was because he had no proof and it would just be my word against his, maybe he just thought it'll be a hassle.

With that said, I do feel guilty. I feel like I betrayed my own values, like I betrayed his trust (even though I've never talked to the guy beforehand), and the fact that I got no punishment (except for a bit of public shaming in front of my fellow classmates) is definitely not helping. 

My question is, should I send an email confessing everything? I mean, in a couple months, I'll never see him again and I won't ever have to worry about this, and more importantly I'll have nothing on my record. But if I do send an email, then I'll be giving him clear cut proof that I cheated, and he'll probably report me and I'll fail the course, or perhaps worse. It's very important that I pass this class, I've failed it before and if I fail again then it'll be hell for me to graduate on time. I really don't wanna talk to him in person either. I'm super introverted, I'm sure I'll stutter everything, not convey my message, and probably cry a little. 

Also, this was not very major case of cheating, it was for a math class and I forgot the correct format to write my solution (which I got without cheating). But of course he doesn't know that, and it was still wrong of me to do so regardless. Should I send that email though, or just suck it up and go on with my life?

My friend and I have known each other since Pre-School and we've been friends for a long time. For as long as I can remember I've always seen us as really good friends, but things have changed.

Once we entered middle school (not to sound narcissistic), it feels as if my other friends and I have matured and grown while he hasn't. Let me explain or better yet, let me give you some examples

* He whines about everything (Ex. not being invited to birthdays and hangouts, when things don't go his way, etc.)
* He is clingy to my other friends and I (never leaves us alone)
* He is nosy and always need to involve himself into other people's business

Furthermore my friend group has developed a sense of humor and one where he just does not fit in. We've tried to adjust so that we can all get a good laugh and we do, but when he makes a joke, it ends up falling flat. The point is, although my friends and i try to include him in everything we do, he just doesn't seem to fit in.

Recently, my friend group has started to distance themselves from him, but every time we step a bit further he keeps coming back. A few months ago we started going to the mall and each other's houses without him, but unfortunately the word got to him and he started to get mad at us.

Now you may be asking yourself ""Why are you still friends with him?"", well that's because my friends and i are a bit scared about what would happen if we confront him about it, which this leads me back to the list. He is extremely unpredictable emotionally and he is the type of kid that doesn't solve his problems by his own, but involves his parents ALWAYS. Not only do his parents have a lot of power in our school, but if they are given the chance to confront us about it and get involved in their child's personal matters, they will.

Now finally, I ask you: How should I handle this situation considering all the circumstances? What do I do to stop being friends with him? Any help or advice is highly appreciated in the comments, thank you.",18Oct2019,2

It's just a dull ache in the lower back of my head that has spread into the roots of my top row of teeth on the sides, right below my cheek bones. It also has a weird nauseous feeling accompanying it. Wtf is this? What's causing it and how do i get rid of it? Do sinuses have anything to do with it?",18Oct2019,1
787,"Throwaway account. 

Ok here’s the gist. I (27m) currently live in AZ and my baby and her mother (29f)live in OR. We split for good months ago before working out a parenting plan. Let’s just say I ran for my life and didn’t have time. We’ve been discussing a parenting plan recently and she agreed to send over the proper paperwork so I can at least get some visitation rights, I’d like to eventually obtain partial custody further down the line, but that’s gonna cost a lot of money that I don’t have right now. So I’ve waited three weeks and nothing has came in the mail. I called her the other day to ask her what the hold up was. She is now refusing to send me any papers and is threatening to move. Why? Because she believes that I drove on her front lawn and tore up her flowers and bushes because I was pissed that she refused to let my daughter stay with me in Arizona for any amount of time. Now mind you it would take me no shorter than 20 hours just to get there, if I were to take a plane and I’d have to rent a car. Again I’m nowhere near rich, so if I wanted to be this petty I couldn’t afford my rent or child support for the upcoming month. I tell her that’s ridiculous, I would never do something like that, I never have, and I sure as hell wouldn’t terrorize my daughter like that. I swear up and down I didn’t do it. She doesn’t believe me. Ok fine. I sent her my recorded work schedule for two weeks with the day she claims I destroyed her lawn being one of them. I worked a lot in that period, 6 day weeks. For the two days I didn’t work, I sent her screenshots of some purchases I made that clearly show my last 4 of my debit card, the date of purchase and the location (AZ) . I even sent her a picture of my debit card with my finger covering up everything except for the last 4 and my name. I even talked to my boss and he said he’d obtain video footage if he had to. I tell her after sending her all of this that if she still doesn’t believe me to contact the police, because if I’m out there terrorizing a single mother and her baby I should be locked up so I won’t do it again. I tell her Id be happy to comply with the police if I had to and they can verify and track my every movement for the past year for all I care. I tell her I don’t expect and apology or an acknowledgment that she was wrong, I just want to move forward and get the papers so I can legally be a part of my daughter’s life again. She responds by blocking me.

A little info on babymomma. She has a history of hard core drug abuse, I even have pictures to prove it. When she’s using she tends to blame me and suspects me of outrageous things. I asked her multiple times if she was using again on the phone and she dodged the question before ultimately blocking me. Also she is prone to extreme mood swings and bouts of violence(toward me mostly). She also has had many breaks with reality to where she’d do some crazy shit and then deny it ever happened. Basically I think she’s either having a psychotic breakdown or she’s using drugs again or both. Now as much as a partner from hell she was she’s actually a kind loving mother and I obviously want my daughter to have that. Should I call DHS and have them check on her? The only thing I’m worried about is she recorded me screaming one of the last days I was there. I locked myself in the bathroom and screamed “I can’t take it any more” because I’d been abused for three years straight and I was literally at the end of my rope. I spent last xmas and New Years in the psych ward because I was suicidal bc I felt very trapped by her controlling narcissism and I believed her when she said I was a useless human/father. Sadly I lied to the people at the psych ward and said I wasn’t being abused by her in order to protect her, even though I showed obvious signs. Sadly I never thought to record any of the times she screamed(almost every day in my face), the times she threatened to kill me, the times she would destroy my possessions, talk down to me until I was crying, physically attack me(sometimes in front of my daughter). I’m a very passive person and I was never violent back. The worst part is she completely denies all of it and tells me I’m making it up. It makes me so angry, but that’s besides the point. She also tells old friends and her therapist that I was the abusive one, which is total and complete bullshit. There were times when I wasn’t nice to her bc I was abused in a regular basis I felt like one of those animals you’d see in a kennel and I would resort to name calling sometimes. But I never threatened or attacked or gaslighted. So based on her behaviors my suspicions are rising and I’m starting to get worried for my daughter. If I call DHS she will fly off the handle for sure. And I really really don’t want to fight or battle or start shit I just want to see my daughter. My gut is telling me she might be in trouble. What should I do? What should I expect the outcome to be?",18Oct2019,2

I always doubt myself and it seems that people who don't study as much and are less stressed always get better grades than me, no matter how much I try. I don't have any pressure from my parents but I am scared of disappointing them. I get jealous of other people's success and I constantly compare myself to others.

It started a while after I enrolled in University, nothing was enjoyable to me anymore, so I decided to take a year out in an attempt to make myself happier and focus on myself.
Instead I've been isolating myself in my bedroom, can't bring myself to leave and do anything. 

Most of my friends are still at uni so I have no one to talk to in real life, my best friend is in my home town but going through a hard time himself and can't be there a lot for me right now, so sometimes I go days without any human interaction. 
I don't know how to get myself out of this rut, I have 1 friend nearby who can't see me, I can't get out of bed most mornings, everything seems so bleak and I can't shift how I feel. Everything seems so much and like an unbearable amount of effort, not having uni work to do has left me with no responsibilities and I'm just laying in bed all day feeling terrible.

After I woke up it took several days to learn how to walk properly again, and it progressed from taking a few steps with assistance to walking short walks around the ICU for within days. After they fully recovered I thought that would be the end of it. Now  about 6 months later I noticed first going down stairs, and now walking most of the time, my legs feel shakey and weak, just like when I was re learning how to walk.

My brother, lets call him Jay, has sided with my mom and ignored my opinion, my dad's opinion, and any other opinion he disagrees with.

800,"So I’m 24 years old and I’ve always known what I wanted to do with my life. My resume is long I’ve worked at a hundred warehouses and retail stores and even completed some college. 

Got in trouble with the wrong crowd so now I’m fighting a felony case but my lawyer says it can be taken down to a misdemeanor and I might get out on house arrest. 

Now I’m having trouble finding a job since I lost my last job because of the case. I’ve applied for Amazon they keep giving me the runaround telling me my background check is still under review. I don’t know why but I’m still optimistic that I’ll get that job...but it doesn’t seem likely.

I’m a struggling artist (I produce, I make rock pop music, and I write screenplays) and things just aren’t looking good but my producer (whose worked with a lot of big name people) is eager to get me back into the studio but honestly I can’t afford the production this time around (I lost my job.) 

No one wants to hire me because of my pending charges. Then I get a phone call from this marketing company and the lady on the phone is basically like “Yeah we are a marketing company looking to expand our team, it’s no commission it’s salary based yadayadayada set up an interview.” I go to the interview today and she fucking lied to me. They ARE a marketing company...selling fucking Verizon in a goddamn Wal-Mart. Face to face sales trying to get people to switch to Verizon. The company is called gray square. The lady on the phone LIED to me. It’s NO salary, and it’s all fucking commission. I have to sell cable to get paid. If I don’t make any sales in a week they give me a minimum wage of  $300 for that week, but I have to pay that back out of any future sales I make.

Got my hopes up for this “Salary marketing position” and it’s all pyramid scheme type bull shit. I don’t know whether to go in my room and blow my brains out or keep waiting for something miraculous to fall out of a window. I took the job because I literally have nothing else on the table.

On top of that my mom is on my ass telling me I need to find a job or get out and it doesn’t help that her new boyfriend/husband is putting shit in her ear telling her “don’t help him he’s grown.” I’m barely eating and losing weight because this fucker told her “I’m not feeding you’re son because I’m not feeding a grown man.” So they go out to eat or order out and exclude me and have no problem telling me “don’t touch our food.” And that’s fine with me. I’m 24 I should be able to feed myself,  I should be able to do for self, I should be able to finally move out and get the fuck away from them. BUT ITS HARDER THAN IT SEEMS. 

My mother has never been a supporter of my dreams. She’s the type to fake to the family like everything is perfect. She even let this fucker convince her that I should go into a shelter...A FUCKING SHELTER. Her excuse “(her husband) said they will help you, they will help you get a job and then they can set you up for housing.” 

I’m like mind blown that she believes anything out of his mouth. I don’t know. Am I wrong, am I seeing any of this the wrong way. What should I do. Should I give it up and put a fucking gun to my head, should I jump out of a fucking sundown and call it a life. Should I end whatever the fuck my mom thinks I’m putting her through. I need to know.

806,"So basically I met this guy on Grindr that seemed to be into the same sort of thing as I am, a Master-Slave/ Dom-Sub situation. He was older than me and was looking for a master so I messaged him there and then we moved on to talking on another app. The first sign that something was weird was when he sent me a pic of his son. They are on holiday in my country, so I wasn't surprised that he mentioned being with his son, but then to send a pic of him struck me as really odd, but I didn't think too much about it because I thought it might just not be a weird thing for him and that it was one of those things where a parent shows off their kid cause they love them so much. So whatever, I told him he had a cute kid and moved on.   


The conversation then came onto the topic of hobbies, which I didn't really see the point of him asking cause this was honestly just meant to be a hookup and tbh with gay hookups people often don't know each other's names let alone their hobbies. But I still told him, and that was when things got really weird. He said that he liked to take pics of his son, and that one of his hobbies was nude photography. I simply couldn't believe that he was admitting to making child porn so casually, so I asked him who the nude photography was of. His son, he answered. I was still floored. He's from Scandinavia and so I though to myself that maybe it's just a cultural difference and that it's not weird to take nude photos of their kids there since I believed that they have like nude sauna sessions with family or something like that, and I simply just couldn't believe that he was admitting to doing this like it was the most normal thing ever. Like, it just wasn't possible right??? At this point I should have exed communication but I felt I had to know for sure. I was also really interested in him so I didn't want to stop talking to him if it was just based on a misunderstanding of the situation.   


Anyway it eventually came to the point where he fully admitted that no-one knows about the photos because some of them are 'naughty'. And then he said he wanted me to blackmail him by taking photos of him abusing his son, and kept saying it was his son's fault because he was so 'sexy' and other extremely depraved stuff. He even said he came to visit this country specifically to get guys to use his son. When I told him that he was an evil crazy person he told me I was an asshole and a fake because I claimed to be a Dom and kinky and that I lied since I refused to get into this with him. LIKE WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK?????? I asked him if he didn't realise what he was doing was wrong or that he didn't care and his response was that he was just a horny perverted guy and that I shouldn't judge him. He angrily told me to contact him when his son was an adult  when I explained to him how insane he was being and that there's a difference between being kinky and what he was asking me to do. I honestly couldn't believe what was going on and I still do not.  


Anyway the struggle I'm having now is that I feel like I am somehow complicit because I didn't stop talking to him immediately it became obvious that there was a huge problem there. I feel evil and messed up and like I was somehow encouraging him by asking questions to know if this guy was really out here talking casually about molesting his kids. Also since he is here for just a short while and I don't even know his name or personal details, reporting him seems like it would do nothing. I just don't know what to do or how to feel, I am so so confused and I just don't know. This was the most bizarre, troubling situation I've ever found myself in online.

He didn't react to really anything we said, just... observed us. He had his hood over his head and he was fiddling with something in his pocket. I... I don't dare to think it was a weapon but one point he took his hand out, and was stretching his arm I guess? Then... for some reason, my instinct told me I was in danger. Eventually, \[me\] fawwin and I distance ourselves  (Thanks to \[another friend\] and his spoon full of ants diversion \[he picked up a spoon and scooped up an anthill and threw the spoonful of ants toward us\]). No one in the group knows him. He then follows us near the platform where the pond \[near where we hung out\] ends while staring at me, and sometimes fawwin! I then try to create another diversion, checking the time on my phone. it was 1:23. ""Welp! Time for me to go!"" Immediately as I said those words, he looked at me and started walked away. Its over right? No... It gets creepier. As we are walking along the path towards A building (Since its where the stairs are to get to the front of the school, I spot him standing against the pillar under the bridge. It seemed he was waiting for us. I quickly alert the group of this and they follow me through another path. We instead go through the cafeteria, then up the ramp towards B building and into the plaza between the two buildings. No one knew who he was. I can't tell if he was an actual threat, someone that's actually shy (Least likely. even shy people don't do *this*) or... Someone sent him to observe us. He looked thuggish I guess.

809,"Let me preface this by saying that we are both in high school, and this is only my second ""deep"" relationship. 

I'm a senior in high school, and this girl is a freshman. During the beginning of my junior year, my ex of a year cheated on me. This kinda set my mental health into a downward spiral, (granted it was my fault) and I kept my emotions really bottled up. I put on a happy face and kinda pulled my way through the school year. Towards the end of Junior year, I was actively trying to seek help, and then my cousin died. We were both the same age, and extremely close. I was devastated. It took me past how bad I felt at the beginning of the year, I was sad, lonely, a huge mess of emotions that were all pouring out at once. This past summer was probably the worst I had ever been. I lost alot of weight from not eating, stopped talking to everyone that I knew, and just bunkered down in my room staying up late doing nothing productive. To put it into perspective, I grew up playing videogames, and I absolutely loved them. But I couldn't play them at all. I was so sad, it made me sick. I got bored and exhausted. It was horrible.

Come the beginning of this year, I'm taking an elective class. (Meaning a mix of different grades 9-12) I sat at the back table by myself, still trying to get my shit together from the last four months. Eventually, this girl sits down at the same table. She was shy, quiet, but very nice on the rare occasion when we did talk. Eventually we start talking more often, get each other's numbers, yada yada yada. Cut to now, and we literally talk all day. Conversations have lasted weeks. We have so much in common. Same sense of humor, goals in life, ideas of how the world should work. She is incredibly smart, funny, kind, all the cliches. She literally knows me better than I do. She'll take a look at my face, ask me what's wrong, and I don't even realize something is bothering me until we start talking. I've told her things that I haven't told my closest friends. She pulled me out of my hole, and right now, she is my everything. 

I'm only 17, and like I said. This is only the second ""deep""relationship I've had. I literally have no idea love is, but I feel like this is the closest I've been. But back to what I said. I'm 17. She's still 14. I don't want to look like a douche or a weirdo preying on young girls. I turn 18 in April. Then it gets really touchy. She asked me if I would take her to homecoming. This is why I told her that because of the age difference, and how I'm still in a tough spot when it comes to relationships, I wouldn't. She seemed very sad, but she understood. It broke my heart. I felt so bad. I told her in a long conversation that if we ever had a relationship, I would want to wait until she graduated, for both our sakes. It was one of the toughest conversations I've ever had. I told her that our friendship would not end, and that I would still cherish hanging out with her. She seemed very sad. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to feel selfish putting this off. I don't want her to feel like I don't want to be with her. I don't want her to think I'm not her friend anymore. I don't know what to do. The one person I would be able to talk to about this, is the one I don't want to hurt.",18Oct2019,1
810,"So I recently moved in to a new house share (5 of us) and I've been getting on fine with the new house mates bar one. The first week there I had some friends (7 of us) round for dinner on the Friday night. She sent a message on the chat at around 10:30pm asking us to be quieter, to which I didn't respond but I did ask my friends to turn the music down and talk quieter. Then at around 11:30pm, most of us left except for 3 (2 of them lived in the house). She didn't say anything more to me about it but she did complain about it to one of the other housemates, how we didn't reply to her or that we didn't tell her there's be so many strangers in the house (that's true but I didn't think it'd be that big a deal at the time since it was Friday). She stopped speaking to me for a few days.

Since then I've noticed she's super OCD. Moves our things in the kitchen in to the cupboards (just random cupboards, might not even be the right place for it) if they're sitting outside. Doesn't like people using her plates AT ALL. Moves our shampoos from the next to the bath tub on to a shelf opposite. These things aren't that bad but they are a little annoying. 

Then a couple of days ago she complained (on the chat) that the house was dirty and she had just spent a long time cleaning it and if we could try to keep it clean for her guest coming on the weekend. I had an argument with her on the chat (I can specify about what if you like but the post is already so long) and again she stopped speaking to me. 

Today I came home and I wanted to do some washing but she had her stuff in. When it finished I waited for her to take it out and when she did she put some more stuff in, this time when it finished I just took it out and put it on a chair nearby and put my stuff in. A few hours later I went to check it and I saw the dial on the machine had been turned to off and my clothes were inside in warm soapy water. Now, this is a very new washing machine so probably not an error in it. It's in the kitchen so someone may have rubbed against it by accident but I very much doubt it. 

Should I confront her about it? I've got no real proof though...
I've got to stay in this house for another year, I'm not sure about her but probably similar or longer.

Crazy house mate doesn't like me, switched the washing machine off with my clothes in it for revenge",18Oct2019,1

812,"I am quite embarrassed to discuss this issue with anyone hence the throwaway account. I also apologize for any grammar issues in the post as English is not my main language.

I am a 26-year-old virgin male university student who has a problem expressing my sexuality. I have a deep-seated feeling of shame when I find someone attractive hence do not attempt to even start a conversation with an attractive woman for fear of being creepy or publicly humiliated by her.

I firmly believe that the issue started due to my religious upbringing (Islam), constantly bombarded that looking at women with lust and sex outside of marriage is forbidden. I have instilled these beliefs to the point that to this day I have trouble even socializing with women without any awkwardness. During my formal school years, I attended schools that practiced segregation up to secondary school/high school which led me to strictly socialize with boys. I could 

I later, during my undergraduate education started questioning my faith and I started to slowly lose my faith. The losing of my faith started to make realize how limited and dull my life was. I slowly eased my way into making acquaintances and female friends that I was not attracted to. To my surprise, they were quite friendly to me and I was quite relieved that my initial negative thinking wasn't reflecting reality. 

The problem is when I find a woman sexually attractive I end up mentally freezing, avoiding eye contact and keep the conversation quite curt. It happened when one of my female friends introduced me to her other friend, then later started to confront me on why I was so rude to her friend earlier. I couldn't tell her about my issue so I just mentioned I wasn't feeling well and avoided the discussion completely. I keep on thinking to myself, if this goes on I will never have any sexual relationship because of this mental freeze I have. It is like I am an adolescent boy who is going through puberty.

Should I seek therapy for this?. Can I even discuss this issue with a psychologist as I can't imagine how this issue can be resolved?",18Oct2019,4

814,"I’m a 27 year old medical student, from Europe, currently on a research fellowship in one of the Ivy League university’s in the US. I’m here fore 10 months in total. 
There are so many possibilities both professionally and social/adventure-wise. 
I’m now having trouble in choosing to go for the career and attend all these events that would be could be good for my career or actually enjoying living in another country, having friends and exploring. But I can’t do both. I simply don’t have the time in my already busy schedule. 
An example is this weekend. I’m invited to this weekend long event (Health hackathon) where I would learn to work with other students like engineers and business majors, it’s an event where you don’t really sleep and just go at it until Sunday evening. This would most likely also diminish my ability to work an focus the coming week. But it’s an incredible opportunity that I most like won’t have again. 
Or I could go to this big Halloween party on Saturday, with some people I hope to call my friends and meet a lot of other people, enjoy the entire Sunday with some other friends and feeling relaxed and well rested for the coming week. 
I have these dilemmas almost every week and I don’t know what to choose.

816,"I'm a 25 yo father of a beautiful one month old son living with my gf (19) at her mom's. I've struggled with depression to varying degrees since childhood. Not only was I not popular but I was dealing with my own struggles at home. The three biggest contributors being my mom leaving when I was a baby, my dad being a drunk that could hardly hold down a job, and my cousin (f) who is 4 years older than me started engaging in sexual activity with me when I was about 5. By now you can probably guess that I was pretty messed up early on. I was only a child but I was craving sex and attention, as though they would fill the holes that my mother had left in me. We continued to have sex off and on until I was 14. I didn't have relationships with girls at school, which is okay since my view of women was very perverted at the time. However obviously that only contributed to the loneliness and confusion I felt. Fast forward 3 years just a week before my 17th birthday I find out my girlfriend at the time had been cheating. My depression was really out of hand at this point and had gone on unnoticed by virtually everyone around me. That night I attempted to take my life. Without giving too many details I will say that I used a razor blade and didn't know that cutting veins horizontally doesn't typically do enough damage to be fatal. I was found the next morning by my grandma and was taken to a hospital with a little over 200 cuts on my upper body. Thus began the cycle of being admitted into mental health facilities. I'd lose my insurance shortly after that, with every subsequent visit driving me further into the hole. By the time I had enough courage to join the workforce I was 19 and my credit score was sub 500. I found that pills didn't help with my depression but Marijuana did so I steered clear of the drugs they prescribed me in treatment. I went from minimum wage job to minimum wage job, never being able to save money and not being able to get a better job simply because of drug tests. Finally I hit a stride, I'm not sure what happened but I pulled myself up and got a new girlfriend and actually managed to start saving money toward a car and apartment. Unfortunately my grandma (who I lived with at the time) died shortly before this so I was stuck living with my grandpa, a very old fashioned man with a short temper. He was mine and my girlfriends only ride to work and this simple factor would go on to further drive us apart. He began getting angry with how long it was taking us to save and get our own apartment. He said he wanted us to figure something out before the week was up. So I called around and tried to find an apartment however thanks to my credit score people either just told me no or wanted more than I could afford on the down-payment. So I bought a car instead and we began staying with a friend. One week later the car's head gasket blows and I find out the hard way why the owner was selling it for $800. Now that I have no car I have no way to get to work, and yes I tried other methods. Fortunately we were able to get out of the situation by relocating to Florida to stay with my gf's mom. Since then we've had a baby and I have a car. However my depression has been getting really bad lately and I've become completely overwhelmed. I just lost my latest minimum wage job as a server after walking out, because I couldn't seem to handle the way customers were treating me with my depression weighing so heavily on me. Now I'm more depressed than ever, I have a son that I can't afford to take care of (shout out to her mom for helping me there) and at this rate my credit is not getting any better and neither is my mental health. I feel so trapped in my life and useless to the only family I've ever been able to truly call my own. I'm losing myself and I just can't find the strength within to pick myself up. I feel just as deep in the hole as when I started trying to climb out of it at 19. I am by all accounts a failure in life and if it weren't for the generosity of my gf's mother I would be homeless as well. I don't know where to go from here or even if I should. I'm sorry to anyone that took the time to read my sob story, I really just hope someone can tell me something I'm missing. Some option I haven't explored. I'm too lost to find the answers I need alone.",18Oct2019,3

Her brother sexually abused her when she was younger, she had the chance to press charges but didn’t out of fear of her mother abandoning her. Apparently the police don’t do anything to help her out and they just kicked her brother out of the house for a while and he came back since he was underaged at the time.

820,"I have lived with my grandparents all my life. I am 22 and I am going through university at the minute. I haven't exactly had a job due to school and then university and the last job I had it was at a new upcoming Vietnamese restaurant that I was only able to work at for a week because my granny kept phoning me to see what time Ii was coming home at and my boss thought I wasn't being serious about my job and I felt so much pressure I quit only for my granny to say she was glad as she never liked that job and how she didn't want to tell me as I would think she was just saying that to be critical or something. Ii had a job as an Avon rep at 14/15 and it confused me and my granny didn't want to help me so we gave up after finishing 2 catalogue sales of about 10 people.

I have been in University for the past 2 years doing a course for it to finish and now I am doing a different course for another 2 years only this one includes graduation at the end because my other course before this one was to get me enough points to get into this course. I have tried applying for jobs but unable without a passport which my boyfriend is helping out with.

My grandparents pay for everything for me which I am grateful for but my dilemma is I am planning to move out with my boyfriend and it's going to be difficult as I get £750 and my granny takes £250 and will ask for a lend of money regardless if I need it for something , she will tell me she will have it for another day and forgets and then lets me be aware of her money troubles while I am trying to think of how I am going to get the money to pay for a passport , new clothes for university due to me going through depression and wearing years old clothes, shoes because my feet keep getting hurt etc. I may not be independent but I am sick of being treated like a 2-year-old and even my relationship that has been 7 years long and it is treated like a teenage romance. I keep talking about moving out, they ask why and then make a joke about how I will never move out.

I am not blaming my problems on other people but my granny is a difficult woman, You could be performing heart surgery and she would call you to do something so stupid like make a cup of tea and tell you that you can do what you were doing later on. I nearly failed my last course due to her always getting me to do stuff and telling me I can do my own thing later regardless of how long it will take or how tired I might be. Every time I went to university there was no mention of how it was or whatever it was always 'When do you get paid' and they started to know when I got paid and when I didn't.
