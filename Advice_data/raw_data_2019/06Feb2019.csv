0,"I've grown aware recently that I say a lot of things without thinking that often make me come across as rude, mean, or just obnoxious. I find that sometimes I can't seem to shut my mouth when I don't have anything to say. I'm glad I realized this so that I know I need to change ASAP, but I'm not sure how.

For example, I flipped someone off while I was out for a run recently because they yelled at me to ""run a mile for them."" I felt uncomfortable at the time but I definitely should have just ignored them because they were likely just trying to be nice to me. I feel completely shitty and wish I had never done that, but I know I can't travel back in time.

In the last week, I've tried looking at how one of the nicest people I know talks to others and imitate, but I still came home today feeling completely shitty about myself because of one or two things I said. Does anyone have ideas for mental ""tricks"" or exercises or otherwise distractions to just get myself to stop talking sometimes? ",06Feb2019,1

3,"I’m turning 21 soon and I never really have birthday parties because I’m not that type of person. I usually just have a little cake and my parents cook food that I like and that’s about it. No big party, no cousins or aunts or uncle, just my parents, siblings, and dog. 

However this year I figured since it’s my last big milestone birthday, and I have an actual girlfriend (who my family loves and vice versa), that maybe my parents, my girlfriend and I could go out for dinner and drinks. 

My main reasons are they’re younger than me, and can not drink, and we all have different tastes in food and the few times I’ve gone out for my birthday I’ve had to compromise on where to go because of that. I was thinking of going to an  “all you can eat” Korean BBQ place since I’ve been wanting to go forever but never have. I know my brother has a very small palate and I know he wouldn’t step foot in that place because of that, and my sister is too picky and most likely would not go with the “all you can eat”, which would be a problem because everyone at the table has to do it.

I talked to my girlfriend about this and she suggested having a “day party” for family and then at night go out for drinks, my mom was kinda surprised but my dad didn’t say anything. I know my sister is pissed and now is talking about leaving me behind for her birthday dinner coming up (I don’t care if I go or not) and I don’t think my brother even heard what I said. 

I don’t see what the big deal was considering the original plan was to just go to a bar with my parents, have a few drinks, then go home and see my girlfriend. So my siblings weren’t included in the first place. 

Am I wrong for wanting this? Any advice on what to do?

TL:DR: I don’t want to invite my siblings to a birthday dinner because of our differences in food taste, only bring parents and girlfriend. Help.",06Feb2019,1

6,"Mid 20s guy. I’ve been smoking weed since my mid teens. I’ve made hundreds of attempts to quit and managed to abstain for 1 month by using benzodiazepines (Xanax/Valium) to get past that first week of sweaty, sleepless withdrawals. I smoked again after 1 month and ever since then I’ve essentially been digging my own grave with self-destructive behaviour, including: 

* Smoking weed every single day, with maybe a day or two off as part of a quitting attempt once or twice a month. 

* Continuing benzo use. I always find myself buying Valium and Xanax and taking them for a week or so in a row. I usually take a few days off after a week of use. 

* Frequent MDMA use. Right now I’ve been using it for 3 days in a row, at night after work. And spending that time rolling, masturbating, sniffing poppers, watching extreme porn (transsexual, gay, etc.) and playing online games with a prostate toy in my ass. I identify as straight. I will sleep at around 2am and have to get up for work at 7:30. I’ve been late for 3 days in a row because of this. 

* Gambling all of my spending money for the fortnight on the first weekend after I get paid, leaving me with little to nothing (other than the cash I manage to keep for bills) for entertainment/anything else. I often dip into my savings ($1000 total - used to have $4500). 

As you can tell I’m probably not in the best shape. I don’t know why I am seeking all of this hedonistic self destructive pleasure and escape. I can’t think of any major trauma that would be causing me to seek happiness but I guess I’m generally not very happy in my life. I don’t really like my job, I have a good girlfriend but our relationship is rocky and she’s a doctor making $80k+ and I’m unqualified making $50k so I think it’s likely I’ll lose her soon, for both the extra ambition she has over me and the wedge I’ve put between us by hiding from her and avoiding her to do drugs and pleasure myself. 

I need to get out of this rut. 

Where do I start? 

Please help me. ",06Feb2019,1
7,"So I don't really know what to think of this or what to do. After a night drinking not too long ago, I went back to my friends house to collect my stuff. I was fairly intoxicated at this point so I do not remember everything. I had left my house keys in my car so before my other friends ubered home, I went to grab them. Apparently I was gone for awhile so 2 of my friends left...I ended up ubering with another friend and got some fast food before going home. I ubered back to where my car was the next day. Everything that was in my front seat was thrown in my backseat and one of my car windows was down, meaning i must of put my key in the ignition at some point. Not a big deal but then I notice the car ahead of me has a lot of scratches. At this point I was really concerned so I called one of my friends to ask if I could have hit another car last night...he did not think this was the case. Addtionally, there are no markings on my car. Part of me finds it highly unlikely that I did it...as I said, there was no damage on my car while the other car had scratches all over the back. Additionally, had I hit the parked car in my drunken state, I feel like I would have panicked and driven it somewhere else at some point. Finally, I do remember some things from a little bit before that all happened and after it all happened (like getting fast food)....I feel like I would have some memory of this event. Still I feel really guilty and it seems like too much of a coincidence. ",06Feb2019,1
8,"(F/19) I’m a college student (commuter) and I can’t make friends. I’ve always had a lot of anxiety talking to people my age, I recently had a bad falling out with my best friend from kindergarten and although we made up it just hasn’t been the same since, so the  only person my age who I see and hang out with is my girlfriend (romantic partner). I really try hard to talk to people but I get so nervous and I have trouble trusting people. I truly don’t mean to sound narcissistic but many times when I think someone wants to be friends the person ends up becoming flirtatious, tries to ask me out and then becomes totally uninterested when I tell them I have a girlfriend . I just want strictly platonic friends. I’m a very introverted person and a bit of a nerd. I prefer watching “Jeopardy!” and playing video games over going out. I’m terrified of parties and I just want platonic friends to hang out with.

9,"I can not quite believe that this is a story I can even tell, it is like something from a book or movie.

Let me get to the point, a man (26) from Mexico who was living in my hometown temporarily when I was in high school, this was about 4 years ago. I'll call him Jarocho. We matched on tinder at that time, under the circumstances that we both found each other very physically attractive and we were both into cinema. He was and is a filmmaker, a great one at that. I was studying film at my arts high school at the time, so I was especially drawn to him because he was working in the field I wanted to get into. I guess that I would have been 16 then and he would've been around 22. I believe I had my age listed as 18 on tinder (don't need any comments about that, I'm 20 now and I know it wasn't cool.) I was open with Jarocho about my age, though, and it didn't drive him away from our text conversations, all very casual, about movies and music and life in general. We didn't talk a whole lot though, and we didn't meet up at all when he was living in my city. He moved back to Mexico and only remained in my contacts and in my social media. I was sometimes curious about him, but really nothing progressed. 

Almost a year later, in late November of 2015, he contacted me. We caught up for a few days, video chatted and talked on the phone even. We gradually learned more of each others' lives. Somehow, it got to a point where he was telling me that he thought he was falling in love with me. These words caught me off guard, and I did not reciprocate them at first as I felt that I still didn't know him all that well. I was intrigued by him, though, so it didn't scare me away. Eventually, I did begin to feel that I was falling for him (or, the idea of him at least.) We spoke to each other as if we were dating, and I told him that I felt the same for him. Here is the crazy part:

He decided (as a complete surprise to me) that the day before new years, he would take a bus from Mexico to my city to see me, and he would stay with family he had there. He arrived on new years eve, and we spent that day and part of the evening together. I didn't stay with him that night, rather I stayed at a friend's house. I kept my meeting with Jarocho a secret, I felt that anyone would think I was insane. 

I saw him for the next two days. We got this very cheap, 70's looking motel room where we laid together and made love all day. He took beautiful photos of me there, and we showed each other songs and movies that we loved. Now, I really did feel absolutely in love with this guy. His family was very kind to me, made amazing food, and he was so romantic and gentle towards me. I didn't think about the age difference, since my understanding was that it wasn't such a taboo thing in Mexico and I knew myself to be more mature for my age. This was three years ago, and it was the last time I saw him. 

Since then, I've dated other people and he has too. We've gone through times of daily communication, to months without a single message to each other. But every time we do talk, he reinforces just how much in love with me he is, how everyone else is temporary and I am his ultimate dream, and how he hopes that one day I will live in Mexico with him and be his wife and have his kids. It's a lot. I find myself in a difficult situation, because I do feel love for Jarocho. The thought of him is very comforting to be, and many nights I have longed to be there with him and nowhere else. 

Just a few months ago, while he was aware that I was in a long term relationship, he got a tattoo of my artwork on him with some meaningful words beside it. A beautiful gesture, but perhaps it freaked me out a bit. 

There is just something that feels so very off about our situation. Maybe it's simply that it is an uncommon one to be in, but I cannot stop wondering how it is possible for him to love me so consistently for three years. I'm one to worry myself sick... I can't leave the country at this moment to see if this relationship is worth pursuing, and we all know it would be very hard for him to come to the US at this point. I just want some second opinions about this situation and what I should do. I have expressed my worries to him many times over, but they don't seem to phase him at all. He is dead set on believing I am his soulmate. I just don't know what to do at this point. Maybe I don't need to do anything, but I'm not satisfied with the thought of wondering about this man for another three years. ",06Feb2019,1

11,"Is it just the PMS talking you guys? :')

Anyway, I recommended a video game to a friend. It's not a pointless shooter, but a story heavy game with ""make your own choices"" thing (for those who know, it's TWD series.) I know she like themes like loss, togetherness and survival. So I thought it would be a  really good choice. I told her that it was episodic. She can stop at episode one or even earlier if she really doesn't like it. Plus, the first episode is free, so it's not like I'm asking her to buy anything. I'd give her my Steam if she'd liked it anyway :'). 

Buuut she totally dismissed it, saying that she doesn't like video games and that she feels it would only waste her time. End of convo.

Aaand ok! But the thing is, I got into this one anime bc of her. And guys I hate anime. A loootttt of them are disappointing and poorly written (not all anime duh, there are gems here and there). Even if the art style is good. The thing is, even though it's not my cup of tea... I still gave it a chance. And I ended up liking it! To the point we talk about it every day.

It just hurts because... I really value her opinions and interests. If she recommends something I will give it a shot because I think she really has good taste and I want to have something nice to talk to her about. What do you guys think?

TLDR I'm butthurt bc a friend won't even try to give my recommendation a shot, even though I watched an entire anime series she recommended me even though I avoid anime like the plague. And ended up liking it.!

16,"So I suppose a bit of context first might help explain my situation for about a year now I've used a proxy website to access to access porn as its blocked on the wifi I use. I don't live in a country where porn is illegal or blocked its just my wifi.

The website I've been using is a list of a variety of different porn websites (around 7) of which I've only ever visited 2. Yesterday for the first time I opened a different website on the list and clicked on a search bar for that website which was mostly obscured by the proxy url. And this is where the pickle-ing began. 

Below the search bar was a single ""suggestion"". My last name. Just there. 

The search bar doesn't seem to work as I have tried entering searches and it has no effect on the list below (it isn't search history) the bar its still just my second name. and when I click on my second name, as dumb as that may have been, nothing happens either. However the site isn't completely unresponsive as clicking on videos on the home page does work.

I'm not to informed on these things. which makes what i had done even more stupid. So i asked a friend who had found me the site after it was brought up that I cant watch porn. Since he had opened it in the past  I worried he may be in the same situation. But when he went to the same site on the list his search ""suggested"" were: msi, asus and hdmi all related to stuff he had been looking at on amazon apparently . which was strange as no further specification was added to them like cable it was just ""hdmi""

the website its self is https which i always thought meant it was secure and safe shows what i know and i have only ever visited it to my knowledge in incognito mode as there is no mention of it in my history anywhere and i never delete it. 

I have ran several virus scans on my computer and phone but everything has came up clean

I have no clue whats going on or if there is any real danger at all from them knowing (maybe) my last name and some search history of my friends.

I would appreciate any advice or info on how bad the situation is and if anything can be done greatly. Im struggling to think about anything else atm. Thank you

19,"I am using a throwaway because I don't want this tracked to me. 

This is in a public school in the U.S

I currently attend one of the most prestigious schools in my State and in the Country. Sorry if my grammar or spelling is off I am mind fucked right from the anxiety and stress because I haven't told my parents and need advice now. This is what happened:

&amp;#x200B;

Basically my  school uses an online system where a student can report their absence online if they are going to be absent from school and their login works where a student enters their unique id number and name and they can report the dates and reason for why they are going to be absent.  

I basically found a list of ID numbers and corresponding names on a teachers website (public) and submitted absence reports for random kids as a prank. I did this on a school computer assigned to me. I didn't think this would be a big deal because they recently announced that the online reporting system is no longer valid and people have to bring in a physical note the next day they return and I wont be caught. The absence reporting system would only send emails to the students teachers and wouldn't excuse the students absence because of the new rule.

My teacher got complaints from students that they were reported as absent and my teacher searched every computers history before class and I got confronted that it was in my browsing history of being on the absence reporting site. He had solid evidence so I gave up and admitted I thought it would be a little prank and I didn't mean any harm. 

I got sent to the Dean and they said I was going to be expelled for "" **Use of any computer, including social networking websites, or use of any information technology device to threaten, stalk, harass, bully or otherwise intimidate others, or hacking into the network to access student records or other unauthorized information, and/or to otherwise circumvent the information security system ""**

I'm pretty sure that using public information found on a public site technically is not ""hacking"" and is a minor prank. I was told by other students that the Dean is bluffing and I won't get suspended. The dean is supposed to meet me again tomorrow to finalize the decision.

22,"Hello, everyone.

I’m in my second year of engineering now and I feel like garbage. I have too many responsibilities piling up to the point I turn inactive and can’t do anything.

Now, I didn’t want to go into engineering. In fact, I wanted to take a year off to make money before going to culinary school, but every time I brought this up with my speech pathologist while my mother was present, my mother would always interject with something like “Well, you could try engineering instead, you only have to do a year, it’s not that hard, you’d be good at it, etc.” and completely dismiss that I wanted to go do something else. Both of my parents are engineers and my older brother and sister both tried engineering but dropped out in favour of arts. The last time I mentioned culinary school, a little under two years ago, my mother told me that in order to do so I would have needed to bake and cook everyday and not just as a hobby, that it needs to be what I was absolutely dedicated to. I felt crushed and so I enrolled in engineering.

As a result, I feel as though I was pressured into engineering because I’m the youngest and my older siblings stopped. Now I have lost interest in what I used to do all the time. I used to paint miniatures almost everyday but now I struggle to get one or two done in just as many months. I only cook or bake maybe three times a year when I used to find any excuse to do so. I used to go online to watch old cartoons from when I was younger but now I always leave them unfinished.

I’m not happy anymore, and the things I used to do to make me happy feel dull or not as enjoyable. I mindlessly scroll through the internet aimlessly for nothing, often closing out of a site only to open it up again to start the whole process over again. I know I should be doing something, even if it is schoolwork, but I can’t find the energy to do anything.

I just want some advice on what I should do to make myself happier without being rude to my parents, especially my mother. She didn’t do this out of malice, I know that, but I do think she was the biggest influencer on my decisions. I just don’t know what to do or say, can anyone help?",06Feb2019,1

25,"the employees at the financial aid office in my college are uneducated &amp; unaware of basic facts that are like the backbone of their job. they have given me misinformation on many separate occassions that led to me being under chronic stress for a month and a half. their ignorance led to me having to scrape up over $1000 in the past month just to keep myself in my classes. each time i asked them a question about my situation, they gave me an incorrect answer that resulted in serious emotional distress, taking out loans from people that i didnt need, sending loans back to someone thinking i didnt need them but then being told that i did, not being able to sign up for the $500 certification exam that is the whole reason i'm at school. i'm through the ringer. every day something new pops up. every time i talk to someone, they tell me something completely different. the misinformation they gave me is completely fucking egregious. it all begins on jan 8th

first they revoked my financial aid. then when i spoke with an advisor regarding an appeal. she laughed in my face; she told me the only way to keep my classes was to pay in full by the deadline (deadline was 2 days after i got the fucking letter saying my shit was revoked) she also told me i would not be able to do a payment plan (which was FALSE) 

i got a loan from my sister and ended up being able to do a payment plan (i was informed of this through student counseling services, not the aid office) and filed an appeal for my financial aid. the financial aid staff told me my appeal would not be processed until feb (which was false, because it was processed before january even ended). they told me that once my financial aid was approved, they would cancel the payment plan and refund my money (which they would later claim was not correct). they would also cancel out the following monthly payments. i operated under the assumption that i wouldnt get approved and spent the past month stressing about money, barely eating and convincing my grandma to loan me the rest of what i would need for my next payment due on feb 5.

financial aid approved my appeal about a week and a half ago. when i saw this, i sent the loan from my grandma right back to her. i figured i was in the clear until a few days later i saw an email from the payment plan service reminding me of the impending $512 withdrawal. confused, i headed to the financial aid office and asked them what i need to do to cancel the payment plan, since it was still set up to withdraw the $512 on the 5th. the girl at the front desk told me that even though my financial aid was approved, i would still have to pay the feb 5 payment since ""financial aid isnt even dispersed until the 28th"". 

at this point, the stress of this situation is fucking me up mentally. one day i think im in the clear and dont owe $512, next day im told i do owe $512 and it's not like i can pull that money out my ass in a day's time. i couldnt get it from grandma in time because i had just sent it back to her and mail doesnt work that fast (she doesnt do paypal, etc she's almost 90 years old)..so i honestly broke down from the stress of this entire situation. had three different meltdowns. it has affected my ability to maintain a positive attitude at work &amp; school very seriously. 

anyways, so i go home and have a melt down over the fact that i now have to pull $512 out of my ass in two days or i will be dropped from my classes. after talking with my family, my sister (who had already loaned me $512 for the down payment on the payment plan) offered to put the feb 5 payment on her credit card as long as i paid her back. i call the business office to have them switch the cards on the payment plan account so it will charge to her credit card not her debit card. keep in mind this 2 days before the payment is actually do. business office redirects me to nelnet, the company that runs the payment plan. they tell me that they cant switch the fucking card because the ""payment was already processed"" since they need 2 business days advance for all transactions? WTF? i tell them if it already withdrew from the card on file, it wont have sufficient funds. they tell me if that's the case they will charge a $30 service fee and try the payment again on the 20th. they say i cannot switch the card on the account. 

so at this point in the story i had until the 20th to come up with the payment. my sister was weary of it automatically withdrawing from her card but she agreed. we asked grandma to send back the 512 so she can put it on her card. grandma sent it back. 

problem solved? NOPE. today while i'm going through my email i see one from nelnet. it says a change was made to my account. i open it and it says ""adjustment"" in one column and ""financial aid"" in the adjacent column. i'm fucking CONFUSED AND SICK OF THIS SHIT, so i go to the business office (separate from the aid office) and ask this lady to explain like im five what the hell is going on. 

the lady proceeds to tell me that my mom called her (so embarrassing) to get the whole thing straightened out. she said that the financial aid office does not communicate with the business office, therefore they didnt know my financial aid had been approved and that's why they kept me on the plan. she said once my mom told her my name she was able to look me up and see that my aid was approved. then she went in &amp; cancelled my payment plan. 

but didnt the bitch in the aid office tell me i still owed the feb 5 payment regardless of my financial aid????????

WHAT THE FUCK. it's been a whole damn month of manic bullshit, stressing about paying for classes that ARE ALREADY PAID FOR...

here is my question
who do i give my letter of complaint to? who needs to read this? who is in charge of training the staff? would it be wrong to go in there myself and say the things i need to say directly to the people who have caused me unnecessary chronic stress and fear for a month straight? 

the bottom line is, they cant get away with this. if i didnt have such a good support system in my family, i would have simply been dropped from my classes and told to fuck off. i would hate for this to happen to someone who doesnt have the same resources that i do. like this is so horrible to go through i dont want anyone else to feel this stress when all theyre trying to do is be better.

26,"I am in high school (16 M.) I’ve known her for three years now and we have been very good friends. In my freshman year, I asked her out, she accepted and we went on a date. It didn’t really go well and she kindly rejected me. We remained good friends, putting our past behind us but I still cant shake the feelings I still have for her. I am a junior now and this past year, I noticed how she looks at me a lot differently, she always initiates conversations now and it is kind of awkward since there seems to be tension. I love spending time with her but I am a little too afraid to make my move. Any advice?",06Feb2019,1
28,"In short; 
me and my best friend are mostly just best friends because of trust, now when we’ve told each other everything there is to know. We realise that we have pretty much no mutual interests and things to do together.



So. Around 5 months ago I met a guy in my school who was really nice and we just started chatting to each other, about our backgrounds and such and before you know it. We’ve told each other everything there is to know about each other.  But we don’t really have any mutual interest. Anything that we really like doing together, we’re together in a 6 people friend group and that’s now becoming the pretty much the only way we’re doing anything together right now. He and the 4 others are together in a class meanwhile im in another one where I don’t really feel like I fit in. 
He fits really well in since he has the four others and the charisma to be anyone’s friend. I feel like he’s always telling me less and less about what’s going on with him and when we’re together we encounter more and more awkward silences. 
Just, any ideas I guess?

34,"The thread might seem somehow empty and vain, but I have a lot of considerations about that recently.  


As in title - I wonder if I lack attention due to the fact I'm a long-haired man. Their length is a bit over my nipples. They are dark-blonded/kinda brown (I struggle at describing colours tbh) and they are wavy.  
In general it is claimed by my friends (and by myself) that long hair suit me, what I find quite unusual for a men, I've got also complimented for my hair in a past multiple times. I also work out for some months and I have a plan to get quite ripped off. I was nicknamed as a ""viking"" on few parties despite being only 5'9"", although I am sometimes mistaken as a girl (when I shave - and I don't have any kind of cool beard or sth) by some strangers and it tends me to annoy me even more, although it happens less common time by time.  


All in all I have a somehow justified feeling that due to the fact that I am long-haired a lot of girls reject me from the very beginning (like being long-haired decreases my dating pool 3 or 4 times?). I somehow lack any closer contact with girls for 2 years or so and makes me feel even worse. One of my 2019 Resolutions was to begin coping with women much better as I supposed to in a past, thus I want to limit any potential downsides of me and I wonder if long hair really kill it that much. Few of my more f-word-boyish friends agreed with me.  
I have tried out Tinder recently and albeit I haven't scored that badly - 25-30 matches during a month (and even met one girl recently) or so as I own it, but at the moment I struggle with getting them and still some of them are somehow far-fetched (for example I turn right girls that are placed highly out of my distance range simply to score, as I know they've probably liked me), as and I don't really find it satisfying. The patience is the key, but I have a feeling, that with a shorter hair I would be much more successful in this area.  
Especially combined with a fact that I begin to be more attached with somehow more ""standard"" environment and tend to attend some rock/metal shows and pubs much less frequently the feeling gets strengthened.  


On the other hand I find it quite hard to abandon a vision of being a ripped off viking-alike and getting more masculine, that doesn't really seem distant and in a future would probably increase my dating pool. I also don't like the idea of adjusting to the tastes of the girls, but maybe it would be for the best and would make my life easier if it had improved my attractiveness. I would be also somehow sentimental towards cutting my hair off, but everything passes. And also - I don't know how much it is the fact that I do not have the looks of a male model - if I really had to rate myself, I would give myself 6/10 or so and it would be fair I bet.  


Should I cut them and would cutting them really improve my attractiveness in the eyes of the girls?

  
PS if somebody was curious how I look like, I'm not going to post my photo, but I will say that I look somehow like young Tom G. Warrior  (metal fans should know this name) at this photo, but with much less turtle-like features, more oval face, less sharp chin and stronger built.

35,"I would extremely appreciate advice on this. I don't have anyone I can turn to for advice at the moment.

I put details of the break up at the bottom because its very long and personal (but i guess this question can only be answered depending on the context of the relationship??)

1 year ago from today my ex and I broke up. She's someone I genuinely love and is perfect for me in so many ways. I can't help but think how shitty my life was all of last year and how perfect it would've been had we stayed together. I want to message her how I regret my actions and breaking up with her was the worst decision I've ever made.

Is this a bad idea? If not, how do I express myself without sounding soo.....desperate? pitiful? (My vocabulary is not that extensive)

Background (This might be a little long, I'm sorry) :

I will start this prior to where I believe our relationship started to go down. Prior to this it was amazing and I had never been happier in my life.

Its August of 2018 and we have been dating for about 1yr&amp;3mo. She was in her home state for the summer working and I was working doing research at university. When I picked her up from the airport and saw her for the first time she told me she had to admit something to me. A few weeks ago this guy she knew (before we dated - also our classmate) was interning in the city by hers so they got together one night to hang and they ended up making out. Nothing more. I definitely believed her and was happy she didn't lie \*\*BUT\*\* unfortunately I am obsessively insecure about my social/sex life and she knows this and as much as I tried maintaining a clear head it bothered me to an extent and trust issues/jealousy were beginning to form.

However, I loved this woman and I kept thinking ""all they did was kiss it's not big deal"" and I did not want to lose her over a stupid drunken mistake that she made, feels absolutely terrible for, and told me first chance she got in person. She screwed up and handled in the best way possible i think. How else do you try to fix relationship when you screw up like that? Most lie and she didn't. I still loved her and wanted to date her and we did for that semester ( Fall 2018 at the time and were now seniors) however during that period I noticed trust issues being formed, me declining her for sex more often, and bringing ""him"" up sometimes in arguments not related. She even said she wished she never told me about ""him"" that how often we fought about this. It was a rocky semester and looking back I'm sure i was verbally abusive about it during my emotional phase.

Come last semester of senior year and ""he"" is back at school after 6mo internship. We got in a BIG fight that pretty much resulted in we need to stop these outrageous arguments or break up. She was right. I thought about it long and hard the next day and decided I was going to be a better boyfriend and make our relationship strong again. I no longer cared about insecurities of ""how I've only been with x number of woman"" (which is so stupid to think of even though it still bother me now) while my partner and others have had more experiences at my age.

You ever have those moments you just \*\*completely\*\* change your mindset? Mine was 100% for the better. I went over to my girlfriends house, we talked. I asked her if she was talking to him or texting him and she said no and I believed her. I wanted to believe her. I loved her so goddamn much and we have a very successful future together. We had amazing sex. After, while she was in the shower I was sitting there in bed SO SO SO HAPPY about my life and excited for the future. I had quit smoking weed too because a of job so that means I could go out even more with her!

\*\*THIS IS WHERE SHIT HITS THE FUCKING FAN AND I RUIN MY FUCKING LIFE\*\*

While im waiting for her to shower, I see her apple watch next to me. I was hesitant and part of me didn't want to touch it. I believed her and told her I was going to improve myself. No snooping. But (and fuck my life for this) to solidify this pure feeling of happiness I opened her watch and only scrolled to see if I'd find ""his"" name. I didn't read anything else. Immediately my heart sinks. My happiness is faded and an emotional tsunami overwhelms me. I see ""his"" name. I open the messages and it nothing a but her sending him a bunch of drunk texts at 2 am saying things like:

""hey"" , ""are we okay?"" , ""whats up??"" a bunch of times late at night when shes drunk and he almost never replies.

But what stuck out the most was ""Low key I miss you"".

Reading that destroyed me. I kept my cool when she got out of the shower, I went home, immediately went into a mental fiasco with myself as to what I should do. I was DEEPLY IN LOVE with this girl yet felt so BETRAYED. I still wanted to date her at the same time I felt like I'd be viewed as a pussy by others or don't respect myself well enough if I decided to stay with someone who is texting a guy she hooked up with that makes me feel shitty. Being alone with these thoughts was very dangerous and I pretty much drove myself to the ultimatum that she stops talking to ""him/ texting""him"" or we break up (more prepared to breakup i think) . I went over to her house furious and immediately started yelling how I found the messages (which she coincidentally deleted in the few hours I wasn't at her place) and gave her the ultimatum She said no. She said I can't control who she talks to and I cant force her not to talk/see him. In my rage I YELLED I WANT TO BREAK UP and left and all I hear is the loudest scream ever and crying behind me. I couldn't believe what I did i was still an emotional mess, crying, and had zero idea if what I did was right or not. I do know I yelled louder and harder than ever its the thing that I regret so much. I wish i put more thought and time into it. After that, we don't talk the whole weekend until Monday when I go over to talk and she breaks up with me. Since then my life has been depressing and reflecting back on 2018 it all could've been avoided had I not snooped or freaked out on her.

I love her so much. I want to marry her, have a family with her. She did things that I don't think anyone could do. I've never connected with anyone more. I want to tell her these feelings and I want to be with her \*\*BUT\*\* at the same time my insecurities multiplied when we broke up and since then my life has been depressing and I know (through a mutual friend) shes been going out and hooking up with guys. Getting back with her now would make it feel like we took a break from our relationship and during that break i did nothing while she ""explored"" and then we got back together. Makes me want to try and dating/""exploring"" before getting back with her even though I really want to (Or is this not normal and I'm being delusional)? I think i'm finally gonna try and start therapy about this and my other insecurities.

I guess I'm looking for a consensus/validation on if i royally fucked up or not.

I've never been so lost and could really use some help. This is my first ever relationship and she was my first for alot of things. Im 23M

Should I message her?

What can I do to improve myself as well?

Guess i should mention I'm also a sensitive guy that was bullied pretty hard b/t in middle/high school and its affects me still so please don't be dick but I guess i need a punch to the face from the hard truth.

Now I'm realizing that I got into this relationship really fast after my last relationship which was 10 year horrible emotionally abusive relationship.  My current boyfriend is such a great guy and everything my ex wasn't.  Supportive, kind, easy to talk to, and so much more.  I really feel that he has taught me what a real relationship could be like.  However, he has had back surgery and is very overweight, which prevents him from doing a lot of things.  I'm overweight myself but have recently lost 40 lbs and am working on losing more.  Even at my heaviest though I was more active then him.  His back and weight prevent him from doing things like walking in sand, going to the snow, going camping, or even just walking for more then say 15 mins at a time.  There are a lot of adventures that I would like to have that he will never be able to participate in (he says because of his back although I think his back pain is made way worse by his weight) that I can't imagine never being able to do again.  I want someone I can do these things with and whose idea of a good weekend isn't laying around all day every day, every weekend (a netflix and chill day are great sometimes but not every weekend).  We also don't have the best sex.  He doesn't have the biggest penis and because of his back the only way we can have sex is if  I am on top (which is my least favorite of positions) the rest of our love making is great, but the actual sex part has never actually worked (meaning he has never come during sex) he says this is also a problem caused by his back surgery.  This also is very worrisome for me as I would really like to have a child someday and I'm not sure that he can actually get me pregnant.

To make matters worse we have discussed moving in together (actually supposed to already have happened but he backed down due to not being as stable as he would like at work), getting married, and having kids and up until about a couple weeks ago I was totally on board with that.

We did not talk alot in 5th grade but we once talked for like a full day because i was helping her with something and she kept crying so i confronted her.
Then i stopped having a crush on her for 2 years but then it suddenly came back, and we started talking and laughing.
After like a semester of us talking my friends keep pointing out that she likes me and stuff but i stupidly say this exact same line “dude look at me, im like a thousand miles away  but these 2 other friends are like what 2 miles away”

Same stuff happened at 8th grade but at 9th grade, it looks like i am invisible to her, she doesnt respond to any text, i even once tried to say hi to her when school finished but she bolted out of there real quick, but she is going along fine with lots of other people i was confused but i continued to move on with my friends.

However, my course is very intense and I’m finding it really hard to keep on top of my work and complete it the standard I would want to, because I don’t have the time to spend hours in the library. I’m also the only full time student on the program who has a job as far as I know, and feel that everyone else has time to do so much more research than me.

48,"Hello,

i just have a question about registering my artist name as a trademark in North America at least or worldwide.

I am from Canada and I noticed that my country is not a partaker in ""The Madrid Protocol"", which the USA partakes in. my understanding is that this protocol would allow you to trademark your name in many countries worldwide at once instead of filing for every country individually...

So my questions are:

-I want to be trademarked AT LEAST in Canada and the USA. If I file for my trademark in Canada and it gets approved, would I also be able to apply or already be covered in the USA?

-Since Canada doesn't partake in the ""Madrid Protocol"" would my trademark only be valid in Canada? Is there some other protocol Canada partakes in that would trademark me in the USA, and perhaps worldwide instead of having to apply for individual countries?

-Lastly, would it just be better to apply for my trademark in the USA only, then use this ""Madrid Protocol"" to cover my in Canada and in the other member countries?

TLDR: I'm just trying to avoid paying multiple unnecessary fees, and just want to know which country is best to apply in and what protocols I can take advantage of in order to AT LEAST cover my trademark in Canada/USA, and better yet worldwide.

I am currently prescribed Adderall (ADHD), Zoloft (Depression), Lamictal (Mood swings) and Gabapentin (Anxiety). I was emotionally and physically abused for most of my pre-adolescent childhood and am still to this day mainly by my Dad still verbally/emotionally abused. Ok now that I got that outta the way its time to share my problem. Simply put every time ANYTHING goes well for me I get super depressed and feel like I don’t deserve it. Even if I know deep down I do I still feel like shit and feel strangely positive when in a failure. These days I just kinda loaf around my room watching youtube and playing video games which is honestly the only thing keeping me sane. I bring this onto myself a lot as well as in I put a lot of my time and effort into doing something that I want to improve in and when I excel at it I get bored and depressed. I tend to overthink things and actually am aways thinking which is what I call constant “brain fog.” For example around 4 months ago there was this girl I liked very much and spent a ton of time hanging out with her and it was on and off great or absolute shit. Whenever I went up in “friendship status” I started to feel depressed and worthless. Eventually she asked me out on a date and I accepted and was very excited. The night of the date a wave of depression washed over me.

I have some form of self hatred and I subconsciously feel depressed whenever I advance in the thing I wanted to do good in. I hate being complimented as well as being angry or depressed the majority of the time. Not to sound edgy or whatever but if it wasn’t for my anxiety I probably would’ve killed myself by now.

if u need clarification just ask",06Feb2019,1

I need some advice about a situation that happened in class today. The class started normally, and the professor began talking about the upcoming midterms we have this week in class. While the professor was talking about midterms he changed topics to make a point targeting a student in our class who is disabled and requires extra help. The professor targeted the student by making a statement targeting the student for making a mistake in booking the exam accommodations. The student though the exam was going to be Tuesday and Thursday of this week when in reality the exam is this upcoming Thursday and the following Tuesday. The part of the professor’s comments that really crossed the line I think was when he mentioned the students email date mix-up in front of the whole class and said that all the students with disabilities need to “Check their damn syllabus” since the mix-up caused extra effort for nothing. I find my professors comments and behavior in handling the matter absolutely disgusting because the student made a mistake with the dates and did not deserve to be called out in class and have the class laugh at their mistake. In my opinion the professor’s comments where completely uncalled for and unfairly targeted the student with disabilities. I strongly believed that the matter should have been dealt with behind closed doors and not spoken out loud to the entire lecture hall to hear and laugh at.  I am looking for some advice because I want to do something about the situation like report it to the school, but I am afraid of repercussions and would love some advice on what to do about the situation.

57,"Hello all. Large chance I am going to sound like an idiot, but whatever here it goes. Directly after college I moved to the San Francisco bay area with my boyfriend as he got a really good job, and I had never left my hometown and wanted a chance to explore &amp; try something new. I have a psychology degree, but as soon as I moved here I applied to hundreds of jobs only to realize that it would be exceptionally challenging to find a position in my field without having a master's or PhD, especially in such a competitive location. The only jobs I could find up my alley were ABA therapy positions which I would have loved, but I do not have a car or proof of auto insurance, which most of those jobs ask for. Long story short, I started to look for anything that would make me money. I applied to a random ""account executive"" job for some marketing company. I am a pretty smart person, sometimes naive, but not usually. I knew I didn't want to be doing any sort of door-to-door sales. None of what the job description said was accurate, AT ALL. It was a complete lie.  


I got my first interview. Went in, very plain big room with two board rooms attached. I assumed there were more offices in the back. Everyone is dressed really nicely. There are about 7 other people waiting to get interviewed. Finished my interview, got a call that night or the next morning saying that they really liked me and saw something that really stood out about me. Got a final  call telling me I got it, and that I would have to come in to sign papers and what not. That was a Friday morning. I emailed back IMMEDIATELY and asked that the files be sent over ahead of time so that a lawyer and such could take a look at it, as this seems completely standard. No response that WHOLE entire day, or Saturday (they worked Saturday's), or even for the few hours they had before I came in Monday they didn't email either.  Keep in mind I was desperate for a job, and this was going to be my FIRST real job out of college, so I truly did not know what to look for or expect in terms of the contract and everything- WHICH IS WHY I WANTED IT AHEAD OF TIME. I went in. The 'receptionist' gave me all these documents and then literally after two minutes was like, ""are you all set?""  I just told her absolutely not and that I had a bunch of questions?! It seemed pretty insane. Then I go in with the dude that interviewed me the whole time. Felt like I was in the Twilight Zone, no joke. I asked about NORMAL things not covered such as healthcare, PAY...really just the most normal things ever. He acted so confused, he was like, ""what do you mean we've told you all of this"" and all this crap. I don't even know man. I went back out, tried to read the rest of it to the best of my ability, and saw one part that said at any time I can leave without consequence so I was like whatever, what do I have to lose.

&amp;#x200B;

After about a week of standing in Best-Buy asking people about their fucking Xfinity cable (they did NOT disclose this is what we'd be doing at all lol) I realized this was definitely a pyramid scheme. They were just a bunch of younger people trying to dress up mad classy and push it into your face that the more successful you are, the more you can live some sort of fairy tale life. I don't know, it was so so fucking cringe. They'd like put us in this room before leaving for our assigned best-buy stores and blast electronic pop music mad loud and like jump up and down and yell to ""amp everyone up"". All we did was repeat the same fucking three sentences to everyone that walked by in whatever store we were in. Barely any customers would pay us any attention...because who the fuck wants to stop and talk about everybody's least favorite thing to pay for- CABLE. 

&amp;#x200B;

The boss also kept talking me up, and he was actually my person I'd go with each day (every new person had a mentor). Because of this I actually at first thought I was special lol. But after a while he just kept being like ""you should really start wearing heals to work so people take you very seriously"". He wanted me to work really hard so that I could open my own branch of this business. That's what these people always told us new people. That if we worked really hard, we'd be able to open up more of these businesses all over. They told everyone this bull. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is getting too long, but yeah I just decided to quit. OH YEAH, by the way. This job was supposed to be hourly wage + commission. However, they do not pay you for the first two weeks at all, nor do you get commission. Well, I never ever got paid &amp; found out that everyone else who got scammed didn't either, through looking at Glassdoor (which by the way I looked it up before going for the job and there was nothing there until after lol). I worked 7:30 am-6:30 pm monday-sat. So essentially, they know they're hiring with the idea that most people will quit due to such shitty working conditions, and so by each new person having a mentor, whatever sales they DO make within their first two weeks goes to them. So this is probably how they ran their business. BUT, I looked recently and they shut down HAHA.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind, they always told us there were other sister businesses, and they did mention one nearby. BTW, one time my boss was like yeah I created the name of this business (the one we specifically worked at), and I was like wait aren't they all called the same thing. He looked at me super confused looking and goes, ""if you had a business would you want someone else naming it?"" and i was sorta just like well no, but this isn't your fucking business it is a chain started by someone else (who by the way we video chatted with and is a LAWYER from AUSTRALIA). Holy fuck. Sorry this is so long and I hope someone will read it all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I got a W2 for some business name I've never worked for. I looked it up online and nothing legit comes up...only thing I see is mentioning of pyramid schemes, and of the company being in the nearby place I mentioned they had told us they had another business (with a different name). 

&amp;#x200B;

I basically don't know what to do. This may sound really stupid but if I file it, and it is some sketchy business, will I get in trouble? Or if it is already on an ADP earnings summary is it good to go, and not on me if there are any issues? Or should I try to contact the state somehow? No number coming up for said business.

58,"I was not sure where to post this , so I posted it in this sub. Also English is not my first language so bear with me please. 

The ages given in the title are in real time ...the ages back then were I (14), older brother (16), younger sister (9f)

I still remember  opening the bedroom door prior to dinner to see what my older brother was doing and the shock and horror I felt it was like I was struck by lightening I didn't know what to say or to do, I crawled back to my room which I shared with my older brother and stood there like a dead person, since then I didn't talk to anyone about this. I guess I wanted to think that it didn't happen that it's not possible I wanted to believe that it was not true. And also, I couldn't have possibly talked about this to anyone.  I come from a third world country and this would have destroyed my parents so that was not an option to tell them, I didn't want/couldn't speak to my younger sister who till now I don't know the devastation it had on her. 

Life continued ""normally"" after that , we all pretended like nothing had happened, which meant on the surface, I had to pretend nothing changed and still talked to him and get along fine.  Older brother got a good education and a job, got married and now has kids and a functioning family and is settled in another country. He is also the older brother so my family consult him with a lot of issues and he regularly helps with family finances. I also moved to a first world county ( scholarship ) to obtain an education and have graduated and plan to stay their for at least the next 10 years or so. My younger sister , the one who was involved in this accident, is back home with the rest of family, other 4 younger sisters and another younger brother. 

This has been eating me from inside ever since , I lived with my older brother through the rest of high school and university life and I had to pretend nothing happened, I couldn't do or say anything. I think I was a coward. He is quite loveable , sociable and successful in his life, my family and relatives like him and he seems completely normal. 

Growing up, we were the two oldest siblings, with only two years gap and we used to do everything together, football, games studying and there was a big gap between us two and the rest of the siblings who came later. My parents had some difficulties with some finance, we used to get beaten up sometimes which is quite common in third world countries but we managed fine we had a house and bills were always paid on time. It was not a very happy home but it was an Ok home most of the time. 

As I said no matter how much I wanted to forget this, I just couldn't and it still pops up in my head most of the time.  One year ago, I was under a lot of guilt and hate for my older brother so I sent him a long text to tell him that I was cutting him out of my life for what he did and that he is never my brother and never to contact me again. An hour later I texted him saying I regret that text, he says he hasn't read it. Cutting  him out completely was not possible as I had to visit my parents and he was there. But ever since that text our relationship is no existent, he knows deep down that I never want to talk to him and we have not talked in over three months. All that pretending I had to do over the past 11 years, I don't have to do now. 

What hurts me the most is the effect that this on my sister, which I never talked to her about. Growing up in that culture sex was a taboo conversation to talk about. I think there was no sexual penetration but they were both fully unclothed and doing something. She is now at uni at home and due to graduate in a year.Also, that's when the family is planning to get her  married, arranged marriage but she has met the guy and there is a period of engagement to see if they get on with each other. 


I don't know what am hoping by posting this, I have never told this to anyone and don't know what to do. Family reunion with all of us is unlikely, and my relationship with my brother is now non-existent and will be so unless I initiate contact him with him again. I am not prepared to talk about this with him or with my sister. Like the conversation would just hurt me so much. 

tl;dr. 12 years ago I walked on my brother aged 16 having sex with younger sister (9f) and couldn't talk about it to anyone out of fear/shame/disgust shock. 12 years later the three of us are different countries and all seems normal on the surface but no one know that I and my brother don't talk anymore.

59,"I read into things far too much and normally assume the worst every time. Here's a recent example:

About 2 months ago my friend posts on reddit about how he has a crush for the first time in 3 years. More recently I've begun talking to him more, and told him a few things that nobody else knows. He's my closest friend and he knows it. One day he posts on Instagram referencing the crush, specifically, 'sir(maam) please...'. This aligns with me because I recently came out to him as trans. Our conversations have been slightly more flirty, I guess as well. There are other things but this has gone on long enough. Point is, the obvious thing is this isn't about me, as I have asked him out before and he's said he doesn't feel the same (we're both bi/pan so sexuality isn't a problem). However I can't shake the idea that it is about me, even when it's not

You can see that I make huge leaps in assumptions and always assume, even when I know it's irrational to do so. How do I stop this (or at least lessen it)?",06Feb2019,1
60,"I moved into my apartment a week ago but we signed the lease and were doing stuff in the apartment since the middle of last month. The whole time, my upstairs neighbors have been crazy loud and often fight. I also think they are helping care for some of the kids in the complex. I've been able to time their dinner time and sleep patterns by the noise level.  None of that bothers me at all. I'm used to noise so it only gets annoying every once in a while.

They fight at least once a day and the kids scream and cry often. Tonight, there was mostly silence interspersed by occasional banging in the back room. It's just eerie. I mean maybe they are out tonight. But this is my first apartment and I have no context about what to do in this or other situations here. I am also afraid to just walk up and ask why they aren't making any noise.

63,"So my best friend and I have known each other since preschool. We're both currently freshman in high school and things have gotten rough. I never knew her as a person who openly expressed their feelings but it's gotten a bit worse. 

Recently, before school started, her mother who's raised the children by herself, suffered a stroke. Her other sisters have moved out after graduating high school and so she is now her mom's main caregiver. Her mother came home as soon as she was able to but my friend stayed with another friend for the mean time.

 It's been a few months and everything is looking good so far but she's been kind of emotional lately, which is something I've never seen from her. But that's not the problem. We both joined the bowling team this year and ever since she got on varsity, she's been really stressed. Whatever she starts to do bad or bowels below her average, she breaks down. She'll cry over something that seems so small and insignificant. 

Once again, however, that's not the problem. The problem is this. Whenever I try to comfort her, she tells me to stop. No matter what I do, it's wrong and it doesn't make her feel any better. Lately I've just not done anything but whenever I don't do anything, her new varsity friends always swoop in and save the day. They do the same things I do but, for some reason, she actually smiles and laughs when they do it. It's genuine and I should know. I used to be able to get her to laugh like that but I don't know what's happened. 

I've always been there for her as much as I possibly could and I do just about everything for her, no joke. I take care of her trash whenever she asks and I always try to buy her a little something whenever I have the cash since she's always been so nice to me, even when no one else was. I ask her what I can do to help, how I can make her smile again but she's really dismissive. It never used to be like this. Have I done something wrong?

64,"My father had a stroke last year, in part due to his long term alcoholism. He's 57 and worked at a construction company that was unionized. 

The reason I bring this up is because it's becoming a huge burden to try and help my father get better.

When he had the stroke, the doctor said he had a very good chance to recover his movement. The right side of his body lost most of the mobility but with therapy, we were assured he had a very good chance at recovery.

Well, he lives in Los Angeles with his sister and I live about 2 hours out. He and his sister speaks very poor English. This has led to him not receiving the care or help he needs.

His doctor refused to sign off on more disability even though he can't work due to him not receiving physical therapy. Everytime I set up an appointment for his physical therapy, he somehow can't make it and it never gets rescheduled. 

I did his paperwork for his pension from the union, and now he's worried he won't be eligible for medi-cal if he gets his disability reinstated.

I just want him to live in a place where they will take care of his medications and dietary needs. I don't know if it's possible because of the income he will receive from his disability and pension.

Right now he's not getting any assistance, which I believe is due to the doctor not extending his disability status. We got a new doctor and now just waiting for an appointment.

I'm just so lost and have no idea who I can talk to that could explain and help fix all the paperwork so that he just focuses on getting better.",06Feb2019,1

I first had the flu, which I then contracted bronchitis and an ear infection a week and half later. I’ve been consistently sick and it’s driving me insane.

I finished my round of antibiotics a few days ago and they are still working through my system. The infection in my ear has subsided although there is still fluid and discomfort. 

My abs hurt from coughing initially which happens. But now I am suffering severe pain behind my ribs/infront of my lungs. I’m sure it’s just the muscles being exhausted from the coughing,  but it legitimately feels like I’m being stabbed in the rib if I breath too deep or let out the slightest cough. This has been for a few days.

I’m just so sad. I can’t even cry because of the pain of breathing. I’ve been in severe pain or very uncomfortable for almost three weeks straight. I have reached the point where I’m convinced I won’t get better. Nothing feels ok anymore, and all I want is to be unconscious. I feel so deeply depressed, and honestly just fucking victimized by my body at this point. This is the most pain I’ve been in, and I don’t know if I bruised my ribs or what but I can’t function normally. I’ve been trying to get out of bed and be a person because my two weeks of solid isolation really hurt my soul. But that seemingly is making it worse and I’m not a good person to be bed ridden, I always have to be occupied and fidgeting.

The only other option is street parking. Thus far, we have operated on a first-come, first-served basis with the spot, and each of us has ended up using it roughly equally over the 6 months we both have been here. We have 6 months left of our lease.

I am conflicted because part of the reason I rented this apartment was the promise of off-street parking. Sharing the spot has not bothered me thus far because I knew that this was part of the deal from the get-go but I am not sure I want to park on the street 100% of the time, for the same reasons that she is now requesting full access to the spot, minus being pregnant.

Street parking is spotty as it is right now, as I am in the midwest and we just got through that terrible snowstorm and our streets have been shitty. I do want my neighbor to be safe because I do care about her and her pregnancy, and I want things to remain good between her and I because she has been a pretty fantastic neighbor except for one or two things that I decided I can deal with.

Yes, I realize how small of a problem this is. I am just looking for perspectives before I make a decision, which could go either way at this point, as I can kind of understand why she is pushing (not asking) for special treatment.

80,"So I work for a huge company.  My office consists of about 50 ppl. 4 bosses for each department.  We are all around the USA but this is just my office.  Well I over heard a few ladies saying derogatory comments about me.  It shocked me due to they knew I was right there and could hear them but they don’t care.  I went to my boss and told her what was said.  She told me I should find out why they would say that.  Confront them... Well I took two of them in the conference room, the ones talking about me. I did it very professionally but I wasn’t able to get anything out because one of them told me they didn’t have time to play with me the other one stormed out the room.  The one that stayed continued to tell me she isn’t my friend we just work together.  I wasn’t trying to be her friend I was trying to see why they would talk about me and if I did anything to them to deserve it.  I just let her rant on whatever she had to say which had no point in what I was trying to talk to her about then she got up and left.  It was pointless and she was rude telling me I shouldn’t run and cry to my boss about it.  I didn’t once cry I was being professional.  It was pointless.  Well I went back to my boss and told her how it went and what was said.  She agreed that they were bullying me and we needed to nip this in the bud.  So she decided to schedule a meeting with all 3 of us letting us all know it would be at 2 pm.  That day Thursday.  Well the one who ranted left for the rest of the day so boss rescheduled for the following Monday.   When Monday came it was a mess.  They made up lies about me which I informed them they are lying.  They prepared stories.  One girl took my information out of my trash can to say I don’t share my work and showed the boss., That backfired on her.  No one ask me for anything but lied and said they did.  Which extra work can be taken from anyone in that office.  That was extra work she took out the garbage at the end of the day. these ladies do not speak to me never ask for anything but lied and said they did.  Then the one who said I’m not her friend told my boss I don’t even tell her hi in the morning.  It was petty crap  and both of them ended up yelling at my boss which she yelled back.  Nothing got resolved other then she saying at the end of the month I will be training for my new position and will be moved.  She also is trying a new way to hand out work which we all go to our lead to grab a paper when we complete another.  So the bullying has not stopped at all.  I sit at my desk while they talk about me but don’t mention my name just make rude evil comments.  Saying how basically I’m childish and now they are treated like kids, which is there own fault.  The meeting wasn’t about work they diverted from their bullying.  Also other random comments. I came home today feeling like crap.  I want to move away from where my desk is( cubicles 4 seats with our backs to each other.  The 3rd lady came back to work today she was sick Monday, well I the nice person I am told her she would need to get her papers from The lead now.  No one else other than me was there in the group.  She completely ignored me.  I know she had talk to the other two.  
My problem is they are still being unprofessional even claimed to call HR because they can’t finish their numbers now because walking to someone to ask for a paper must be so hard on them. BS.  They don’t do their work just run their mouths.  I try to wear my ear phones and I get things done and then some.  They are jealous.  
Problem I am having is they haven’t stopped, idk if they were even reprimanded for yell at our boss.  She did have to take them in the office after the meeting but considering they don’t shut their mouths and is belittling  me to everyone they can, idk what to do.  I know HR is my next move, or should I sit there and wait til the end of the month to move up?  I have a nice boss who I respect but if she didn’t do anything about what they did to her (I’m assume) hoe can I know she will help me.  From fellow workers this isn’t the first time these two woman have bullied people, nothing was done in the past.  I am apparently the new one they choose, plus I am new I’ve been there a year and love my job.  I’m moving up while they choose to stay were they are.  
Should I suck it up and wait? Or go tell the boss they haven’t stopped and I’m starting to feel sick with this crap at work.

81,"   My parents divorced 4 years ago after almost 15 years of marriage and 2 sons. The couple weeks before there divorce the slept in seperate rooms.
At the time I had no idea what could've caused it, our life seemed perfect.

    There have been instances over the past 4 years that lead me to believe that my mom cheated on my dad. 
    For example; sometime after my mom moved out she announced to me and my little brother that she was seeing a man. A couple years later when we(my little brother and I) were eating out with my dad and grandma my mom walked into the restaurant with her the man. 
     My dad yelled at them to the get the fuck out of the restaurant. After they turned around he said to us,""That man is the reason we're divorced"". At least thats how I remember it. Needless to say the night was ruined and I went home teary eyed. 
       
       She left the new man after a couple years.  I've seen her being picked up by other men and come home to them in the house a couple times. This has increased in the past year. 
  
     Until now I have pushed this down and not talked to anyone. But on Sunday my dad helped me tear out the plaster to find a pipe in my moms house. She left well we were doing this. My dad told me today that he saw her get into a car with another man. He rarely yells, but this was to much. He's been saying he wont help her with any repairs around the house for a while but, I think this was the last straw.

   I'll admit im disgusted too. I almost cried for what was probably the first time since the incident in the restaurant.  I have to go back to her house in a few minutes, they live less than a block apart. 


    So heres my question. How do I prevent myself from blowing up on her when she gets mad at me agian, as she often does. I fear this will become a serious problem in the future. 
      
    I just hope my little brother hasn't figured out whats happened...

Tl;DR I'm pretty sure my parents divorced because my mom cheated on my dad. Im compressed this until today when I found out she went out with another man while my dad was helping me fix her plumbing.

P.S. any advice is appreciated. Please tell me if there is a better subreddit for this. This is the first time I've reached out for anything this serious.

About 24 hours ago, a bat randomly flew into my living room from who knows where.  We were too spooked and clueless to know what to do, and abandoned the house to go to my in-laws (we have a baby we were worried about).  My father in law and I came back and opened the screen door and turned most of the lights out as we waited 45 min for the bat to be drawn out, but didn’t see it again.  I took off work today and we searched and searched and searched this house, but didn’t find anything.  Now I’m not sure if it’s safe to sleep here.  I realize it’s rare a bat has rabies, but I’m also not sure how to move forward at this point living this house.  Also wondering if this bat could have gotten back out the way it came in, or if it could be dead now.  I have a cat too, who is usually pretty good at tracking pests and was after the bat when it entered the living room.  Appreciate any help you can give.  Thanks",06Feb2019,1

86,"Hello Everyone,

I have been thinking since 3 years that if I am the father of my ex's son. We broke up in nastier way. She was pregnant and married already at that time. She had husband when our relationship was going on. They warned me that they would call 911 and police if they see me again in their vicinity. 

The breakup was very emotional for me and it took toll on me in many ways. She was my colleague. And I resigned while she was 6 months pregnant 3 years ago. 

I have been thinking to contact them first but I was afraid as they warned me and I was afraid that i would lose my H1 visa  if something becomes critical. 

I just cannot live properly and it is taking emotional thoughts thinking that her son might be mine. I just cannot let him leave there. 

I am mentioning religion only to find if that plays part. 
I am Hindu. Working in USA on H1
She is Sikh, Indian born. Came to USA 5 years back. And was about to get USA citizenship. Now she is USA citizen. 

1. Should I contact lawyer for this and proceed legally?
2. Can I get to see him if I am the father
3. Do they have right to reject my request?
4. Can they file defamation case on me?

Hey reddit. I’m an 18 year old male and ever since I was a kid I used to follow the latest fashion trends and such. As I got older I started getting more into self recognition, mindfulness, meditation, Buddhism, and spirituality. What you like usually reflects in the way you dress most of the time. Well I like to show this, plus the clothes I wear are really comfortable. The only thing I have been told though is “you look like a hippie” “your shoes are funny” “you look funny”. I usually wear a handmade poncho (“drug rug”) or a handmade native American hoodie with a pair of jeans or pants (dark green, dark blue, etc.). My shoes are handmade moccasins. I like wearing my Mala beads and my spirit animal necklace and bracelets. I feel happy when I dress the way I do. But everyone tells me I look like a stoner hippie. I feel like most of the time when people look at me they are just looking at how I appear since I sort of stand out. The thing is, I know what I wear is not stylish, or up too par with today’s fashion standards, but I like it. I’m a clean person, I don’t smell bad, I take great care of my hygiene and what not. But it’s hard attracting women i guess because the way I dress. I don’t look “dirty” either, just different.

In the last few years I lost all my friends and my boyfriend. I do think that I can be funny, but I don’t ever feel that close connection with anyone where I can share jokes because I know they won’t think it’s funny.

Long story short, I made a huge mistake that I now realize.  I'd been demonizing a sweet and kind person because I became disillusioned months ago about something.  She and I had been close friends for a couple of months when this occurred.  Now, of course, she won't speak to me and I am entirely cut off, and I definitely deserved that.  Recently, the fallout has led to everyone I used to call friends leaving me and cutting ties.  It's one of those things where I didn't realize what I was doing was wrong until the aftermath.  I have nothing left.  My social life was borderline pathetic as it is, now it is nonexistent.  There's not really anyone for me to go to, to explain why I did what I did, how I was wrong, and how much I regret it.

Last time I went to see him he basically, in a roundabout way, stole the dog I raised from a puppy.

&amp;#x200B;

I am having a huge internal conflict. My husband and I are 31 with no kids of our own, no house to sell and no real attachment to the State itself that we both grew up in. We want to relocate from Michigan to Oregon. I feel extremely guilty for leaving my immediate family. We've been considering this move for a very long time and I always knew out of my entire family my Mom would have the hardest time with me moving away, so I stayed where I was.

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly, my Mom passed away very suddenly in August from cancer. Since she's been gone I've been thinking about moving and getting a fresh start more and more. I talked to my Dad about it and he fully supports us. My younger brother does too. My sister absolutely does not. She has been trying to convince me to move back to my home town ever since I moved 45 minutes away two years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

She keeps telling me that I won't be any happier anywhere else, I'll run into the same issues in our new location and once I move I will regret it. She's really laying on the guilt thick, which I don't need since I'm already doing it to myself. I also have a teenage nephew that I'm super close with and I feel like he would take our move pretty hard. I feel like I would be putting another loss on our family, but I want to start a new chapter in my life so badly.

I don't know what to do. I haven't ever really been one to take risks or go on a huge adventure and I don't want to regret staying where I am later on in my life. I feel like this year would be the time for my husband and I to move if we were ever going to do it. He's 100 % ready to leave the state. His family would be sad if we left, but supports our decision.

Hi all!

After four challenging years, I have graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science! Hooray! There's only one small problem - I absolutely detest programming.

\[Background\]

I was a very young high school graduate (16) and was sort of forced into the program by my two very well-meaning parents. I continued the program because I'm good at school and as a bonus I was able to go through school with my now husband. To be clear, I am a decent programmer and I have just under three years of experience in a development role, so this distaste isn't for lack of trying. The programming jobs that I had gave me anxiety that began to effect my life in an unfortunate way.

I'm here because I want to know my options. I am reasonably smart, I am great with people, and I learn quickly - I just don't want my job to make me sick.

Things I do enjoy: organization, face-to-face interaction, planning, problem-solving. 

I feel like I've wasted four years of my life and so here I am. Specifically, what kinds of careers can I have with a Computer Science degree that do not involve programming?

The problem is that for about 2 months now, we've been texting about every other day and seeing each other about every other week.

I still have very strong feelings for her and think about her all the time. She tells me that she only feels friendship towards me, but keeps adding stuff like ""...for now"" when she says it. It's like she was expecting for her feelings to grow for me but it never really happened.

I know the logical solution would be to stop seeing her since it brings me great suffering to not have her as a romantic partner in my life. But she has a lot of relational problems and has a hard time keeping people in here life. She doesn't really have friends and has a lot of personal issues. She is working on herself with the help of a therapist.

I feel like I am very important to her well-being as she can rely on me when she has a bad day and that we share a lot of common interests.

I've been unemployed for over a decade - a few factors to this, but the biggie currently is having autism and adhd which makes it very difficult to job search, on the rare occasions I apply for jobs I get an interview and it goes well (but they opt for people with better qualifications or more recent experience).  I can work and without accommodations, I worked for years without any problem including managerial roles, currently I volunteer with a couple of really highly regarded organisations too (so my experience is great but employers still look down on volunteer work as not real work). 

The problem is purely with job search, it's such a weird problem there's no support - I've tried to find support, but it just dons't exist or people don't know how to help me. I can't go back into higher education due to disabilities and cost.

No job means no life, stress of not being able to afford to pay my bills, while other people my age have families and are buying houses I'm stuck alone in local authority housing I can't even make look presentable, other people my age have good jobs or own their own businesses...I feel like I should be able to do this, but I just can't. 

**No friends/family/partner/children...**

I moved away for a few years and when I returned I found all my friends had moved on, I did find a new group of friends to occasionally go out with via Meetup but I stared dating one of the members who became abusive so Meetup is no longer an option for me due to his being so active in all the local groups. I want a partner too, but despite having a lot to offer I just get no attention or opportunity to met men and even if I do someone who's long-term unemployed with no friends is hardly a catch - I try dating apps but I don't get past a few conversations, it fizzles out before the point of dating. I'd like to have kids but the way things are right now that looks like it won't happen, which is devastating.

Having autism makes it incredibly difficult to make friends, it's only gotten worse due to social isolation, but also between depression and not having any money it means I've no hobbies to try to make new friends or just to have something to talk to new people about so I don't seem totally boring. I try to find free events, I go to gig, I save money to try new things (dance class, climbing, archery, running club, classes, etc), I also try to avoid staying at home...even if it jut means wandering around the mall - nothing is fun when you're on your own, and I just can't connect with anyone. 

**Depression...**

Surprise! I have depression. See above : lack of love or companionship is the biggest blow, but also just having no sense of purpose or value makes me feel useless, getting older my looks are fading and without a career or a family I'm struggling to see what the point in continue is. Every attempt I make at trying to improve my life fails, one step forward and two steps back, I'm just completely stuck in this one place with no support and no idea how to escape. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not willing to just give up but it's such hard work even keeping my head above water and not sinking into depression, it feels like I'll never get my life back or come close to finding any worth in my life. What else can I try?

I(17m almost 18) have a very strict mom. I hate her the only thing from killing myself is because I want to see her die. Even sometimes that isn’t enough reasoning. I can’t remember when it started because that’s how long I’ve been wanting for her to die. I pray everyday that she dies. She’s a emotional abusive manipulate person. My step-dad doesn’t give a shit about me only about my mom. I no longer talk to my Father. It’s been 10 months since I’ve last talked to him. He’s also a manipulative person. Also my sister died last year (22f).

My mom won’t let me quit football without letting me do other things. If I quit I won’t be able to do anything else. I’m a varsity starter and I find football to be so boring because of how soft it is nowadays.  I won’t be able to workout play other sports idk about video games my mom hates video games and blames them for everything. 

I’ve been told you’re almost 18 you’re on your own.

Also I’m a junior in high school.

How do I get out of this house? 
How do I get to enjoy things I want to do without the support of others?

But I still think about how awkward, smelly, and ugly I was in middle school and early high school and I can’t help but cringe. I’m surprised I had friends. Not so surprised that I got bullied. I’m a lot more confident and better looking as well as obsessively hygienic but I still wish that part of my life didn’t exist. Really messes with my head whenever I think about it.  I was depressed, suicidal, and socially anxious too. Makes me feel like maybe I’m destined to be a loser because how could I mess up that bad. This may sound dumb, but if there comes a time that I am successful it would be pretty awful if all people remember me as is the smelly, awkward girl from high school/middle school *cringe*

The main issue is that the floor and the door are so loud and creaky that it wakes me up in an instant. I put up with it during the summer but I politely requested that he keep his bed clothes outside the room when I go back to school. He agreed but continued to come in and wale me up half heartedly claiming he ‘forgot’. I would understand if this happened a few times but this has been happening almost daily for 7 MONTHS now.  I tried to tell my mum and she warns him, but he only stops for a couple of days then continues to wake me up in the middle of the night again. What makes it worse is that it takes me from 2-4 hours to fall asleep again. I’ve been waking up with migraines and it’s beginning to affect me at school.  I find it extremely difficult to stay awake in most lessons and I’ll be sitting my GCSE’s soon. I suggested collecting his clothes earlier along with other solutions but he ignores me.

119,"Very long story turned medium sized story:
I was with my ex for about 3 years, it was by no means perfect but i genuinely believed we were in love, we were talking life insurance policies on each other, all types of serious “in it for the long haul” stuff. 

One day my spidey senses told me something was off here and i checked his phone while he was asleep, i found a screenshot of his Snap list with his exes name (who at this stage lived on the other side of the world) with a sent chat from 1m ago, but she wasnt in his snap list at all nor could i find her (stupid woman - i shouldve turned off “only friends can send me Snaps”) 

Then he upgraded his phone, and being the techy one he asked me to set up his new one and sell his old one - fatal mistake as the next morning he started messaging his ex on Messenger and i was getting the notifications on his old phone. You can guess what i read - “i love you, i wish you were here - the idea of f*cking you is so good - if you were in front of me the choice would be easy” typical A Class scumbag BS. I sent a message from his old phone to the thread and blew up their wee romance 

The typical emotionally charged break up happens, him crying that hes lost ‘the woman he was going to marry, she didnt mean anything i was just caught up in the moment’ blahblahblah and i laid down one rule - ‘you even so much as speak to her again and you literally cant even say hello to me in the street ever again for the rest of your life’

That was 6 months ago, and i found out theyve become friends on Facebook recently and she is back in our city. I aint stupid. I know what that means. 
I want to stoop to all sorts of lows and plaster the screenshots of the shit he was sending her on billboards to ruin his new career, if i could get away with running him over id definitely consider it.

121,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 
I’ve been in a relationship with the same guy since we were sophomores in highschool (seven years). Without going into too much detail because that would make this post ridiculously longer than what it already will be, I’ll just give the general information. 
I haven’t been happy with our relationship for a couple years due to a few reasons; We are still living with my parents, finances are going to waste on things not important (don’t even get me started), all he does is want to play video games and instantly gets upset when I ask him to turn them off so we can watch something together or just spend time with one another, I have to constantly ask him to help around the house to the point where it becomes an argument and he’s turning it around on me saying that I never acknowledge the effort he does put in when he does actually do something (I do and it is not often) and he just all around doesn’t really put any effort into things. I’ve always been the one who surprised him with things or did things specifically for him. Which has inevitably diminished our sex life. I’m never in the mood because I never get the affection I desire and when the time comes down to it, I’m almost always refusing and he gets upset and asks me why I don’t like him touching me or things along those lines. I feel like our relationship is built on loads of codependency. I’ve tried talking to him numerous times about all those things and more. A couple months ago I asked him if he thought our relationship had become routine and he said no and asked me to explain. I told him I felt like we both work, come home and he’s on videos games all night or lays in bed on his phone and I’m left to make dinner, go grocery shopping or pick something up. I told him I needed help and more effort because we are a team and he agreed. It was good for about a month and then it ended. Which brings us to where we are now. I have had it. Ive been so stressed with everything around me that all I really want is time to myself. I mentioned a couple days ago that I felt like I needed maybe a month to myself and he immediately put his guard up and got angry. A couple days went by and I brought it up again. I told him flat out I didn’t want to argue I just wanted to talk. I again said I wanted some time to myself just to re-evaluate and clear my mind as to what is our actual future. A “break” as some people call it. We’ve been together, joined at the hip since day one and I just need time. We both pretty much sacrificed our highschool/teen years as well as going to future schooling to being committed to one another. I’m 22 years old and I do not have any friends that I see or hang out with. My life revolves around making this man happy and how I’m going to keep this relationship together.   I asked him if he thought it was selfish that I wanted some time to myself and his response was “yes because I don’t think either of us need that” and I just keep telling him I do because that’s how I feel. He goes on to ask me what he’s suppose to do with his life and if I’m really just wanting him to up and leave. I said idk that’s why I just need time. As I’m typing this he is now packing his things into garbage bags and we haven’t said a word in at least an hour. I am feeling extremely guilty. I do not want him to go but I know that I need time to myself. I don’t know what to do or say and I’m struggling to keep it together. I need some type of outside opinion. I’m feeling so lost.

125,"So I’ve always wanted to be in the military, specifically a Navy SEAL, go ahead and chuckle, I know it’s a childish thing to dream about but never pursue such as an astronaut almost. But I actually always wanted to do it. I trained throughout high school following specific work out regiments and such to prepare for my time in BUDs (if it ever came), but with the pressure from my parents and family to go to college, and then meeting the love of my life soon after, the dream suddenly faded away.

I have friends in the military, my best friend is a marine currently deployed in Syria, and when I see social media posts about it I can’t help but feel regret and longing to be there. Ever since I was a kid, all the way to 18-19, it was I wanted. Now that I’m 3 years into college and 22 years old, I don’t know what to do.

And then I have my family whom I love dearly. I like school and love science (bio major, physics minor), but I’d much rather be in the navy and pursue academia after the fact.

During summer he stays 1 week with his mother and the next with his father. During school however he only stays with his mother.

A couple of minutes ago I was scrolling through social media when I found that R had put on his story.

Backstory:
Last year one of my cousins friends (A - friend) saw me on his snapchat story and asked for my own snap. Coming from a middle class family, I only had a slide phone so he gave her my number instead. She reached out to me and we had the usual awkward conversations for a while. After finally meeting for the first time during the end of the school year, we hung out for a short time before we had to go to our separate classes. (We aren't in the same grade) 

Current:
The rest of the year passed with nothing really happening. Skip over a summer of nothing, and here we are. This year has been going at a more steady pace, we are hanging out during the day a bit more but after school is busy for both of us. We have gotten pretty close over the beginning of the year and some things are getting ""steamy"". In some conversation the idea of dating has come up, but nerves and confidence have held both of us back. I figured that if any progress was going to be made that I should take action. In the unprofessional way of doing it, I told her what I was feeling. A, reciprocating a little, but is nervous about dating or getting close to anyone.  A said that she used to get excited thinking about dating, but now is weary because we have gotten so close. Just to add to it all, finding the time to hang out with one another is really difficult.

Anyways i was minding my own business and happened to leave my wallet out in the open, and apparently after i came back to get it my brother must of looked through it, because my mother said to me: ""is that your wallet? so \*sibling\* looked through it"", and then i immediately left because no thanks. Inside i had a receipt of a condom purchase, still there.

A little tangent would include me talking about how nosy this boy is. Once i saw him masturbating under a blanket, and i wanted to k i l l m y s e l f . He didnt see me thank the seven but that image was still burnt in my mind. I kept it bottled inside; im not about exposing my brother like that.

Anyways im 16, and though im not having any sex i bought it because etc etc generic excuses. What gives me more anxiety is that Mom knows im gay (the image of her with that image), and that they were ""large"".

So tl;dr im going to kill myself (not really please dont give me self help guides). How do i get over this shame, or guilt or whatever i feel? because i want to die, and talking to her or my brother now also makes me want to die. Leave your validations below, Thanks! ",06Feb2019,1

145,"Need an opinion- I’ve been with the same company for 12 years now (this coming July). I starting working there when I was 17 at an entry level position, in shipping/receiving, at the time it wasn’t a career but more of a summer type job. Basically I didn’t take it too seriously.

Skip 5 years- I’m still working for the same company. I work for a small, specific devision of a very large corporation. 3 digit billion annual revenue corporation. I decided to go back to school and study in a field relevant to what I envisioned myself doing for this very same company, I was able to keep my seniority working evenings part time, when I graduated I immediately got a job internally, relevant to my field of study.

I’ve currently held the same position for 5 years- Basically when I got out of school they decided to hire someone with experience to lead our department. We are roughly 5 people total in our department for this sub-division of a massive corporation, benefits are great, recently got 6 weeks vacation, can’t complain much. I know I’m lucky to have a job and I’ve worked hard to keep it.

I guess what I’m saying is this; I feel like I’ve worked hard enough not only to keep my job, but to have gotten promoted. I’ve never asked for a raise and consider myself to be somewhat humble, I’m confident but I feel more appreciative for what I have rather than what I don’t. I have trouble playing that corporate fake I want to be your friend happy hour bullshit. I guess I always though hard work pays off, regardless of how you play the game.

The problem is that I’ve been there since the age of 17, I’m now 29 and have a 2 year old son, a mortgage, bills, expenses, revenue property, you get the picture. I’m the “ Go to guy” for any issues related to my department. Not being unionized- I’ve also been on the road, helped with support, development, sales etc. I feel like I’m still viewed as that kid who started there when I was 17, I’m part of the landscape and from my perspective, taken advantage of. I’m reluctant to pursue another career opportunities because of the security and stability I feel there, combined with the gratefulness and comfort in getting a steady pay check to provide for my family.

Regardless, I need a new challenge, I need to be stimulated, I need to learn something new. I feel like I’m at a dead end with this company. On the other hand it’s all I know. I’m still young and understand that things come with time, but I’ve been there for just under half my life. I’ve been feeling bummed out about this for a while now, maybe a year or so and it does reflect in my work. 

If you have some advice, whether this reminds you of someone you know,have been there yourself or feel the same, let me know what you think and how you did/would deal with it.

146,"I'm 16 years old and am supposed to be having the best years of my life but I really feel like I'm missing out here.

First things first: I don't have any friends, I go to a school that's supposed to be better than normal public school where we spend the majority of our day in and our lunch in, we are in the same place for the 4 years of high school. It wouldn't be a problem except I hate almost everyone in my class, maybe I'm picky and I need help to fix that but I can't stand anyone in my class, they try so hard to be ""random and quirky"" and it's so irritating. This results in me being depressed, spending all my time with my parents, I like my parents, but when you're a teenager it's the opposite of what you WANT to be doing. Since I've gone out with friends 1 single time since I've been in high school, I've never had a drink of alcohol, never been to a party, never dated anyone, had sex, or even kissed someone

&amp;#x200B;

I have this weird problem about rejection and being liked, the couple people I do like I'm deathly afraid of asking them to go out and do something and I can hardly give an explanation as to why. And this is only with friends, you can only imagine how I am with girls I find attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not even smart either, quite the opposite. I'm failing 2 of my classes and barely getting through the other ones, this is partially due to being a sad case and never feeling like doing work but I'd say I'm far from a smart person either way.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really have anything I'm interested in, whenever people ask me I just say entertainment like music and tv. I played soccer when I was 9 and I rather enjoyed it but it's not something I'm good at nor could make a career out of. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm actually really jealous of my father who had a good time in high school with people he's still friends with today, I listen to him tell stories and think to myself that I will never have anything like those experiences. One time someone came up to me, asked me if I liked tacos, then left (this is an 11th grader saying this to me.) I can't bring myself to express this to my parents, or anyone at all

147,"Throwaway account, because a lot of my friends are on reddit.

I'm going to call my friend Gina. So my friend Gina has a history of dating/liking older guys. Her type is specifically older and Christian, as she told me once before. Her last relationship before this one, ended badly bc he cheated on her several times.

About a month ago, she told our friend group that she started dating someone, but REFUSED to tell any of us who it was. The most we knew about him was that he was in college and that they had sex. We just assumed that he was a freshman in college and since we were seniors, we thought it was somewhat alright, although we were a little worried.

Well yesterday, Gina told me everything. Her boyfriend is 27 years old and goes to a nearby college. They apparently go to the same church and are in the church worship group. He approached her and instigated this relationship by telling her that he could tell that she was worshiping with her heart and soul. He fed her compliments and told her that she was a true believer in God.

Obviously, this was pretty weird, but Gina accepted them and they began a relationship. But there was more! This guy is MARRIED. Further into the conversation, Gina tells me that he cheated on his wife before with another younger girl (around 20).

To me, it sounded really gross and predatory and I tried to bring it up to Gina, but she keeps insisting that it was real love. That they loved each other, and that he was a holy man. But last Saturday, apparently the pastor at the church noticed something weird with her boyfriend.

Note that Gina and her boyfriend kept this whole thing under lock. They deleted messages, never called at home, only went over to each other's houses when family wasn't home, and made sure to not tell anyone, including close friends.

Anyways, I guess the pastor finally noticed something weird with the guy, and he brought Gina's mom into this. Apparently, they've been noticing some predatory behavior towards Gina and another girl at the church. The pastor had a talk with them sometime over the weekend (Gina's boyfriend and some parents), and her boyfriend decided to stop going to that church.

From that moment, he ghosted Gina for a couple of days and today, broke up with her. So right now, I'm unsure where to go. I'm not sure if this is pedophilia or grooming or whatever. She insists that it was really love and that he was a good person and I'm doubtful. She mentioned something about possibly having to go to court because of this? I have no idea what to do, she's really heartbroken and I don't want to invalidate her feelings about this guy, but then I don't want to have her think that this situation is okay.

While browsing I found a website that the student wrote that gave a glimpse of her sophomore year. The entries on the website were all positive.

The student’s birthday is tomorrow and I was thinking about finding a way to send the link of the website to the deceased’s family as a nice way to celebrate her life. 

I was planning to ask my teacher to email them, but then he would know I looked her up and I don’t know how he would react to that.

155,"Hi all, 

(apologies in advance for my wording, pacing and grammar. I'm rush typing this up at work) 

We are both 28 years old and live together in our own house. 
Late last year my (F) SO suddenly collapsed (she had no history of this ever happening) while preparing dinner in the kitchen, I was in the same room as I was folding laundry. 

I turned around to see my SO mid fall collapsing against the kitchen counter, I rushed over and she was extremely pale and completely unconscious, words can't describe the feelings I had when I saw her like this, I was frantically shouting her name and trying to ""wake"" her up, while my (sister) housemate was dialing for an ambulance (this was all happening within seconds) I felt so powerless in the situation as it felt like, at the time that this was it, this was the end for the love of my life.

For context, not too long ago I lost my father (51) suddenly in a similar scenario, he was perfectly healthy with no issues, never drank, hardly ever ate anything sugary or smoked and just randomly collapsed dead while getting ready for work. To be honest the last few years of my life have been shrouded in misery for my family, it's been tough dealing with these changes. 


- Luckily, by the time the ambulance arrived which seemed it was instant, my SO started to slowly regain consciousness however she was completely out of it, confused, pale and delirious. I remember I just kept hugging her, begging for her to be 100% okay, at this point I thought she may have had some kind of stroke.

I followed the ambulance to the ER department where they took my SO - this is where it kinda get fucked up. I got to the front counter and asked the triage/nurse where my partner was and if she was okay, they responded back to me with ""yes she's here, take a seat."" 
I tried probing for more information yet they pretty much refused to give me anything, I think it may have been because we're not married, and I look like i'm 19 - not to mention we live in a bad part of town so i'm guessing domestic incidents are common for staff here. Long story short, I sat and waited for 9 hours not knowing if my SO was alive, hurt or dead - it felt like eternity, had every single scenario running through my head, I was shattered. 

Eventually the same nurse tells me to come through and I finally get to see my SO, at this point she was back to normal and sitting up in the bed while a doctor was performing tests, in the end they were confident that she had possibly just fainted. 

So, back to the point of this post. Ever since this happened I for the life of me cannot focus at work, my mind is still somewhat in a state - like for a whole day I thought I had lost my SO, those are emotions and thoughts I can't just shut off. I feel guilty because I should be focusing on my work, I have people that depend on me, bills and mortgage to pay yet I just can't work. for the past few months I've been delaying work projects and avoiding any and all work, I'm really good at looking busy (lol) but I know I can't do this for long, I have even started entertaining the idea of losing my job because right now work does not feel important to me, all i want to do is experience what life has to offer with my SO. 

I just feel bad, it's been months since this happened yet it affects me still, yet I don't show it, no one would know the wiser not even my SO.

I just feel dread 24/7 and work feels like the least of my issues at the moment, yet I can't take a break or leave because of my responsibilities, I've exhausted all my sick and annual leave hours trying to change my way of thinking yet I'm stuck.  

I've organised to see a psych, though the appointment is not for a few months due to wait times. 

What should I do, I can't keep this charade up for much longer as I know work will catch on that I haven't been performing in months. 

I feel like shit.

157,"I feel some context may be helpful for this, and greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read:

I am a 21 year old male currently in college in NYC. I come from a wealthy but quite toxic family and spent my teenage years numbing out and maintaining. 

This past spring I made the decision to get sober. While there is no easy time to do so, I am beyond grateful that I did it this young, and must say my family and friends showed up for me in a huge way. Stepping into the pain I numbed out with use has of course been difficult, but also incredibly rewarding.

That being said, something still feels largely missing. I have made ammends with family, have wonderful friends, am doing well in school, and by no means am miserable—I just feel something is calling. 

My instant reaction is that this is me running away, fantasizing, and so on. My therapist, whom I have a wonderful relationship with, is the only person ive really discussed this with. She of course has been healthily skeptical as well, and part of what I love about her is her ability to push back on my behaviors/thoughts. However in our last session, after quite some time of us visiting this topic on and off, she candidly said I think this is exactly what you need to do. 

It almost caught me off guard in a way to have someone outside of myself say they think this is the right thing, especially from someone who would be very careful to endorse something so “radical.” 

Now i’m just trying to think about what exactly it is to do. Ive heard of people going to buddhist monasteries, something that certainly intrigues me as ive developed a meditation practice. But im by no means set on it. I just want to live a life of practice, discipline, and most of all, simplicity. 

Part of what feels right about this is I dont feel i’m running from anything, but rather moving towards something. Has anyone done something of this nature? Had a friend who has done it? I am truly grateful for any insight and guidance.

159,"Hey guys,

I just graduated college, and I'm working my first real job. It's as a research technician. Long story short, me and my mentor are butting heads in a sense, to the point where he pretty consistently doesn't trust me to do anything and wants to be there, watching me, when I do anything. At first I was shadowing him, then he watched me do things and we've kind of stagnated there.

When he watches me, he stands behind me silently, occasionally correcting me. Although I haven't done anything that complicated (I do the same basically 5 tasks every week), it's still fairly nerve wracking having someone watch everything that I do. I cannot do anything independently, and what little things he trusts me to do independently, I have to check in with my boss frequently to show him steps in between. Before we get set up, he'll occasionally ask me to list the steps in order for the few protocols that we do, and if I cannot list them all in order, he won't let me touch anything. 

This got me in trouble today when I didn't go and grab him for steps in between the protocol we were running, and he scolded me as ""the job requires a certain level of trust"", and he needs to trust me to grab him when he says he needs me to. Nothing happened - it was just pouring contents of tube A into tube B - but the whole situation still made me stressed. In his defense, he did tell me to grab him, and while I misunderstood him I should have asked a clarifying question to make sure I understood him correctly. I apologized, and we're going to talk later this week about my performance.

As with all new jobs, I have made some mistakes - some careless, some related to nerves. My biggest mistake was setting an expensive piece of equipment down without proper protection underneath it (it didn't break), but other than that the mistakes I've made have been minor at best (I made one other mistake that made a small bit of an easily replaceable solution get thrown out, but that's the only other ""big"" mistake I can think of).

The lab I work in does very high caliber research. So understandably, they expect a high level of accuracy and precision. As someone with ADHD, focusing is not my forte. I am working on getting medicated, and am also working on using mindfulness techniques that should help me get better at the job. Today was already a better day than it's been, since I slowed down and simply took time to think about what I was doing more. So I understand that some of the problem is probably me. That being said, it's really hard for me not to be anxious when a) I don't feel confident in doing anything, b) someone is always watching me do things silently, and c) my mentor literally does not trust me to do anything. It's really killer to my self esteem, and my nerves are making me perform worse. This is not my first time in a lab (I did a lot of research as an undergrad in many different labs), so I know that it's just this environment. It is my first time in a lab of this size, however.

To correct the situation, I've mentioned how people watching me gets stressed out (""Well you'd better get used to it,"" was basically his reply). I've also mentioned how I wasn't sure to what degree I was meeting his expectations, and we're going to have a discussion later this week to address my progress.

In all honesty, however, I really just want to apply for a new job. I don't see the environment becoming any less stressful, and I don't think I have the attention to detail this lab requires. I don't want my time to be wasted, and I don't want the lab to put wasted time and resources into me, just to be fired. Every night I come home, and I literally just stress about how I'm going to piss off my boss the next day - it's on my mind constantly, and I'm perpetually anxious about it. I can't really shut work mode off, and it's getting in the way of my personal life.

Im looking into transferring to a school in my city and just not staying on campus its only about 25 minutes away this school is about 45 and I've been home every weekend and I find myself just counting down til I can go home then almost crying when I have to go back I dont know what to do or if I can mentally handle this for the rest of the semester til I can transfer please give me advice for this situation is there anything I can do or am I just out of luck? im honestly so concerned for my mental health at this point.",06Feb2019,1
171,"So my girlfriend and I just moved in together. Both of us are moving out our parents house so it’s our first time doing all of the adult stuff that comes along with it. 

One of the first purchases we have to make is a couch. My girlfriend and I talked it over looked in a few places and decided on a couch. Today we went to the store and were going to buy it. 

As we were looking through the store my girlfriend’s father called, and when she told him what we were up to he started going off on her. Told her we were being dumb to buy the couch today with Presidents day about two weeks away. Told us we should wait til then and the couch would go on sale.

My girlfriend told her father that the store we were at (raymour and flanigan) was already running a Presidents day sale, and the couch was on sale. My girlfriends father reiterated that we should wait until Presidents’ Day because they would further discount the couch.

My girlfriend and I don’t want to wait, we want to get the couch now. Even if the couch is discounted further how much more could it be? Unless its a significant discount we don’t want to wait. We currently have no furniture, just a table, some uncomfortable chairs, and our bed. We figure its worth sacrificing the theoretical discount so we don’t have to spend the next two weeks sitting on the floor.

But her father practically lives in her head, so she decided we were going home sans couch today. What do you guys think? Should we listen to papa and wait for Presidents day, or just splurge and get the couch?",06Feb2019,1

I'm from the southern US, she's from Sweden. We met here on Reddit last March, quickly became close, and our relationship started at the end of May. I know, it's not gonna work out and we're young and should've just stayed friends but it's way too late for that, and I care about her too much to break things off. Not to mention I don't think I could do that to myself.

Her parents know all about me. She says she talks about me almost all the time. Once she was texting her aunt and even she asked how I was doing. I've said hey to them on video chat multiple times. They don't really seem to disapprove of our relationship and they themselves even met online. She's one of my closest friends and knows more about me than anyone. I feel like I can be my true self with her and not put on a mask like I do when I'm talking with my irl friends. Basically, I trust that she's exactly who she says she is.

 My mom knows I talk with her, but she just thinks we play Overwatch together with the rest of my friend group. My dad knows nothing.

I want to visit her this summer. Bad. I've been saving up my money for the past couple years now simply because I had nothing to spend it on, but now I do. I have enough money for my own plane ticket, passport, and some spending cash, but seeing as my dad would most likely have to come along I wouldn't be able to pay for his stuff. I'd do anything to be able to visit her. I'd go without Christmas and birthday presents, if my dad said I could go you can bet your ass I'd try to get my license and a job asap to start making money to pay for it.

I don't even know how to approach this topic with my dad. Been thinking of just dropping the bombshell on him when we're alone sometime. My mom's a whole different beast, but telling her doesn't matter as much. She's the type of person that that tells me not to talk to people online because ""that's how you get trafficked"" so I'm surprised she didn't freak out when she found out I was talking to a girl online.

TLDR: I met a girl on Reddit, I'm from Texas, she's from Sweden, we've been in a relationship for 8 months and are what I'd consider extremely close, I believe she's exactly who she says she is, I really want to visit her with my dad, I can pay for myself but not him, don't know how to even tell my dad anything about this",06Feb2019,1

I’m wanting to leave for a better opportunity, but I feel like the place will be in shambles if I leave because they’re so dependent on me. If I do go, I’m going to give at least a month’s notice, but I don’t even know if that will be enough. I also haven’t mentioned anything about quitting, so it’ll be seemingly out of the blue.

You see people who play instruments, can draw really well, or master a (or at least be proficient enough one)  skill. When you look at these people, you can notice a common trend. they spend several years, decades, or even lifetimes getting to this level in a craft (with exception to prodigies). This fact is what troubles me. There will be spare time where I want to try something and will for a while. Over time something else will catch my interest and will have me completely lost.  I only have so much free time and there seems to be no limit to things I want to try. Everything I get into I want to at least get good at it to the point where I’m at least an intermediate level.

I was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety and as a result I take Wellbutrin, Clonodine(I think I spelled that right), and Trazodone. Well a while back she stopped giving me clonodine. Now in my state at times I don’t want to take my medication because my dumb brain thinks I can handle the pain “I just wanna show myself I don’t need them” whatever stupid bullshit so I didn’t really care. In addition, she’s been making me take her dosage of wellbutrin which is 300mg instead of the 150mg I was prescribed by my psychiatrist. 

Now she stopped giving me my trazodone. I was up til nearly 5 am (I’m homeschooled) and woke up at twelve. I got barely any school work done today because I’ve felt depressed and awful. It’s been a month since I’ve seen my therapist because she’s too lazy to set up an appointment. It’s just so hypocritical for someone who claims I need to take them. 

I told my cousin and she pointed out how very wrong this is. I suppose my question in what do I do? I can’t ask her to hold on to them because I had a suicide attempt about eight months ago via pills. What do I do? I feel awful and I feel myself returning right back to how I felt before my attempt. I’m safe and everything I just don’t want to go back and feel all the pain again. I have too many things to live for. Also just addition info  I’m 15F in the US.

I met with members of my school about this including the dean, and they told me it was out of their hands as it was the med school in pennsylvania that made the policy. As a last ditch effort I emailed the person/dean who signed the acceptance letter in the school in Pennsylvania (I had not contacted anyone at the US school before) asking if they would honor the acceptance letter given that I was eligible until they revised their criteria. The dean from pennsylvania told me, ""to direct this and all future inquiries to my home institution, and that ""I was under the impression you were already given an answer,"" and this dean from pennsylvania CC'ed my dean overseas.

I find myself in a rather peculiar situation. Back in September I joined an academicly involved team (university level design competition), in which close to 40 people were a part of. Since then my workload has steadily increased to the point where I am the only one doing any of the work. There are about 10 people who still show up to the general meetings, however nobody wants to do any work or show up to scheduled work times.  I truly feel as though I have been stuck holding the bag. The workload that I have taken on has lead to my grades, work life, and social life to suffer.

I have been strongly debating of dropping from the team and letting them sort out the issue themselves. I honestly feel that without me there to pull the weight the team will fall apart and there will be a large amount of anger towards me (I have another year left of classes with the people I am on the team with). Not to mention that several thousand dollars of sponsorship dollars has already been poured into this project. 

I have attempted to raise interest amongst the remaining members to share the workload but have had no luck.

196,"I honesty have never felt so low in my life the way I have been lately. I am at a standstill and it is driving me nuts.

At the age of 19, I basically started a career that I didn't realize would end up ruining my life. I have been a Registered Massage Therapist since 2011 and while I loved my job because I am amazing at it and really thrive to help people, I have sustained multiple injuries from it. I have had disc herniations in my neck causing me massive pain and paralysis. I currently got diagnosed last month with DDD (degenerative disc disease) in my C5-C6 with osteophyte formation (bone growth) that is putting pressure on my neuroforamen (passageway for nerves to pass through along the spine). FUN. Also, my clavicle on the right side pops out when I raise my arm in any direction that just causes me shit tons of pain and neck muscle spams. I am literally in pain ALL the time and refuse to take painkillers/ anti inflams/ or any drugs in general. I obviously do other things to try and manage my pain that are more natural.

I currently hold a license to practice in 2 provinces and have been residing in one more then the other for the past 2 years. To be honest, I hate where I am. It's cold and winter lasts longer then summer, the people suck, its not cheaper to live unless you are considering buying property. Which I am not. At least not here. I don't want to live here, its just cheaper to afford rent. I moved here back in 2017 because I wanted a change.. and to move away from my toxic family that I was living with. I love them, I can tolerate them in moderation, but I couldn't live with them any longer. There is no privacy, no respect for my life or my personal belongings that I worked hard for... living in a bedroom wasn't conducive to a healthy space. I couldn't use the kitchen without being harassed and called names and being picked on.

My father is a hardcore Sicilian and cannot deal with the fact that I don't want to eat what he eats...so, I'm considered mental, crazy, sick...whatever he thinks to call me on any given day. 3 years ago I decided to eat clean and more on the vegan side. Just because, I feel healthier and I find I'm in less pain. When I visit home for the holidays, I dread it...he forces me to eat what he wants and makes me feel like shit if I don't..This is one of the main reasons I left.

I wanted to give this province a fair shot but it's not working for me. I miss my friends and family...I miss everything about my province expect for how expensive it is.

Another reason I moved here was because I was having no luck finding another job outside of Massage Therapy. Sure, being a female RMT was a surefire way to get a job almost anywhere, but I couldn't do it full time anymore to make a decent living to even pay rent. When I say full time I mean, 5-6 days a week 4-5 patients a day. I am currently down to once a week or twice a week 2 people a day. I was super lucky to find a job here in less then a week of being here as a Medical Office Administrator which I do ""full time"".. It doesn't pay the best, but at least its consistent and doesn't kill me.

My home province is so over populated in the major cities, there is too much competition to be noticed for an interview. I would sent resumes daily...sometimes over 100 and not one response for an interview. I searched for months.. nothing.. I couldn't move out on what little I was bringing in as an RMT and I couldn't work more because I would suffer in pain. So, I left.

I thought that coming here would give me some opportunity, more skills, more to put on my resume other then ""Person who touches people for a living""...that's all any employer saw when I applied to jobs.. and it sucked. I have so much more to offer and have so many skills. But no one paid attention to that. Just the past few jobs I had were touching people. And my only schooling outside of high school was a massage therapy diploma or other additional certificates to expand myself as an RMT. It did I guess, I now have MOA that I can add to my resume.. but that's not enough.. I tried applying to more jobs in my home province with my updated resume and cover letter.. but not one response.

I am 29 now, turning 30 this year.. and I feel like a complete failure with no direction. I want to change professions, I don't want to be a desk worker, I don't want to be just a disposable employee.. I want to be successful and happy... But all I know is what I DON'T want to do.. I don't know what I want to do at all.. other then helping people, being around people, and preferable being outdoors in seasons with better weather... I got nothing. To go to school and take courses is scary because I don't want to be in debt for the next 10 years paying back student loans with no promise of job afterwards... I don't know how many friends I have that have masters, degrees, bachelors..but work retail jobs and can't find ANYTHING in their field. It's scary to say the least.

I have been saving up money because obviously I have goals. I want to own property in my home province and have a career that I can be proud and feel successful in. I want freedom and the ability to travel and see the world, but make enough money to be comfortable, not rich. I feel limited because of my stupid injuries so I can't do physically demanding jobs or things I love to do which includes working with my hands versus sitting down all day staring at a computer.

I feel so conflicted since I don't want to live here, but can't afford to even rent back home on my own. Staying here is only setting me back from possibilities I could stumble upon back home... but where am I going to stay? I can't stay at home..and all my friends already have their own place with their new families or still live at home and have no desire to move out. So basically, I would have to get a job(s) that don't pay enough for me to barely scrape by and set myself backwards..All I know is I'm not happy here and I am scared of failing.. Yet, I have no freaking plan..and that scares me the most because I always have a plan..I am such a passionate person with so much to offer yet, no one wants to give me the chance to prove myself. I can barely sleep anymore or find joy in anything because I am just so consumed in figuring out my next move in life.

Is there anyone currently going through this and if so, what are you doing to fix it? I feel like my mindset is so negative right now and I have literally zero support. My parents don't care about me being successful.. they just want me home even if that meant I wasn't working and just living with them till they die.

I'm a 22 yr old male and as much of a virgin as anyone can be, which has been a point of stress in my life recently, I feel I'm fairly attractive and am fine conversation-wise, but my situation's a bit different from most in that I'm the oldest sibling of 2 severely autistic brothers, 19 and 21, (which if I'm honest has given me a major complex and almost always stopped me from following through in a relationship for fear as to how a girl would react to my life even since gradeschool, and if I did get close to someone I would tend to 'self-destruct' a connection with a girl either voluntarily or involuntarily as it just seemed easier than balancing 2 seperate lifes, or attempting to meld the 2 together)I honestly don't know know when a good time to inform them of either of these things is. I've met so many understanding people throughout my life though and the awareness of autism has increased ten-fold compared to when I was a kid, so I know that if I truly tried to follow through and introduce a potential partner to my siblings it would be okay, it's just a major block I can't seem to shake, if someone left me because of my situation I don't know if I could handle it. Before I knew it I was out of highschool and working, with no romantic feelings with anyone I could look back on (I've never even had a kiss before, but there have been a couple things, skinny dipped with a beautiful girl a year ago and was very close to moving things to the next base (or three) but I backed away like an idiot when she insinuated she wanted to take it to the next level. Though honestly I think she was really surprised and respected me for it but goddamn I felt pretty pathetic.) Now I just feel like I'll never have any kind of love in my life and that I've wasted the best years of my life. I feel like an old man, taking care of two disabled sons that aren't even mine. (Dad left when I was 14, Mom was left with both of them and I was left with the choice to take what should be his responsibility or watch as my Mother and brothers deteriorate) However, because I sacrificed my time my brothers are no longer violent, they go to sleep at night and stay asleep all night, and they are both finally happy on a daily basis, so I know that if I want to pursue my own wants and needs I actually can with a minimal negative affect on my family's situation. Yet whenever I have the opportunity I don't want to even leave the house to pursue my opportunities, I'm just so fucking tired. Everyday I picture myself gray-haired and alone as I take care of my brothers until I die, filled with regret that I didn't live life to the fullest (or even half-full). I don't know what I expect to read by posting this, I know my situation is heaven compared to many people on the planet, I just can't seem to shake the pain that comes with looking to the future. I don't even know if I'm posting in the right subreddit but I din't really care, just had to vent for a moment and put my thoughts to text. Any advice would be appreciated, It's like I know life will get better if I keep moving on but the road ahead is so dark I can't see where to plant my feet.

TL;DR I'm a 22yr old virgin who's dedicated more time to taking care of his autistic siblings and mother than to my own life and now that my time isn't as needed I feel lost and alone. Good Times!",06Feb2019,1
201,"Self confidence is something that I have struggled with for the majority of my life. The environment that I'm in has nothing to do with it, as my friends and family support me in everything I do. There has always just been a constant little voice in my head, saying that I'm not good enough, that I will never be able to do what I want, etc. As much as I try to ignore this voice, and even if I mostly do tone it out, I guess my mind is just so used to telling me ""no, you can't"" that I end up telling myself that anyway. This has impacted nearly all aspects of my life, to the point where I sometimes have to write multiple drafts of a text before I send it, and then still end up worrying about what the other person will think. To be honest, I'm really just sick of second guessing everything I do, and all I want is to be happy with myself how I am.",06Feb2019,1

I've made a couple friends since going here, and one of them I can't live a day without, but I need everyone else so much. I will feel terrible to leave him there since he came from another state and had very few friends as well, but I'm just not happy at my current school.

He constantly physically abuses me (he is larger and stronger than me), doing things like kicking, punching and putting me in choke holds randomly. It seems like he has a good family life and I am the only person he does this to. He also threatens to hurt me every now and then.

206,"21(F) been dealing with depression and general anxiety since about 16 maybe earlier. I've always been shy but a lot of bad experiences with shitty friends and boyfriends gave me major trust issues. On top of that I have horrible social anxiety to the point where even hanging out with people I like stresses me out, so I've begun to feel like meeting new people is a lost cause for me. My drunkard father and mother who enabled him for my entire life have no real passions/interests in life and identity issues which they passed onto me. I used to really love making art but at about 18 I totally checked out of life and stopped trying. Now I wish I had kept up with it but I lack the inspiration to draw and feel that everything I make is shit, which makes me feel more depressed rather than relieving stress like a hobby is supposed to do. I feel I need to go to school now so I can make progress in my life and also keep my mind occupied and I have several interests but as far as I know there's nothing I'm that passionately interested in. Because of these things, I have very few friends, no hobbies, no direction in life, and a whole lot of existential dread. I feel that I'm stuck in a constant shitty job grind without anything to relieve the daily stress or look forward to in the future.

207,"So, this is my first time writing a Reddit post since I feel the need to ask for help from anyone out there and I do apologize for the inconvenience. Last month, around December 12th I believe, I got rear-ended. It wasn't major or anything, but my car got 2 puncture holes on the back due to his license plate. He got out of the car and saw he was just a really young, 18-year-old with some friends in his car. He begged me not to call the police and that he'll pay no matter what. I agreed to it putting myself in his shoes that if I was in his situation, I wouldn't want the police being called. I told him fine, that I'll look for a mechanic and get it fixed, but told him that I would take a picture of his license plate and driver's license. I had to focus on my finals, as finals week was really brutal for me, but right after I was finished, I took my car to the local mechanic shop. The mechanic told me it would cost 1,350 dollars, as the carbon fiber below the bumper had an indent as well, but my insurance would help me pay for the repairs. I would pay only 800 dollars, but I still felt bad for the kid and said that I got hit in a supermarket and the perpetrator took off. I told him fine seeing that the car was a lease and had to return it soon. I inform the person and he said sure sure, no matter what, I promised to pay no matter what. Not only that, but I had to get a rental car since I had to transport my mother to work and had work. Fast forward 2 days, my car is all set up, and I call him saying ""hey, the car is done, I'm paying just 200, you just pay 500 dollars"". Here is where I got surprised. He got mad at me saying ""why is it so expensive? Your car isn't a Mercedes or anything? Your mechanic is ripping you off. Send me a receipt. I know because I am a mechanic as well...."" I got so furious and told him ""and you didn't inform of this when you hit me?"" He replied, ""but you never asked me."" I sent him the receipt and told him ""as you can see, I just want you to pay the 500 dollars as it was your fault."" He was backing out and I started to get annoyed saying ""if you don't pay me back, I would have to call the police."" He said, ""no no, just give me till the end of January, you'll get your money."" I thought that was the end of it. It wasn't. Fast forward a week prior to the end of January, he sends me a text saying ""hey, my car broke down, I'm putting a down payment on a new car right now. Just give me till the first week of February."" I respond saying ""ok, but don't play with me please because I really need the money."" Fast forward to the first week of February I sent him a text. ""Hey, it's time man. I can't keep waiting much longer as my credit card bill arrived."" No response. ""Hello? I'm not playing man, please answer your texts"" I get a response which is the automatic response that I have been blocked. I use a separate number and call him, to no answer. I call him again on another number, no answer. Now, it's been a week and still, nothing him. I'm asking what can I do at this point. I have his driver's license, his address, and license plate, but many people are saying there isn't anything I can do at this point.

I was called to present what I had been doing so far and when I finished the professor told me that I should present in May at a conference. 

I said yeah and sort of just stared at him, which he interpreted as me being nervous to which he started saying ""oh ResidentWeenie doesn't like me anymore"" and then got up and went to grab my face. He didn't because I put my hands up to put distance between us. 

By this point he and I were both upfront and everyone saw. I feel super embarrassed and uncomfortable and I'm not sure if I acted appropriately. I feel like I should have let him touch my face because me recoiling seemed weird.  **What would you have done?**

I'd like to stress that my professor is not a pervert or a predator, but he does make me uncomfortable. He is a super old, and very sweet man. 

He is super touchy feely with me in particular, but he had never wanted to touch my face before with his hands, especially infront of others. He does hug and kiss my cheek when he says hello to me. This does make me uncomfortable but I don't know how to stop it. I feel like mentioning it to anyone will result in me looking like I'm lying (even though others have seen it), want attention, it want to ruin his career. 

I think intent matters and he has no intent to abuse of me, he's just inappropriate. When I leave meetings I make sure to say goodbye from a distance.

215,"So I work for a consulting company in the energy sector. I have had great success for several years, but in the past year things have fallen apart. For context, my boss has always bought into the big talker types. The ones that claim they’ll bring so much revenue into the company and fast talk their way into making sales. These same people have overtly ripped him off for tens of thousands of dollars over the years via base pay/advances, falsifying deal values, and him paying for mundane shit like Uber rides, hotels to stay at, food, bail money, etc. He either completely overlooks this or is okay with it, all the while he has treated myself and the only other legit employee like complete trash and constantly holds things over our heads that have no bearing on what we’re trying to do. 

Most recently, our department has withered down to 3 people, and the two of us are attempting to get a hiring spree going but he has flip flopped on everything we discussed with him in person and he agreed upon last week, only to say he isn’t going through with it now. He also pays an outrageous salary of close to $100k to his other department manager, while we’re 1099 commission only and have always had to generate our own revenue. So we haven’t ever cost him a dime in operational costs, yet she is a massive drain on capital and again he is either oblivious or has convinced himself that she’s worth this absurd salary. 

I’m at my wit’s end with everything. I’m starting school again soon so I’d really hate to have to find a different job that will most likely have much less flexibility since I make my own hours here, but I just don’t know how to proceed.

216,"A little over a month ago my husband and I adopted a 7mo old kitten from the shelter. Both at the shelter and for about a week after we brought him home he was so sweet- he let us pet him and scratch under his chin, he was super cuddly and all around a very sweet cat. Then about a week later he just started biting anything that moved- especially our hands. At first it seemed very playful, but it feels like over the past month (we’ve had him now a month and a week) he just keeps getting more aggressive with the biting and is starting to bite harder. We have been very careful to not play with him using our hands, to only play with toys, etc. We do not reprimand him when he bites, just let out an “Oww!!!” and pull the hand away and stop engaging with him.  Sometimes he will wrap around my arm and latch on so hard that I have to literally shake him off :/
       Everyone keeps telling us that he is just an overly playful kitten and will grow out of it but I am worried he won’t. I already have a sort of stand off-ish dog (husky) and really wanted a pet I could love on. I’ve had other cats before and don’t remember any of them being this bad with the biting. I am worried this is a symptom of him being unhappy.

A couple of notes-

- Our dog and him got into a scuffle within the first week he was here over some food, and it seemed to coincide with when the biting started. I thought maybe the biting was him being scared and defensive of the dog but now they seem to be fine together and pretty much just ignore each other, so?

-He does like to cuddle on us at the end of the day or when taking a nap and will let me pet him  and massage his ears/face as he falls asleep. Sometimes he is really into the pets and will lean into them and purr. Other times he will seem like he enjoys it and then start attacking my hand again

Is this common behavior that he will grow out of or do I have a larger issue? I am concerned that he isn’t happy with us and would be better off in a house without a dog. I have grown attached to him and would like to give him more time to adjust, but I also worry that once he’s not a kitten anymore he may have less of a chance of being re adopted if I wait. 

*FYI I live in a no kill city so his life is not in danger if I take him back to the shelter.

There is consistently not enough food in the house and the children are not supplied with enough clothes for winter months, they are malnourished and are never taken to any doctor. The parents aren’t buying my girlfriend the proper medications for her depression and anxiety either or taking her to a doctor when she is severely overweight. The parents make enough money and have the time to do all these things, the money is spent on weed instead and time spent with the mother and stepfather arguing and yelling constantly, with doors being pounded and full water bottles thrown at the kids. She just recently had the courage to file CPS reports and they came to their house to check and the police officer basically said “Well it could be worse” and left them to continue.

It has been 4 days since I confided to Kelly I like her. The 2nd day, I had a HUGE realization when I woke up in the morning, and eventually Reddit did too when I checked the comments: I am being treated NOT as number 1.

My friends said the same thing Reddit did: *Don't be an option*.

* We are still very close friends. If you were to have another surgery, I would still come visit you. This time though, no teddy bear or hint dropping gifts.

With that being said, let's start the conversation

#What I want to say to Kelly, pt. 2 (The ""Conversation"")

I will tell her the following in speech format, but to simplify it, I will list it out:

* Self respect is a core value of mine, and I feel that  making myself wait is doing myself a disservice. I know you said you don't think it's fair to me to have me wait around and be a second choice (and I should look around), but I am a date-one-at-a-time person and it is not my style of doing things.

* Do you find FWB attractive? Do you find me attractive? The way I see it, you're having trouble picking one out of us two. Me confiding feelings while you were already on the edge about dating him puts you through more confusion, and I totally understand. 

* I want to be with someone that treats me as their number 1. Not someone that is unsure about dating me. You are definitely not the person that has been playing me around, and you are in a state of confusion. Because this is not what I want, I'd like to say **I don't want to do what you suggested earlier: Letting what we have grow (treat you like a GF, etc). I have to do what's best for me and right now that's what's good for me. I just want to remain friends and keep it that way for the future.**

#Conclusion

I like KElly as a friend, and after a lot of consultation with my friends who have been around her, they said I deserve someone with a more matching personality and of course someone that likes me as their number 1. However, I am still unsure about the conversation part and would like some advice from you all. Thank you.

My question is, when will I be?  I'm comfortable living in my car, but I'm not comfortable panhandling.  How much money will I likely need to get myself to Seattle or LA or El Dorado some other faraway magical land?  How much will I need leftover to not starve once I get there?  How much will I need while I find a job, and a place to stay?  Is there any particular amount, or do I need to be a proper grown-up with 2.5 kids and a mortgage before I can do that?",06Feb2019,1

I'm new to college, homeschooled prior, so I'm a little bit socially maladjusted and decided a few weeks in I'd begin hanging out in the campus lounge to try and make some new acquaintances and greet people. Things are going well, but I'm a bit of an introvert, I like people but I get tired very easily.

We weren't super buddy buddy or anything, just acquainted. But ever since then whenever he sees me, he drops everything he's doing and runs over to me attempting to start conversation.

He's there.

Minding my own business in the library returning a book?

Shouts my name and runs over to me.

Sees me sitting in a cafeteria listening to music with my earbuds?

Knocks on glass, runs inside, sits at my table and despite me not saying a single word to him he just sits there doing nothing. Not even using his phone, not even talking. Just sat there for a straight hour staring at me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've given no indication that I was interested and I've never gone up to him so I don't know what's going on? He makes every single effort to follow me wherever I go. I've gone all around campus, by the bookstore, by the bathroom, the computer lab to work on an essay, EVERYWHERE.

I recently met a girl who takes the same bus as him to college, and he apparently has a habit of latching on to a single girl at a time and just following them wherever they go, to the point he'll wait outside of the bathroom alone until they leave.

241,"Hi Everyone,

**BACKSTORY:**

I've been together with my now fiancee for 4 years. The relationship itself is very good and solid but we just moved in together. I've slept with her a bunch of times before over the years but this time we're living together for the first time. The reason we didn't move in together before is because of timing. In college I was staying at my parents and she was living in a dorm. After graduating I went to grad school and so did she and we were a good 45 minutes apart so we had each others place. Long Story short, we graduated and I recently proposed to her. We also had the chance to move in together since we now live and work in the same area and it makes sense. 

**MAIN ISSUE:**

So to get to the point, the first week everything went great. I was sleeping super well and everything was cookies and cream. By the third week I was starting to get annoyed at a couple of things. She literally takes the whole comforter in the middle of the night leaving me to freeze to death. When I finally get the comforter back to the middle, her body is burning hot. I can literally cook and egg when I'm next to her. Then she starts moving all around the place. By that point, it's already 4 AM and I still haven't gotten that much sleep. I thought I would get used to it but it's been 2 months and I'm miserable. I'm honestly not sure how I didn't notice any of this sooner when we started dating but now it's driving me insane. 

I haven't mentioned anything to her but at this point I can't stand it anymore. I'm not sure if I should tell her something or suggest me sleeping in the spare room we have. I definitely don't want to hurt her feelings or the relationship but this is starting to affect my job and life. And of course, we're planning on getting married in the near future which makes things even more stressful. ",06Feb2019,1

244,"She was 3 years younger and also I wanted to have sex since my high school buddies were losing their virginity but she didn’t want to fuck.

So I quit on the relationship and she dumped me which I wanted but the new girl who was my age and smoked pot didn’t want to date me so it was almost instant regret and it made me go into a shell in college and gave me tremendous anxiety. And now my life is basically a wreck, no friends, no job, living with my parents, and ironically enough chronically addicted to pot especially dabs. 

The shame I feel from this whole process drives me ever deeper into the hole every day

Doesn’t help that I was a former “gifted” student whose grades had dropped off some so that I didn’t get into my chosen school and had to settle for a school with far less career connections. So it was already sort of teetering for years I guess, but not much. However what has happened since then has basically been a continual downward spiral with many of the negative turns being further self inflicted issues by me and even further deepening the hole.

247,"I'm 42/m, not extremely promiscuous or anything but I've had occasional one night stands over the years. I'm not married, never have been, so basically I enjoy the freedom I have, lol. Anyway today I was waiting to order a sub in the deli area of my local grocery store when this little girl comes running by. She was very small so I'm guessing around two years old but I'm not the best at guessing baby ages so take that for what it's worth. Definitely not more than three years old. The first thing I thought when I saw her face was that she looked like I did when I was little, and she looked right at me so I smiled at her, but she didn't really respond and just kept running. I looked up to make sure she wasn't just running around alone and saw a lady chasing after her and I immediately recognized her as someone I had a one nighter with a few years ago, definitely long enough ago for that kid to have been mine. I would say the time frame would definitely correspond. I don't think she saw me but I was panicked and I turned around and just faced the other way until they were out of sight, then I quickly left the store.

Honestly, I have no idea what to do, if anything. I think I remember the girl's first name, and I did bring her home the next day so I have a vague idea of where she lived a few years ago but that's it. We never hooked up again. She could have slept with someone who looked like me a short time later and it could be that guy's kid, she could be married to him now, I have no idea. But even if it is my kid, there's also the factor of me not being the greatest person and I don't know if I would be even a halfway acceptable dad to a kid. I don't have the greatest morals.

248,"So, I was recently rehired with a promotion to Family Dollar. I quit before, and I have very limited training (Was a cashier before, Assistant Manager now). This lady who was hired as ASM in my absence seems to have it out for me for seemingly no reason. 

I just come back from a training store on our delivery day (Meaning there's nothing left to put away), and this other ASM--We'll call her Jane--Is already there. She closed the store the previous day, and she was there in the morning. As soon as I get there, she's telling me I need to get on register. I'm not gonna lie to you, I want to avoid the register at all cost. If you're on register, you're on register alone, and the company expects you to get a ton of other work done. In this instance, there was a cashier coming in in just two more hours, so I tried to explain to her that me getting on register for only two hours was pointless because I was supposed to be unloading the truck.

 She got snippy telling me that she knew that, and that she had to get endcaps done. She claimed there was still stock to put up before the truck came, and that same stock belonged on the endcaps she was working on. She also was confused about me being there for the truck. She didn't think I was doing it (Even though I came in the previous night, and she said I was there for truck).

The back room was spotless.
There was no stock to put on endcaps.

I let it happen anyway because I know how it can be when you start doing something, so I get on register anyway.

I ask her if there's anything she needs me to do so she can finish the endcaps, and she says there's just too much on the floor for me to help her. So I don't. When I see less people coming in, I check the store computer (Because all managers are supposed to check it 2-3 times a day, and Jane decides she ""doesn't mess with that thing""). While I'm looking at that, she gets some chips and just starts eating next to me. I print some stuff off, and get off the computer. I read that some signs need to come down, and that Valentines balloons need to be blown up, so I work on that. I let her know what signs need to be pulled and she's like, ""Well I'm not worried about that, I'm worried about these endcaps."" 

She is no where near an endcap. She's down an aisle just sitting on the floor. (In fact, I found her standing up front doing nothing more than anything)

So, then she takes her break, comes back, says she talked to our SM (Who was on Vacation btw) and she says I'm unloading the truck after all. Which, duh.

She takes a customer call, and it loud and snippy. I tell her to relax and breathe, she doesn't need to be so stressed about work. She comes at me like, ""Well there's a lot to do. Looks like you're doing enough breathing for both of us anyway!"" And she walks away.

At some point, its mentioned that the cashier usually runs register for truck.

I start to get off register, she asks why, I tell her our cashier is gonna be in soon, and She's acting like he's doing truck suddenly.

The cashier is late, and I mention that if he doesn't show up, one of us has to unload the truck alone. So she leans over the counter, on her phone, and says, ""Oh no, you volunteered to do truck, so you can do it while I just sit up here on register allll day.""

Unwarranted. I didn't volunteer, I was informed I had to, and she acted like she was going to do it this whole time, but okay. I just shrug and walk away.

The cashier comes in and for 2 straight hours they sit up front talking, doing absolutely no work, while I put up signs she should have put up last night. It was frustrating.

Then another ASM from another store (Who happens to be my mother) comes in, and wonders why all these people are here and not doing anything productive. Jane claims she hasn't worked since Monday. Which is a lie because she closed the store the previous night. I told my mom they haven't done anything at all.

From there, there's a shift change.

So yesterday, Another ASM (My best friend and coworker) tells me that Jane got a stressful DM visit and told her that I don't do any work, and that she knows I don't like her.

Today, I come to pick up keys (Because I don't get my own keys), and my best friend and I are scolded (I am not clocked in) about what didn't get done, and She's suddenly all about teamwork (My SM is usually very petty, and she will get on anybody about anything). She claims she's about teamwork but mentions that only she, my friend, and I would be the only ones following task lists because we're a team. What about Jane? Why isn't Jane in trouble? And even if Jane weren't in it, a team isn't just management. Why aren't the cashiers getting talked to?

(My SM also checked the camera becayse I left a not saying it was dark by the time I got her text about taking the front trash out--Something that shouldnt be there, and that she put out--And she said it was still light and that I should have done it. Super petty. Couldn't look at us doing work though.)

I'm so stressed and mad I can't sleep. Our SM wants to have a formal meeting between my friend, herself, and I (But again, probably no Jane.). I'm concerned about what lies may have been spread or how unfair the criticism may be.

I'm no star worker, I slack, but I definitely don't stand around and do nothing. I achieve results.

TL;DR: My Coworker was lazy, called me lazy behind my back (And said I didn't like her), and suddenly she's not being held accountable for errors, or apart of the ""team"". And I worry things may get worse.

What should I do?

257,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for over a year. Almost the whole time in secret. I visit her after work, we hang out at school, etc etc. (BTW I'm 20 and so is she) Her dad HATES me. It all originated when he found out I had depression issues. Then he once found a hickey. Things got way blown out of the water and eventually I met up with him and person and told him I was sorry. I told him that's all we did (really it is). We just wanted to do ""what they do in the movies"". Idk it was just in the moment. Anyways back to the topic.

Around the time of the hickey someone was spreading a rumor that he hits his kids. And he assumed it was me. I've tried meeting with him, calling, texting, and eventually I just wrote him a letter saying I'm sorry about the rumors and tried to clear some things up. He won't talk to me still.

Without going into details I think he's a narcissist. He's extremely controlling and he blackmails his kids a lot with things he pays for. They aren't allowed to lock bedroom doors and he has NO ISSUE walking in on my changing girlfriend and just striking up a conversation while she is changing. 

My girlfriend wants to move out. Very bad. She is sick of her Dad being emotionally abusive and hating me as well. We have discussed moving out for a while but she wanted to be more ready for it. Well the time has come and she found the apartment she wants and asked her parents about it. Her mom was extremely supportive and drove a half hr to the thrift store to buy her some used dishes so she can have some plates and bowls and stuff. Her Dad called Mom about this and he came home early from work to grill my girlfriend. He asked why she would want to move out and things like that. Eventually he got to the point where he said, ""you can move out with one rule. _______ (me) is not allowed at your apartment"". He doesn't want her associated with someone that ""almost ruined his reputation"".

We aren't sure if once she is moved out we should tell her parents or let them catch us. Or try to stay secret as long as possible. I just want my girlfriend to be happy. She means the world to me. I'm willing to lose her for her to be happy. I wouldn't ever want to break up with her. But I can't force her parents to hate her. Is it selfish of me to keep dating her? She said ""if we ever break up I won't regret cutting ties with my family"".

The main issue is that the floor and the door are so loud and creaky that it wakes me up in an instant. I put up with it during the summer but I politely requested that he keep his bed clothes outside the room when I go back to school. He agreed but continued to come in and wale me up half heartedly claiming he ‘forgot’. I would understand if this happened a few times but this has been happening almost daily for 7 MONTHS now.  I tried to tell my mum and she warns him, but he only stops for a couple of days then continues to wake me up in the middle of the night again. What makes it worse is that it takes me anywhere from 2-4 hours to fall asleep again. I’ve been waking up with migraines and it’s beginning to affect me at school.  I find it extremely difficult to stay awake in most lessons and I’ll be sitting my GCSE’s soon. I suggested collecting his clothes earlier along with other solutions but he ignores me. I can’t help but feel like he doesn’t care about me at all. Every night I spend lying awake trying to go back sleep the more I despise him. He is almost 26 and has no plans of moving out soon.

264,"I'm sorry for any spelling I'm on mobile. This is a long story so I apologize in advance. I (25 F) have been with my current boyfriend (24 M)  for a little over a year. I'll call him Thomas. We found out I was expecting and were both excited. I have always felt more like a friend than a lover to him and feel like I'm missing something. 
My ex and I broke up at the worst of my depression when I didn't know how to cope with anything. It ended awful. We jumped into relationships fairly quickly after spending two years together. I miss him everyday ave we just got to the point where we are finally on good terms. My family adored him and we had our future planned out. Now I'm feeling stuck in a relationship with somebody I love but am not in love with. I miss my ex more than anything and truly believe he is the one. Any advice is welcome because I'm so lost. I just got back on my antidepressants to help but I just am so heartbroken every time I see him.

266,"Hi everyone. 

I have a problem I'm struggling with. It's mainly sensitivity to some people's voices, in particular loud voices with certain frequencies and pitch. 

I obviously can't ask people to shut up or avoid them completely in public areas. 

So far I've been wearing headphones and turning up the music volume but there are times my headphones aren't with me or they are so loud I can still hear them.

It's a very unpleasant feeling, I literally feel vibrations in my inner ear that chill the back of my neck.

Any suggestions would be great thanks

268,"Long story short, I kind of fucked up and took on a semester of college and 9k student debt. Working to a degree to be able to apply to JET.

I basically just want a simpler life, and America can't offer that at all. I'd be satisfied working in some old lady's shop everyday.

Im an eagle scout, been studying Japanese since April and am currently minoring in Japanese. I've got a decent grasp on the language and grammar. How can I convince someone to sign a work visa without me needing to go through more college? This way of life is killing my soul, I need to get lost in the wooded mountains of Japan basically.

269,"For starters, this is what sexsomnia is: 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_sex

&gt;Sexsomnia, also known as sleep sex, is a distinct form of parasomnia, or an abnormal activity that occurs while an individual is asleep. Sexsomnia is characterized by an individual engaging in sexual acts while in non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.

I am 27 years old gay male. I have experienced this occasionally and never took it seriously or even considered that it was an issue since it never really affected me negatively. Once, it happened with my straight roomate in college who I groped and dryhumped in my sleep, i apologised and he took it lightly and made fun of me. Since then it has only happened with partners with whom I was in consensual relationships. It did concern me that I could not recall the details of what happened each time, but again I did not take it seriously. 

Last year, in December however, i ended up drunk at a party and shared a bed with my friend. And the next morning I woke up with fragments of memory of assaulting my friend, let's call him A. I was mortified and didn't know how to deal with it. I asked A whether or not I did anything inappropriate at night. He affirmed, but did not broach the issue and evaded. I tried to apologise, but I didn't know how to. We spent the day together with friends and I tried to put it off my mind. A few days later, our mutual friend (B) called me up and blasted me for assaulting her friend. She was really hurt, and I was mortified. I tried calling up A, but he did not pick up my call. I apologised to him in text and promised that he would never have to see me again, that I would remove myself from our mutual friend circles, and stop associating with the activities he's involved in. I told him that I regret everything that happened and that I will always be guilty for doing what I did to him. I have not touched a drop of alcohol since then. 

I never thought I would be able to show my face to anyone again after what happened, i wanted to drop out of college. I didn't want to associate with any friends. They all think I am a really stand up guy who has impeccable integrity and empathy. And now I am just a hypocrite who betrayed his friends the worst way possible. 

I confided what happened to four other friends, they listened to me and told me what I did was shitty and that I need to make amends but not expect forgiveness. And that dropping out of college and isolating myself won't help anyone. So gradually i started going back to college and hanging out with people. But then another incident happened, where while I was hanging out with my friends at my classmates place, B came over (B passed put from my college so all.y classmates know her) saw me there, and lost it. So a lot of my classmates who were there as well as some other people found out that I am a sexual abuser. Very shitty situation but not something I was not expecting to happen. 

Right now, i am going through my daily routine very mechanically, not completely isolating myself but am just hovering on the lines of being polite company to being aloof. At home i just stay holed up.in my room watching netflix. I have deleted all my social media accounts other than Reddit. And am just waiting to finish my college by June this year and get away from everyone I know here.",06Feb2019,1

Me and my man have been together for 5 years I am 21 years old. We are in love or were or whatever is happening. Anyways, these past 6 weeks have made me feel all types of ways but the lonliness sucks. Me and him have always been happy and never argued this whole five years. That was until the baby came. I feel like he is disinterested in me and everything I do or have to say. I feel as if i have no help because he hets frustrated with the baby crying. Okay, i get it, babies cry a lot and it can get on your nerves but my baby is ALWAYS crying and its stressful. Nothing wrong with her she just wants to be held all the time and thats fine but my arms get so tired with her being in them all day that i just wish he would rock her for a while but it gets frustrating and i know that so i dont get mad maybe a little annoyed but not mad because i get it. Ive been around kids my whole life and he hasnt. He always wants favors from me but i dont get any in return mostly because i cant but a little back rub or something would be nice. We barely talk anymore and i get so frustrated to the point where i get snappy and i am really not like that. Then we end up snapping back and forth. I feel unappreciated and unwanted. I feel like i just carried a baby for 10 months and went through all that pain that i should maybe get atleast 1 night of sleep. But he just acts like he cant hear her so i have to get up and do everything. Even in the morning. I thought it waa supposed to be team effort but its beginning to feel like a 1 man job that needs 5 men to finish it. Its 2 am and i currently just put my baby to bed and he is sleeping but im wide awake wondering if im good enough for anybody anymore. My body is hideous, my face is broke out, i havent showered in days i feel disgusted in myself and i dont know why it has to be this way. I dont feel pretty at all anymore and its upsets me to the point where i cry. I try to talk about it to my bf bc i always good talk to him before but he just doesnt want to listen to me anymore like hes tired of my voice or the stories i tell. I have nobody but a baby who cant talk or understand what i have to say and i literally feel heartbroken at this point. Just wish i had someone to talk to about the way im feeling.

272,"So I have a friend. We've been family friends for about 12 years. We were never super close, as we only hung out once a few times a year and whenever we ran into each other at church as kids. I had good memories with this girl, as she is only a year older than me (and I am also female). 

About 7 years ago, she was going through some really hard time. She never wanted to share the details, but I am pretty sure she turned into a drug addict. She dropped out of her Ivy league university, much to the dismay of her Ivy league family, and said she could only get back in if her super rich parents ""paid a ton of money to the school."" She said she was kicked out for wearing a bikini, which I do not believe, but I never challenged her. When she was going through her hard time, her mother would ask me to reach out to her. I did because I genuinely cared, and only about 1 out of 10 of those times got a response. One time she messaged my sister and my sister told her I was going to the local mall with my now ex bf (we will call him ""Tim""). Tim thought she was super weird, and I saw how strange she was since she dropped out of school. She was a very different person. She ended up grabbing Tim's ass while we were in a store and I had my back turned (looking at clothes). I believed Tim when he confessed this to me later that day, and he asked that I confront her. I did. I called and left an honest, but not aggressive voicemail. She never returned the call. Never brought it up. Never said sorry. Ironic enough, Tim ended up violently assaulting me, but she doesn't know that and doesn't need to. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year and a half later, I graduated university. My parents said I invite her and her family to my party (despite them knowing about the Tim incident bc Tim was then my ex). She had just been readmitted to her Ivy and I believe she was jealous that although I was younger, I had finished my studies a few years before she would. This was also a big deal because her family was significantly richer and more educated than mine. Anyway, she gave me a very, very ugly used dress. I am not being a snob when I say very ugly. It was absolutely hideous. I have no idea where she got it. I never shared my opinion and pretended that she gave me a sincere gift. There was also no card with the gift (which is unusual in my American culture). There was no congratulations. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few years later, she ended up graduating. She shared that she was bipolar, which I accepted and said I was ""there for her"" even though deep down the Tim incident and the dress incident bothered me. I never brought those up. I was hurt that she could hurt my boyfriend back then (she was single at the time) even though Tim later did some horrible things to me. She did not invite me to her graduation party, but she did invite me to her engagement party. Although I could not attend her party (because I was on an international trip), I wished her the best. I sincerely wished her the best and the happiness because I knew that she had gone through a lot, but the Tim and dress incidents still bothered me. She also started to harass my younger sister and insist that my sis was a druggie (and she never was/has been). This really bothered me, but I never brought it up because I stayed true to my ""assume the best, forgive always"" Catholic upbringing. She kept me out of her life unless I posted something somewhat juicy on facebook (like a new job, a new boyfriend, etc). To me, this seemed really fake. She never expressed joy for me for anything. She merely was competing with me. And to make things worse, I am now in graduate school at a really prestigious school and she is not in graduate school but wants to be(again despite coming from a more privileged family). 

Her engagement party was over a year ago, and she never responded to my ""when are you getting married"" question. Now she did. She did not invite me to her wedding. I think that she only invited me to her engagement party because she is materialistic and just wanted more gifts (her parents always spent a ton of money on her, so she is used to getting lots of expensive things). She asks how my life is now, but I sense that it is not out of genuine concern, rather out of competition. At this point, I do not think I want to be friends with her. I have already expressed a sincere congrats to her on her engagement/marriage more than once, so I think I did my duty. I haven't responded to her fb message. I feel like she is taking advantage of my kind and forgiving nature, and I don't want to be awkward and bring up the Tim incident, but that still really bothers me. I have mixed feelings about dumping the friendship, but I feel like it's a good idea. Please help. Thank you for your time and advice. ",06Feb2019,1

I am Joe, 28yo and live in Australia. I have had a chronic medical condition for 13 months now.

What do I do? I can't live like this. Can I donate my body to research? 


Here is a little write up about my condition(I am not asking for your diagnoses, as I said I have exhausted all urologist options):

The issue is in my penis and causes me to have 24/7 sting in my urethra, my urine smells and I have frequency/ urgency issues. Sex makes it worse. So you could understand why I can't just accept a life of no partners at 28. 

What would you do in my position? I have just about given up.

It just gets worse around 11PM-1AM when I'm trying to fall asleep and it just keeps sounding like someone is running a marathon upstairs.

293,"First time posting in this sub. So, I’m 16(F) about to be 17 in three days. My boyfriend is 17(M) about to be 18 in about two weeks. He currently lives with me at my moms house with my two sisters. It’s been very stressful and frustrating living here. We’ve been together for a year and a half. 

This might sound spoiled or entitled but we’re supposed to be responsible for all of the chores (heavy garbage, tons of dishes, huge bushels up and down the stairs, etc) around the house while my older sister (19) does ABSOLUTELY nothing. My youngest sister (13) doesn’t get yelled at to work either but will occasionally clean up and halfass do the dishes. I’ve dealt with unfairness my whole life unlike my boyfriend who’s always shared equally with his siblings. It really stresses him out when we get yelled at to do stuff around the house especially when it was just done earlier that day or the day before. I get frustrated too but it’s worse for him because he hasn’t had to deal with it his whole life. 

Basically, my mother is borderline toxic when it comes to working around the house. She’ll nag and nag unless we do it RIGHT away, which is almost impossible because it’s not like we sit around all day waiting for her to come give us a job to do. And remember, she’s only telling US to do the work. When I bring up how my sisters can help as well then suddenly I hear how we don’t do shit and we never help etc etc. It’s like she doesn’t see how much work she actually makes us do. But, there’s always excuses for my sisters. Plus, one time she told me how my oldest sister pays her so she doesn’t have to do chores. So we have to take on her duties just because we don’t want to pay. 

Anyways, we’ve been wanting to move for a while now. Struggling to save money due to having to buy our own groceries, most necessities, phone bill, etc. But we’ve got a good amount saved rn. A few months of rent. The underlying issue is actually getting an apartment. We want to move to a town that’s about two hours away from our current home. My parents aren’t too strict that they would call the police and report me missing or anything but they’re naggers, hypocrites, etc. Also, his older brother, oldest sister, and nephews live in this town so we wouldn’t be completely alone in a new place. 

The typical rent is around $500-$700 there. We have our eyes on a place that’s $535 a month. Rent is too expensive in any towns close to me, except the city (Chicago) that’s about 30 mins away but is dangerous, especially for my boyfriend who’s already been involved in gang violence, etc when he was younger. But, I figure if we both get jobs then we should have no problem keeping up with bills. I’ve been talking to the landlord about applying and there aren’t too many requirements but they do look into some stuff. Like there’s a chance we’d be able to get approved if he applied by himself as a newly 18 year old, but our chances are better if a parent does it due to qualifications. 

Sorry this is so long, just really need advice. Anyways, sometimes my mom can be tolerable/okay and it kind of makes me blind to how she acts when chores need to be done. I wish it wasn’t like that because I always end up disappointed. So I texted her one night and told her that with or without her help, I was moving it. We discussed and I made sure to keep telling her that I would still be able to make it happen without her, just so she wouldn’t be able to hold it against me or anything. She was kind of 50/50 about the whole thing. I had legitimate answers to her questions. I told her the lease requirements, where we’ll be living, what complex, etc. I told her all the information. She seemed like she was going to do it so the next morning I brought up filling out the application and she said she wasn’t letting her 17 year old daughter move in with her boyfriend. Also, she mentioned how we apparently don’t do anything she asks so why should she help us? Bullshit .. anyways, I was frustrated and kept asking every now and then. Only because I knew she was close to agreeing last night. I gave up hours ago. 

At this point, it’s pretty clear she isn’t going to do it. I’m still really upset because I know it’s possible without her but our chances of getting into a good place would’ve been so much better if she helped me. We’re not happy here, I told her many times during our convo. I guess I kind of got my hopes up thinking she would agree. But now that it’s clear she isn’t, idk what to do. I asked my dad (they’re divorced) but I knew it was a very very long shot. My dad is sensitive and got very stressed when I mentioned leaving a few months ago. I thought I would try telling him the same things I told my mom. Only he just hurt my feelings in a different way. I know he didn’t mean to, but he really made me confused and stressed. I KNOW I want to leave, but he’s been texting me nonstop for the last hour saying how bad of an idea it is and suggesting that my boyfriend move alone and I stay here to “think”. I’m tired of being treated like I don’t know what I’m doing, especially with my boyfriend. I’m tired of them judging him when they never got the chance to know him. He smokes weed and plays video games in his free time. It helps him calm down. He’s stressed 24/7 here, more than I am. Because of this, they think he can’t take care of me and that we’ll end up homeless or I’ll end up dropping out of school. (I’m enrolled in online school so it won’t be a problem when I move) Their judgement towards him is completely biased and also hurts his feelings. They used to like him but since he’s been living here because he needed help, everyone has grown some type of resentment towards him. My family uses every chance they get to talk shit about him or us. I’m very upset thinking about it rn. 

Basically, for a few months now, every time I get into an argument with a family member I mention how I’ll be moving, out of there lives, etc. Ik it’s not the best way to handle things but I can’t help it sometimes. So this idea to move hasn’t been new and it’s been thrown in our faces occasionally. I just know I’ll be so much happier in my own apartment with my boyfriend. I see myself marrying him. We’ve been together 24/7 for about a year now. We’re past the honeymoon phase and are very serious. I want to be able to decorate my own rooms. I want to be able to do my own chores. I want peace and quiet when I’m trying to do school work. I want peace in general. I forgot to mention how LOUD my sisters and mother are. My sisters have some type of personality that involves yelling, talking loud, etc. My mother yells nonstop. The only time I can work uninterrupted is in the middle of the night when everyone is sleeping. This fucks up my sleep schedule since I end up sleeping all day and my boyfriend is awake without me. Right now I’m sleeping okay by still have trouble focusing during the day. 

I just need to know. Am I making the right choice by deciding to move away with my boyfriend? I feel guilty, confused, and stressed. My dad tells me that I have a false sense of comfort because I don’t have bills yet. I agree with that in a way but I still think it’s better for us to leave. Side note: my grandparents live in a house behind ours. They don’t want my boyfriend here AT ALL and it’s come to the point where I cannot visit them or talk to them without getting so upset and frustrated by them nagging me, judging me, etc. about him. I jump at any noise I hear outside of my door, scared it’s one of them coming to stress us out. Nobody can get into my room because I took my doorknob off on the other side of the door. My grandparents will sit at my door and say terrible things to stress us out. Whenever my grandpa comes he’ll say totally rude things like “someone is about to go run and hide” “he needs to start paying rent by __” “who’s in here”, etc. Every comment he or my grandma makes when they’re outside of my door will ruin my boyfriend’s and my day. 

Am I making the right decision? What am I not thinking clearly about when it comes to moving? I just don’t think I have any other option. ",06Feb2019,1

295,"For some background, I am a Californian Computer Science student currently at a community college and have several options for transferring to a 4-year for this upcoming fall semester. I have been in a long distance relationship for over a year with my girlfriend who lives in France. We have already visited and lived with each other for several vacations. We are very happy together and we are serious about our future. My French fluency level was tested at B2, which is competent enough to attend university and live in France. In addition, the costs are nearly the same for all three options so that factor is not important. After college, I plan to first work in France and then see about the possibility of moving to a country with higher salary rates (France has one of the lowest in Europe) after my girlfriend finishes school as she is one year lower. Fortunately, I am very lucky to be in this situation and have these options but I am having a hard time deciding what is best for me.

My options are:

* Go to university in France and live on my own in a studio.
   * I would be able to see my girlfriend, live on my own, travel throughout Europe, and it would be easier to obtain visa and future job if I stay to work in France / Europe. However, the program would be taught completely in French which would be more of a challenge (English is obviously more comfortable) but I would have my girlfriend's help and I could improve my French very quickly through this total immersion. Also, my parents and I are a bit skeptical of a French degree compared to an American degree, especially if I return to America again one day and try to find a job.
* Complete the last two years of a 100% online Cal State bachelor degree while living on my own in a studio in France
   * I would be able to see my girlfriend, live on my own, travel throughout Europe, could immerse to improve the language, would have an American degree taught in English, and it would be easier to live in France instead of coming after two years of university in California. However, the school reputation is not as good as the third option and it could be a bit complicated for assignment submissions or online class conferences with the 9-hour time difference.
* Stay in California to finish the last two years at a good UC school while staying at parent's house
   * This is my parents' preference because the school ranking and reputation here is a better than I would receive at the other two schools. I understand why they prefer this as it logically would allow me to have better chances with finding jobs after graduating. However, I would have the long distance with my girlfriend for another two years and I feel that I could regret living at home.

My main concerns are really the value of a French degree compared to an American degree along with how important a school's reputation is when finding a job. I do not think that the school reputations matters too much for Computer Science as the concepts are all the same, but my parents disagree. Thank you in advance for your advice.

300,"I am the youngest and only female of three, to a single mother who may have not been the best mother but that story is for another day. I'm currently in my senior year of college, about to graduate this summer with a bachelor's degree in fine arts. I haven't lived with my mom since I moved on campus.

My second oldest brother, C, and his girlfriend, L, moved into my mom's apartment in 2014 (taking the empty bedroom that I left behind.) My mom agreed for him to move in with him under the assumption that he would help pay rent and he did, for a time. There has always been tension between C and my mom since both of them are loud and hot-headed. C regularly smoked weed and my mom didn't like that, but he did it anyway (along with L.) L didn't work and instead lived on SSI. C worked different part-time jobs while living with my mom but worked a full-time job at the same busing company my mom worked at. 

Over the years, tension grew in their home with those three constantly arguing about living situations, not paying rent, constantly smoking weed, etc. My mom has repeatedly told him that she wanted him and L to move out. They didn't up until 2 moves later, when my mom moved into a house. 

Now, here's some context. I don't live with my mom, but my mom rented a 3-bedroom house so that I could spend the weekends and holidays at my mom's house and, also, to spend more time with my dog. C and L lived in my mom's living room because they were expected to move out. Tension grew between my brother and I because of my dog; my dog was a puppy at the time, so I would have to walk through the living room to let him outside in the back (and this would happen at early mornings and late nights.) C and L had a cat that liked to roam, so they would put up baby gates to trap the cat. Taking down the baby gates and holding the cat over and over to let my dog outside must have irritated them. Actually, I think me having a big dog in general that my mom took care of while I was away was irritating for them in general. 

C and my mom had constant fights while in that house and I mean screaming fights, where C would insult my mom and my mom would tell him that he needs to leave. There was a night after spending a few days at home where I sat in my room with my dog while C and L were in the living room. I was stressed out by the living situation and, honestly, I cry very easily so I was crying in my room. My mom came to check on me because I wanted to go back to the dorms for the week. She noticed I was crying, asked what was wrong, and then I told her that I feel anxious taking my dog outside because it irritates C and L and I didn't like the attention. I'm assuming C heard me say this because, from the living room, he told me to ""stop being a big baby."" I know that may seem like a childish thing to get upset over, but I was already feeling shitty for being there and for him to throw that at me made me feel like I was back in my child body again. I felt small. I wanted to leave immediately. I walked out and while my mom was driving me home, she was telling me how pissed off she was that he told me that. 

After I was dropped off at home, I got a call a few hours later from my mom that she kicked him out of the house. C and L packed up their things and left. I don't know where and neither did my mom, but she didn't care at the time. She just wanted him gone. She said that when C was leaving, he told her that she's not a mother to him and then left. That night, in 2016, was the last time I've seen my brother.

Since then, he has cut off all communication and ties with anyone in our immediate and distant family. We messaged him to let him know that our grandfather died and he responded that he didn't care and blocked our numbers. We later, through some digging, found out that C and L moved to Colorado Springs, CO. That's the only information I have on my brother, except a recent one.

My mom called me a few weeks back and told me that she found Facebook accounts for C and L. I looked it up and saw, indeed, recent pictures of my brother and his girlfriend--with a child. There were no information on the name, gender, age, etc. on the child because his Facebook account was private and when I submitting a friend request for both him and L, they both blocked me from Facebook.

I've spent time and money trying to look up my brother so that I could find some closure for myself and my family. My mom has been (and still to this day) beating herself up for years about C abandoning our family. I understand that it's his decision to go no-contact with us, but I wish I would understand why he made this drastic decision and stuck with it this far.

I know a possible address he may live at and I was thinking about sending him a letter in the hopes of him responding. However, I want to know something about the baby. A name? A sex? How old are they? I looked up the birth announcements in the Colorado Springs newspaper but found nothing. Is there any other way that I could find birth records for my niece/nephew?

TL;DR: My brother and his girlfriend has gone no-contact with our family and I've recently found out that they may have a child together. ",06Feb2019,1

302,"Literally. I don’t know what happened, but I just can’t drink alcohol anymore without getting sick. Like “throw the drink up 5 minutes later when it’s the only drink I’ve had” sick.

I know this doesn’t sound like that much of a problem, and admittedly it isn’t in most situations, but I’m a sophomore in college with a heavy drinking culture, and it’s kind of what you do. And there’s a lot of stuff that I just don’t want to do sober because it’s so god damn boring, like going to a basketball game. Can’t get rowdy sober. 

Plus, I’d like to be able to enjoy beer. Not the garbage like Keystone or Bud Light, but there’s a lot of really good craft breweries near me that I want to try. 

I don’t know how related this is, but I like to smoke weed a bit, and I recently decided to go on a tolerance break, so there’s a couple weird things going on in my body there. 

Anyways, I’m feeling kinda stuck and a bit sick (after one fucking beer) and not really sure what to do. ",06Feb2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm invisible.  It feels like there's something about me that either repels people or prompts them to judge me unusually harshly.

&amp;#x200B;

It was in my friendships.  Throughout middle and high school, I 'rivaled' with a couple of friends in a few hobbies (mostly academics and an extracurricular activity).  In our tiny school, we were considered to be the 'best' at those particular things.  But no matter where we were in life, our friend group always preferred cheering those friends on over me.  I once won a schoolwide contest - and somehow 'beat' my friend - only to have someone in our friend group approached me to ask why I got an award that that friend clearly deserved.  When friends noted how good my grades were or how talented I was in my niche, it was usually as a comparison:  ""*If you think DrawingThin is good, wait until you meet X.*""  Even in high school, well into my senior year, a school counselor repeated the sentiment: he told me that while my writing was 'good', my friend was simply out of this world.  I was just a benchmark - my friends weren't interested in celebrating successes with me, but they were always pretty happy when someone else beat me.  I could never figure out what I was doing wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I see this in my family.  A few weeks ago, when I was back home, a relative noticed that something was bothering me.  In a rare moment of vulnerability, I decided to open up and tell them what was on my mind.  The response was literally this:  ""Life's like that sometimes.""  Nothing else.  They lost interest.  They returned to their seat, sat down, and started eating again.  It was as though I'd said nothing.  But the second my younger sister walked into the room, that same relative came to life, began joking with her, and asked her about her day.   Any argument or debate can start in a family by anyone, but the moment I begin to say something, people lose interest and shut the conversation down.  Family members greet me with tight smiles and unsure looks, but they loosen up when they see my sister and squeeze her.  

&amp;#x200B;

I see this in my other relationships.  I might tell a mentor, for example, that life has been feeling particularly hard.  They'll smile and say ""You have nothing to to be worried over!"" and the conversation ends there.  Days later, I'll overhear that same mentor consoling a friend and reminding of them of the deep conversations they'd been having - the conversation didn't end at 'You're worrying over nothing', they actually sat down and talked.   My roommate and friend has stopped talking to me at home: when I ask her how her day went, she flatly replies that she doesn't want to talk.  But she very happily and gladly reaches out to our mutual friends, and even arranges plans that might slightly impact me (e.g., she once was planning a henna party) without telling me last.  

&amp;#x200B;

When I mentioned that I missed my deceased mother, I got a 'Well, at least you had a mom' from my mom's older sister.  When I told the professor who reached out to me that I didn't understand why my lab group hated me (spoiler alert: I found out later that at least one of my labmates actually had an issue with black people), she told me that I struck her as 'angsty' when she first met me, and that maybe that's why.  My friends hug and greet each other so naturally - they'll hold hands, talk, lay in each other's laps - but those same friends seem hesitant to even to touch my shoulder.

306,"Okay, there's a lot going on here, not just the recent move, so this might take a while to explain. I hope you read anyway.

I struggle with moderate depression as well as moderate-severe generalised anxiety, and I'm also autistic. Ever since moving to a new city, my depression has been getting worse for the following reasons. Its getting so bad I have trouble leaving my bed, can't stay awake a whole day, can't concentrate well enough to safely drive my car and start crying randomly several times a say.

1. **I'm homesick**

I just moved from my hometown (X) to a city slightly larger (still a small though) city (Y) about an hour and a half away. I moved because the university campus in X does not have the course I wanted to study, but the one Y does. I've never lived so far away from my family, and I'm having a difficult time adjusting. Its not that my family are great or anything (in fact, they can be abusive) but I they are still my only support and I love them. But more than missing them, I miss X. Not the house I was living in - I was only there for like 9 months, but just being able to go to the library or my favourite cafe or any of the parks I like. I know the people in X, I know who the mayor is and the local politics and the businesses. I've tried to get used to Y by visiting cafes and parks and the library and getting to know new people, but its not the same and it just makes me even more sad. X was the first place I have ever felt at home, having moved around a lot when I lived with my parents, especially very suddenly (getting taken interstate with no warning overnight, for example), because my grandparents have lived there ever since I can remember and thus I have been familiar with X since I was very little. On the one hand, I don't want to give in to the feelings of homesickness because I hope they will pass, on the other hand I am miserable in the meantime. I always thought I would explore the world one day, maybe even live overseas, but I can't even handle being half an hour away. I don't want my mental illnesses to win, but I want to go home so badly.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. I'm terrified of starting university**

I'm 22, so most of my high school classmates actually graduated university last year. I'm a late bloomer, I'm aware. I tried to do a vocational diploma through university the first year after I left school, but I only completed the first part, a Cert IV, before dropping out because I had a major falling out with my father and moved to X to be with my mother. I was living with my father until that point. I was barely handling the stress of the course anyway and doubt I would have completed it even if I had stayed with my father. After this point, I attempted a traineeship in business administration, which went terribly. Not only do I suffer from poor executive functioning skills (due to my autism) that made me not the best fit for the role, but my mental health deteriorated to the point where I couldn't do the job because I was spending so much time crying, hiding in the bathroom, having panic attacks and cutting myself. I eventually left the traineeship at the advice of HR and went into a mental health facility for a while due to being suicidal (partly due to the job, partly due to finding out I was autistic, partly due to living with my abusive mother, partly due to the major falling out with my father). I lived in a government funded [youth residential mental health service](https://www.wellways.org/our-services/youth-residential-rehabilitation) (link just an example, not the program I was with) for a year and towards the end of it they helped me start at [TAFE](https://www.tafecourses.com.au/resources/what-is-tafe/) doing a university preparatory course. This went fine to start with, until I moved out on my own. Moving was incredibly stressful for me, and adjusting to living independently without staff to help me manage my mental health was very difficult. The other students also tended to find me annoying (its like high school all over again) although I did make one very good friend who I am still friends with. I dropped out in June, and by September, I was back in a mental health facility - this time for two months. After coming home, I was feeling great - better than I had since I can remember. I decided to actually making progress towards my life's dreams - I want a job one day (I'm on unemployment benefits at the moment but may be transferring to disability benefits soon), I want to complete university, I want to see new places. I even went out on my first ever date. I signed up for a Bachelor of Social Science (the Cert IV meant I was eligible to apply, and could later transfer into a Bachelor of Psychology, which I'm not currently eligible for). I was so excited that I didn't even care I would have to move. But now, the course is less than a month away from starting and I'm remembering how terrible I am at school - I can't organise and plan, and sometimes I can't understand instructions the way everyone else does (being autistic really sucks). Not only that, but my ability to concentrate and keep up are going down the toilet now that my depression is coming back with a vengeance. There is no way that I could possibly handle university in this state, and maybe not even if I was well. I mean, I'm already planning on only studying part time and I have been meeting with the disability advisor, but even so I'm afraid it will be too much for me. The start date just keeps getting closer and my anxiety about it is rising and rising and I think I should drop out before it starts because I can't handle yet another failure. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. I don't like my new house**

As the end date for my lease in X got closer, and I was so excited about moving, I took the first place I could find. Finding a place in Y was really difficult, partly because I have a cat (nowhere seems to allow pets) and partly because I already have some of my own furniture (every share house is already packed to the brim with their belongings. I way too hastily agreed to a place without really considering it. It is a converted detached shed/garage acting as a sort of granny flat. I thought I would love having my own space but living without housemates is terribly lonely. Not only that, but its lonely in the sense that it is also far out of town on a farm. Its not just lonely, its gross. The first thing I noticed when I moved in, before I'd even bothered to unpack, it the sheer amount of bugs - particularly spiders. And this sounds like a problem that should be easily fixed, but its not. I can't afford bug bombs, and I've used up several cans of bugs spray, but I can't reach the cobwebs on the roof even with a ladder because, again, its a shed - there's no proper ceiling, just the pointed corrugated iron roof. And there are a LOT of cobwebs (like a crazy amount, you wouldn't believe how much). Anyway, naturally, being Australia, some of these spiders I've identified as kinds that could literally kill me - red backs in particular. And then there's the cockroaches and earwigs and ants. Most places, when you move in, are cleaned before you get there, right, but not this place. I haven't had the chance yet, but I think I'll need to take a handheld scrubbing brush to the floor of the bathroom and spend an entire day cleaning it. All the curtains have holes in them, the light fixture in the bedroom is missing a cover, there's no laundry or built in cupboards so I have nowhere to put stuff like my vacuum, mop, bucket, etc. the faucet in the bathroom is constantly running, the fly wire door has holes in it, there is no ceiling so the air conditioning is so loud it gives me a headache (but I have to have it on because we are in the middle of a heatwave), the only heating is a wood fire so that's going to get expensive and annoying come winter time, the toilet is always running and it makes condensation on the lid which then rolls on to the toilet seat when you lift up the lid, and I just don't have enough furniture on my own since there aren't any built in cupboards or storage areas or anything (and I'm too poor to afford any). I sound probably like I'm complaining a lot, and any of these things on their own wouldn't bother me, but all together just adds a ridiculous amount of stress on top of everything else, and again it is literally a shed so it doesn't have like proper walls or anything, and there is marker writing on the walls that the builders must have used and anyway I'm rambling but I really can't handle it at the moment and I just was to live in a real house.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. I'm Broke as All Hell**

Before moving, I got my [superannuation](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/superannuation-and-retirement/how-super-works) (basically forced savings for retirement) released early due to hardship. I had about $1000 (AUD), but most of it was used very quickly to pay off medical bills and to buy things I needed for my new place (as I had been sharing before, I did not have any kitchen stuff, for example). The last of it went into paying a mover to help me, even though he was very reasonably priced. Since moving, I keep needing extra things to pay for that I wasn't expecting - new glasses, text books for uni, bills from my old place in X, registration for my car, medication, furniture that I didn't realise I needed, etc. Its seemingly never ending. On top of that, I'm paying more here than I was before, since Y is generally more expensive to rent in than X (I guess because its slightly larger, even though X is nicer in my opinion). I'm also paying a heck of a lot in petrol costs to visit X again, because I'm so homesick I've been visiting my mother's place almost once a week. Plus, I have an obligation to visit a resident in the dementia wing of a nursing home in X, because I signed up through the [Community Visitor Scheme](https://www.slhd.nsw.gov.au/acrs/cvs.html) back when I was living in the youth resi. I don't want to stop seeing her until they can find another volunteer, but I also simply can't afford to be driving back to X once a week. My mother has been helping by giving me food to take home when I visit her, but even so I'm really struggling with money and its making everything so much harder. I've been doing dog walking to earn a bit of extra cash, but sometimes I simply can't go because I can't afford petrol to get there in the first place, and this yet again just adds another element of stress and responsibility on top of everything while I'm already not coping.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. I don't have time to find anywhere else, and even if I did...**

So university starts in about a month, that's hardly enough time to find a new place and move, and be settled and unpacked before the semester starts, which absolutely needs to be finished before the semester starts if I want to have any chance at all of not failing out immediately. On top of that, moving has already been so stressful and really taken a huge amount out of me and I don't know if I can do it again. I'm worried I simply won't be able to handle it, and I'll end up back in hospital. On top of that, my current landlady is so nice and such a kind person, I don't want to up and abandon the place with no warning only a month after moving in. We don't have a contract or any agreement about how long I would stay, but even I know that one month is too short. It just wouldn't be fair on her. I thought about offering to pay a few extra week of rent before I leave, but I'm way too broke. And speaking of broke, I have no idea how I'm going to get a bond together if I do find somewhere new to live (I didn't pay a bond here, so I won't get anything back when I leave). I've thought about applying for a zero interest bond loan through the housing department, but the problem is that I can't guarantee that it will even go through, and you need to have been accepted into a place before you can even put in an application for the loan. There's no way I will get accepted if I can't guarantee I will be able to pay the bond. On top of that, I will have to sell or store a large amount of my belongings if I am moving into a share house, and I don't have enough time before university or the emotional ability to be able to handle all this at the moment. Most places want you to move in within like a week, and I don't know how I can agree with anywhere if I'm not sure I'll be able to figure out what to do with my stuff that quickly. I've thought about renting a storage unit for my belongings, in case I need them in the future, but I can't afford that anyway, and even if I could, my car is tiny so I'd need to pay someone to help me move it all which I can't afford. And even the stuff that I'd be able to bring to a new place and keep in my room, like my bed, dresser and bookshelf won't fit in my car. How would I even get that stuff to my new place even if I sold everything else?

**6. I don't want to give up before I've even tried, but I don't want to try and fail**

When I mentioned to my mother what was going on, her immediate suggestion was to come back home to X and maybe study only one subject and do it online, or even put off uni for a while and go through a disability job agency to find part-time work. And God, it is so tempting. I miss home so much and I am terrified of the prospect of university. But I know I would never be able to study online. I need individual support with the disability officer in order to understand what I need to do for the classes, what assignments/homework/readings need to be done when, what paperwork we need and where to find it, etc. (I'm not stupid, I understand all of the content perfectly, please don't think I am dumb, I just need help with all the other stuff). Not only that, but I'd be lonely. I'm already lonely. I wanted the proper university experience, you know. Well, not the partying or anything, but I want to go to class and have study session with my classmates. I wanted to have somewhere I have to go every day or almost every day, and people I see every day. So studying online isn't for me. But I don't give up on uni all together, even though I want to, because its been my goal for so, so long. It means so much to me. So that means that I either move back to X and give up on uni, and make an effort to try with uni, possibly fail waste a whole lot of money and stay in Y.  And, well, I feel like I'll probably be terribly unhappy either way because I don't believe that either option will work out.

307,"so this is my first reddit post and I’m on mobile so bare with me.
I’m stuck on what to do and what the police can do for me.

Last night, my dad texted me while I was at my boyfriends house to be careful because there was a suspicious guy around our apartment. 

I live in an apartment complex with two gates, one leading to our front doors that gets stuck and the lock doesnt always work and the other that leads to the basement that has a window facing the hallway of it but the lock does not work at all. There’s 5 units. we’re in the first one. 

When I came home I talked to my mom and she said as I was heading to work at 4am, our roommate went downstairs and opened the curtains to check if it was raining and saw a man staring back at her. It has happened to her twice and we are suspecting they live a block up from us as around that part of our neighborhood is where its really dangerous. She was terrified for a week.

I have complained to our landlord that our locks dont work, our mail is being stolen, and we need better gates and she promised us that to happen soon but its been months and yet the only time they speak to us is to remind us of the rent due. We used to have issues that we had called the cops for such as kids using our stairwell to smoke weed or to have sex. Nothing gets done

I am 4’11 and 115 pounds and I only carry a palm sized pocket knife with me but that isnt much compared to what we’re dealing with. I don’t know if they are planning to rob us or just being creeps but I have an elderly cat at home and he’s left alone as we all work. I don’t want to get hurt or robbed or come home to nothing and a dead cat.

Background: 

I have bipolar 2 and my mental health is not stable. Every time I have a meltdown my husband has helped me. Now he says he is overwhelmed by this. 

I know it sounds silly but I like affection. I want to cuddle every day at least for about 15 mins. I like to kiss and hold hands, etc. He did all these before but now says that I am needy and trying to compensate the affection I never had from my parents with him. He doesn't want to cuddle that often anymore.

Every time I approach him with a cuddle or a kiss he says he doesn't want to. He even gets offensive and mean when I approach him. He says he wants to do these things when he feels like it. In the mean time he treats me like shit. 

I offered to take a break from the relationship. He says he doesn't want that. I offered to leave him alone for a couple months and he said he might get suicidal and he doesn't want me to leave. Yet when I am around him he treats me like shit. 

I am considering divorce. It is hard for me to be with a man that doesn't treat me like his wife. I also feel I am being selfish, because he helped me through some very tough times and I don't want to toss him away like that. I just don't know how to approach him anymore.

Since then its been kind of a downhill tumble. 

In school I was bright, top of my class, kind of lazy but i always got A's.

So i opted to stay home for awhile and make sure she was okay. It worked for her, but my boyfriend at the time left in the middle of the night. To god knows where. I got a kiss on the forehead and i didnt even get to keep the car I helped him buy. 
 Since then, ive been struggling with getting a job, and having to move back home.

324,"I live in a dorm with two other girls. Our general dynamic is a good one between friends and roommates, and our room is known for being the one with the open door where everyone is invited. There is always a friend that is in our room. In the beginning of the year, one of our mutual friends, a commuter, started sleeping over every so often. We didn't think about boundaries because it wasn't an issue at first, so it became a generally unspoken assumption that she was welcome to come at any time and we even referred to her as our fourth roommate. We set up a system to work around her living here, like leaving our door unlocked 24/7. Eventually, she came over more and more often, bringing stuff from home and setting up a small living space for herself under one of our beds. She lives here for days at a time. My roommates and I find it extremely difficult to bring up this issue with her because the boundaries with her are more friends than roommates and we did implicitly create an environment where she felt comfortable to set herself up as our unofficially fourth roommate. We genuinely enjoy her company and we love her as a friend, but we're constantly violating our dorm's rules by having her over and we feel it is a bit inconvenient sharing a space with four people when it was really meant for two, and since she is paying no money and using our things and living freely with us, it is also kind of unfair because housing here is expensive. That being said, I'm afraid she might take it personally because it's a tough thing to hear from people that suddenly a place you considered a living space is not really something to take for granted anymore.

It's hard because we as roommates let her stay over as often as she liked and welcomed her for this whole school year so far.

328,"So where to begin. I've been with my boyfriend for about 2 and half years would say overall a happy and healthy relationship. 

We had some bumps in the beginning with my old friend group and distanced myself from them and since then it's been great. 

Now this is my first relationship and I will admit I am a jealous person and I am insecure (so you have a bit of a better picture of my mentality (not like mega crazy just you know normal I don't feel good enough pretty enough thin enough etc)). So we got together at the tail end of 2016 and in 2017 we started to go out more, go to concerts etc. Posting pics etc. 

I'm not on Facebook only Instagram and this girl started following me, me and my SO then posted pics of us at a sports game and the views and she liked the picture of the views on my SOs page but not the pic of us. Nothing wrong with that at all but I just asked if he knew her and he said it's just some girl he slept with once. 

For some reason I just didn't believe it and have always had a nagging feeling about this person. Since then she has liked a few more pics on his Instagram of just scenery or there was a pic of my bike and his skateboard by the sunset she liked but never any of us. She had sent a snap to him of just a dark room and some weird caption but I think that was like a mass snap to everyone so I wasn't that bothered. 

But I just had a bad feeling and asked a few times if he would unfollow her cause I just think she still has a thing for him and it makes me uncomfortable they still follow each other. But he won't he said I'm being a psycho for asking. 

So I drop it. Dropped it for a while and just thought youre a fine sexy beatchh who this man loves stop thinking about that trash girl. 

Until she requested to follow me on Instagram just before Xmas and I just declined cause I don't want to make my mental health suffer worrying. 

Today I really wanted to get an old photo off my Facebook so logged on for the first time in nearly 3 years and got the photo but I couldn't help myself and wrote in the search bar 

Photos liked by SO

Nothing bad came up until I saw he liked this girls profile pic in march 2017 (2 days before my birthday and we were definitely together) this kind of sent me on a bit of a spiral so typed in SO and this bitches name. 

A few photos came up from a concert about 3 months before we got together. Now he told me they met once on a night out and then she came over and they had sex for ten seconds. 

I know think all of this was a lie and that something bigger went on. Everytime I bring this girl my so makes me feel psycho and I just want to know am I clinging onto straws or would you be worried as well?

I don't want to start drama for no need at all we are in a good place but I'm just upset. I know he will say what's wrong with liking a picture, why do I have to unfollow unfriend her etc? But if it was the other way around I would unfollow them straight away. 

This is all so much in the past I'm afraid it will really harm our relationship but I'm really not comfortable with this girl I just have a feeling in my gut and it ain't gas! 

I feel like if I bring this up my boyfriend will definitely tell me I shouldn't have been looking and trust him and what does it matter that was 2016/2017 this is now. 

I really love my boyfriend and this is my first relationship and he's had a lot more than me and lived with SOs etc. 

What should I do?!?

330,"Okay, there's a lot going on here, not just the recent move, so this might take a while to explain. I hope you read anyway.

I struggle with moderate depression as well as moderate-severe generalised anxiety, and I'm also autistic. Ever since moving to a new city, my depression has been getting worse for the following reasons. Its getting so bad I have trouble leaving my bed, can't stay awake a whole day, can't concentrate well enough to safely drive my car and start crying randomly several times a day.

1. **I'm homesick**

I just moved from my hometown (X) to a city slightly larger (still a small though) city (Y) about an hour and a half away. I moved because the university campus in X does not have the course I wanted to study, but the one Y does. I've never lived so far away from my family, and I'm having a difficult time adjusting. Its not that my family are great or anything (in fact, they can be abusive) but I they are still my only support and I love them. But more than missing them, I miss X. Not the house I was living in - I was only there for like 9 months, but just being able to go to the library or my favourite cafe or any of the parks I like. I know the people in X, I know who the mayor is and the local politics and the businesses. I've tried to get used to Y by visiting cafes and parks and the library and getting to know new people, but its not the same and it just makes me even more sad. X was the first place I have ever felt at home, having moved around a lot when I lived with my parents, especially very suddenly (getting taken interstate with no warning overnight, for example), because my grandparents have lived there ever since I can remember and thus I have been familiar with X since I was very little. On the one hand, I don't want to give in to the feelings of homesickness because I hope they will pass, on the other hand I am miserable in the meantime. I always thought I would explore the world one day, maybe even live overseas, but I can't even handle being half an hour away. I don't want my mental illnesses to win, but I want to go home so badly.

**2. I'm terrified of starting university**

I'm 22, so most of my high school classmates actually graduated university last year. I'm a late bloomer, I'm aware. I tried to do a vocational diploma through university the first year after I left school, but I only completed the first part, a Cert IV, before dropping out because I had a major falling out with my father and moved to X to be with my mother. I was living with my father until that point. I was barely handling the stress of the course anyway and doubt I would have completed it even if I had stayed with my father. After this point, I attempted a traineeship in business administration, which went terribly. Not only do I suffer from poor executive functioning skills (due to my autism) that made me not the best fit for the role, but my mental health deteriorated to the point where I couldn't do the job because I was spending so much time crying, hiding in the bathroom, having panic attacks and cutting myself. I eventually left the traineeship at the advice of HR and went into a mental health facility for a while due to being suicidal (partly due to the job, partly due to finding out I was autistic, partly due to living with my abusive mother, partly due to the major falling out with my father). I lived in a government funded youth residential mental health service for a year and towards the end of it they helped me start at TAFE doing a university preparatory course. This went fine to start with, until I moved out on my own. Moving was incredibly stressful for me, and adjusting to living independently without staff to help me manage my mental health was very difficult. The other students also tended to find me annoying (its like high school all over again) although I did make one very good friend who I am still friends with. I dropped out in June, and by September, I was back in a mental health facility - this time for two months. After coming home, I was feeling great - better than I had since I can remember. I decided to actually making progress towards my life's dreams - I want a job one day (I'm on unemployment benefits at the moment but may be transferring to disability benefits soon), I want to complete university, I want to see new places. I even went out on my first ever date. I signed up for a Bachelor of Social Science (the Cert IV meant I was eligible to apply, and could later transfer into a Bachelor of Psychology, which I'm not currently eligible for). I was so excited that I didn't even care I would have to move. But now, the course is less than a month away from starting and I'm remembering how terrible I am at school - I can't organise and plan, and sometimes I can't understand instructions the way everyone else does (being autistic really sucks). Not only that, but my ability to concentrate and keep up are going down the toilet now that my depression is coming back with a vengeance. There is no way that I could possibly handle university in this state, and maybe not even if I was well. I mean, I'm already planning on only studying part time and I have been meeting with the disability advisor, but even so I'm afraid it will be too much for me. The start date just keeps getting closer and my anxiety about it is rising and rising and I think I should drop out before it starts because I can't handle yet another failure.

**3. I don't like my new house**

As the end date for my lease in X got closer, and I was so excited about moving, I took the first place I could find. Finding a place in Y was really difficult, partly because I have a cat (nowhere seems to allow pets) and partly because I already have some of my own furniture (every share house is already packed to the brim with their belongings. I way too hastily agreed to a place without really considering it. It is a converted detached shed/garage acting as a sort of granny flat. I thought I would love having my own space but living without housemates is terribly lonely. Not only that, but its lonely in the sense that it is also far out of town on a farm. Its not just lonely, its gross. The first thing I noticed when I moved in, before I'd even bothered to unpack, it the sheer amount of bugs - particularly spiders. And this sounds like a problem that should be easily fixed, but its not. I can't afford bug bombs, and I've used up several cans of bugs spray, but I can't reach the cobwebs on the roof even with a ladder because, again, its a shed - there's no proper ceiling, just the pointed corrugated iron roof. And there are a LOT of cobwebs (like a crazy amount, you wouldn't believe how much). Anyway, naturally, being Australia, some of these spiders I've identified as kinds that could literally kill me - red backs in particular. And then there's the cockroaches and earwigs and ants. Most places, when you move in, are cleaned before you get there, right, but not this place. I haven't had the chance yet, but I think I'll need to take a handheld scrubbing brush to the floor of the bathroom and spend an entire day cleaning it. All the curtains have holes in them, the light fixture in the bedroom is missing a cover, there's no laundry or built in cupboards so I have nowhere to put stuff like my vacuum, mop, bucket, etc. the faucet in the bathroom is constantly running, the fly wire door has holes in it, there is no ceiling so the air conditioning is so loud it gives me a headache (but I have to have it on because we are in the middle of a heatwave), the only heating is a wood fire so that's going to get expensive and annoying come winter time, the toilet is always running and it makes condensation on the lid which then rolls on to the toilet seat when you lift up the lid, and I just don't have enough furniture on my own since there aren't any built in cupboards or storage areas or anything (and I'm too poor to afford any). I sound probably like I'm complaining a lot, and any of these things on their own wouldn't bother me, but all together just adds a ridiculous amount of stress on top of everything else, and again it is literally a shed so it doesn't have like proper walls or anything, and there is marker writing on the walls that the builders must have used and anyway I'm rambling but I really can't handle it at the moment and I just was to live in a real house.

**4. I'm Broke as All Hell**

Before moving, I got my superannuation (basically forced savings for retirement) released early due to hardship. I had about $1000 (AUD), but most of it was used very quickly to pay off medical bills and to buy things I needed for my new place (as I had been sharing before, I did not have any kitchen stuff, for example). The last of it went into paying a mover to help me, even though he was very reasonably priced. Since moving, I keep needing extra things to pay for that I wasn't expecting - new glasses, text books for uni, bills from my old place in X, registration for my car, medication, furniture that I didn't realise I needed, etc. Its seemingly never ending. On top of that, I'm paying more here than I was before, since Y is generally more expensive to rent in than X (I guess because its slightly larger, even though X is nicer in my opinion). I'm also paying a heck of a lot in petrol costs to visit X again, because I'm so homesick I've been visiting my mother's place almost once a week. Plus, I have an obligation to visit a resident in the dementia wing of a nursing home in X, because I signed up through the Community Visitor Scheme back when I was living in the youth resi. I don't want to stop seeing her until they can find another volunteer, but I also simply can't afford to be driving back to X once a week. My mother has been helping by giving me food to take home when I visit her, but even so I'm really struggling with money and its making everything so much harder. I've been doing dog walking to earn a bit of extra cash, but sometimes I simply can't go because I can't afford petrol to get there in the first place, and this yet again just adds another element of stress and responsibility on top of everything while I'm already not coping.

**5. I don't have time to find anywhere else, and even if I did...**

So university starts in about a month, that's hardly enough time to find a new place and move, and be settled and unpacked before the semester starts, which absolutely needs to be finished before the semester starts if I want to have any chance at all of not failing out immediately. On top of that, moving has already been so stressful and really taken a huge amount out of me and I don't know if I can do it again. I'm worried I simply won't be able to handle it, and I'll end up back in hospital. On top of that, my current landlady is so nice and such a kind person, I don't want to up and abandon the place with no warning only a month after moving in. We don't have a contract or any agreement about how long I would stay, but even I know that one month is too short. It just wouldn't be fair on her. I thought about offering to pay a few extra week of rent before I leave, but I'm way too broke. And speaking of broke, I have no idea how I'm going to get a bond together if I do find somewhere new to live (I didn't pay a bond here, so I won't get anything back when I leave). I've thought about applying for a zero interest bond loan through the housing department, but the problem is that I can't guarantee that it will even go through, and you need to have been accepted into a place before you can even put in an application for the loan. There's no way I will get accepted if I can't guarantee I will be able to pay the bond. On top of that, I will have to sell or store a large amount of my belongings if I am moving into a share house, and I don't have enough time before university or the emotional ability to be able to handle all this at the moment. Most places want you to move in within like a week, and I don't know how I can agree with anywhere if I'm not sure I'll be able to figure out what to do with my stuff that quickly. I've thought about renting a storage unit for my belongings, in case I need them in the future, but I can't afford that anyway, and even if I could, my car is tiny so I'd need to pay someone to help me move it all which I can't afford. And even the stuff that I'd be able to bring to a new place and keep in my room, like my bed, dresser and bookshelf won't fit in my car. How would I even get that stuff to my new place even if I sold everything else?

**6. I don't want to give up before I've even tried, but I don't want to try and fail**

When I mentioned to my mother what was going on, her immediate suggestion was to come back home to X and maybe study only one subject and do it online, or even put off uni for a while and go through a disability job agency to find part-time work. And God, it is so tempting. I miss home so much and I am terrified of the prospect of university. But I know I would never be able to study online. I need individual support with the disability officer in order to understand what I need to do for the classes, what assignments/homework/readings need to be done when, what paperwork we need and where to find it, etc. (I'm not stupid, I understand all of the content perfectly, please don't think I am dumb, I just need help with all the other stuff). Not only that, but I'd be lonely. I'm already lonely. I wanted the proper university experience, you know. Well, not the partying or anything, but I want to go to class and have study session with my classmates. I wanted to have somewhere I have to go every day or almost every day, and people I see every day. So studying online isn't for me. But I don't give up on uni all together, even though I want to, because its been my goal for so, so long. It means so much to me. So that means that I either move back to X and give up on uni, and make an effort to try with uni, possibly fail waste a whole lot of money and stay in Y. And, well, I feel like I'll probably be terribly unhappy either way because I don't believe that either option will work out.

335,"I wanted to join the army years ago as an officer, and when I first started seeing my current partner I was starting the application process. She didn't try to stop me, we'd only just started seeing each other. There was a lot of resistance to the idea from friends and family alike. Pretty much no-one was supportive of the idea citing the dangers of the job as the only reason. Regrettably, I decided not to go ahead with it. 

One of the major reasons I wanted to join is because I really want to be able to make an impact and do something important that can help people. My skills and interests were never in medicine or healing, but I can do protection and security. So I tried a few different careers as an alternative. The truth is its not worked out for me. I'm just desperately unhappy with the work I'm finding myself doing but I had come to accept that I'd passed up the opportunity to join and that I was getting too old to join. 

I'm 25 now, and a few weeks ago discovered that I can still join up to the age of 29! So suddenly I'm overwhelmed with excitement at the prospect. I've no interest in discussing it with my family, after all this time I've decided that they really should have been more supportive to begin with, so I'm not getting their opinion. However, the woman I've been with all these years matter so much and I needed her on board. 

So we talked about it as another opportunity, and whilst she didn't seem happy she was clearly doing her best to find ways to make it work. She's got lots of questions and so do I, which I need to take down to the recruitment centre. We talked about it for about 3 days and it looked like I was going to be able to do it. 

But yesterday she came home from work and asked to talk to me. She explained that she does not want to stop me doing what I want. She knows that I wanted to do it before and that she hasn't seen me so happy in such a long time at the prospect of joining. But she says she can't do it. She can't have the army wife life, being moved around, being away from each other for months at a time, the potential for death or serious injury. I can't convince her anymore, she's got all the facts that are available and she doesn't want to entertain the idea anymore. But she's also pointed out that she cannot live with me resenting her if I choose not to go to be with her.

We've been together nearly 7 years. She's clearly given this a great deal of thought. But now I just feel stuck. I want 2 things, to be married to her and I want to be an army officer. I thought the 2 would be compatible. I need advise on other ways to think about this, to somehow figure out what the best thing to do is. How can I guarantee that I won't be angry and resentful in 10 years if I choose to be with her over joining the army? ",06Feb2019,1

339,"Hello! 

I am currently racking my brain trying to find any possible career paths. I wanted to share my interests, strengths and passions with this community and see if anyone has some helpful suggestions for possible career paths.  I am a 22 year old, with one year completed in a marketing program. I dropped out of school after attending burning man, granted I was unsure about my program before hand. I am eager to get back into developing my professional career as I do not feel fulfilled working as a waitress. I am open (if not eager) to getting back to school.  I spend a lot of time painting and have recently had some artwork submitted into a gallery for emerging artists. I never planned to lean on this as a career nor do I think I will make big $ doing it, its just something I enjoy. I would use it as a side hustle, but not as a steady, reliable career. I do a lot of self development work and have an opportunity to begin leading a woman's circle in Vancouver, and possibly becoming an online support coach for a program they operate online. This excites me greatly, however its not a full time, reliable career. I have considered counselling but am not sure about it, meaning I can't commit to 6+ years of school. I am interested in being entrepreneurial but do want to have something to fall back on. I also love festivals and events such as basscoast, burning man, LIB etc... and have desired working for such companies but am not sure exactly what training and education is required. (also it can just be a ""its not what you know but who you know"" kind of situation) I also, like many millennials, are wanting a job where I can feel free. Working online and being able to travel are very alluring to me. 

So basically I like art/creativity, being highly social and helping people, event coordination, self development and therapeutic healing modalities.

I'm a first time poster so sorry if this isn't the place to put this. So I need your advice, I'm a straight 20 yr female studying at college, when I was in high school (3 years ago) I dated a guy who was absolutely wonderful in the beginning but after a year and a half he became emotionally abusive. I had the courage to leave and found someone else. Unfortunately, after 3 months he cheated on me and got with someone else. It's been over a year that I have been single and I've gone on heaps of dates. But I don't find anyone attractive anymore, when I see them there is no spark. When I text them I feel hopefully that they will be the one but when we meet I feel nothing unlike my previous boyfriends.  What do you think I should Do? Am I not cut out for love?

342,"As an introduction, I (22F) met a guy in my class (22M) and we instantly became best friends. Just as a side note; he's interested in guys so it's 100% platonic. We've been best friends for about a year and a half now, and he sometimes hangs out with another classmate of ours (22M) so usually it's the three of us.

Turns out, this other guy and i have a mutual attraction, and we got together. Everything went well for us, it was like a dream to me. Except, when we broke out the news to my best friend... he responded very badly, and immediately refused to talk to us. 

He didn't speak out and tell us why exactly he was reacting that way (which got me very frustrated because i've been in way too many situations with miscommunications involved to know that it NEVER ends well), but was indirectly posting tweets, probably with the intention to give us hints that he disapproves of us.

But 6 months later, it's as if nothing happened that day, the three of us are still pretty close. Or so i thought. Just recently a small fight broke out between my best friend and i over a really petty miscommunication but he's making a huge deal out of it. 

I'm just wondering if it's just the grudge he's holding against us, and i'm really frustrated about the unnecessary tension we're having because of this. I just wish he'd speak out and tell us what he honestly feels about us, and that he'd be happy for us instead. 

My main worry is that we will get to the point of not speaking, which wont be good considering the fact that i spend most of my time with them. &amp; now i'm pretty lost on what i should do. Thoughts?",06Feb2019,1

345,"I am in 13th grade and getting my high school degree in July in Germany. I have no idea what I want to do afterwards.

In Germany, you have three major options with a few variations after finishing grade school. 

You either go to Hauptschule (5th to 9th grade), Realschule (5th to 10th grade, which is what I originally did) or Gymnasium (5th to 12th grade). 

I went to a tenth-grade school, and then went to a high school after that (I got my tenth grade degree and went to a trade-specific highschool (11th to 13th grade). 

So now, I'm close to the exams, which are in two months. I still have no idea what I want to do, so I'd like to ask what my options are.

Reason as to why I'm asking reddit instead of getting my ass up and searching for counselling is because I have major depression. I barely managed to kick my own depressive unmotivated ass to write this post.

What are my options? I'm desperate. So desperate that I'm writing this in class instead of paying attention.

I originally thought of becoming a Librarian due to my love of books. But I was told that getting a job would be difficult and the pay isn't good and and and... .

I really would like to escape my parents, who play a major part in my psychological issues. So I was thinking of going to a trade school instead of studying, because I'd get money. Money to move out, I don't care if it's an affordable cartboard box around the block, I just want to take control of my own life. But which path should I take?

I like books, RPGs, DnD, Heavy Metal and on the edge to becoming alcoholic with acceptable to good grades to boot. Great starting conditions, amirite?

I'll get my degree, for better or worse. If I graduate with good grades or extremely crappy ones, I'll be content to know I'm not entirely useless. 

Anyway, that's the gist of it.

Which sort of job would you recommend me or what subject should I study?

355,"I started an apprenticeship as a software developer at the age of 17 back in August 2018. Its been half a year now and I feel absolutely miserable. The company I work for could not be any better, but I just dont enjoy my job. However, I have been riding myself down this path the last year.

It started when I decided that I wanted to drop out of school because it made me very depressed. Back then I was under the impression Software developing would be my dream job and I was very happy that I was able to find a spot pretty much immediately. My parents were very supportive of the whole thing.

I havent really enjoyed the job at all, not even the first few months, but I didnt have the heart to tell my parents how bad I'm feeling. So they are under the impression that I enjoy my job. But now it has become as bad as during my time in school and I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts more and more. I just want to quit my job.

The problem was, until recently, I had no idea what the hell I was supposed to do otherwise. Software developing was THE job I thought I would enjoy. I didnt have the necessary degree to go study at a university, and after dropping out of school and my job other companies might not want me.

Today I made an in my opinion decent plan. I was thinking about delivering food. There's a pretty popular company here that you can work for to deliver food. I wont even need a car for it. I already enjoy riding my bike in my free time, so combining that with my job wouldnt be an issue. Apart from that, I would earn the same amount of money I do now, even if I would work 100 hours less a month. So I would have more freetime + even more flexible hours, since I can choose my working hours. Overall, it sounds really appealing to me, and I would have more time to think about my future while still earning a solid amount of money.

I  was recommended by a school counselor to apply for an internship that  was not in my field of practice. She assured me that the position would  be a good fit for me and would open doors. I applied out of respect but I  had no intention of taking the job if it was offered to me. I spoke to  the manager and she loved me at the interview to the point where she  said she’d hire me right there and then. I was/am young , stupid and  inexperienced with the job process so I was startled. I didn’t say yes  but I didn’t say no. In my head I figured there’s no written contract  and I didn’t say anything but she did introduce me to the receptionist  on the way out. I spoke to my counselor, told her it wasn’t a good fit  for me but she flipped out on me and said I would get suspended from the  program if I decided not to take that job. I was close to tears and she  told me if I don’t get an internship, I’d get held back anyways so she  gave me 2 options:

a.) to get held back if I choose to fight for this and risk getting kicked out of the program

b.)  to accept this subpar internship that had nothing to do with my program like she promised it would have

I  choose b.) and I shouldn’t have. My former manager knew that it wasn’t  the job I wanted even though she thought I’d be fit for it. She found  out that I even refused the job from the counselor yet she didn’t say  anything to me because she needed someone to do the work. I still tried  my best in that internship and everyone begged me to stay and even asked  the manager if she could get me hired there on contract even for the  rest of the year. She said “No, I can’t afford to hire her”…. I found  out she hired another student from another campus. And 3 months after I  left, another student came in and she hired her as well.

Now  it’s been half a year since I’ve been applying for jobs but I can’t get  anything because the internship that was suppose to help me get into my  field didn’t happen.

I love working with kids but I've run through every possibility and without a degree you just can't make a living. And because I'm a big, fat, bald, guy with a beard Pre-K is also out. (I've never been more embarrassed and ashamed than when the hiring lady made an almost disgusted face at me) My problem is I have only ever worked in schools and I just can't seem to make anyone believe that that's of any use. I feel like I'm applying to places with no resume. Every application I send is accompanied by a cover letter explaining how my skills can transfer to the given position but still nothing. This is my last resort. It's been 18 months of Postmates bike deliveries and 10 hour a week at after school programs. I can't afford to live a life and I can only eat butter pasta and rotisserie chicken. I'm so desperate for full time work. If anyone has advice Id really appreciate it.


Also to be clear the jobs I'm applying for are mostly clerical or office jobs.

365,"Hi, thanks for reading! Last September I started at a University at the other side of my country to study the English Language. This had been my dream for multiple years. I never anticipated I'd get homesick, but I did. I had to move back home to my parents and quit university. I hadn't really noticed before but my whole life caved in. That became clear after a strange couple of days with my boyfriend in which we talked a lot about our diffferent ideas about the future. I wanted to get married right now but he didn't, because we're not even together for a year and he has had some pretty painful experiences with his ex girlfriend who pushed him to get married. I never wanted to act like her but I still did. Now I need to build up a life for myself so I don't try to get all of my feeling of security for the future out of him. Can anyone give me some advice?

We are really open about our past relationships to each other,she came out of a long term relationship 3 months ago and she still talks to the guy but he isn't into her anymore,i came out of a long term relationship too 1 month ago but I'm over it. Now how do i get to that point ? Should i just ask or what? I have been joking about needing a fwb she normally laughs and cracks a joke or two herself too but she never talked about wanting it too.

368,"*okay this is a long story so i really could explain the whole thing.*

&amp;#x200B;

*so* I had my 3rd quarter exam (currently first year rn) and lets just call the subject **Sub1** . Once we had the exams, we had a weekend to cool down and we check back on it the monday of next week. Monday and we check/Correct Sub1 exam. (yes, we check our own exams, but we exchange with others for the sake of cheating and stuff.). We have graded it and gave it to my teacher (Lets call it Anon) for Anon to recheck. Most of my teachers dont record it when they recheck, you'll get it later.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, it was grading time, Anon gave back the exam paper to us and what we have to do is say our score to anon for anon to put the grade on the list. When he called my name, i didnt have any idea of what my score was. *i dont have a paper? where tf is my exam?* I told Anon i had no idea where my exam was or i had no recalls of it being given back to me. My teacher questioned me but i really had no idea. My seatmate, Julian, told me that my exam was torn apart and was thrown away. *She saw it being on the floor, torn.* But then she told me that 19 was written on the paper. She wasnt sure if it was the **exams whole score** or just a fraction of it. So i told my teacher 19. **But heres the thing. Im the smartest student in class (or the whole first year grade) and i get over 30 on my exams. 19???? my score???** Anon told me that i must not do that again. Anon told the class to make sure to protect their papers in case of my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Julian narrated to me how the paper got torn. I sat on the front row just until recently of that day. Since there was no teacher when the exams were given out, most of my classmates played a messy game, *at the front part of the room.* It was a windy day as well. Julian told me the paper mustve flown from my desk to the floor, then the game started and many people stepped on it and torn it. So that was the story.

&amp;#x200B;

**Grade Giving Day.**

It was time for us to recieve my grade. Dad was the one to get it, i was left at my classroom. We got home and told me,

&amp;#x200B;

why in the world is your grade in Sub1 91?

&amp;#x200B;

my 2nd quarter grade in Sub1 was    95, now 91.

&amp;#x200B;

IT WAS DEFINITELY THE EXAM. OMYFFINGGOD.

So me and my dad had a talk on why.  explained to him what happened, then he told me he was going to talk to my teacher.

My dad is more of like a ""I need to speak to your manager"" kind of person.I was always so annoyed at him for doing so, but it is just him proving his point and teaching whats right, or the other way around.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was the day he spoke to anon. And we got home, we had another talk. 

He told me he recorded it when it was given back to Anon. It might be true but yup. 

Maybe 19 was just my real score. maybe im a f\*\*\* up?

nut anyways, anon told my dad more.

Anon told my dad a thing.

So in Sub1 we would make some projects. Anon told him I did projects with the leading topics mostly being ""Immature"" and ""Not fitting to my kind of person"". Anon also said i made too many jokes that were much immature. If you think hes destroying my personality, i admit, yes i am that kind of person. What he said was true. So i forced myself to admit to my dad that i am that type of person in school, because i habited always telling the truth. I then said that my grade on the paper (19) was just a fraction of the whole grade, my dad still teams with anon.

&amp;#x200B;

For you, what was the real thing happened and what should happen? Should i defend or just deal with it?

&amp;#x200B;

My stand: SInce i believe i really excelled in the subject, 19 is a fraction of the whole exam score. It wasn't the exam score.

&amp;#x200B;

Anon: 19 is my real grade. He recorded it and that is what it really is. He recorded it before it was torn

&amp;#x200B;

for me, i think... i dont have a stand at all. i want this saga to end but it'd just be too dramatic. I would need some advice.

thanks!

369,"I’ve been with his mother for 4 years now. We’ve been in smaller apartments most the time we’ve been togeather. She has a 8 year old son that she didn’t have custody of when we got togeather. The kids dad is trailer trash and it has rubbed of on the kid. Fast forward 3 years into the relationship and I buy a nice 4 bedroom house. We just had a daughter, my first child. All of a sudden my wife wants to have her son move in with us. At first it was alright. I tried really hard to get this kid in a good schedule with structure. That failed bad. Kid gets to do whatever he wants at his dads house and it bleeds right into when he’s at my house. The kid constantly makes huge messes then refuses to clean. Doesn’t stop talking ever. Constantly doesn’t listen to me. The kid even glares at me and gets pissed when I ask him to do things. He wants to go back to living with his dad so he can do whatever he wants and watch tv all day and I’m 100% okay with this. My wife on the other hand who also can’t handle him doesn’t want anything to do with it. I’ve tried everything to like him but I just can’t. Not the way he acts. I’m starting to feelreal resentment for him and feel like he’s ruining my sense of peace in this beautiful house I just bought. I never feel comfortable when he’s around me and definitely can’t relax until he goes to bed. I work hard everyday and really can’t stand coming home to this every single day.

So I’m looking for advice on potential ways to reach an audience that appears un-reachable.",06Feb2019,1
374,"I have a beautiful grey and white cat called Mrs Bottomsley. She’s just having a little snooze as I waste another day lying in bed. There’s another one somewhere. I think she’s outside on some very important cat business. They’re my little babies. They were my mum’s cats but she died unexpectedly last year so now I’m their human.

After years of stress and struggle, my career in London had finally taken off and my future was looking secure but when my world came crashing down around me I had no choice but to move back to my mum’s house. I have no other family and with no savings I felt I had to quit my job and move here in order to look after the cats, arrange the funeral, handle all the legal stuff, sort through a lifetime’s worth of possessions and when probate is finally granted, decide what I’m going to do with this ramshackle house in the middle of nowhere, miles from the nearest town.

Despite years of depression and nervous breakdowns, the NHS has never provided any real help and simply point me towards charities who “might” be able to provide talking therapy. Spoiler alert: They won’t. Or don’t. One of the two. I’m on a high dose of both betablockers and Sertraline which provide some relief but I guess I really need to vent and despite not normally being so narcissistic, I thought I’d shout into the void that is the internet. 

I was a bit of child prodigy and the pride of my school. Which made me a target for bullies. I was also tall, nerdy, fat, baby-faced and with an under-developed penis. Which gave the bullies more than enough ammunition to damage me for life. I’ve never been able to form male friendships and I’ve never been able to maintain relationships with girlfriends.

A few years after university I lost the weight and slowly aged into my face. At 6 foot 3 inches and with a pretty-boy face I was suddenly attractive, apparently. I still had my trust and confidence issues (still do) and it took a while before I met my first girlfriend, At the age of 26 I finally lost my virginity and felt what it felt like to be in love. But in the 2 years we were together she cheated on me constantly, got pregnant with another man’s child… and left me in order to marry him. She told me a few times that I was far too small to satisfy her sexually despite the other skills I was attempting to acquire. My second girlfriend was a few years ago in London, she dumped me after we’d been together a year because I was struggling to find work, which fuelled my depression, which fuelled my inability to find work. I’ve not met anyone since and have never heard from either of my exes since the relationships ended.

The house has structural issues and is slowly falling apart. I’ve just spent my last bit of money on fixing the toilet and some other pipes/plumbing work. Apparently the roof is in a very bad state but I can only worry about that if and when something happens. I’ve not made a start on sorting through mum’s stuff yet and because she left no will, probate is taking a while so I’m in legal limbo for a while anyway. I’m going to apply for benefits but last time I tried that was about 7 years ago after a complete mental breakdown. I scored zero points on my assessment and was put on jobseekers, which was such a horrific experience I simply stopped claiming after a short while because the harassment and negativity was just too much.

Despite the flow of unconsciousness that is this essay, my career in London is/was as a copywriter. I was starting to earn good money, my portfolio was growing and I was starting to make a name for myself. 

Anyway. In the here and now, I’ve started writing a book so I’ve at least got something to do, something to think about and something to give me hope for the future. I’m barely making any progress though and I’ve started writing many a book in the past and have never completed a single one.

Right now I just feel utterly trapped and alone. I apologise for all of this and I wouldn’t be at all surprised if absolutely nobody has gotten this far. I feel like I need advice but there's probably nothing anyone can tell me that isn't common sense. I just needed to vent. I just needed free therapy. I miss my mum and I need a hug. I’ve got my two little babies though and as long as they’re ok, I’m ok. And the three of us have got years of cuddles, treats and string-chasing for years to come.",06Feb2019,1
375,"So I think the reason this happens to me is because when I was a baby I guess I always gave my parents a hard time and would never fall asleep and just cry instead. To get me to go to sleep they would drive me around in the car until I fell asleep. Unfortunately I think they did it so much that it's stuck with me so that every time I drive for more than a half hour I start to get tired.

This has gotten so bad that I've almost completely fallen asleep behind the wheel or have dozed off for a second or two. Luckily I haven't been in an accident, but I'm afraid it'll happen soon and I obviously don't want to get hurt or hurt other drivers. I do a variety of things to try to keep myself awake: slap myself in the face, slap my thighs, pinch myself, yell and scream, roll down the windows in the winter, etc but nothing ever works.

This has become even more concerning because I just started a new job in the city and my morning drive is about an hour and a half.

I've also learned that coffee doesn't do anything for me (it's like it doesn't affect me at all). I also take Prozac and I know it can cause drowsiness but I had this problem before I started taking medication.

I don't know what else to do. ",06Feb2019,1

377,"-Before you read please note that I’m not a native speaker which will explain my rusty grammar.-

Last year March 25th I encountered love at first sight. From the day we laid eyes on each other we never parted. I lived with my father at the time and financially supported both of us. My father is rather toxic and abusive so I left him, rather ran away and lived with George - The man I fell for - it’s been ups and downs scenery wise and with his family over taking a lot. They didn’t give me any chances to show them who I was and they tried coming between us. When George was completely devoted to us he fought against them to keep our love. Being who I was I constantly tried to make it better and told him to contact them and make it right despite what they said about me being a witch and him being caught into my web. Because he never fell in love so they didn’t know who he was anymore.
Things slowly got worse. He’s like any man, quite closed up on feelings but at the start of our love he was very open and honest without me having to ask constantly if he was okay or what he thought.
At the start of our love he was in pain due to my lack of dependency towards him. I wasn’t clingy or needy and that made him feel like he loved me more than I him. When we left my dad I had overwhelming guilt and shame because george and my friends kept telling me how my father was a abusive hypocrite. But family is family. So I kept my guilt inside ashamed that I still cared about my dad and loved him despite all his wrong doing. The fact I felt ashamed of my feelings and felt like I had to hide it  made me very depressed and George slowly saw how he wasn’t able to make me happy. I wasn’t the happy confident woman anymore. I felt depressed and nothing could really change it. Though I loved George very much. We grew comfortable with each other to the point where we didn’t bother expressing aloud how we felt anymore. The silence grew longer and gave place to restless minds. Doubts and fear slowly crept in with the dissatisfaction of the life we currently led. We grew so comfortable we started being lazy, stopped working out and trying to seduce each other. The romance was fading and we just ended up being emotionally dependent on each other, hoping that every next step we took will make everything alright again. But we stopped making any effort and compromise ended up being a drag due to lack of efforts in the first place. We ended up moving to Spain with his mother and brother. Everything fucked up one night. His mother threw a tantrum and everything was against me. George was fed up of things not working out so he closed up completely and decided to stay in the room and feel sorry for himself while I was trying to defend myself. I felt like the noose was already around my neck and I was trying to defend myself when it was already too late. Seeing how George gave up and started to side with them the only solution was me leaving. They threw me out of the house, eventually I couldn’t go anywhere since I had no money so they had to bring me back in and waited 2 days until my flight off. He gave up and let me go. I felt betrayed and let down. It was miscommunication, but he decided to give up and feel sorry for himself instead of being selfless.i had no choice, I took the plane. We were supposed to be on a break but who am I kidding? We broke up. Again since he closed up again, miscommunication. When I was on the other side of the world I was absolutely broken, going back to my dad wasn’t an option to me. I had to start over. And George didn’t bother being there for me the first week I arrived completely broken because he was so focused on his own pain. 
The night everything went down in Spain the pain was so overwhelming I cut my wrist, terribly deep. But I wrapped it up. On the plane my baggage’s scraped it and I ended up losing a lot of blood. I didn’t bother caring to notice. So when I woke up in the other country I was in a hospital bed. Alone, no messages and no one to call. I didn’t tell George that of course. Throughout the first week I tried to put myself together I told george how horrid I felt. I was being ho poets and he was tired of hearing how much in pain I was. So he told me to snap out of it and stop feeling so sorry for myself. Then I decided lying to him and telling him I was alright and he was angry nonetheless. It drove me insane. His absence and how confusing he was. Saying he’s done then turning around saying he’s not giving up. I wanted to kill myself and him finding out made him angry. After the day we talked -or rather fought- over phone about it he started being more attentive. But by the next day I switched. From suicidal to fuck all. I decided to work for a party hostel which I did for a month. Partied constantly and had sex with other men and women. After a while I saw how it was impossible for me to get over george no matter what I did. Hell, I almost fell in love with someone else. But I wanted George. So we texted and started to make up again. Before I left Spain he told me that it was okay if I had sex with others, but we all know what “okay” means. He asked me to be honest and pulled out of me the truth. So I decided at first to tell him I slept with a man. He was angry and hurt but accepted it. To my surprise for Christmas he bought me a ticket back to Spain. I had 5 days to wait until I was back with him. When I arrived he pulled the truth out of me and I ended up having to tell him that I slept with 4 other men and had a threesome with a woman. He can’t bring himself to forgive me and he’s angry. He says he loves me to death but I’m not so sure. He didn’t sleep with anyone on the other hand, so he expected me to be the same. I felt guilty, I took in his anger and let him blow off the steam. But he started taking my guilt and submission for granted and plays around with my feelings out of anger. Two weeks later he took a plane ticket and left me with mother in -pardon my French- shit. Now I know everything I did wrong and I’m pass everything. Thriving to be better and be who I was at the start of all of this. He wants space but it doesn’t make him feel any better. He’s closing up and tells me boldly how he will never change for me. That everything has to be his way and nothing else. That he’s going to work for god knows how many months over there and that expects me to wait and be loyal. No need to tell me being loyal but he does all of that and checks on my social media and messages nonetheless. He tells me openly that he’s trying to hook up with other women and have sex with them so we’d feel even. 
- if you’re still reading I want to thank you because this is one long ass post-
I told him how I understood everything he’s going through and how angry he is but that I had to move on even if he didn’t. If he truly loved me that he had to forgive me. That I know what I did wrong but it’s not going to be the death of me and that I’m not going to be taken for granted because of what I did in the past.
His last message was “You know what, I think I’m done. You simply don't deserve me. As soon as I get paid I will send you cash for a flight to wherever or whoever you want.”
I messaged him back and he has been online everyday but he doesn’t even bother to read it. He’s ignoring me and his mother.
I changed my passwords ages ago as well. 
And honestly I have no idea what to do anymore. 
I’d love some advices and outside opinions on what to do and what’s happening. 
Also to consider I’m 20 and he’s 22.

380,"I got this job as a referral- I was working at a different office location as a temp, and was told to apply and was highly recommended by my coworkers. My boss had the manager email me the description, and said if I had any questions just ask. So i did, immediately following up. Nothing back. Not a “I saw this, I’m busy but I’ll get back when I can”, nothing. Until my boss talks to her. 


Ok well, after getting the offer I was signed up for orientation but then emailed a week before I started that my first day schedule had changed, to go do my documentation stuff and wait for further instructions via email from my manager. Nothing. Ever. I emailed as I was sitting filling out documents and finally finally she told me what to do next. Cool, aggravating and I’m sensing a pattern. 


We meet for thirty mins and then she leaves for a meeting and says we’ll connect up later that day. Nope. Don’t see her at all the next day. Was informed that in our office of now TWO PEOPLE, my only other coworker is leaving seven days from now for a week long vacation and I will be here alone to do all the work (which is an overwhelming amount even for her, a six year employee). The temp I was told was working with us had since quit. I found all this out not through my manager, who has yet to tell me anything about what I ought to be doing, but my apologetic coworker. 


And then I had IT problems, emailed her to “make her aware” of my issues, and called IT to get them resolved. She opened separate tickets and IT got confused since some was fixed. She emails me saying it’s fixed now, then emails back IT, WHICH I CAN SEE, and says oh well she must just have been looking at it incorrectly. Thanks.

* Has also taken up smoking which just hurts him even more financially and health wise
* He keeps getting rejected from jobs and takes it personally even though it's obviously not his fault

The downside is there is a lot of late hours to achieve this.

He doesn't respond to texts, he won't go out or come over, it has been a little less than a week now. He came out on Sunday which was amazing but he was obviously struggling to speak. I miss him terribly and I know that's selfish so I'm trying not to add that to his suffering but maybe he needs to know how grey the world is when he's not in it. 

I don't know. What do I do?",06Feb2019,1

389,"My grades are decent (mid 70%), money is not an issue, and my family is hugely supportive of me. I’m currenty at school for computer science. (First year, 2nd term, Ontario)

I have fallen apart mentally and can’t see anything but black ahead. I have had suicidal thoughts for the last month or more, but I know I am not going to do anything stupid. I generally hate being here (at school) but this is a product of my environment.

I have hobbies, I love powerlifting and reading and playing the guitar, all of those I am very good at. The thing is, I find no joy in them anymore. Everything I once loved is no longer any joy.

I don’t want to drop out and be the kid who failed. University was where I hoped my life would get better, as I was bullied from gr6–10. Uni was where I was supposed to shine. I was always know as the extremely smart kid who was kicked around. Now I’m about to withdraw from all my courses.

I recently cut off all my ‘friends’ as I realized they were toxic, and that I don’t need it in my life. I have self medicated smoking weed 10x a day and being always stoned. I binge drink on weekends.

Since the start of the new term I stopped doing any drugs or drinking, and dropped acid to get new perspective. It worked, and things have changed, but the overwhelming thing is: my brain wants me to leave. But if I leave, what’s for me at home? I have a wonderful family and all that, but what about my future? I want to continue university, but I’m calling my parents crying every single day and suffering heavily. 

I’m about 90% sure I suffer from dysthymia, which makes the stress hit me all the more, and brings on gigantic bouts of depression. Dysthymia explains why all my life school has been a source of depression, as every time I get stressed, I don’t even notice the stress as I just feel depressed. 

My parents want me to continue as well, but my mental state is terrible. They don’t want me to drop out, but I have had mental breakdowns everyday nearly for the last month and a half. They just want me to be healthy.

I like what I’m studying, and as terrible as it is to say, my family is fairly rich and I’m not worried about money for a while.

I guess what I’m trying to say is, I don’t know what to do. I’ve applied to transfer to a school closer to home but that will take a while to work itself out. My home is hugely welcoming, and I will get the help I need there, as my university is total dogshit and i was already trying to GTFO there anyways.

I want to continue, but there is no way I can do this currently, atleast I don’t think there is. I have no idea what to do. ",06Feb2019,1
390,"So, to start off I’m not a drunk but I definitely think I have unhealthy relationship with beer. I started working night shift about a year ago, and falling asleep was a major issue. I found that if I had a beer or two before bed, it helped me fall asleep in the middle of the day. It’s been a year and I’m still finding beer the best way to nod off. I also usually drink on the weekends. So I would say on average I drink 6-10 beers a day (usually Coors or PBR, I don’t wanna get hammered.) I don’t usually get drunk, I’m never out of line, and I maintain a good job and pay all my bills. I make sure my family is taken care of, and am able to let my wife be a stay at home mom and full time student. We’ve discussed my drinking and my wife isn’t concerned in the least bit about it however I know the long term of this at very least will have an impact on my health. Every time I think about stopping drinking though, I get antsy and buy more beer. It’s very confusing because I always thought alcohol addiction had an ugly face to it, but if you consider my situation addiction it’s pretty boring.

392,"Hey guys, i'm 28yo male married for 4 years to a 27yo female (we know each other for 15 years, together 7) and I've this thing that is bothering me the last 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

First things first, my wife always wanted to go to medical school and I always supported her. She studied like 4 years to get in and july 2018 she actually did it, she managed to enter med colege. Well... that's where everything started to fall apart for me.  


Suddenly she stop helping me with house chores but that's ok 'cause she was leaving home 5am and ariving at 19pm, med school is hard... But then she was always on her cellphone talking to this dude and giggling and stuff, it's like I had a daughter and she was dating someone...

&amp;#x200B;

One month later at this particular night I couldnt resist, I took her phone while she was taking a shower and I saw that they were sending heart emojis to each other and doing that ""good bye dance"": Oh, take care sweety &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 good night... This broke my heart soooo much 'cause we'r christians, actually she was christian since she born and after we got married she converted me and because of that I tought that this kind of thing would never happen in a relationship like ours.

&amp;#x200B;

What bothers me more is that we've ALWAYS been BEST BEST BEST friends way before we got together, and suddenly we were not anymore. It felt like a stab in the back of our friendship and a stab in the back of our marriage.  


I couldnt handle this anymore and I talked to her, she said that he was just a friend and I was overreacting. After that they stoped a little, no more giggling, no more hearts and good nights, but they still talk to each other, and everytime they talk and I see they texting the wound opens up again. I don't know what to do, I love her so much and she says that she loves me a lot too, but I'm starting to think that I would not be able to heal.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, last weekend I had to take a flight to another state to take an oportunity on my dream job, and the airport is next to the beach and near to our beach apartment. So, on our way there we were making plains of staying for a few days after I got back. When I came back, as soon as I arrived she said: Hey, what time we'r going home? I'm tired of being here... (I'm restless for years, nonstop, and I couldnt stay on the beach for a single day. This makes me wonder if she considers what I feel and what I'm feeling for all this months.)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a good man, young, good lover, faithfull to god, I cook, I clean, I fix, I provide and I'm tired, so tired. I feel like i'm losing the love of my live and I think if something don't change soon she'll lose me.

&amp;#x200B;

She said that if I met him the jealousy would go away, but every oportunity that comes we don't go or the guy wont. She stays 90% of the time talking to her friend and everytime she has a chance. It's not like I can ask her to stop talking to him 'cause they take classes together, they'll interect at some point.  


Well, there's a lot more things to tell but I tried to make it short. What should I do to save my marriage?",06Feb2019,1
393,"So here's my situation. I've lived in my cars for 2 years. I have been going to school full time the entire time. I was working until last August but after stopping drinking cold turkey, I went through DTs and ended up quitting. I haven't worked since. I had two vehicles my car, which was totalled yesterday by me and my van. My van is about to die soon. It has a blown head gasket and intake gasket that I can't afford to fix. It's already on borrowed time. I move it as little as possible. I was using my car to get to school, do laundry, take showers, and recently look for jobs. 

Neither of my vehicles have been registered or insured because I couldn't afford to pay it or get the things fixed so it would pass inspection. I have 2 expired reg and no insurance tickets I'm fighting in court which takes up a portion of my time. I have to get a full time job and probably a part time job so that I van pay to get a place and a new car. I have a little money from taxes and financial aid but I absolutely need a job to sustain renting a place. Part time will not work. 

I'm completely overwhelmed especially after the accident yesterday. I know my priorities need to be work and finding a place. So I'm seriously contemplating dropping out of school. I have until the 11th to get a 70% refund on tuition. The only thing about dropping out is I will have to pay back some of the financial aid I received this semester, my loan payments will have to start immediately without the 6 month grace period, and I probably won't be able to go back unless I pay the financial aid I owe and stay on top of my loan payments. I don't see too many other options for me right now. I have to set the right priorities or I may end up on the street for real. At that point it will be even harder to get back on my feet. I need to make a decision soon or possibly risk that scenario. I know this is probably the right choice to make but was looking for another perspective on this. Thanks in advance.

TLDR: Live in my van. Don't have a job. Need a job asap. Overwhelmed with school and legal issues. Thinking of dropping out so I can focus on getting a place, making money, and fighting these tickets. ",06Feb2019,1

396,"For the past 6 weeks I’ve been obsessively stalking (a strong word, but being honest with myself that’s how this feel) someone I was involved with. Going between Instagram, WhatsApp and a location based dating app. 

At first it felt like normal break up behaviour, I knew it was preventing me from moving. Eventually, 
through the dating app I saw they had met someone, who they had met, how long they were there etc, and obviously this had a massive negative impact on me. It’s addictive behaviour, and I have a feeling of genuine fear when I decide to block them and not look them up, the not knowing is better than knowing but I can’t seem to make this stick in my mind. 

The obvious answer is “just stop looking” but I can’t seem to do it. Anyone been through something similar? How did you get out of the habit? ",06Feb2019,1
397,"I'm a guy and she's a girl, both late 20s. 


I made a friend at work after a few years of being friendless. I met her last nearly a year ago and we really got on from the start. We have a lot in common, we have similar personalities... Weve spent 8 hours a day together, every day, every week, every month, for nearly a year so it's easy to feel like you are friends, but I've really felt like we are. I've told her personal stuff, 90% of the time we're laughing...

 After 6 months of being work friends, I got upset that we'd never meet up outside of work or anything. I confronted her and told her how I feel and how I thought I was just a work friend and if that's what I am, I'd rather just be colleagues because I was starting to feel hurt. She's very sociable, she's the kind of person that we'll have a group of really cool friends no matter where are goes, everyone likes her, etc. I don't want to be second best just because I don't have any other friends, that's why I confronted her. 

She said she's just terrible at keeping up which is why she hardly meets with all of her friends, why she's terrible at texting at the weekend, etc. She apologised and told me she'd be a better friend by inviting me to places, being more in touch, etc.

I understood, and got really happy about it. But it's been a week and whilst I understand she's got stuff going on at the minute, she keeps being shit at making me feel more than a co-worker. And that's the key, if I text her she'll open it the next day and reply there and then or in another 24h. I actually had a shitty day this week and wanted to talk to her about it, and she offered which might seem good, but then I texted her to say 'its ok it's all good now' and she didn't even open it for a day or so. So that got me thinking, what if that text had said I was having the shittiest time? What I struggling with in my life is something really private and she doesn't seem to even appreciate that to go out of her way and check her phone. But she's got no issue texting other people on Facebook. That's one of the reasons why I've felt she's bullshitting me. 

So on the one hand, I've got this person that I really, really get on with, who is nice, affectionate, kind, etc. As a person, she's lovely and sweet. But on the other hand, I've had to nudged her to be a better friend, she keeps saying she's bad at texting but she's got no problem texting other people in front of me, she won't tell me anything personal like I've told her nor appreciate that I've told her something so private.

I'm still trying to figure out if I'm actually her friend and she's just a bit shit about it and never had to worry it because she's naturally popular or whether she's bullshitting me. What I need advice on is on whether confront her again or just keep as I am doing at the minute. I'm just not talking to her unless she talks to me, but I'm being nice when she does. This is weird because we're never not laughing and joking around. But at the same time I was being a bit short with her the weeks/days leading up to the day I confronted her PLUS the fact I confronted her PLUS the fact that I'm struggling with something personal makes me feel like she's gonna see me as drama or too much shit going down in over a month. This is the third week that I've gone quiet on her and the second time this week. And it's all because it annoys me that she can't be arsed checking if I sent her a text to say I'm ok for days when she's on her phone texting people this very second. 

I don't know if it's because I'm a guy and she's a girl (both late 20s) or if it's because I've done something wrong by opening up and showing weakness, or if it's because she's just crap at being friends, or whether it's because she doesn't want her bf to worry (she admitted he wondered what was going on when I confronted her because apparently she talks a lot about me). I've got a gf myself so I'm not trying to pursue anything and I know she knows this. I don't know if I'm being drama or doing great for putting myself first. Am I in the wrong here for demanding stuff from her? And above all, do it tell her or do I carrying on keeping myself to myself whilst nice? And what do I do if she asks if everything's ok when it really doesn't feel like it is?

TL;Dr I made a friend a work, we got really close, but I don't know if she's just terrible at being friends or bullshitting me. And I've already confronted her so I don't know whether to do it again or just keep my distance and let her put the effort in. 

Edit: the last few times when I've gone mad at her it's really affected her to the point that she'd not speak to anyone else, she's cried, and then even admitted that tried a dozen times to text me or come talk to me but was really upset she'd hurt me. It takes her no time to be like 'have I done something wrong? Are you mad at me?' This makes me believe she truly cares. But again, there's everything else. ",06Feb2019,1

Coupled with all of this, any time I email the manager asking for help/them to review the work I have so far I get excuses saying they receive hundreds of emails a day and as such are “too overwhelmed” to even sit me down and explain what exactly I need to do and how to do it moving forward. Any other email I send gets me a half assed response in which they answer the bare minimum and ignore the vital questions I ask.

I had the idea recently to sell just the stone and have it replaced with a moissanite or something similar when I had the setting resized.

I feel a tremendous amount of guilt over the thought of selling it, but even more guilt at the thought of not selling it to provide for my children.

(long story short, I was accused of something terrible, but no evidence was ever brought up or verified and I was forced to relocate to another school). But because of my lack in GCSE's no other school was willing to accept me and so I had to head to College.

410,"I live in a nice, modern apartment building that has a very minimal style to it. Each floor has 3 apartments and the elevator, that’s it. This week a new set of tenants have moved into one of the apartments (I haven’t met them) and seems to have figured it’s okay to leave their shoes outside the door, in our clean, mess-less foyer/hallway (whatever it’s called). This really bugs me, for a number of reasons - 1. I really like a clean and tidy area, whether it’s inside my apartment or outside the door. I’m someone that gets stressed with clutter 2. Their door faces our door, which means the first thing I see when opening my door is now their shoes 3. The foyer/hallway is small, and there are no windows, so the shoes are definitely changing the air quality of the area (if you get my drift) 4. It’s just kind of inconsiderate of them

It’s not like we live in a crummy block of units where people leave all kinds of things outside the door. We pay good money for rent and I think that with that comes some level of expectation.

2. ""Well, for instance you could &lt;activity that requires money&gt; or &lt;activity that requires friends&gt;""
3. no answer, they just start scolding me about it

Option 2 is annoying because every single activity they suggest always involves either money or friends. I'm 15 and I have no way of getting money; everyone my age seems to somehow magically excrete money for a lot of expensive activities and I have no way to get money. I don't get weekly or monthly money, since my parents think it is stupid to give their children money.

Some people have a system to get money from their parents if they do a job of some kind, but whenever I ask I always get scolded for ""greed"" because I ask for a job.

Well, if I mention the lack of money everyone says to do some free thing with friends. They seem to forget that I seem to somehow be the most unlikable person in the whole damn country, since even with a room full of people with the same interests as me (computers, programming, cooking) I can't even talk to people without being called a loser.

In my school, they held a programming club. I was the only one in a 500-student school who came, and obviously the club was canceled. The cooking club was full of girls (the stereotypic teenager kind, airpods and all) that won't allow me to join because I'm a loser.

Whenever I ask what makes me a loser no-one ever answers.

Our PE teacher dropped my number by three grades because I didn't take part in any of the ball sports and other sports that need teams, because even if I was forcibly assigned to a team everyone would just ignore me.

I've tried to assess the situation and see what makes me so unlikable, but even asking a therapist there is literally nothing wrong with me. I am not fat, don't wear glasses, have decent hair, wear reasonably good-looking clothes, and don't stutter. But the moment I say ANYTHING, even if it's just a ""Hello!"" everyone immediately pushes me away because I'm not ""one of them"".

It would seem that I'm eternally doomed to never have friends, which also makes outside activities practically impossible. The only alone free outside activity is walking, which gets boring after a while.

Anyone got any advice? I asked about this on a couple of other forums for ""people like me"" but one of them didn't get an answer before the forum shut down and the rest were removed without leaving a reason.

(I know this subreddit will probably immediately also remove this post because of the apparently telepathically transmitted reason no-one likes me.)",06Feb2019,1

420,"im starting to get irritated with my only 2 friends. I have known them both for 14+ years which is unfortunate. 

Lets call the first one Steve: Steve and i met 16 years ago, our families are close. Lately i have became irritated with him for a couple of reasons. 

1. He spends all his time with his girlfriend (Jackie, his first one after high school) . Which is cool, i understand being with your significant other, but this man. They live together yet I'll ask him him he wants to play a game (we typically game since we are both in college and do not have time to actually hang out in person. Who am i kidding, we enjoy gaming) It feels like majority of the time he will hang out with Jackie unless  she is busy with school or work. 

2. He hardly will ever play a game if its just the 2 of us (there about 4 others we play games). We both got Sea of theives about 2 weeks ago, he was really enjoying in then like 3 days later just stopped playing because we couldnt do stuff in it (because we were trash. I have gotten a lot better now). There another game called ""Franchise Hockey Manager 5"" (its 75% off). I got it and showed him it and how cool it is but he refuses to get it because our other friend (Jack)  that we want to play games (aside from ps4 games) with wont get it as Jack stated ""Its a shittier version of the NHL franchise... Jack has never once looked at the Franchise Hockey Manager franchise. He only knows what i told him about it before i got it.

3. We play another game called League of Legends, Steve and another mutual friend (Joe) bitch at me for picking a champion i want to play (even though he is bad) and tell getting mad at the other 2 teammates for doing stupid shit. Joe and Steve blame me for their stupidity. 


Now on to Jack: 

Jack likes to actually go out (hes also in college) he has college friends where as i go to a commuter school and decided the people in my classes are school friends (hang with them at school only).... Jack and I use to play fortnite with Steve, but Steve got bored of it (due to needing to build and hated the RNG of battle royal). We also play the NHL franchise games a bit. I have tried to get Jack to come play PC games with Steve and I, like Franchise Hockey Manager but he refuses to because ""it sounds like a shit version of NHL""

I'm at the point where i just want to say fuck it im done. I have tried to include them. However as humans crave social interaction and they are really my only friends dropping them would be worse IMO


Other things they do that annoy me: 

Steve- never watches shit live makes it impossible to talk to him about sports or anything

Steve- Finds shit funny that is not funny (example https://youtu.be/bT_UQqIIgjs)

Steve and Jack- both challenge me on tons of shit (ie me using br (BR) as a short for Battle Royal. I watch streamers i play Battle Royal games the most. but yes question it with zero knowledge) 

Steve and Jack: both terrible with ETA and response timing. I try to make plans. such as ""Steve when you think you will be on a game today""... ""in an hour"" (on 2 hours later not on) decides to tell me his plans changed. Like fuck, i wasted 2 hours thinking i had plans with Steve and now its too late to make other plans.

Steve and Jack: Both form opinions on this (such as Franchise Hockey Manager 5). For this game, I told Jack about based on what i thought it would be, but there is a large part of it I didnt know until i got it. However his mind is made up. Steve on the other hand wont get it cause Jack wont play it with us.

TLDR: my only 2 friends are starting to annoy me to the point where i want to say fuck it were done. but if i do then i have zero friends and humans crave social interaction. I hate making new friends ",06Feb2019,1
421,"Over the past few years I have estranged myself from part of my family for various reasons (including my own childhood abuse/neglect). It was hard but necessary for my mental health. For whatever reason, two separate relatives from this branch of the family decided to send my toddler a birthday present this year. The cynical side of me thinks they sent the gifts to elicit some sort of response from us, but I suppose it is possible that they had good intentions. Before the gifts were opened, I had decided to mail each a polite thank-you note written on behalf of my child. 

However, when the gifts were opened, they were both duplicates of items we already had. I think one was likely by accident (think a very popular children’s book that basically everyone owns), but I’m pretty sure the other resulted from a misguided snooping attempt to figure out my toddler’s interests. I’m fairly certain that this relative spoke to another relative I do have contact with, because the gift was one of 3 very specific things my toddler had requested (and already received from us!) for Christmas. Neither relative included a gift receipt and my toddler was visibly disappointed to open these “gifts” we already own. Seeing my child’s disappointment stirred up my negative feelings toward these people. I want to be snarky and tell them thanks for the gifts, but we are donating them to a local organization because we already owned them (which is what we do intend to do with them). However, I don’t think that is the right way to handle this situation. Should I just send them each a polite thank-you card as originally planned? Or just say nothing and hope they get the hint that we continue to be  uninterested in any sort of relationship with them?",06Feb2019,1

I have always found things such as the military, CIA, etc. very interesting and something I would like to do. I have always felt like I should do something more with my life to give back to the world. I am a rather smart individual and go to a top 10 university. Because it is a private school, it is not cheap by any means. I have considered joining ROTC or looking into working for the CIA, but neither people in the military or working for the CIA make very much money. For this reason I think my parents may be disappointed in choosing to do one of these things, as they would see the investment in my education as a waste.

I have been actively applying to other jobs, just to keep my options open. An opportunity came up to work for a great company, and it would be a full-time position with benefits, salary, the whole 9 yards.

426,"I’m not sure whether to post this here or on legaladvice. For now, we are trying to brainstorm what to do prior to taking legal action, so I figured I’d post here. 

Background: I am part of a few “close-knit” buying and selling groups on Facebook. I purchased an item from this buyer last July (using all precautions) with no issue. In December, we reached an agreement over another item, I sent her the money (no precautions since I wrongly trusted her), and she never sent the item nor responded to my messages. I found 6 other people who were scammed by this same seller in the same timeframe.

She is still buying and selling in the groups and have contacted the admins regarding kicking her out of the group. However, this won’t help us get our money back. Due to the nature of the transaction (we “consented” to paying her), neither Facebook nor PayPal will help us. I told Facebook the situation, and they said that since it was an authorized transaction, they can’t do anything. But then they flagged my payment account for unauthorized use. PayPal took similar action. I don’t plan on using Facebook Payments again, so I don’t mind, but this confused me. 

We have looked into small claims court, but it won’t work since we are all in different states/countries. We’ve also looked into a Letter of Demand, but I know advice for that doesn’t belong in this subreddit. I was thinking to contact her employer, but I’m not sure how to go about this. Also, she seems to be the one in charge of answering inquiries and calls, so I don’t know how much help that would be. I’ve spent 2 months gathering information on her, as well as messaging her on Facebook, but I haven’t approached her on any other avenues, in case there’s a more effective way to do so. The other buyers who were scammed have spread the word to other social media sites, though. I was wondering what else we could do to help get our money back? I do not want to and will not do anything that will get me in trouble/is illegal. 

This is the information I have regarding the scammer, all found freely online or through our interactions:
- Name
- Home address
- Home phone number 
- Employer (company, address, email, phone number, employees)
- College (she’s graduated, I think)
- Email (for PayPal)
- Facebook profile
- Instagram profile
- Pinterest profile
- Old Twitter accounts
- YouTube account
- Publisher (she’s a self-published author)",06Feb2019,1
427,"Hi there! thanks for reading. I will try to make this succinct. Here is the events that lead me here. 

June - got laid off

July - sold all my stuff, got rid of my apartment, dropped the cat off at my parents and went on a road trip around the country. 

November - Accept a job in downtown LA making good money. Start to save up and apartment hunt. Until then, staying at my parents. 

We are now here in February. I really do not like my job. I am hesitant to move because of how much I dislike it.  I recently had my resume, LinkedIn and cover letter completely redone. I am almost done building a personal and professional website. I feel strongly about my job hunt, however, the whole living at my parent's thing is looming over me. Living here is great! I am just a single man that wants his own space and life back. 

So what the heck do I do? I need to be out of here but I am hesitant to move close to my office and then get a job a month later on the other side of town, which, in LA terms, can be over an hour in traffic.  

So I ask you reddit, what should I do? Thank you in advance. ",06Feb2019,1
429,"Usually I have a big self confidence in everything except when it comes to ask out someone for a date and tell that I like her. This was always a problem to me. I can talk to girls about anything, I have a lot of friends who are girls and have a good relationship with all of them. Yeah I know it's not the same but still. When somebody asks why I don't have a girlfriend I tell them that I don't want and don't need for a one because there are too much problems with a relationship and I don't want to deal with them. But that's not true of course, I badly want a girlfriend. I really want those problems. I'm not a sentimental man, I usually don't talk about my feelings and problems to anyone. I'm the funny guy in the group and I use sarcasm very often,sometimes I use it to tell what I really think. I thought that I could use it to ask out someone but they wouldn't take it seriously. Of course when it comes to serious things I get serious too and my friends know this. I   
 just started to open up more to my friends and tell them about my problems.

In primary school and the beginning of high school I had a crush on a girl for three years and she friendzoned me (she wished a guy just like me) for the whole time,then she moved in another school, we stopped talking and it took me 2-3 month to get over her completely and stop thinking about her. I never asked her out directly because  I didn't want to lose her friendship at least (Yeah, I'm lame). I gave her some signs but she never reacted to it. I really loved her, I never cared about her flaws, I just wanted to be with her but I didn't have the courage to tell her what I really feel for her and what she is meaning to me. 

So 3 years later I'm in college now and a couple a weeks ago I saw her with her recent boyfriend, she smiled at me, but I pretended I didn't notice her ( childish, I know). But when I got home the my old feelings just burst out and I couldn't stop thinking about her again. I made some awesome friends in college and I have a very good friendship with a girl (we are just friends really), and we talked it out, she told it too her roommate the situation(who is a good friend of mine too but we didn't opened up that much to each other yet) who wasn't there because she was out of college. In the next day we went a night out and I was still depressed but this girl's roommate made me forgot my old crush for that night (and didn't think about my old crush ever since then). I didn't tell her or anyone else that she made this impact to me. I started to fall in love with her. I liked her so far too but I never thinked about her in this way.  She didn't send me any signals, I'm good judge of human nature so I would have noticed it. Now i'ts changed, I want to ask her out, but I still don't have the courage to do it.

And I don't know why because I was in a relationship for a summer. I met her in a house party,we started to talk, and we hooked up. Things just happened by themselves. We liked each other, but we didn't want it to get serious, we discussed that we will be together for the summer only (she lives the other half of the country,she was there only for summer). We were really happy for that time and we both had a good summer together.

 I didn't felt for her this deep love that I felt for my crush in high school and that I started to feel for this girl in college now. Maybe this  seriousness is what prevent me to do it, but I don't understand because that's exactly what I want,a serious relationship . I don't want to fuck this up too. Why is this little step seems so big to me?",06Feb2019,1
430,"I apologize ahead of time as this is long but anyone who takes the time to read I would appreciate! It feels like everyone in my age group is marrying off or in serious long term relationships. I’m a female and 22. The past 3 months alone I’ve had 3 close friends and about 10-12 girls from high school (all 21-22) get engaged/married. I didn’t expect this until my later 20’s. Now I am absolutely in no rush to get married, and honestly marriage isn’t really even a priority for me to have a happy life, however I’ve started to realize how resentful I feel. So here’s a backstory, I’ve been with my current boyfriend (M, 21) 1 and 1/2 years and my boyfriend (M,23)  before that for 3 years on and off. I love my current boyfriend but I still miss my ex. I adore my current bf and he’s great but I’ve never felt as in love/passionate about someone as I did with my ex. Due to my own immaturity at the time/lack of experience and his own personal issues we didn’t work out. He’s dating someone new now and the last time we spoke, a few months ago, he told me we would be in each other’s lives again and when I said I wish we would have met once we were a bit older he said he understood that. Since then his gf told him she wasn’t comfortable with me being in his life at all and we haven’t spoken  (although I’ve tried), except when he somehow accidentally called me in the middle of the night about a month after that conversation (I saw the missed call notification the next morning).  Now I know I need to move forward and let myself be happy in the present which I’ve been doing, but I still think of my ex almost everyday, even if it’s just in little passing thoughts and still hope one day we can start over completely. How does this tie in to everyone around me getting married? Well I know it’s ridiculous but I can’t help but see all these girls I know in long term relationships marrying off in seemingly perfect relationships. I feel like such a child and so ungrateful feeling this way. Logically I know I only see the “perfect” parts of their relationships they choose to share. I also know my bf is amazing but I just don’t know if I see myself marrying him one day. I feel like I’m in this weird Situation with my feelings for my ex and my bf, while it feels like all these other girls just found “the one” (whatever that means) and everyone else is pairing off. I’m scared in 5 years or 10 years when I’m 26-30 it’ll be even worse. I don’t want to be bitter or settle in the future out of fear of being alone. I don’t want to keep wondering if my ex will ever speak to me again because I know I’m the grand scheme of doesn’t matter. Again I apologize for how long/confusing this might be, or if this wasn’t the place to post this, but anyone whose felt similarly or have any advice please let me know.

431,"I did driving lessons a few years ago but stopped because I was so scared and my driving instructor was rubbish. He said I was obviously very nervous and my knuckles were white on the steering wheel. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I want to move across the country so I need to drive to open up job opportunities and so I can visit people from home. I've been searching for instructors and reading reviews and finally found one who sounds good. The first two lessons she made me feel really relaxed. I thought I was doing ok. Although she did say that the older you are the harder it is to drive. I'm 28, and she says how quickly the 17 year olds she teaches pick it up.

&amp;#x200B;

My last lesson I kept asking her questions about what I was doing and why. She pulled the car over and told me I was overthinking it. She said just do as she does and it will become muscle memory. I felt a bit like she was getting frustrated with me, hoping I would have picked it up sooner or something?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I had my fourth lesson today and I just feel like I'm getting worse. My 2nd lesson I knew the gears well but this time when she asked me to change gears I kept getting it wrong. At the same time I have to put the clutch down, do this, do that, and it's super overwhelming. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every lesson we've just gone to the same quiet spot and driven. It's taking me so long just to learn how to steer and go in a straight bloody line, going at a pensioner's pace. I felt really deflated at the end of the lesson and just like she is getting bored of teaching me. I said to her I feel like I'm making no progress and she said by the time I'm actually getting into it, the lesson is over, so maybe I'd be better off with two hour lessons. I asked if she thought it would take a while for me to learn and I can't remember her answer but I doubt it was good!

&amp;#x200B;

At the end she made me drive down a busier road and she said after that that she thought she just had to make me do it. This implied to me that I wasn't making as much progress as she hoped. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like crying! I feel she's getting bored of teaching me. Lessons are so expensive, if I have to start doing 2 hour lessons that's going to be £60 a week. I don't know if I can afford that. And she takes 10 minutes driving to a quiet place for us to practice. Today she had to make a phone call to her son's school before we started driving, to tell them he was ill and not coming it. It only took 10 seconds but it did annoy me a bit. Honestly feel like giving up now.",06Feb2019,1
432,"So this is something that's been swirling in my head for a couple months.
A few months ago, my bf and I were going through some hard stuff and he decided to reach out to his ex (the girl before me) and just get some friendly advice and see a new face.
But he lied to me about it. He hid that he was hanging out with her sati g he was with his guy friends and acted like she was a friend he went to college with and said there's nothing to worry about.
I knew this wasn't the case and I eventually confronted him about it and he told me it was his ex and didn't want to tell me bc he afraid I was going to over act and get mad and jealous.
I went through hsi text messages and found out that he was saying some pretty weird shit to her, like ""not to be weird but last fourth of July was better) he was dating her then.
We eventually got over it and moved into an apartment together but I woke up one day and just knew something wasn't right.
I went through his texts again and found that he's been talking with her. He hasn't told me this.
I'm turning over a new leaf and have decided that I don't want to go through his shit anymore bc it isn't healthy. But now I'm conflicted with the thought of if I should ask him if he wants to be friends with her.
I personally wouldn't hang out with her if he did bc I don't like the way it makes me feel. But I can tell he cares about her and I'm sure he wants to.
I trust that nothing will happen, but I'm scared of how it'll make me feel bc of the past.

433,"Alright so a little while back I posted about an individual that caused a car crash nearly killing my two best friends and drama between that individual and myself just went down hill etc. 

Well, that was two months ago. My best friend is still with the girl who caused the crash and I personally feel it’s a toxic relationship but that’s just me. Anyway, so for the last two months after my best friend “cheated” on this girl who he was casually sleeping with, things took a drastic turn. She completely stopped talking to me saying she needed space. Which I was fine with because I’m not a piece of shit. That was two months ago. For the last month and a half at work she’s been completely avoidant of me, rude(not verbally) but ya know silently rude. I work with this girl FYI. Well I contemplated quitting my job because of her. She’s created a toxic environment for me to be in. Her best friend lashed out on me a little while ago at work and I don’t need anyone else to attach to this childish agenda. 

So I texted her this yesterday:

Hey I’m not really sure what’s going on between us but it seems to be effecting work and I would like to fix it. There’s been an obvious disconnect between us, I want to amend that to a professional level so it doesn’t further any problems at work. Since you won’t talk to me or even acknowledge my existence. I have tried to show respect to you even after the whole events with hunter and I feel we haven’t moved passed those events. You didn’t even tell me what you wanted to order for lunch the other day. So instead you told Sean what you wanted to have. I’ve avoided going to management about it since it shouldn’t be their problem but I will if I have to. We can’t fix problems if you do not talk to me. I’m not looking to rebuild a friendship I’m trying to establish a common ground of professionalism. 

She then replied with this:

Hey bud I’m sorry you felt like you needed to text me about this. I know there has been some tension but it doesn’t have anything to do with Hunter in my view. I’m just stubborn so if I’m upset with someone I usually won’t go to them until I’m totally over it. If you really aren’t interested in friendship at this point, that’s fine and I wish it were different. We were really close at one point and I’d like to reestablish that, I was just very sure you weren’t interested, so I didn’t try, and I’m also still pretty upset about a few things that occurred. But, if it’s about professionalism then we can work that out and just kind of establish a mutual agreement to be cool instead of awkward because I’ve felt it too and I agree, it is uncomfortable. But if like me, you’d like to have a relationship again, I’d really love that. I miss hanging out and being normal and friends. Also, hunter and I only ever hang out with my friends and I know it would mean a lot to him if we were able to be cool. I know of a few things that happened that really kind of shook me regarding our friendship and hurt my feelings big that we can talk about in person if you’re at all interested. Though I’m ok talking to you, I didn’t want to bother you the other day because I was self conscious about the whole thing and I realized after that how awkward it seemed that I asked Sean, right in front of you. I’m sorry I made you feel like you couldn’t come to me or I couldn’t come to you, that’s really awkward and immature. Just let me know the deal and I’ll roll with it. But after this, we can be totally Gucci at work for the sake of being at work and I really, really appreciate you texting me. I just wasn’t ready, so thank you.

But now every time I come back home to my moms(I split my time between my moms house and my boyfriends place for the sake of college) I realize how mentally exhausted I am. My boyfriend is also sharing an apartment with his brother and they're both extroverted. They always want my attention versus when I'm at my moms, she knows that if I want to talk I'll come to her. Otherwise she leaves me to my devices. The worst part is that because of this, I haven't been creative. I'm an artist and having the solace of my quiet place keeps my production/creativity up. 

And yes, I've talked with my boyfriend about it but we just can't seem to make anything work. So any sort of advice or suggestions are very much appreciated.   ",06Feb2019,1
437,"Hi all,

I commute to work by train and the station I commute from is fairly quiet so I do not normally see many people around. However for the past 2 weeks a group of 3 men have been hanging around the station and harassing me. The first time it happened I was just sat waiting for the train and these men came up to me. They started saying how attractive I was, and asking questions like how old I was and was I single. At first I tried to ignore them and thankfully my train arrived a few minutes later. I left feeling uncomfortable but assuming that was the end of it. But unfortunately since then they have been hanging around the train station a lot and have been asking me these sorts of questions nearly everyday. When I told them to leave me alone they just laughed and said they like a woman who is feisty. They have been bothering me now for a few weeks and yesterday was the last straw. I was sat at the station and when they came over I got up to move. One of the men then roughly grabbed my arm, using enough force to prevent me from moving. When I told him to let go of me he said he could do what he wanted and his friends were just laughing and encouraging him. Thankfully I managed to push him off and the train came. I was left feeling very shaken after this. I am only 21 and these men are probably in their early 40s, something which intimidates me even more. 

Does anyone have any idea of how to stop this from happening again? Is there anyone I can contact? Thank you ",06Feb2019,1
439,"I was promoted a few months ago.  My new position is much more demanding and I’m pretty good at it.  When I took the job, I agreed to do it for the same money I was already making.  It was nice to have the title and I was glad to build my resume.  I got “congratulations” but not more money and I was fine with that at first.

But it’s a LOT more work and a LOT more responsibility.  I’m in charge of people and have to keep clients happy and I didn’t expect this much stress.  I spend half my day putting out fires.  I think I deserve a substantial raise.  I’ve found out the person who had this job before me made twice what I make (but he had the job for 20 years).

Should I wait it out for a promotion, or demand an immediate raise?  I’m working 60+ hours a week week for 45k.  The guy I replaced was making 6 figures.  I think I got the job because I agreed to do it on the cheap, but I deserve more money.  I’ve got 15 people under me, I’m in charge of million dollar accounts, and millions in inventory.  Plus all the little fires I have to put out.  My boss and I get along well.  I don’t want to ruin that and I don’t want to lose my job.  I just feel like I’m working for pennies on the dollar.

For a few months they dated ,now at first he was supposedly not staying at our house but simply there a lot (which was later confirmed to be a lie he was living there against  my mothers wishes)

they broke up in august of 2018 after he gave her an ultimatum of moving to Alaska with him (he was going to be stationed there for naval training and not assignment so she would be require to find herself a new job and a place to live) or they break up ,after about a month of heart ache she got over this and moved on or so I thought ,she dated other men and even laughed when she knew her ex had to experience extreme frigid temp but also earthquakes (yeah she's kinda petty)

 but after he came to our house last night she decided to sneak him in and let him spend the night ... she is currently seeing another guy ,her ex has friends and family in the area he could stay with in fact that was one of the things that hurt their relationship before because he would go out with his friends for days on end without a word 

I don't know what to do I know that tonight there will be a fight between her and my mother and I know he will probably be her again

441,"So here is what happened: when i started uni, i met this girl i like during introduction week that was organized by the uni. we are in the same program. I flirted with her, but i think she took it as normal conversation. After introduction week, I sometimes see her in class and say hi whenever i see her, but apart from that, we dont talk. Yesterday, i went to a party (again organized by uni), got drunk at the bar and she was there too. We talked a bit, but again basic stuff(i was trying to talk more to her) She s also drunk and we start dancing when she starts grinding herself on me with the song; i go with it until she asks me if we want to sit down. i do and she sits on my lap, we look at each other for a few moments and somehow we started kissing with the tongue; that goes on for 15 minutes all while she on top of me, when she says to go have a drink at the bar, after that we continue dancing while she grinding on me while i m behind her, i dont initiate anything else since i was too scared, i simply hold her and she holds my hands close to her chest(i dunnow if she wanted more than just kiss or grind), after continuing we go out smoke with some friends(also cuz the inital place is closed); genuis me simply says this was fun, we should do this more often, she agrees

my friends and i take an uber home since it was very late and her friend (who came over for a few days ) and her take an uber home too( we live in opposite directions). i havent spoken to her since and dunnow if i should ask her about that party and about what her feelings are towards me or if it was just the alcohol

sidenote: she could have done the same thing( grinding and kissing) with other guys since there were a lot that were interested, she did dance with some of her male classmates but not as much as with me; she was with her friend that also started kissing with some random dude( which the friend did before me and her did)

442,"Today i have a party with some of my co-workers who are still in their 20s age.  

They talked about changing job in the new year to get better salary and will jump to other position in other company just because of higher pay.  

Our current company don't have much benefits, lower pay than current market price but it is a good starting ground for new comers who don't have any experiences.  The work is also easy, little and not that hard compared to other companies.  

So in the end, higher pay = higher focus = more work to do.  

I and my co-workers also joined the company 1 year ago so that they want to jump jobs to get better salary.  

Me, who just got back from the business trip, is still thinking of staying longer.  

First reason is because i have a commitment to keep, it is not worth it to break it.  My co-workers are saying that the commitment is not worth it.  They prefer non-commitment so that they can jump jobs around.  

The second reason is i want to spend more free time to study and improve myself better so that i can get a job abroad.  

The third reason is i have one big debt to pay off.  

I work in IT industry and i heard people said the lifespan of an employee in this industry is very short. If you don't get a high pay or supervisor positions like project managers, directors then it is no hope and you should change jobs.  ",06Feb2019,1
443,"I rent an apartment with a uniquely designed kitchen where there counter is up against a wall-to-wall window that opens in the middle, with two panels that slide open to create a semi-open-air kitchen. 

The gas range backs right up to the glass, and the two rear burners sit only few inches away from the fixed outer panel when window is closed, and even closer to the inner sliding panel when the window is open. 

The kitchen doesn't have a hood, so opening the window open is the only way to manage exhaust. 

I was using the larger burner on high the other night with the window open and the inner panel glass cracked from the heat.

Obviously the apartment was poorly designed as either the gas range shouldn't back right up to glass, or the glass needs to be a tempered glass that can withstand high heat. 

I didn't immediately think about this risk when I originally rented the place so I guess I've agreed to this, but now it is clear that the kitchen design is not really fully functional, and the glass limits the use of the gas range in its full capacity. Not only this but it is also a safety hazard as the apartment is on the 4th floor and should the glass fully shatter and blow out.. it wouldn't be good.

So in your wise opinions, should I just suck it up and pay for the repair (and pay for the right kind of glass to correct their design mistake and allow me to cook how I want) or do you think I have some grounds to ask the owner to fix it and correct the glass so that it can withstand the heat from cooking and allow me to use the kitchen to its full capacity?

447,"Hi! Thanks in advance for reading this post.  I'll try to make it as short as possible so here goes:  
I teach English in Japan and have done so for about 6 years.  The entire time I've had one student stick with me regardless of me leaving my former school and starting my own company.  This woman is, however, very old; I'm guessing about 80+ yo.  Gradually I've watched her decline.  She can't drive her own car anymore and often forgets Japanese, let alone English.  But she is incredibly prideful and won't admit to any of her difficulties.  In the case of the taxi, I have offered to drive her home, but she refuses and pays \~$14 for a taxi one-way.  
Her English skills have deteriorated a great deal and I can tell she used to study in her own time but no longer does.  Her level is now at what I would consider a first-grade level.  She can answer questions like ""Do you have a hat?"" or ""How many hats do you have?"" But struggles with answering questions like ""What color are your hats?""  
There is a woman in America she has never met but is the mother of a former teacher she had.  This woman emails her ALL THE TIME! and my student comes to me for help writing responses.  At first, it started with a Christmas card here and a birthday card there, and then a mailed letter every few months but recently she had been emailing her.  

The American woman does not understand my students level at all and writes very difficult sentences like ""At our old age viruses can be devastating.  Our age is against us.""  Each time, I have her read the email and I write it in a notebook (because my student REFUSES to write in English) and I don't have a printer handy in the middle of the lesson and I never know when she is going to get a new email.  Then I highlight all the mispronounced words, go back over them for pronunciation and have her check the meaning in her dictionary.  Then I read her the email and paraphrase using the easiest words I know and ask, ""Do you want to respond to that?"" and write what she says, in my email (because she is so slow writing on her American keyboard on a Japanese phone) while I fix the grammar and then send it to her.  She must copy my email and paste the text into the response email.  Her responses are almost indecipherable without A LOT of correction.  
Because some of the phrases are difficult to express in Japanese i.e. ""our age is against us"", she will look up individual words like ""against"" and disagree with me on meaning, in that specific case telling me her dictionary says ""against"" means ""opposite"" and sometimes refusing my simpler explanation.  She and I are often both frustrated by these emails.  
Because the American woman switched from letters to email, she responds immediately after getting a response and then we spend about 4 class periods writing her back.  But the level is too difficult for my student to actually make any progress and I have instead realized she is getting worse, whether due to age or lack of practice at her level or a mix of the two I can't discern.  I don't think the American woman has any idea any of this is happening.

I am going on a 3 month maternity leave in May and I will have a replacement that doesn't speak any Japanese and will be unable to help her because he won't be able to navigate her (Japanese) phone, let alone understand her answers. Also, I don't want to continue writing this woman letters anymore because it feels to me like a big waste of time. (My student, for the record, does not even remember the name of the woman we are writing, which makes this feel especially ridiculous.)   
I feel like I have a few options 1) flat out refuse to help my student write letters anymore which I am sure will greatly upset her and make her more obstinate 2) Email the American woman and explain the situation and ask that she either write shorter, simpler emails or limit her responses to one every month behind my student's back or 3) tell the American I can't help anymore 4) something else?  
I'm open to suggestions and I need help before I lose my mind.

Thanks again for any advice.",06Feb2019,1

449,"So I've only been at this job like 6 months. I work in Administration so I end up talking to almost everyone in every department at some point. That's how I met this one guy at my job.

So first off he is so fucking cute. I noticed him the first day I started, which I feel is interesting bc while he is handsome and cute, hes not like baseball-player or movie-star type hot. Hes also almost exactly 10 years older than me. Anyway, I digress....

He is mostly attracted to women his own age it seems, but we do get along pretty well. We have a lot in common and I feel like he flirts back. But he is very introverted so idk if hes smiling bc hes nervous/ socializing or if its bc he likes me back! I'm in my late 20s and feel like all the good ones are taken. Hes in his late 30s and says nobody swipes right on him or ever takes an interest in him. I think he is quite the catch though! But I do really like this job and don't want to jeopardize it especially if it doesn't even work out.

I kinda wanted to ask him to hang out as friends, but we work in completely different departments so i feel it is awkward for me to ask him to hang out. Although most times we only really talk bc we chat each other up/ find reasons to talk to each other, I still can't confidently say that it wouldn't be super weird. Plus I feel like its awkward enough already being a younger woman asking out a man who is so much more experienced than me. 

What to do! My love life has been in shambles lately anyway so part of me is like, fuck it, give it a try! Then the other part of me feels like I finally like my job, maybe flirting is just a perk and I should mind my business. Please help!

I have a great life and personally don’t have much at all to complain about, but I feel like I just fade into the background for so many people.  My wife is great but sometimes I feel like my support for her is somewhat taken for granted.  There’s nothing in particular I can point to, but I just feel like she doesn’t necessarily return the same thought and care that I do for her.  If she needs something or has a need, I’m always attentive and try to take care of things for her.  But often if I need something I just don’t feel like a priority.

This isn’t specific to just her, I feel somewhat like this is the case for tons of people in my life.  My friends seem to count on me for a lot and I feel like I deliver a ton of favors, but this courtesy isn’t necessarily returned.  It’s not that I expect it, but it would be nice to be thanked or at least acknowledged every now and then.  Sometimes it feels like everyone expects me to be there for them and it’s not something that has any meaning or bearing to them.

It’s kind of like this at work too, I feel like I get talked over a lot and ignored in group settings or at meetings.  I’ll make a point to speak up or try to get a point across, and someone will just reiterate it five minutes later and everyone will act like it was a new idea that I hadn’t even brought up.  Today, a supervisor who has known me for months called me by the wrong name, as if my existence or who I really am was ultimately irrelevant.

I just feel invisible a lot.  Even in random social situations.  I’ll be out with someone and will see my wife or friends flirted with or get attention, and nothing like this ever happens for me.  In other group situations, it’s just like I’m not even there.

I originally went to school to be a civil eng, I jumped to construction eng, and I somehow landed in commercial real estate development. I like it. I think it's always where I envisioned myself before I knew it even existed. I work for a small company but we do fairly well. My boss is the COO and I work directly under him as a project coordinator. He fired the last girl because she apparently made relentless mistakes. I found out he fired her 9 months after she was hired. 

Now this job is challenging. There's a steep learning curve and every day you are dealing with something new. I feel like I would need years to actually get the hang of this job. Every project is different, every vendor is different, and there's a million moving parts that need to be handled all at once. It's stressful but that doesn't really bother me. We are playing with large amounts of money so I understand not wanting to make million dollar mistakes. 

My boss slightly trained me. There isn't much you can really do to train someone for a job like this, you just need to learn along the way. I've learned my boss has a temper and has gone off on people in the past. That has not happened to me yet. I have made quite a few mistakes so far. Not knowing exact dates, forgetting to print off certain documents, not knowing where files are located. Most of the mistakes have been very minor but my boss will ask me when we expect certain documents to arrive and I will say let me check and pull it up on my computer. He has gotten upset that I don't have the dates memorized. 

Today this email exchange happened (info removed for privacy):

Me: ""(Name) said that she strongly recommends attending event between 12-9 months before date.""

Boss: ""12-9 or 12-19?""

Me: ""12 to 9 months before date""

Boss: ""Okay, I would put numbers smaller, then bigger, when listing a range. So 9-12, in this case. Otherwise it can create confusion like did you have a typo?""

This is how almost every single one of our interactions happen. To me, this feels silly. If someone sent that to me I would know exactly what they were trying to say. I have no problem fixing this in future communications but this is every single day multiple times a day. I send him something that he gave me no direction on and he says it's bad he can't use it. Redo it. So I do and he nitpicks it apart. 

I really wouldn't care all that much about this but his demeanor has changed around me. Now Feb is a stressful time for us in the office but I've noticed that the change seems to be directed at me. I've talked to him previously and he said that he is not worried about me ending up like the last girl they had because she was terrible and I'm nothing like her. But he also told me I would know when he has given up and everything he described is ticking boxes in my head. Every time I talk to him now he is short and will cut me off. He does not want me to explain my mistakes and doesn't have much time to walk me through anything. 

I don't want to lose my job because I think this position will really take me far. I am normally very malleable to new environments but I am now suddenly dreading being around him when at first I thought he was the best boss I could ask for. Rose colored glasses, I know. But I also worry that maybe this will have a negative impact on me in the long term. I have a coworker who is my only friend in the office tell me that I will have veins of ice soon enough and it will be fine. Is this healthy? Am I just not cut out for this? Am I just being overly sensitive? Thanks everyone!  ",06Feb2019,1

471,"Feeling so down lately I don't feel like I deserve good things. Basic human maintenance is hard to do, and I've lost interest in everything. When I see something funny on t.v and laugh, I feel guilty because I don't deserve joy. When I decide to read one of my favorite authors, I stop because I'm not worth the time she spent writing those wonderful words. Food is a necessity, but I'm not worth feeding. All I am is sad, and can't find a way out.

This thing that happened months ago-- I know it's not my fault, but they believe otherwise and have decided to collectively shut me out. Calls, emails, and letters, all ignored. I thought I belonged there, and at the very least would be afforded the benefit of doubt for months of otherwise exemplary service. They were my entire world. Leaving was like cutting off a piece of myself that I treasured, yet it was so easy for them to just throw me away. All that time spent giving that place everything I had, and not a single person thought or presented argument on my behalf. I've never felt so worthless in my entire life.

473,I work at a school that is specifically for kids with leaning disabilities and we are also a testing center. I've been working here for two years now as a secretary and I can be very forgetful (which isn't great in my field of work). My boss called me into her office last week and she very gently told me that she thinks I have a lot of symptoms for ADD. I have good intentions and i want to be a hard worker but I have trouble staying focused and I can get distracted very easily. I can be disorganized no matter how hard I try to stay on task and I lose things all the time. I try my best to be the best at my job but its so frustrating to not be able to be what I need to be. Before you say I'm lazy or careless I can tell you I'm definitely not. I really want to get this all sorted out. She wants to help me get tested but the only problem is that I have no health insurance (I'm 19) and I was disowned when I was 17. Technically I'm under my parents until I turn 26 but they are private pay and don't believe in insurance at all. I really need help if anyone could give me some advice for getting health insurance at my age and some affordable companies to go through that would be amazing. Thank you!,06Feb2019,1

After a few months the MIL got back with the husband, once they were back together he told her about sneaking onto our property and watching the her without anyone knowing. A trusted source has now came to the MIL with the full story, the husband was on drugs, had a gun the night they came to my home and planned on killing her then himself, but at the last minute he changed his mind. The MIL is leaving again to stay at a place the husband is unaware of and doesn't plan on going back.

This morning he sent me this text and now I am very worried that he is in mental trouble.  This isn’t something that just happened, it’s been progressively getting worse over the years.  I don’t know how to help him and I am researching as much as I can.  He’s coming over tomorrow morning to spend a day or more here.  


“I don’t know who to turn to anymore. I’m not asking anything because I don’t think there’s anything to ask. It feels like my affliction constrains and abuses me at every turn. Idk if it’s OCD because it feels more like a curse. I should have applied to SSI a long time ago. I feel imprisoned and reduced to suffering and crippling even when it comes to applying as a dishwasher. It feels like if I could just allow myself to be myself that I would be apart from this but I really don’t know what that is. I’m not sure how to do that. I think if you saw me at a moment when I was in an employed environment you wouldn’t believe it. It seems like no one does. I don’t trust my ability to do the simplest of things. The same rules don’t seem to apply to me because I can’t seem to do the things designated as being things most people should be able to do. I’m fucking debilitated. I have to somehow keep going until this disease is no longer a significant factor in my day to day life. I have to keep going beside the suffering. I can’t stand it. I guess I’m just venting.

The job is easy, like, stupidly easy, and they pay pretty decently just for me to mostly sit around. And therein lies the problem- I know this job isn't fulfilling. It's not going to lead anywhere, and it's certainly not going to help me achieve any of the dreams I set out to do. But I've gotten so complacent coming in and just messing around that I can't find any motivation to get my ass back on the job market and actually get out of here. I can basically sit at my desk and watch Netflix all day and no one will care.  


What makes it all worse is that I keep lying to my friends, family and girlfriend about how I'm really looking but not finding anything. What I'll actually do is get on my computer, look at a few applications but never send anything. And on the rare occasion that I actually force myself to send one, I never hear anything back- and that just makes me feel even more depressed and trapped. It's like I'm on this constant cycle between hating myself for not aspiring to do better and being too lazy and unmotivated to do anything about it and so I've just been procrastinating for over a year now.

481,"I started working my current job in July of 2018. When hired I was told I would be full time. I was given 27 hours instead. It made money tight but i was able to pay my bills, until my student loans came due. I found a second job, but was laid off a month later due to budget cuts. 

My current job uses me when they need me and throws me aside when they no longer need me. I work in two departments. One only has two employees in it. The other lady took vacation one week and rather than inform me or change my schedule ahead of time they told me the day I needed to start covering her shifts. They didn’t change my schedule to reflect the extra 40 hours and instead made me work 67 hours that week with no days off. They knew in advance they would need me, but for some reason didn’t think to change my schedule. My state has almost no worker rights so its perfectly legal for them to do this. All i can do is quit. 

My manager in the other department cut my hours because she said I was a terrible employee. She compared me to the lady who had been working there for 25 years. I couldn’t do as much as she could so therefor I was a bad employee. The issue was, she would come in early and work off the clock to get things done and would clock off and stay late to finish up. I refuse to work off the clock so it always looked like I was doing less. 

In my other department the second lady quit, leaving me as the only employee in that department. I assumed they had worked to replace her as soon as she put in notice. They didn’t start looking until a week after she left. They notified me on Christmas Eve I was getting her hours as well. I worked another 67 hours that week with no days off. I didn’t get to see my family for Christmas at all as I was at work until late on Christmas. 

They told me I was working her schedule until further notice. I asked to be taken out of my other department until they found a replacement. It was killing me physically and mentally. I have a bad knee so working nonstop for so long made it to where I could barely walk. Not to mention shear exhaustion. 

They refused to take me out of the other department the next week due to the holiday. I had to work another 67 hours with no days off while the managers all took three days off that week. I told them if they didn’t give me a normal schedule i was going to quit on the spot. Since I’m the only one in the building trained in this department they caved.

I asked if I could have the full time spot and they told me they would think about it. Instead they hired some girl who legally cannot work where I work (she told me). They had me train her (she was also getting paid more hourly than I was). They sent her for a background check on her final day of training. Surprise surprise she didn’t pass and they let her go. So I just continued filling in. The department got a new manager and he asked if I had put in an application for the spot. I didn’t know I needed to, I was told I didn’t need to by the previous manager. 

I went to give the general manager my application for the spot and she didn’t take it as “we don’t need you to apply as you already work here.” A week later she asked if I wanted the spot. I said yes. She said you need to apply then. I got pretty upset at that point. I got it in the next day. 

She interviewed me for the spot a few days later and used it to inform me of why they most likely weren’t going to give me the spot. They had me trying to do my old job in that department, plus all the new duties. It was impossible to get it all done. They didn’t care though. They said I wasn’t good enough because I couldn’t handle 55 hours of work in 40 hours.

It’s to the point that I can barely crawl out of bed in the morning. I barely eat. I get off work and go right to bed. My marriage is falling apart. I spend every waking moment on the verge of tears. It’s to the point I don’t even want to live anymore. I’m not suicidal though. I just feel like I’m being used and abused by this place and then tossed to the side when they don’t need me anymore. I financially can’t afford to quit though. But I don’t know if I can continue to work here without a complete breakdown.

I eventually experimented with clothes that were outside my comfort zone, but my then best friend would always make these snarky remarks like ""nice pink sweater"" or ""those colors make you look like a country's flag"".

490,"Hello Reddit. This is going to be a long mess please bear with me.

I'm a 20 yo gal and have dealt with mental health issues most of my life. After getting misdiagnosed quite a few times and hitting rock bottom I decided to take my mental health upon my hands and got into therapy. 

From the first few therapy sessions two of the issues that came up and I thought we should work on were depression and agitation. Let's say that at times I feel very down or/and very agitated/ irritated. Not the greatest feeling ever. I talked to my therapist about it (and even told her I used to self harm as a way of coping with that) and she seemed to understand my situation. Given my history with misdiagnosis, she thought it would be better to not give me a proper diagnosis and just follow through with the treatment. 

Now, almost 5 months later, I see little to no improvement on that aspect. Generally, I know that therapy has helped me a lot especially with my anxiety but that's about it. It seems like we haven't addressed that problem much when we really should have. Everytime I get there and I tell her how terrible I feel, we discuss it a bit without reaching any conclusion (or even point) and then off to our next topic we go. The only thing she's told me about that is that ill always have those depressive/agitated periods, I'll just learn to deal with them better, which doesn't give me much clarity (or hope). 

The past few weeks I've been feeling like *shit* and the self harming urges are coming back. Ended up cancelling the last appointment in a very shitty way (I texted and didn't pick up the phone when she called) and won't be able to make another appointment until the next week which gives me plenty of time to decide if I'll be going back or not.

Overall I like her as a therapist and she has helped me a lot. I'm just stuck now and don't know what to do. Do I suck it all up and get my next appointment or do I quit and try to find another solution to my problems? Do you think I'm being irrational? 

If you've made it this far thanks and I love you ❤️",06Feb2019,1
491,"I am the youngest and only female of three, to a single mother who may have not been the best mother but that story is for another day. I'm currently in my senior year of college, about to graduate this summer with a bachelor's degree in fine arts. I haven't lived with my mom since I moved on campus.

My second oldest brother, C, and his girlfriend, L, moved into my mom's apartment in 2014 (taking the empty bedroom that I left behind.) My mom agreed for him to move in with him under the assumption that he would help pay rent and he did, for a time. There has always been tension between C and my mom since both of them are loud and hot-headed. C regularly smoked weed and my mom didn't like that, but he did it anyway (along with L.) L didn't work and instead lived on SSI. C worked different part-time jobs while living with my mom but worked a full-time job at the same busing company my mom worked at. 

Over the years, tension grew in their home with those three constantly arguing about living situations, not paying rent, constantly smoking weed, etc. My mom has repeatedly told him that she wanted him and L to move out. They didn't up until 2 moves later, when my mom moved into a house. 

Now, here's some context. I don't live with my mom, but my mom rented a 3-bedroom house so that I could spend the weekends and holidays at my mom's house and, also, to spend more time with my dog. C and L lived in my mom's living room because they were expected to move out. Tension grew between my brother and I because of my dog; my dog was a puppy at the time, so I would have to walk through the living room to let him outside in the back (and this would happen at early mornings and late nights.) C and L had a cat that liked to roam, so they would put up baby gates to trap the cat. Taking down the baby gates and holding the cat over and over to let my dog outside must have irritated them. Actually, I think me having a big dog in general that my mom took care of while I was away was irritating for them in general. 

C and my mom had constant fights while in that house and I mean screaming fights, where C would insult my mom and my mom would tell him that he needs to leave. There was a night after spending a few days at home where I sat in my room with my dog while C and L were in the living room. I was stressed out by the living situation and, honestly, I cry very easily so I was crying in my room. My mom came to check on me because I wanted to go back to the dorms for the week. She noticed I was crying, asked what was wrong, and then I told her that I feel anxious taking my dog outside because it irritates C and L and I didn't like the attention. I'm assuming C heard me say this because, from the living room, he told me to ""stop being a big baby."" I know that may seem like a childish thing to get upset over, but I was already feeling shitty for being there and for him to throw that at me made me feel like I was back in my child body again. I felt small. I wanted to leave immediately. I walked out and while my mom was driving me home, she was telling me how pissed off she was that he told me that. 

After I was dropped off at home, I got a call a few hours later from my mom that she kicked him out of the house. C and L packed up their things and left. I don't know where and neither did my mom, but she didn't care at the time. She just wanted him gone. She said that when C was leaving, he told her that she's not a mother to him and then left. That night, in 2016, was the last time I've seen my brother.

Since then, he has cut off all communication and ties with anyone in our immediate and distant family. We messaged him to let him know that our grandfather died and he responded that he didn't care and blocked our numbers. We later, through some digging, found out that C and L moved to Colorado Springs, CO. That's the only information I have on my brother, except a recent one.

My mom called me a few weeks back and told me that she found Facebook accounts for C and L. I looked it up and saw, indeed, recent pictures of my brother and his girlfriend--with a child. There were no information on the name, gender, age, etc. on the child because his Facebook account was private and when I submitting a friend request for both him and L, they both blocked me from Facebook.

I've spent time and money trying to look up my brother so that I could find some closure for myself and my family. My mom has been (and still to this day) beating herself up for years about C abandoning our family. I understand that it's his decision to go no-contact with us, but I wish I would understand why he made this drastic decision and stuck with it this far.

I know a possible address he may live at and I was thinking about sending him a letter in the hopes of him responding. However, I want to know something about the baby. A name? A sex? How old are they? I looked up the birth announcements in the Colorado Springs newspaper but found nothing. Is there any other way that I could find birth records for my niece/nephew?

**TL;DR:** My brother and his girlfriend has gone no-contact with our family and I've recently found out that they may have a child together. ",06Feb2019,1
492,"To start, I think it’s important to note that my sleep schedule is definitely different from my other three roommates. I stay up about 5 hours later than all of them (I usually go to bed around 5 or 6 am), and I sleep in much later than them as well. My class schedule this semester allows me to do this for the time being, but this post isn’t about my sleep schedule... So when I’m up late like that I try my best to be as quiet and considerate as possible and I try to minimize how much I need to be out in the common area the later it gets bc unfortunately the walls are very thin at the apartments I live at. One thing I do go out there for in the night is to get ice for my water cup bc I like my water ice cold. I always try to be as quiet about it as possible and I really did think I was doing a good job about it thus far. But this morning I woke up to a text in our group chat from the roommate that sleeps closest to the kitchen reading:
     “this is a general statement but whoever keeps getting ice at 5am (more like 1-5 am) can you please stop. it’s extremely loud and these walls are thin, and i’m a light sleeper so it constantly wakes me up at night. i’m not saying you have to stop getting ice completely but at least try to be quieter about it”
I got pretty damn pissed at this message for several reasons
1. I got woken up by them a lot earlier in the year bc I sleep in late and they would be out there talking/laughing pretty fucking loudly, but I didn’t say shit and I just invested in some ear plugs bc I realize the world doesn’t revolve around me lol
2. I really have been trying to be as quiet as possible so I don’t really know what she expects me to do
3. I pay rent just like the rest of them so I’m not gonna stop getting ice completely- especially considering the hefty amount I’m forking out just to live here
4. I never complain about anything my roommates do bc I realize that’s just part of living with roommates and I’d rather find my own solution than expect them to change.
I just want some opinions on this matter to figure out if I’m right or if I’m being a complete asshole. Thanks!

I would move in with my fiance and my cousins to be able to cover the rent, which is about twice the rent of my current place, but for a single story five bedroom. I feel like it would be a great move for me, but I feel very hopeless at the moment. I started a campaign to help us move but it has stagnated, and honestly I am in need of a lot of help. Even though I am disabled and DO work, people ignore that we both work and say to ""just work harder"" I physically cannot. I'm so hungry all the time and my fiance and I are very tired and finding a new job is so taxing it takes up so much energy and I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I feel like cutting my wrists when he is away and just trying to die and escape this life of pain. I work 40+ a week and it's destroying my body. People don't understand that I'm disabled, but it's getting harder to move. It's so painful to walk and I feel like my heart is going to give out because I just don't eat enough. I applied for food stamps but they said I make too much despite 98% of my money going towards rent and the rest is transportation towards work and maybe a little food and utilities. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so out of control and I feel like I'm going to snap and jump in front of the E train on my way to work. I want to feel happy. I love my boyfriend, but I feel like I'm such a burden. He'd be better off going back to live with his family and leave me to rot.

I just said ""maybe"" and then walked away. Then asked me if my coworker was bisexual. I made it pretty clear to him I wasnt gay because I was talking about porn in front of him with other people, and then I also was talking about a crazy ex girlfriend of mine. So I don't know what the hell this guys issue is. I've never had problems like these before with coworkers so I'm at a loss of what the fuck I'm supposed to do. I really want to just be like ""look man I'm not gay and will never have interests in other men"" but I'm just starting to get creeped out.

After playing a few games on my own for about 30 minutes I called him on Discord. No answer. Then I texted him on Snapchat. It says he read but no reply. I then looked on the left on my screen and saw he was in a game with three other people. I texted one of the people and he gave a long line of voice messages saying ""You can't just leave him like that and expect him to be waiting there"" and ""Just keep playing solos you snakey faggot"". I was sort of confused at first because my friend has left me to play solos once or twice for the last few days. I've never done him to him though until now.

I just responded with ""I just want to talk"" and he said my friend said he will call after his game finishes. I played for about an hour on my own. I was never called. I texted the other guy again. No reply.

503,"Hi everyone. My wife and I are both in our early forties and we have one child.

He was born male and now claims he is trans and that he is our “daughter” instead.

I don’t accept this nonsense by my wife has been supporting him through this.

At 12 years old, my son (“daughter”) has managed to wreck my marriage with my wife.

We never saw this coming when he was born. I didn’t even know what “trans” was back then and neither did she so we literally never discussed it.

Now this flies out of left wing and here we are, my wife and I to the point of estrangement.

Anyhow, my son’s delusions have led to things like he cuts his scrotum once a month and then sticks a pad on it to pretend he is having “his period”.

Personally I think that is the pinnacle of looniness and I’m surprised that he hasn’t gotten a major injection yet...

Now is demanding that my wife and I take him to a gynecologist so that he can discuss his “lady concerns and problems” with a “professional”.

I refuse to do this. I also don’t believe insurance will ever cover this kind of nonsense.

508,"So bear with me because this will probably be a long one. So a few years ago I was in the military and was assigned to go to flight school. This was all I ever wanted as a kid all the way up to college age so I went to college, graduated, and commissioned into the military. While there I failed out of flight school rather quickly due to my inexperience flying and, in my opinion, a poor training program. 

Soon I was reclassified into a different job I did NOT want (Intelligence). I met a beautiful girl that had recently failed the Intelligence course and we talked and seemed to have everything in common from the state where we were from to our college major. She encouraged me to continue and said that Intelligence was ""a good job"" but I wasn't convinced. She even asked me about wanting kids, which I thought was odd, and I said ""yeah, eventually"". Even told her I was moving off base to a new apartment complex AND she followed me there giving the excuse that it was her ""kind of place"". I thought this was way too coincidental to be true. We went out to a bar with mutual coworkers after finding out she was being reclassified out of Intelligence and she was buying shots for everyone and got sort of drunk. I was moping around at the bar and she came up to me and started flirting with me telling me to ""smile like I'm the prettiest girl in the room"" and ""Intel is a good job"" you know, trying to cheer me up. Later on we ended up going to a coworker's place where I ended up getting drunk and passing out on the floor. The next morning I woke up and we were talking and I was sitting on the couch when she just laid her head down on my lap and I was like ""wtf"". She said ""sorry"" but I said ""no, you're fine"" and ended up caressing her while talking. It was comforting and I enjoyed our time together. We ended up leaving soon after.

Maybe I took it too far after that but when hanging out with some of my coworker friends at my apartment complex she comes over where we are with a new guy that just arrived on base. I was clearly agitated by this but didn't confront her about it until later. The fucked up part comes when I looked into her window after she went back to her apartment room with him and see them full on making out. It made me angry, betrayed, and hurt because I thought we had something. It wasnt until a week later I ask her if I can come over at night and just talk and chill. She said ""yes"" so I go over. We chat a bit then I proceed to tell her I didn't like that she was hanging out with the new guy and that I ""loved her"" (total mistake). She said ""no"" in a really disappointed way and said I was ""sweet"" and then ""delusional"". It hurt pretty bad but I totally freaked out and said I thought she was ""leading me on"" then proceeded to go back to my apartment (because we lived at the same complex). She chases me all the way to my room and says ""wait"" before I slam the door then text her I ""was just trying to figure you out"" and ""you use people like toys"". Her friend then texted me the next day to leave her alone because she thought I was being creepy. I said ""ok"" and ""I won a game HAHAHAHAHAH"" Ended up leaving the military altogether because of this under the pretense I was going to commit suicide because of her due to my embarassment to continue in a work environment where everyone in my class heard about what happened. It still bothers me to this day I did that. I truly liked her but intentionally creeped on her obsessively. I have wondered if I am a sociopath because of this...I really hope not because I want a normal relationship with a girl.

tl;dr: I obsessively stalked a girl when she showed some interest and then ended this friendship and career after failing hard. Any constructive advice for me? What could I have done better?

(One bad night after a fight w my boyfriend and turning to a friend that drinks to excess everyday) Breathalyzer, community service, fines, everything which I deserve. I’ve had bouts of depression in the past (never medicated as I couldn’t afford health insurance) that would last a year or two and then go away but come back. I started my own legal videography business Jan of 2018 that was doing well enough to support myself but not enough to support a future family so I enrolled in paralegal school that I’m paying for myself so it’s just money on top of money. Not to mention my insane anxiety attacks that I self medicate with. I can’t get out of bed without a Xanax which I will soon be drug tested for probation from the DWI. And now....the cherry on top is I’m 90% sure I’m pregnant, bedridden nausea, with a boyfriend I was planning on ending things with when we were both financially ok because I care about him but just know he isn’t at the maturity level I need. Taking the test with a friend tomorrow as I just can’t face it right this second. I have never been this out of control in my life while trying to do well.

It is a federal job and I would technically be working for the police department here so I’m sure they have access to stuff. 
Two years ago I moved to Houston Texas after graduating from a 4 year university and worked for a gentleman’s club for a few months Jan-March 2017. It was a very fancy place, NOT A STRIP CLUB, and it even required a “sexually oriented business” class II permit. I had to go to the federal office to pay for and receive it. Even though it wasn’t a strip club, I was still a “dancer”. It’s gonna look the same to a lot of people but it’s very different. I wasn’t good at it because I’m goofy and funny, not provocative and sensual, so I did a lot more talking and drinking than dancing. Hence the reason I only stayed for a few months. 

That being said, I feel like because of the license, they will be able to find that out, so I should probably mention it. I wouldn’t be worried except for the fact that it is a conservative town. It isn’t illegal, and I had every right to try it. Found out it wasn’t for me, but I had fun trying it out. But now I’m worried I won’t get the job.

I am currently enrolled as a bachelors student in psychology and I am miserable. I transferred from a small community college to a big university so I thought I might just be experiencing culture shock but I don't think that's it.

I am over half way done with my current major and I don't know if I should stick it out and go back or if I should just switch. I am mainly just concerned about the amount of time it is going to take and the money that it's going to cost (I am currently going on grants and I really want to avoid taking out loans).

She also doesn't have to share a shift with coworkers and doesn't really do much except take one customer every 15 or 20 minutes (it's a sports betting job), so the job is pretty stress-free and very flexible schedule-wise.

526,"Hello all - coming to Reddit for advice because I don't know a lot of folks IRL who will be able to help me with this one.

J, one of the ladies at my work, has been coming in routinely with bruises, and bite marks. After some prodding from her supervisor, she admitted that her boyfriend is currently physically and sexually abusing her. She's scared of involving the police for fear of retaliation (while she is in this country legally, some of her family members aren't, and her boyfriend has threatened in the past to turn them in). He is trying to force her to move away this weekend, to an area where she has no family, she will have no job, and he will have the only access to a vehicle. He routinely takes her phone away from her, and reads through her messages to check up on her. Obviously, this is all bad news and nobody wants this to happen.

After a lot of talk with J, we came up with a game plan to help her. What was decided all around (after speaking with my husband, who was fully supportive) was that J would move in with my husband and I (husband will be leaving this weekend for a few months of job training, and we have a spare room and bed). On Friday, while her boyfriend is getting everything ready to move, the ladies from work will help J move her items from their shared residence and into my house.

There are a few benefits to her living with me:

1. Her boyfriend doesn't know me, and doesn't know where I live, so the chances of him finding her are very small.
2. If he does find her, I'm right near the police station, so help is very close by.
3. We have a spare bedroom and bathroom, so she's not putting anyone out.
4. Finally, while my husband is gone for training, I won't be all alone in the house and going crazy - it'll be good for me too.

J is committed to this, and so are the rest of us, but ... I don't know the best ways to offer her support, beyond a place to stay. Compounding the problem is the fact that her first language is Spanish, and mine is English, and we only know a bit of each others' languages.

Can anyone help me think of things to do to help her? We've got the room and bed, blankets, etc.,  and I'll have basic hygiene supplies (so she doesn't have to rush and replace anything). One of the ladies from work will be going with J to the phone store to get her number changed on Friday (so boyfriend can't contact her). We've already contacted HR and work security with the guy's name and description, and asked that he not be allowed on grounds (and they're on board with protecting their employee).

What else should we do? How can we make this easy on her so she can focus on healing emotionally and physically from what he's done to her, and moving forward with her life?",06Feb2019,1

I decided the best thing to do with some of this money was to attend a full time coding boot camp.  I already have some eduction in that area.  I located an apartment a little less than an hour from the city and moved.  The apartment was furnished so I had to give away my bed and all my furniture. 

I had a pt job for the first 6 weeks while waiting for the boot camp to start.  Then my mom pulls the rug out from under me and tells me she isn’t giving me the money. There were some large fees she’d have to pay.  I tried to explain to her how important the schooling was.  I asked her to just take the fees out of what she was giving me.  She refused.  

Now I am stuck working 6 days, 45 hours each week in two dead end jobs. The seventh day I spend with my kids.  I don’t really have any skills to get a better job.  I don’t have the experience/portfolio to get a coding job.

I know a need a roommate. I can’t afford to save anything to move out.  I can’t have a room mate where I am. If I look for a better job it would eat up the few hours a week I have to study and strive for the great job.  I’m not even 

I spoke to my mom once briefly around the holidays. Whenever I think about picking up the phone to call her I don’t want to.  I know I have to be an adult and take responsibility for myself, however I made a plan based on $ she promised to me.  My life is f@c$&amp;d now and getting worse each month.  I can’t undo this damage her refusal to follow through has caused.  I have a lot of resentment towards her.

532,"I don’t really get hit on too often, but when I do it is miserable and resurrects all the social anxiety I thought I’d gotten rid of. I was approached at work by a guy who comes in like every day and always makes nice small talk with me, and today he suggested we talk more and asked for my number. It is very clear to me that he is flirting with me, but he’s never said anything blatantly flirty enough for me to mention my boyfriend, so I gave him my number because I was anxious. What do I tell him now? If we chat a bit through text it would definitely feel like reciprocated flirting and it would be almost cruel to do. But I can’t just ignore him because I see him often. I am nauseous just thinking about it. Guys hitting on me are usually kinda douchey about it and therefore easier to shutdown, whereas this guy looked slightly nervous and was really happy when I gave him the time of day and didn’t seem the type to approach women a lot. I feel guilty.

And of course the other question here is how to avoid this type of situation to begin with. I’m afraid of saying “I have a boyfriend” when someone asks for my number and getting a response like “Okay? I’m not hitting on you”, or something. Is that an appropriate thing to say? It always feels like a cocky thing to say, unless they’re straight up asking you out",06Feb2019,1
533,"So, some backstory.

I’m currently 16 years old, an honor roll student, have lots of friends, I’m pretty well known within my highschool and have basically never been granted freedom from my parents.

It all goes back to when I was 14, yes, 14. I was out with one of my friends smoking a joint when a cop car spotted us. Long story short, I was placed under arrest for possession, served a court date and was dropped off home. For over a year, my life was miserable. I was never allowed to leave the house, I was driven to and from school on a daily and basically was restricted of all my freedom. I couldnt even speak to my own parents without getting scolded for what I did.

Fast forward about a year, I havent at all changed my ways and instead of stopping my “drug” use, I just became more sneaky. Started smoking at lunch during school, when my parents werent home and even in the shower when they were. Now, it may seem like I’m to blame for all this, but in my situation, unable to do anything at all, weed helped me pass the time. Eventually, my mom and only my mom caught me and didnt tell my father. I was basically put on house arrest all over again for about a year.

Fast forward, I’m 16 and still havent learned my lesson, I’m still smoking weed, however I was still a excellent student, all honors and above 80 in every class I had. One day I wanted to go out to one of my friends house when all my friends were going there. I originally asked to sleepover via text when I was at school and was met with a “no” followed by no response after. On the walk home, i was a little slow and was about five, yes FIVE minutes late. As I’m walking I get a phone call from my dad, “where are you, why are you taking so long, whats going on” etc...

I get home and my dad goes out with my brother in law and I decided to try my luck once more, so I ask my mom, who was home, if I could go out (not to sleepover) at my friends house. She tells me to ask my dad, so I already know its a no. I decide to try my luck anyways and call my dad. I ask, he says “no” like always, and when I ask why, he says “because I said so”. I’ve struggled with anger management all my life and when he said that I raised my voice, hung up and threw my phone into the wall. Then, I punched a huge hole in my wall the size of a bowling ball, and then another. Turns out, my brother in law heard me over the phone and knew that I was upset and he decided to come over with my dad home.

My brother in law comes to my room before my dad and asks me if I wanted to go over to his house to chill as he knew all I wanted was to just go out of the house. My dad then follows, sees the damage and immediatly kicks me out of the house, swearing that I should not come back.

I stay with my sister and brother in law for two weeks before I was allowed back at my own home, ever since this moment, I’m basically imprisoned in my own home. I havent gone out once since, (maybe 3 months ago, is when this happened) and everytime I manage to get out of the hoise, its by not mentioning early dismissal at school, skipping class, saying I was in the library studying for exams, etc..

My weed usage is just as peak as ever and I completely understand that the majority of this is MY fault, however all I have ever wanted was to be able to come and go as I please. I do everything for my parents, I score high in my classes, clean the house, drive them places, I do everything to no avail and I’m forced to deceive them in order to do what I wish to do.

At this point, I dont know what else to do. I sat down and had a conversation with my parents and they told me that “eventually” when they trust me, they will drive me to and from everywhere I need to go and “supposedly” I will get more freedom from there.

Now, my brother is 24 years old and he still has to tell our parents everything he does when he goes out, so I know them saying I will eventually get some freedom is total bullshit. This is not at all a way to live my life and I shouldnt be held hostage in my own home.

Now, I also understand that there are rules as it is their house and I’m financially dependent on them. But when I wanted to actually get a job, (I was offered a great part time summer job, 15$ an hour), my dad shut me down and threw the idea out of the window.

I have no idea what to do from here and am honestly just thinking about going out and not answering my phone and dealing with the consequences at this point as its getting ridiculous.

535,"First ever post so sorry if this doesn’t belong here or if it’s formatted weird I just need to get this off my chest

A couple years ago my friend (m21) let’s call him Jack invited me (f18) over to his house, he lived about 4 hours from where I lived with my parents at the time so I had to sleep over. He told me I could take his bed and he’d sleep on the couch. My boyfriend was a bit weary of me going over for obvious reasons but I assured him my friend was to be trusted so he could rest assured (mistake!)
After some good chats and a bit of mild drinking I decided to go to bed, I was just drifting off when he came in. He said the couch was uncomfortable and wanted to know if he could sleep in the bed, I said that if we slept at opposites ends of the bed that would be fine because I didn’t feel comfortable being side by side in a bed with him. He agreed and then proceeded to get into bed beside me and started spooning me. I could feel his dick pressed up against my ass and he started touching me across my stomach, down my legs, around my thighs and ass area. I instantly went into panic mode and wanted to leave but I was four hours from home and knew no one in the area. The bed was pressed up against the wall so I couldn’t even get out of it, I would have had to climb over him to leave so I just moved out of his reach. He moved over in the bed after me and continued to touch me in the same places. My body felt like it had just turned to jelly, I couldn’t think logically so I just pretended to be asleep. I think he stopped then but I don’t know if he did anything after I fell asleep for real. He apologized the next day and we never spoke of it again.
Anyway, fast forward to now, he has a new girlfriend, she is very upset because another friend of ours invited her over to watch movies with him and then asked her if she wanted to sleep in his bed. She said no, she’d take the couch but he wouldn’t let her so she slept on the floor. She thinks this was a kind of attempt to get her to have sex with him (apparently he was giving off vibes) she told me and Jack about this and that we needed to cut him out of our group, (I’ll acknowledge she had her reasons but I don’t think that justifies abandoning a friend for what “might” have happened) I told her very nicely that she was being over dramatic and reading into it too much. Jack thinks I’m being heartless and victim blaming. 
They go on and on to me about how the other guy is a perverted asshole who deserves to be punished but I think that’s being hypocritical they preach to me about possibilities without even acknowledging that it was my reality. It’s really hard to have the man who sexually assaulted you preach to you about being nicer to ‘possible’ sexual assault victims. I don’t know if he’s doing it on purpose to spite me or if this is some kind of twisted apology or if he’s even made the connection between what he did to me and what could have happened to his gf. Do you think he’s doing it on purpose? To be nice? Mean? Or has he genuinely forgotten or just doesn’t care? Should I tell her? And am I being over dramatic/insensitive?

539,"Okay, here goes. Lol.

Last night was a good night at work. It wasn't busy. Everyone was getting along. We work in a grocery store.  A few hours before closing one of my co-workers told a guy that he couldn't just take a cheaper bag of dog food without paying for it because that would be stealing and next think you know the customer was coming at my coworker and ended up pulling a knife on him.

Another bigger make customer got involved to stop the customer from coming at my coworker. It was a big scene. Our supervisor was called to the floor and it took 3 calls just for her to come out and her excuse was that she was getting drawers.  I was about to call the cops and my coworker who got the knife pulled on him ended up doing it before I could. My coworker was understandly very pissed off. He got a knife pulled on him but after talking to the cops outside he came back in and was telling us how everything went down. The guy who pulled the knife left before the cops got there. He was cussing but by this time he was off the clock and just fuming a little bit. He wasn't being that way towards us but more so just venting about the situation. Our supervisor (50sf) told him to watch his mouth because it's a store and he was told to calm down. He got mad and left but then came back &amp; went off at our supervisor.

He told our supervisor that she should've came faster  when called. He also told her to suck his dick among other things. No customers were around when this took place but he was told that he was done &amp; our normal manager was called.  Our supervisor cannot fire anyone that's why she called the manager.

I understand that he shouldn't have said those things to our supervisor. I also understand why he was mad. A employee almost gets stabbed and you're more concerned about the language he uses? This guy is someone who I really enjoy working with &amp; is actually liked by the supervisor he went off on prior to lastnight.

The entire situation is bothering me. Someone I'm friends with at work got scolded for fuming after he got a knife pulled on him. I think it's ridiculous.  I understand both sides but would probably cut him some slack on this one. Me and another female coworker are willing to go to management. He handled the situation well &amp; stopped things from getting too bad. It sucks. Every employee where we work have done things less than professional without even being provoked so I find it almost unfair that he got fired for being fired up after a situation like that. The two that were telling him to calm down are actually two of the most dramatic people who work there and definitely not the most professional.

I know what he said was inappropriate maybe even deserving of some consequences but bring fired? I know I have no power but I was one of maybe 5 people there and seeing it take place just pissed me off.


Tldr: coworker got fired after venting after getting a knife pulled on him.

I have anxiety, and I'm TERRIFIED, so I'm asking for advice here. 

Basically I'm a virgin, but I've done some things, and so of course my anxiety is telling me I'm dying of a billion STDs. I don't have any symptoms, but I want a test JUST TO BE SURE, for peace of mind, plus it's possible to get one even if you haven't had sex. My question is, how do I ask the dr for a ""standard"" STD test? I only want a blood test and for them to test for HIV, Chlamydia, Syphilis, etc. I've heard they don't test for HPV since basically everyone has that. Is there a name for this? For that range of common STDs that are tested for through bloodwork? That say I can ask for that. Also, how expensive does it look like something like that will be?

As I was about to glaze it  he came over to tell me that my piece was really good and that I should start to try selling them or getting them exhibited and also to tell me that my piece had blown slightly in the kiln. He explained that it wasn’t a problem this time because it hadn’t blown and smashed into any other pieces and said that’s when it’s an issue because he didn’t want it to break any of his. He went on to say that ‘we have a good thing going’ because he fires my ceramics with his and because of that it’s keeping my costs down and he doesn’t charge me as much. I wasn’t aware of this. 

He showed me some pieces in the back of the studio and said he would have had me glazing in the back with him but he had too much to do. I just replied something like ‘oh right no worries’. I couldn’t tell if he was just being friendly because I was alone and I usually come and paint pottery with friends. 

I finished up glazing and went to buy more clay, he said that he would walk out and put it in my car. Outside he was saying more about selling them and made a comment that we could go into business eventually, he said I could come in and do an hours class with him to try and get my sculpting time for the pieces quicker. 

I told my mum when I got home and she thinks it’s great news and I was happy, but my friends think he is coming on to me and said it’s weird because he doesn’t normally say much. Now I Im worried about whether he’s complimenting my work in a genuine way, and I had no idea about this reduced firing rate that I’ve apparently been getting. Should I be concerned?

I [20F] am friends with this guy in my college class. He’s super nice, but I’ve recently been getting the sense that he likes me:

He sometimes gets really flustered when I talk to him, and seems to mysteriously run into me wherever I am (studying at the library, eating in the cafeteria, etc.). 

One time, I was sitting alone in a building working on some homework during the two-hour gap before my next class. He found me there and sat next to me for almost the full 2 hours, even after I hinted that I wasn’t in the mood to talk since I had so much work to do. He asked why I wasn’t sitting next to him in lecture anymore (I had moved to sit next to another girl, not to get away from him or anything), and at one point said “I wanted to ask you something...” but then got really flustered and said to forget about it. 

Maybe I’m reading it wrong, maybe he’s not interested, but whatever’s happening, it’s making me a little uncomfortable. I wish we could just go back to being easygoing friends.

553,"TL;DR: a few days ago, in a depressed state, I took my entire bottle of prescribed Xanax (0.5mg x roughly 7-10 pills). I'm scared I'll lose control again and do something serious, but I might be overreacting. I don't know what to do or who to talk to. 

I don't know where else to go with this. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was roughly 14, and I've been on antidepressants ever since (I'm 19 now). I have a prescription for Xanax and I use it /very/ sparingly because my family has a history of drug/alcohol abuse and I'm always scared I'll head down that path. But I've had suicidal thoughts since I was much younger and I've fantasized many times about taking all of the pills in the house.

Since 2019 started, my depression has been at a seriously low point and I'm seriously struggling to keep it together. I quit my job (ghosted them, I'm ashamed to admit) and I'm not really talking to any of my friends. I was seeing a therapist who I really clicked with, but I can't go back to her because the deductible is too expensive. I live with my mother and she's so supportive and caring, but it's still incredibly hard and I don't want to be a burden on her. 

Last spring I went to the ER for suicidal ideations and they gave me a few resources and helped me schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist in Mayo, who I did see a few times and I trust him a lot. However, I haven't gone back to see him for a while because the drive to Mayo is 1.5 hours each way, the city is stressful, the parking garages scare me, it's expensive, and the whole ordeal isn't worth it.

Anywaayyysss - A few days ago, I was home alone and felt REALLY out of it. I was really dissociated (I think?) and looking back I feel like I wasn't in control of myself. 

I have a prescription for 0.5mg of Alprazolam (Xanax, for those unfamiliar) and for some reason I just took whatever was left in the bottle. I thought ""fuck it."" It was probably 7-10. I didn't count. And then, of course, I slept for a good 24 hours, probably a bit longer. When I woke up I felt surprisingly terrible and continued to lay in bed for a few hours until I felt good enough to get up. 

I don't know why I did this, but I then called my psychiatrist in Mayo. I didn't know who else to call. I told the nurse what happened. I don't know what I expected to hear from that. I was still kind of out of it from the meds. The nurse asked me how much I took and I told her, and she asked if I was having any physical symptoms, and if I was feeling suicidal (I wasn't feeling much of anything). She said since I wasn't feeling suicidal and didn't have any physical symptoms, I didn't need to go to the ER. She suggested scheduling another appointment with the psych. I said maybe later. (That was a lie.) Then I cried for a while.

I eventually asked my mom to keep all of the medicine locked away because I couldn't trust myself, which she agreed to. 

I'm sorry, I don't know what kind of advice I'm looking for here. I just wish someone would suggest something I haven't thought of yet and miraculously save me. I know that's silly. 

Is it worth mentioning to my doctor? When I talked to the nurse on the phone, it almost felt like she was confused to why I was calling and she didn't think it was worth the time of my psych. Am I being overdramatic? Is it not a big deal? :( ",06Feb2019,1

562,"I promise that I am going to keep this as short as possible because I would really appreciate as much help as possible.

Okay so....growing up as a kid I lived at home with my happily married parents and my sister. We had the stereotypical American family. We ate dinner at the table, we talked about our day, but most of all we had respect for everyone at all times. Sadly all of this changed for me when my mother died of ovarian cancer at age 41. She passed away when I was 18 years old. I remember upon losing her thinking that me and dad would come together even closer then we already were. But the exact opposite happened. At first he talked to me just the same but he picked up a terrible drinking problem and that started the decline of our relationship. Then about a year in he just stopped speaking to me downright. The only times he would speak was to criticize or yell at me over petty things. Along the way of grief I also got a dog. This dog is my world. Sadly my dad doesnt see this at all. I've had to stop him from hitting my dog out of frustration many times. He even has threatened to kill the dog, I've legit pleaded with him to stop for so long now but he believes that because ""dogs don't know english"" it's a perfectly suitable thing to say to a animal. To top it all off he tries to avoid talking about my mom at all. He tells me if I bring it up he will most likely spaz out at work the next day so it's best if we avoid it. Also he is dating a woman now. He has been for about 3 to 4 months and he is legit forcing me to meet her this weekend. This man hasnt even cleaned his bedroom since mom died but he thinks it's cool to date...I'm just lost and need advice on how to navigate this.

TLDR: Dad has become abusive and toxic since my mom has died and I need advice on how to survive till I can move out after college ",06Feb2019,1

I've told her straight up I have a lot of stuff to do, and tried to just gray rock her by ignoring her or just ""Hmmm""ing, but nothing happens.

K has expressed interest in J’s younger brother, and J has explicitly told K he was not okay with it. J told me that it’s the one thing in his friendship with K that he would absolutely not tolerate, and that if he ever found out anything happened between K and his younger brother, he would report her.

A few months ago, K told me she’s had sex with J’s little brother a few times. She told me J absolutely CAN’T know about it, and I wanted to keep her secret. I didn’t think she would do it again, so I kept my mouth shut. 

K has been spending the night at J’s house for a few days, and this morning she told me she’s been sneaking up to J’s little brother’s room while J was asleep and having sex with him.

I am honestly disgusted. K hasn’t been the greatest friend to me, but she knows all my secrets and so far has kept them. I would feel awful if I betrayed her trust, and I feel like with all the dirt she has on me she would try to ruin my life out of spite, I’ve seen her do it to others before. I really feel like J deserves to know what’s going on in his own house though, and he would be so upset if he found out that I knew about it but didn’t tell him.

573,"Hi reddit, I thought I would turn to all of you for the most unbiased advice I could possible get.
Short form just so it isn't an essay. 
My mother has multiple personal disorder coupled with schizophrenia.
For almost 8 years I haven't seen here because I chose not to. She left the family in an extremely poor way and ruined any relationship she had with her 4 children in the process.
She's managed to manipulate her way back into 3 of their lives. 
To mention one of my brothers also has schizophrenia but has refused to seek help for it and is in denial about it.
At the end of the day she is my mother and we cant choose our families. 
In the very back of my mind I have far distant fond memories but then they are basically ruined by all the shit that happened with her through the divorce and everything else that followed. I use to be extremely close to my mother when I was young. But that's the past and I don't want to dwell on it anymore as it's so clouded by the bad things. 

Basically she's trying to get back into my life but I honestly don't want anything to do with her. Speaking with her I'm afraid of whom I'm speaking to as she has 5 separate personalities that I know of and its really hard.
Every time she can get me on the phone it usually ends in hysteria on her part but I try to and I do keep it calm on my end. 
But I need to just some how, some way say something that is going to stop her from encroaching on my life that I now share with my wife. 

I don't want to know my mother now, I don't have any strong feelings anymore, and I don't want to see her in person either. She's even elluded to the fact of turning up at my place of work, which I don't want. 

How do I talk to someone like this without have it be derailed into a emotional situation of hysteria on her part and make it more about my mental well-being and what I need in life now?

Please reddit, help me as I need to solve this once and for all. I don't want any of this in my life anymore but I need some honesty help and guidance and after reading how a lot of people get help just by asking on here I thought I would try. ",06Feb2019,1
574,"There is a smallish grocery/general store by my house that I, 28F, frequent once or twice a week. On multiple occasions (at least 3) that I’ve been in there, an early 20ish year old intellectually/cognitively disabled man who hangs out in there has followed me around the store, asking me general questions like how old I am, where I’m from and when my birthday is. This is fine. He has asked for a hug, and asked to take a pic with me with his cell phone multiple times.. I don’t want to take a pictures and I do not like to be touched, or hugged by strangers but I complied mostly because I didn’t know what else to do.  However, yesterdays interaction made me so uncomfortable that I’m here asking for advice.

I was in an aisle looking at something and he finds me and asks his usual questions. I continue shopping while he followed me, and eventually he follows me to the checkout line. He asks me to take a picture of us together on my phone.
Me: why? Why my phone?
Him: mines home charging.
M: *snaps picture* there you go. See? 
H: can you send it to me?
M: I’ll tag you on Facebook. (We aren’t friends on Facebook.) 
H: send it to my phone number!!!
M: (finally drawing a line) no, I don’t give my phone number out. I’ll tag you.
H: just send it to me on my phone number.
M: I can’t.
H: well do you drive? 
M: yes.
H: can you take me home?
M: no I have to go back to work. (Lie)
H: I don’t mind. Take me home.
M: what? I can’t give you a ride home i have to get to work.
H: well if you don’t give me a ride, how will I get home?
M: I don’t know, but I can’t.
H: aren’t we friends? We are buddies?
M: (checking out now) i have to go.
H: can you give me a hug? *hugs me*
And I leave looking over my shoulder through the parking lot. 

There are people in front of and behind me/us for reference, but no one, even the cashier who knows him since he hangs in the store, said anything even though I’m sure I was visibly uncomfortable as I could only stare at the ground, try to keep my answers short, and continuously tried to divert my attention to my phone. I know it is not their responsibility but I couldn’t help but feel as though the cashier should have told him to back off.

Honestly, if this person did not have an intellectual disability and was following me around the store, touching me, hugging me, asking me for pictures, pressuring me for my phone number and guilting me to try to get in my car, I would lose my shit and probably call the police. This man is much much bigger than me, and he is a stranger. This is uncomfortable in any case. But, since he has a disability, I don’t know how to handle it. I cannot stop going to this store for multiple reasons. I don’t know that I want to tell management because the man hangs out here, and I don’t want to take that away from him if this is the only “hobby” he has. And I don’t know what to say to him to get him to stop, make him understand while also being understanding of his particular needs and level of comprehension. I don’t want to hurt his feelings or be insensitive, but I also don’t want any more of these interactions. 

Please help with what to do, what to say, how to handle this.",06Feb2019,1

So Pam has this friend from home who I've always butt heads with. Let's call her Tia. So Tia is not the best person: talks a lot behind people's backs, never has much good to say, has split my friends apart numerous times, etc. She also changes Pam when they are really close, in a bad way. A couple weeks ago, Pam made some bad decisions with Tia, so me being frustrated, I told Pam that Tia makes her different. That conversation found its way back to Tia and she texted me saying that ""you're a BITTER ass person &amp; im here to vouch that everyone feels that way about you in your life"" and ""you make things absolutely difficult and pure hell for everyone else all the damn time &amp; people are sick of it"". There was a lot more that she said, like paragraphs on paragraphs of things, but no one wants to read all that.  And pretty much 95% of the stuff she said isn't close to true. I get I might just say that to make me sound good, but I have few very good friends and I'd do anything for them and I believe I'm a good person. She pretty much just told me her feelings about me and tried to make them seem like they were everyones. Just a fighting tactic to make me feel worse and such. Anyways I ended up having to apologize to Tia for making her upset, which I didn't really say anything that mean.

A couple weeks passed and I'm back at school with Pam from winter break. Pam has done a couple things since we've been back that hurt my feelings and I'm already pretty upset with her. But to add to it, she told me yesterday that Tia is coming up this weekend. To stay in our room. At first, it was alright since I could just stay at my boyfriends place, but today I just realized that won't work out. Pam has also told my school friends about Tia coming and tried to make them pick sides, which was never what I even considered  doing. I've tried so hard in the past to be friends with Tia. She's just not the best person for me personally to be around. I also don't want her in my life whatsoever and just don't need her negativity. I'm just really frustrated because I'm done pretending to be friends with Tia. I don't want to see her but Pam is trying to recruit all my friends to hang out with Tia and her instead of me. I'm just not sure what to do. Am I immature for not wanting to pretend to like her? Just asking for some advice.

Told a 10 year old she will have sex before Jr high. 

Let a 4 year old play outside while she was sleeping. A random service truck pulled up to their yard and the child came running after the truck when the guy left.

We told her to call an exterminator and go to the doctor. When I called and spoke to her today in order to get more information to see how I can help, she said that the exterminator has been in her home 12 times, and couldn't pin point what it is. Red flag number one.

He would add me on Discord to try to convince me we are meant yo be together, and it happened often enough I ended up having to block him. Now, when he had initially found my main reddit account, I blocked his account from it pretty much immediately. Now he is creating reddit accounts to message my main account, threatening suicide, telling me he is sobbing while he types to me.

589,"Hi all. I started a new job Monday at company 1. I have another job offer from company 2 expiring next Monday that I just negotiated up to be a comparable salary to what current job (company 1) is paying. 

Here’s a quick breakdown:

Company 1:

Manager: great and nice

Pay: 87500 base, 2% bonus this year 

Commute: 20 min 

Schedule: inflexible 9-5, work from home very much the exception not the rule. Maybe even frowned upon. 

Company 2:

Manager: unknown 

Pay: 82000 base, 5k signing bonus, 7% annual bonus target 

Commute: 20 min

Schedule: wfh 2 days a week is the norm for everyone 


My industry is fairly small so I’m scared of burning the bridge at company 1 by quitting in my first week, but I really hate the inflexibility because I have a physical disability that affects my energy levels. It’s physically taxing for me to commute here so I wish i could wfh a little bit during the week instead. Also my energy level drops around 3 pm which is why at my previous job I worked 7-3. Now working til 5 I’m so tired and useless for the last couple hours. It’s an invisible illness that I hide really well, so I’m scared people will think I’m just lazy if I try to wfh when it’s frowned upon. (Chronic illness peeps will know exactly how this feels) Company 2 is really drawing me in with its wfh culture and they came up a lot from their original offer and offered a signing bonus. They seem like they’d be more flexible with hours too. The problem is I would burn the bridge at company 1, who for the most part is treating me really well. And I’m just torn. I have no gut feelings. 

Thanks for any and all advice! ",06Feb2019,1
591,"So today I went into a supermarket and decided to buy something from their bakery. I specifically asked the people at the counter if there were any eggs used in the food. Both of the bakery team said no and they even checked the sign on their counter which also said there was no eggs used in the food.
Cue 20 minutes later I start to get this weird feeling and before I know it my skin is raw red, throat is swollen and my stomach is painfully churning itself... This is when I realise oh so they were wrong... Turns out they use an egg wash to baste the food before it is cooked but this is not stated on their information tags. 

I've just gotten back from hospital after having to leave work early and I'm now wondering whether I'm liable to sue considering how out of my hands this error was. Normally I detest this sort of thing but I hate having an allergic reaction it ruins the entire day and this was so easily avoidable considering I asked them this question and they had 3 people behind that counter who all said no.

592,"Hey Reddit, I apologize if this isn't the right sub for this, and if there's a better one I can be directed to I'll move this post, but this seemed to be the best place I first landed on, so I figured it would work. I'll have a TL;DR at the bottom.

Anyhow, for background, I graduated from high school in June of 2017 (I'm 19) with really solid grades, getting third in my class with a 4.0 GPA, and began attending university for a Bachelor of Science (Honours) majoring in Chemistry in September of the same year. My first semester there was decent, with just one C+, a couple B-'s, a B+, and an A-. My second semester was not good, however, as I ended up falling ill and my class attendance dropped as well as my grades. I ended up failing 2/5 classes, managed a D+ in another, and then a C- and a C in the remaining courses. Overall, my GPA was 2.0 (from what I gather from the student portal for the university, and the unofficial transcript provided), which wasn't good. The honours program required me to hold a 3.0 GPA or be barred from continuing in the program.

As you can likely gather, I wasn't allowed to continue in my program, and was sent a notice of academic standing stating that I may not continue, and that I can reapply to a general science program via a paper application. I completed the application and went to fax it, which I thought worked. I later found out (after the application deadline had passed) that the fax had failed to go through, whether due to entering the wrong number, or the fax machine being broken, among many other possible reasons.

In any regard, I wasn't able to reapply to my original institution to continue in a general program, and so I turned to completing an entirely new application online as opposed to a reapplication as soon as the opportunity arose. I applied to my original university in a different program (Bachelor of Kinesiology), along with two others. I should mention that the first institution I attended was in Alberta, whereas the other two I applied to were in BC. I just received an email from one of the institutions I applied to stating that I am being denied admission, based on my GPA being below their standard for transfer (which I was unaware of, as all the information I could gather suggested that their GPA requirement was 2.0), and that my academic record states that I was required to discontinue, which doesn't leave me in good academic standing to apply anywhere else.

So, what I'm looking for is advice on what exactly I can do to get back into school, as I'm completely lost, and my parents never went to post-secondary, so they aren't exactly resources I'm able to turn to. I'm looking into community colleges to complete credits to maybe get my GPA looking better and having strong transfer credits, but I have no idea how any of this works. I really want to get my degree in kinesiology and work into physical therapy, but I have absolutely no clue where to start for rebuilding myself to get into kinesiology.

593,"There are a few factors as to why I'm feeling lost. Mainly my relationship and my career. I have a new-ish relationship of about six months. He is wonderful and amazing and caring and kind and all the wonderful things that you want in an SO. The catch? He has kids, and I have been vehemently child-free since I can remember. I've pretty much decided (through multiple converstations with both of us in agreement) that our time with each other is limited because of his kids. So, I'm having problems deciding how much time we should spend together and if there is a way that we can still be with each other (we still care about one another) without it seeming like we're both sinking with each other. This leads to feelings of guilt when I am happy with him because I know that the longer that he's with me, it's just time that he's not using to get over me and find someone else (and vice versa). I've never had to deal with breaking up with someone because ""love just isn't enough"" before and I'm not dealing with it well. 

My career is a different matter. I just turned 27 and I hate having a desk job. I have a job three hours away from the town I grew up in and no way to get out of the state (seemingly). I want to go and do and see and recently all I've been seeing at my job are the blank walls and feeling like I'm just in this position and job because it's expected of me to work a 40-hour work week. It depresses me to start thinking about spending my life working at a desk, but I don't have the money to leave (trying to work here until I'm debt free -- but that might not happen for another 3 years or so). I guess I'm just trying to get some perspective on how to either deal with it or options that could still help me get out of debt while I'm in my 20s that don't involve a 9-5. 

I know that was long. I appreciate any advice given. Cheers. ",06Feb2019,1

I work days of the week I don’t have school so I’m just exhausted and can’t ever find the time to get my homework done, or if I do I just have to motivation to do it. I know money and a degree should be my motivation but I just can’t seem to put my energy into it. Does that mean it’s not for me? What are my alternatives? Will college get better?

What's wrong with my dog? She is a 7 year old min pin chihuahua mix (shes a rescue, not sure exact breed). She is a very sweet doggo who loves to sleep and cuddle and spends most her days doing so. She can always be found under a blanket on the couch, where she wont move for hours at a time. 

However starting yesterday she has not laid down and is acting very strange. Normally if I am sitting on the couch or in bed she will jump up and paw at a blanket so she can go under and press herself against me. Now she will go under, slowly walk around/over me, and then walk back out another side. Then she will try to go under again and do the same thing! She keeps doing loops and will not lay down. I was awake all last night because she would not stop. At one point I was on the kitchen floor trying to get her to drink some water and she was doing non stop figure 8 loops under/through my legs.

600,"A few months ago, my roommates (my buddy and his girlfriend) and I got busted for smoking cannabis in a prohibition state. It all happened because the two of them were flirting by “play fighting” but it got really loud and the cops were called on a domestic dispute by the neighbor below us. When they got there, they could smell the weed and asked who it belonged to. It technically belonged to all of us, but I took the fall for everything and told them everything was mine. Both of them are trying to do something with their lives and a marijuana possession charge could seriously affect them, and I didn’t want them to have to go through that. I have already had run-ins with police before, so a misdemeanor isn’t a huge problem, it’s just a little expensive. 

Long story short, I have paid a little over $1,500 for everything, and I still owe another 500 in March. To top things off, about a month later I lost my job due to a forklift accident. I have been trying to get a job elsewhere, but the whole court thing has gotten me rejected from many jobs. Because of all this, I have missed my last two rent payments, equaling about $1,000. My roommate has been very patient and gracious about it up till now. He told me he pays the rent himself and just saves whatever I give him, so it’s not a problem. But today he told me he needs the payment as soon as possible.

I’m not upset about him asking for payment. I mean, I get it. But I just feel like he knows my life is kinda falling apart and he has never offered, nor have I asked him, to help with any of the legal shit I’m going through, even though I took the blame for what is essentially their mistake. But I also feel like I owe him, and can’t bring this up. I’m super non-confrontational, and I’m not trying to start a problem between the two of us. Am I an asshole for expecting a little more leniency? What should I do?

605,"As a young adult at 24 and becoming more social and outgoing I frequently find myself at points where I have to choose to believe what somebody has told me, or what I visibly observed about a situation or experience. For example just this week I was out with a few friends and was talking to one of their friends, me and her got on quite well, she showed interest and then added me to which I messaged her the next day and she wasn't interested. 

From my perspective, her talking and being friendly, being less talkative to this other guy and then wanting to add me made me believe that she could only be interested and I pursued this with this definite conclusion in my head, thus asking her out the next day.

Her friend who is also my friend later told me, she was only interested in another guy in our group, she is friendly with everyone so therefore was to me, and apparently she always adds people on social media. So now I'm at a choice, do I believe my friend who may be interested in her and trying to turn me away? Or do I believe my subjective opinion of what I assumed had happened from my point of view.

Ultimately I’m a junior right now in the bachelors for ME program and it has really been a rough ride, not in terms of academics but having to work while having to take a minimum of 12 credits to receive financial aid. I’ve had to work +40 hours a week since before my freshman year to be able to afford these classes and it obviously was detrimental to my academics, hence my situation now. I can’t really ask my family for help as we’re all dealing with a pretty shitty financial situation. Anyways, my gen ed courses are ones I have been flying by in but the engineering specific courses that require a little more time and practice (math/science +engineering core) were JUST good enough just to move on( 50% C’s, 40% B’s and occasional A’s)

Here is the embarrassing part: so the one course that is the absolute basis for mechanical engineering  (EGR 250: intro to thermal engineering) is the course that I struggled with the first time I took it and failed. Now, I had  sporadic test scores where I would do good on an exam (like 85+%) and then get a score like 40%. This large variation in test scores really just stems with how much time I had to devote to this course as opposed to another one.             -&gt;Basically, I failed this course 3 times which is absolutely embarrassing and I’m completely ashamed. &lt;-
[This one course has kept me from moving into the actual ME program classes, but I received conditional major standing since 250 would be the last course I needed to take before entering my actual ME courses. So, this way, I was able to take 2 ME courses (properties of materials and mechanics of materials which I got B’s in]

I petitioned to repeat the course one last time, also stating that this would be the only course I would take in winter semester just to prove that I am capable of succeeding in this program when I am not working and am capable of handling the challenges and focus that I am required to handle in the school of engineering ( stopped my engineering internship voluntarily and my retail job) 

When I received word that the Academic standing committee denied my petition (after fall 2018), they also stated that I am not allowed to further pursue engineering at Oakland. This decision was made at the end of December and I was absolutely destroyed and lost. Then I was dropped from the ME courses I would have been taking now, but can’t because of EGR 250. Now I am not taking any classes at OU or any other school because of one of two reasons: I couldn’t take anything at a community college at the time because classes were full/not worth the money or time OR it didn’t make sense taking another gen ed at OU if it didn’t count towards a degree if that makes sense. 

Fast forward to now: I got another mechanical engineering internship at the beginning of January and have been working my tail off trying to learn as much as I can. All of this is useless unless I have an actual degree. So, I applied to Wayne State mechanical engineering, got accepted for summer semester and am going to take differential equations just to prove to OU that I am capable of college level work. I may also take the engineering static’s course at Wayne. 



HERE IS MY MAIN QUESTION: 

Since the decision from the academic committee, I have been working on a re-admission application to OU.  The re-admission application wants an explanation of the circumstances under why I left OU( for a semester) and how I’ve used my time away. 
*******************************************
—&gt; Is there any chance they can consider me for re-admission? Any major things I can add to help convince them to give me one last chance?&lt;—
*******************************************
 If I didn’t care for this degree I would have switched my major after the committees decision, but EVEN after two months since the committees decision, extensive thinking on what else I can pursue, talking to advisors from other programs, talking to my parents, talking to engineering advisors, I really cannot see myself doing anything else. 

Notes:
- I am still in good standing within the program (2.8 GPA)
- I’ll admit it, coming out of high school my math skills were average and I did have to retake calc 3 at OU
-Commuting to Wayne M-F would really be a pain/ mess with my family’s work/school schedule unlike OU which is a 10 min drive from my house
-I have to submit my re-admission application to be considered for summer semester by March 1. If I decide to hold off, take the classes at Wayne over the summer, and then submit my re-admission app. to be considered for Fall 2019, then I also can prove with hard grades that I am capable of succeeding.
-I have been studying my thermodynamics textbook since December, just learning as much as I can for the course and practicing as many problems I can

SORRY FOR THE ALL CAPS BUT I NEED TO TO EMPHASIZE THIS POINT: STUDENTS THAT ARE CONVICTED OF CHEATING AT OAKLAND ARE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR PROGRAM IF ITS THEIR FIRST OFFENSE AS OPPOSED TO MYSELF WHO CANT CONTINUE BECAUSE I TRIED TO DO TOO MUCH (pay for my classes, hold internships, ACTUALLY TRY to learn as opposed to a student who just goes and cheats. This logic just doesn’t make sense and stings even more knowing that students who cheat can make it farther than me.

I really just want to finish at OU ultimately as my official degree process is 77%. If I have to finish at Wayne State, my transfer credits would put me at 36% progress towards completion of the ME degree= more time and money",06Feb2019,1
612,"I’m basically living on a lie. I grew up with an Asian family, so we are not as openminded as a typical American family (we do live in the states). I don’t tend to share a lot of my personal things with them. Long story short, it took a long time for me to come out as gay, and they were generally fine with it. Still, it has been hard for me to share things with them fearing judgement and prejudice.

Now to the problem. I dropped out of a good four year college. I was going to a UC as a premed student. But I only did so because I have relatives that are in the medical field and they all expect me to do the same because I was a good student throughout K-12. I became miserable because I never was a science/medical person. So i decided to drop out. They eventually found out because I wasn’t going to school. I told them that I was just taking a break, and that I’m changing my major.

That was all truth until now. The major i wanted to transfer into (business) doesn’t open up for change of major. So currently, I’m going to a local college to finish some classes I need for the business major, and then transferring back to another 4 years uni. Very soon, I’d have to tell them that I’m not at UC anymore, and the fact that i’m going to a community college would flip them out. I’m really afraid of their judgement... what should I do?

613,"Alright so I'm just gonna try and get as many details about my family out there to really understand the full situation.

My sister has been a trouble maker since she was 12 when she stated hanging out with a poor crowd of people who introduced her to marijuana around that that time and harder drugs soon after. One of these boys is her current bf who she started dating a couple years ago. They are both about 18 now and I'm 21. 

My mums whole life since my sister's using problem has basically been damage control and trying to get my sister on a better path. She would go to classes to learn about misbehaving kids, try and help the kids my sister was friends with and so on. Its been so painful to watch because there wasn't ever really a good way to control her. 

My mum and dad got a divorce a few years ago (almost 4 now) and I'm honestly surprised it took so long. I really dislike my dad and honestly have no idea what my mum saw in him to begin with. He was never violent but would do awful things that could be just as psychologically damaging. When my sister starting cutting my dad would do it too and told her she made him do it. The majority of my memories of him as a kid are of him just rambling drunkenly in my bedroom doorway while I asked him to leave to only find piss puddles in my living room the next morning.

Before and after the divorce my mum would give clear instructions on how to handle my sister. For almost a year she was doing pretty well. She always struggled with school but she was Working a job and Had avoided any major trouble. I credit my mum for this because they had a couple systems in place. She used a chart that recorded bad behaviors and punishments that my sister and my mum worked up together. My mum also did not let her go anywhere without communication. These were the two systems my mum wanted my dad to follow the most but he did not even slightly. My sister went to stay with him for a couple weeks but only a couple days in and my dad had no idea where she goes for about 3 days which infuriates my mum. Turns out this is around when she stated using meth. 

My sisters friends are all terrible. I've only ever liked a couple of them and the rest are just dirt bags who show no respect, break laws, and use hard drugs. Her current boyfriend doesn't seem that bad but I'm beginning to think he is very manipulative. They fight almost every day and I wake up to it. I can never really tell whos in the wrong because they are both hot heads. I've intervened a few times trying to get both out of Eachothers face. Her bf had threatened to break down the bathroom door to get to my sis a few times and my mum and I have kicked him out because of it a couple of those times. He escalates things in every confrontation and is very rude. He's told my mum she's a terrible mum for letting her daughter go out at night. Now, weather my mum has done a good job handling her is debatable but it's also important to understand that its not easy. If an 18 year wants to live a risky life there's very little my mum can actually do to stop that. My mum has done a good job compared to my sister's friends parents who all let their kids do whatever. I knew a parent of my sisters friend who would do molly with their 16 year old daughter. My point Is I'm getting very pissed off at this kid and my mum has been drowning in this mess for years (she sometimes just breaks down and weeps which absolutely crushes me). I don't really know if Anyone has any good advice but I really appreciate anyone who stopped to read my story.

614,"I recently held a presentation in front of a group of 4 classmates. After just a few sentences I sort of had a panic attack, where I just felt that I would start crying if I continued, and I had to cancel the presentation. This was a major shame for me, since it never has happened before. Ever since then I have had an escalating social anxiety. Everytime since then when I need to speak in front of a group, big or small, I feel the same reaction coming. 

I study a pretty high intensity program in my countries equivalent of high school, where oral presentations in front of at least 10 people are not uncommon. This next week, on Tuesday, I am supposed to hold a presentation in English (which is not my native language). I have major anxiety as it comes closer. I am so afraid of that I will start crying or blush uncontrollably and inexplicably in front of the group.

The thing is, I usually am very social and extroverted. I used to love talking in front of people, and I love hanging out with friends still. This social anxiety and glossophobia has attacked me from nowhere, probably due to lack of exercise and sun the last couple of months. The lack of exercise comes from a skiing accident from a month ago along with sickness before that, both of which probably have screwed up my hormonal balances.

Should I avoid the presenation next Tuesday, and talk to my teacher about my problem? Or should I try to collect myself and do it, risking another ""attack"" and further social anxiety as a consequence? In the best case scenario I do the presentation and succeed, leading to my subconscious accepting that my fears are irrational. I know that I probably should seek help in both cases, and certainly in the former.

TL;DR: I am a social guy who gets panic attacks when holding presenations. Never had this problem before, and therefore I don't know if I should avoid further presentations until I have gotten therapy.",06Feb2019,1

This girl is way out of my league. She’s someone very independent, who has their life organized and planned, straight A student, happy, popular, very social, athletic. And of course she would never notice someone like me.

Because I’m basically the total opposite of her.

I know that it will never work out (she’s straight). I just want to get rid of those unwanted feelings. 

It’s just that every time I think about Valentine's Day, I know that there will be a lot of guys giving her presents or confessing their feelings. I’m a complete outsider. I don’t want to get in their way. I don’t want to ruin her opportunities.  I’ll be just happy inside, quietly cheering up for her while holding my tears back.

It hurts so much. It hurts being different.

Having a relationship with my father is extremely difficult for me. He provides for me, and my family takes care of me; however, I struggle to get along with him and it's killing me. He's old. I just want to enjoy time with my dad before he dies, except I'm a teenager and our views combat on almost everything. 

We got along well growing up, but as I became a teenager and started thinking for myself, our values have grown apart. He's very religious, conservative, and I don't mind what he believes, it's just when he starts prying into every little thing I do is when I have an issue. My parents have no boundaries when it comes to my privacy. They can ramsack my room whenever they want, they take away all of my belongings they don't agree with (such as CD's, books, video games, etc.), And the worst part of it all, is that I can't talk to them about my problems. 

As previously mentioned, my dad is old, and he has high blood pressure. Every time I try to talk things through, communicate about how I feel about things, or work things out, he just starts raising his voice at me. He operates in similar ways to ""my way or the highway"", and his defense for everything he does is because he owns the house and as long as I'm under his roof, I have to obey his rules.

I don't feel like I'm asking for much at times. I just want to have a good relationship with my father. I've lost all trust for him, I feel like I can never talk to him or be myself around him, and I'd just wish they'd give me space.

There were some moments in her life which he said he felt like he had something close to a mother, but in the 9 years that she was in his life that hey were very far and few between. 
At 9 she told him, to his face, that she didn’t want him and didn’t want to be a mother to him. His father who really was no better at that time,  (he’s changed for the better and is now a very good grandpa to our kids and he has formed a solid and loving bond with my fiancé) had to come and get him, at 9, from across the states. 
I say all this because, yesterday his mother died.   

He is 33 years old and has had very little contact with her, not for him trying (even with what she put him through) but because he needed some kind of closure I think. 
Anyways, she died and today we read the obit.... and it’s blasphemous. They had the audacity to put down that “she gave to others even when she had none left to give herself”,  “she was a kind soul with a warm heart” “she lived a full life”.

634,"Posting with a previously used throwaway. Long post.

Relevant information: All of us ""kids"" are adults in our mid to late 20's, early 30's. 

\---

Our parents have been the literal picture of a perfect marriage for almost 40 years. My mom was always super involved in the PTA's and other groups, always made sure our school projects were incredible, spent TONS of time with us growing up, and became a surrogate mom for many friends who had bad family situations. She and I would get lunch every week, paint together, have mother-daughter shopping runs, and talk on the phone almost every single day. In a nutshell, she was the ""perfect"" mom, the mom our friends would say they wish they had. My dad is great as well! Very successful at his career, very supportive, always said how much he adored my mom and that she was the reason for his success in life. PDA with them was normal, and they almost never fought. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last Christmas was amazing, mom planned a ton of dinners, prepared some really special gifts, talked about how wonderful it was to have everyone home, in general, acting the same as she had every year for as long as we can remember. Our only warning that something was off was when she mentioned to a couple of us that she may be going on a trip, going away, for a few days. This was following her venting a little bit about my dad not taking his health seriously, or his temper flaring up with things work related. Myself, and another sibling that was told, just asked her to keep us updated, and to let us know when she was heading out, etc. I don't think we took it super seriously or expected her to be gone long. 

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately after the holidays, she told my dad she needed to get away for a little while, got on a plane, and left. None of us thought this was a bad sign (she had told him she was just going to visit some friends), until she suddenly went completely off the grid. Phone calls, texts, location services, email, all going unanswered. It was nearly a week before we figured out where she was, but then, she didn't want to talk to any of us.

&amp;#x200B;

In the days before she took off, she had been her sweet self with us kids and my dad, but ever since the departure day, she is cold and distant. We don't know what happened. We have each tried to talk to her, to offer her support, or try to understand what is going on inside her head, but she's like a completely different person now. She is frigid, not a ""wife"" or ""mom"" in any sense of the word. My dad is devastated, he has completely fallen apart. Talking to him on the phone is painful, and we wish we could do more to help. Personally, my siblings and I are gutted, we feel like we have completely lost our mom, like she's died. We're barely keeping it together in our own lives. To top things off, she's been on social media acting like everything is normal, which has been hurtful in its own way. My partner and I live near their home, and our friends who were ""adopted"" by mom and dad are beginning to ask what is going on with them, because they haven't seen either of them in weeks. It's getting harder to put a smile on every day and act like everything is okay, and we're running out of excuses. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are SO close with our parents, and this is beginning to feel like a death in the family. WE LOVE OUR MOM, so much. We are trying to stay neutral and be supportive, but we're unbelievably sad and it's hard to keep trying when she keeps pushing us away. My dad isn't perfect, not by a long shot, but he has NEVER been physically or emotionally abusive. Whenever he's tried to reach out lately on his end, she gets skittish and runs away to be somewhere else. It's breaking his heart, and I'm worried he won't be able to keep it together if she is truly gone for good. She has already said she wants a divorce, but won't face him to talk about it. He has offered counseling, therapy, everything, to try and get her to come home, with no luck. She won't tell us where she is, or what her plans are. Every day is a struggle, and there are days where we have admitted to each other that just getting out of bed in the morning is even a challenge. Mom is/was a central pillar in our lives, in my life, and she is just suddenly gone. She's not talking to anyone else in the family, she's cut herself completely off. It feels like the rug has been pulled out from beneath our feet. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently made the decision to see a mental health professional after having some incredibly dark thoughts surrounding all of this. Every support page online that I've found is for kids dealing with a parent leaving while they are minors, and we are all over 18. **I guess I would just like some insight as to what to do, how to best support mom and dad, how to deal with it on our own as their children?** Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

635,"My younger sister has made some mistakes in life. And right now, some of those mistakes have led to her losing custody of her daughter, my niece, and my mom and stepdad having custody of her and that's a post in and of itself, but I digress. So my husband and I went down to see family for Christmas, and my sister was there and she told us that she had gotten engaged to a man she had known for maybe a month at that point. I was taken surprised and skeptical of how well a relationship that was only a month old could work well, let alone throwing marriage into the picture, but I sighed and tried to be as happy as I could for her despite my misgivings.

I figured that it would end bad, but she would learn something from it as people do from bad decisions. I did press her a bit about why she was getting married, and she told me she was trying to get custody of her daughter back. Fair enough I suppose, but I know that there are more things that need to happen for her to get custody back. Well, this month I found out from one of my stepsisters and from my own Google search that, my sister's fiance is on the Sex Offenders list for sexual misconduct with a minor under the age of 13. And she's trying to get custody of her daughter back who is under five.

I just don't know what to do regarding this. Do I let her know that I know about this? I think she knows he's on the list, but not for what, or maybe she doesn't. I don't really know. Should I tell my mom about this since my sister lives near my mom to see my niece? I just don't know what to do in this because I'm afraid if I speak to my sister about this, she may get mad at me and refuse to speak with me about anything period. It doesn't help that she is not friends with him on Facebook or anything, so I can't say I looked him up after seeing him on there and was curious.

638,"**So my current situation:**

I’m a guy, 21. After doing 3 years at uni and missing out on my degree by a single mark, I’m currently in a very average low paid full time job, still living with parents and very financially stable - I’ve always been good with my money. I have almost no job satisfaction and was looking to drop to part time in late March/early April so I could spend more time studying for my final exam at uni and then move into a more relevant job to progress my career. 

I’m very overweight at 18st /110kg and have been really thinking about this lately I need to get my s**t together and get in shape, would especially nice to lose a bunch of weight for when I graduate. I was always tubby but when I started uni I put on a lot of weight just through eating crap. (I did try a keto died in summer 2018 and it went incredibly well for a month, but I got this job and it got harder to maintain in my job and i slowly gave up)

And also my mental health is questionable, throughout my last two years at uni I was questioning if I was depressed, but shrugged it off and haven’t thought too much of it since. Now I’ve always been ‘shy’ since I was a young kid but for whatever reason I looked into anxiety and I scarily fit a lot of the symptoms, and from that I had every single one of these ‘symptoms’ for social anxiety on a reliable website, and now regardless I need to seek advice for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or try medication to ease the anxiety - I guess this is the main reason I’m coming to Reddit on an anon account. I struggle to even talk to my own parents about these things even though it seems so insignificant and everyday.



**What’s the plan?**

So I was off work sick for a week and really had time to think; I’m not happy and I’m in desperate need to get in better shape both physically and mentally. So I handed I my notice at work and plan to use that time to get out to the gym/swimming pool in the mornings, stick to a controlled keto diet and spend time studying in the afternoon. I’m even tempted to learn Spanish as well during my free time in the evenings because that certainly doesn’t hinder a job application and it’s always good to be bilingual. And of course I will do whatever to try to improve my mental health.



Tl;dr

I’m 21, in poor shape, have almost no job satisfaction in a low paid job, generally unhappy and likely have anxiety. I’m financially stable so want to quit my job and focus on improving my happiness, wellbeing, and spending time studying for a final exam for uni.


Gaps in your résumé can hurt, and I’m sacrificing 3/4 months pay but I feel like this is the best time to improve my quality of life, just before I graduate and actually start a career. I appreciate any advice. Thanks :)

I’m also finishing school part time. We make okay money and could probably afford an apartment (not a particularly nice one as the rent in this area is ridiculous) but it would be tight and wouldn’t leave much left for saving. 

The problem is that I’m getting increasingly frustrated living here. My mom is retired, so we are both home a lot during the day and she constantly gives me advice about how to take care of the baby. It’s not bad advice, just unneeded. I also can’t go anywhere without her asking where i’m going, if I go to the store she wants to know what I bought, what I’m eating, etc. Just no privacy at all. There’s a few other things too: everything has to be cleaned right away (no leaving dishes unwashed, clothes in the dryer, things around the house), can’t take long showers, can’t cook after 8 pm, probably more things. 

I love my parents and nothing they do is done maliciously or anything. It’s really generous of them to allow us to live here and it’s a huge help financially so I feel a little guilty finding it so annoying. I’d love to hear from anyone else who lives with their parents, what was it like and how did you make it work? Even if not then advice? I’m not sure if Im just being bratty or if it is really a bad idea to stay. Thanks",06Feb2019,1

647,"Alright so my son is 9 months. It's been about a month since my wife, my son, and I have seen her and I don't see how that's gonna get any better. 

My wife and I hate her.

So Lets get into this.

My son is born. Things are okay between my parents and us at first, but my wife and I started to notice that while visiting my son, my mom was constantly taking pictures. Like...90% of the time she was there she would take pictures. The other 10% she spent creating Facebook posts about how she ""had the best day with her grandson"" with all of the pictures she took. My parents would come over like once a week for an hour or so. That was it. But she always made these elaborate posts. It seemed REALLY fake and it pissed us off. We tried to just let it go. Hey, if she wants to be fake, be fake. It was annoying, but we tried to get past it. Maybe she was just super excited to be a grandmother. Whatever. We would send her updates from all his doctor appointments and she would immediately post them on Facebook. So we stopped giving her info unprompted. Then she started asking for it. So we gave it to her. Again. Immediately posted. 

At this point, we are pretty annoyed by all this and our son is only like 5 months old. For the next 3 months, my mom and dad would visit once a week/every other week for an hour or two. STILL taking pictures like 90% of the time they were there. My mom would yell at my dad for playing with him because he was ""ruining her shot"" which made me really mad. Like, you are going to discourage him from having a fun, healthy relationship with his grandson because you need a picture for Facebook? foh. 

After a very frustrating Christmas with them, I finally snapped. I texted my dad (who I've always had a good relationship with) and basically just told him ""this is pissing me off. its excessive. it needs to stop."" He told me he didnt understand what the issue was, but would try his best. A week later, they came over again and I swear, it was worse than ever before. Neither of them put their phones down. So I stewed the whole time they were there. Not the best idea, but I decided to call my dad that night and I was kind of an asshole. Told him he disrespected me and that I wanted to smack the phone out of his hand. He told me he'd talk tomorrow, that he didn't mention to my mom what I told him. I got nothing else from him. I texted him and told him to tell my mom that the pictures need to calm down. No exceptions. 

Next day, my wife and I got a series of rude texts from my mom including a text directed at my wife that was like 2 pages long where she called her ""selfish"", ""narcissistic"", ""self obsessed"", ""that her makeup is clogging her brain"" and that she ""poses like a Kardashian just to get likes"". She also added that even if she doesnt ""earn our respect, she deserves it cause she is the matriarch of our family.""

Now, I know you all don't know my wife. She isnt any of those things. Not even close. I can honestly, truly say that. 

Info on my Mom though: 

My mom and I have a very rocky past. She told me I was the reason she attempted suicide (she drank half a bottle of gin in like 2 hours...no pills. Just alcohol). She once told me I could ""move out or give me her car"" the day after I got a job that I NEEDED a car for. It was literally in the job description. She has also written similar notes/texts to her sister and ex-best friend as well as aired her grievances with my brother at a family Xmas party when I was very young.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I told my mom she was not allowed over and that we dont ever want to see her again. I told my dad he's allowed to come by to see his grandson whenever he wants, but she is not allowed near us. I blocked her number. I have refused all contact with her and now my dad hasn't spoken to my wife or I in about 3 weeks. Which is very odd since we used to talk daily.

649,"So I rarely go on nights out - and when I do I usually always have work the next day so never stay out any later than 1am. 
So this weekend it’s my friends birthday and she wants to go out clubbing on the Saturday. I said yes and she asked if she could stay at mine that night as she doesn’t want to get a taxi back to her house by herself and the taxi to mine is a lot cheaper than to hers. It will just be the two of us going out as all of our friends are back at uni. I asked my mum if she could stay and my mum said yes, but I’d have to ask my sister as well, as I share a room with her. 
I never wake my sister up when I come in - I take off my makeup and get changed in the downstairs bathroom and so when I go up to bed I’m as quiet as possible (Also - my dad sleep walks and so it’s just not an option for us to stay on the sofa downstairs). 
So I asked my sister and she said no. Confused, I asked her why not? And her reply was (this sounds like a joke, but this is actually how ridiculous my older sister - who is 25 years old - is) “because I like to fart in my sleep and don’t want people here, it’s just annoying”. I was just dumbstruck, and I just asked why again. “I don’t want you to wake me up”, I explained that I have never woken her when I’ve come in, and that the latest we would come in is 1am as I have work in the morning. And she knows my friends isn’t a heavy drinker, so she knows full well that we won’t come stumbling in being loud.
She said she would pick me up at 2am at the latest so my friend wouldn’t stay, but the last time she said she would do that, I rang her and text her and she woke up, and just ignored my messages so I had to wait until 4am to get a taxi because she was too lazy to adhere to her promise. 
Basically, I just don’t know how to deal with her! I’m considering just letting my friend stay and just ignoring her but she will undoubtably flip her shit. (Also I cant go back to my friends house as I have work in the morning and neither of us can drive, and her mum/sister won’t pick us up - basically the only option to allow us to go out - for the first time in months - is to stay at my house). Any advice is welcome. Thanks.",06Feb2019,1
650,"I'm a college sophomore, and in one of my biology laboratory courses I work at a table 5 other students. We're split into 2 groups of 3, but we all share the same table and (ideally) collaborate regardless of group status.

My group has a girl that's on the spectrum (I'll call her M), and she's prone to getting distracted from the experiment, getting anxious about the chemicals, and lacking the ability to pick up on social cues from the professor or other group members. We're in the same major, so over the last 2 years I've really gotten to know and appreciate her. Whenever she gets nervous in lab, I'm usually prepared to let her know everything's alright and meet her with the patience and support that she needs in that moment. We're friends! So it made sense when she sat next to me on the first day of lab. However, the table we were at was with this one girl (R) who seems constantly bothered by what my friend does. R always looks to her friend and laughs when M says something odd, or rolls her eyes and groans to herself when M asks a question without raising her hand. Whenever M tries to join in on R's conversation, or even asks her a question about the lab, R literally just shuts her out and completely ignores her question. I just met R this year but I've already grown to dislike her just because of her constant comments of how she already understands all the material, and her condescension towards classmates who seems to struggle with this material. 

Understandably if you don't know M, her actions seem really strange. But even so, it doesn't make sense that R is just constantly making comments to her friend and laughing about how weird they think M is. It's been making me really angry, and I've wanted to just call her out in the middle of lab. M never seems to pick up on what R is doing, and she usually lets me know when she's anxious so I honestly don't think she's even noticed whats happening. I want to tell R that her animosity towards M is more of a disturbance than the actions she laughs at, and it's making lab an even more stressful event.

~~ALSO I'M UPSETTI THAT SHE KEEPS BEING MEAN AND ITS STRESSIN ME OUT~~

What do I do about this situation? Do I talk to R after class? Should I email R? Do I reach out to a professor? I'm worried that if I try to speak to R directly she'll give me some severe backlash, and if I email her she'll think I'm cowardly for not speaking to her face-to-face and ignore my comment. I know what I want to say and how to say it in polite way, but I'm nervous about her reaction. 

I know I have to reach out to R and let her know what she's doing is wrong, but I genuinely don't know how to navigate doing that with someone like her. Any advice?",06Feb2019,1
651,"Long story short, I'm looking for a new job. My current one is fine, and it pays the bills, but I don't want to stay there forever. I was recently offered a different job, but it's not exactly what I was hoping for. This new job would require me to tour, like a roadie. I'd be on the road for about half the year; sleeping and living on a bus, showering at the venues, and going city to city. It sounds fun, and pays well, but I don't think I'd be happy. I recently got engaged, and we live with our fur babies, and I don't want to put any pressure on our relationship. My whole life is here. I just don't know whether I should stay with my family, or go after my career. In the long run, this would help both. We could get a house and put money away. But I don't want to do it just for the money. 
I think I already know what I'm going to do, but I could use some other opinions and some advice. ",06Feb2019,1
652,"All my life I’ve bumped heads with my dad. He is super stubborn and won’t listen to anyone’s perspective/ideas unless they align with his beliefs. 

Here’s my current situation. I’m 23 and graduated from university, have a Kinesiology degree, am already working in my field with a couple of jobs (that I unfortunately don’t like). A few months ago I moved in with my boyfriend whom I’ve been with for a couple of years. We are super committed and we are actively pursuing a future together, everything is great and going for us. 

Moving in with my boyfriend was an absolute nightmare in terms of telling my parents. My father argued it and said it was “the worst decision of my life”, telling me I couldn’t afford it and that I should be using my money to repay my loans instead of wasting it on rent, that I’m not married to this guy and there’s “no commitment” in his eyes between us, that we’re rushing things, etc. He also told me that I will fail and that will come back crawling and with no money. Well fast forward 6+ months later, not only am I able to pay rent and my loans just fine, I have no issues with having little money and can generally afford to buy things for myself every now and then. 

My boyfriend has been trying to find work in his field. He is an engineer and it is very difficult to get your first job in this field unless you’re lucky enough to have family/friends who can get you in. His parents are both engineers and have recently offered my boyfriend to go work with them back in his hometown. Only issue is that it’s about 3 hours away from where we’re currently living. We also live in the same city my parents live in. 

At first we were skeptical of the idea, but it’s a great opportunity for him not only to get experience and start his career, but the job pays very well too. There is a possibility that I get a job there as well, being a small town, there’s a lot of clinics and retirement homes, places that are suitable for my field as well. 

Mentioning the idea to my friends, and my mother, they all think it’s a good idea and makes sense. My father is a different story. He thinks it’s a terrible idea and I need to stay here working (even though I hate my current jobs and he knows this) and my boyfriend goes over there, which makes no sense if you’re in a relationship. Also, despite him never being to this area he apparently “knows” there’s nothing for me out there and that I will have no chance of being successful. He gives me no chance to speak my mind, or asks any details as to what could be there for me, just immediately assumes that there is nothing for me. 

This situation is terribly stressful, considering everyone I’ve told so far says it’s a great idea but he gives no support. It really hurts because this is my own father, someone who should be supporting me, not shutting me down every single time and telling me I’m going to fail. It hurts even more because my boyfriend’s parents are incredibly supportive and have offered us financial support if needed to get started in this far away town (my father gets angry at this, but it seems he is jealous). I also love my boyfriend very much and are already thinking of getting engaged this year, so there is no way we're moving without each other. 

Any thoughts on this situation? How do I cope? Is there anything I can do to change my father’s mind or is he forever going to be a closed-minded person, and I just have to accept the way he is? ",06Feb2019,1

654,"Okay, I'm a freshly turned 16 y/o girl, and my parents and I have some trust issues. Some are because I actually did fuck up, but some are because they're crazy (but then again I'm 16 so my judgment may be a little flawed.)  
My parents are also split, but they still talk and manage my sister and me together. I live with my mom and see my dad on weekends.  
I'm a very casual weed smoker. Like once a month, max, because I can never find the right place and time. My parents aren't strict but drugs are a big no-no. I've only ever smoked, and never got really high.  
I wanted to get high easier, so I asked around to find someone with edibles. Well, a girl at my school had them. Looking back, the decision was stupid, but I bought 6 cookies with 1.5 each. I'm upset I bought so many at once because now they're harder to hide.  
I had to stay for a club after school, and my mom was a bit late picking me up. I ate like half a cookie (I knew it was too much, and it's a rookie mistake.) Everything was fine until we got home.  
I had the fridge open, and I remember when it first hit me. I was HIGH-high. Like out of my mind. I saw my childhood and convinced myself I was dreaming like 5 times in 30 seconds. It would've been fun if my mom wasn't standing in front of me freaking out. It was higher than I had ever been. My mom truly saw me at my worst state.  
She could tell right away, and in my random talking, I told her I ate a cookie. She had me lie down in bed, and after a while, I fell asleep.  
I bought the cookies and had the whole situation happen Monday. Today is Wednesday. She came to me and said ""We're going to talk about it. Bring it up when you're ready."" (which means ""do it asap or I bring it up myself"")  
What I'm looking for is advice on my apology. I want to be sincere with my mom.  


Writing this out and reading over the story has already helped me very much. Please send advice for anything you can think of, from what points to tell my mom/ dad, how to rebuild trust, or just ways to help mask the insanely strong weed smell that now exists in my room.

I tried a million of times just sitting down, and trying to study to prepare for an important test, or to do some exercise, but as soon as I do well for at least one single day, I lose all my dedication for the next several weeks. I keep finding excuses to not exercise, or skip homework. Like, ""today is *whatever* so I can't study/exercise"". And then again, I keep telling myself ""okay, so starting with tomorrow, I'll be a better person. I'll study, and exercise to lose weight, take care of myself etc"" but then when the day comes I just say fuck it and don't do anything.

And that’s when the joke was made because someone made mention about the missing Asian data. 

So when he said “Asian lives matter,” most of the class busted out laughing (including myself). 

Next class he makes a public apology and the only black person in our class gets up and addresses the whole class about how it was wrong, yada yada and she was hurt. 

I kind of feel like I owe an apology. But at the same time it won’t be genuine. I laughed because I instinctively thought it was funny. And I still do. I’m not racist and I would have laughed if it was about any other race as well.

Now today we went to my psychiatrist, and my mother decided to schedule an appointment for my sister, and I heard a very important detail about my sister.

I learned she’s been stalling to get to school, and yet the doctors believe she has anxiety and this is because of stress.

Now here’s the thing. I don’t think she’d avoid going to school if it was stress, and that school is not even remotely stressful. It isn’t what I’d do at least.

I’ve theorized it’s bullying or sexual harassment, the kids there aren’t exactly angels, but I don’t know because she never tells my family anything.

1. Micromanaging: He HAS To be involved in everything even if he is messing it up. 
2. No formal Hierarchy: He refuses to to give out titles on the basis that everybody at the company is ""equal"".
3. Not a good listener: If you are having  a problem with something or somebody, he will NOT get involved. He will tell you to figure it and stop bugging him because he is making money.
4. Quick to hire: He will hire people on the spot based on appearances, many people he hires do not have the skills for the job. Warehouse workers with no certifications, and various people in positions of power with no formal training.

Ok now we need to talk about Maddie 

&amp;#x200B;

Maddie: 

Since arriving she has openly flirted (as in electronic proof, texts, skype, etc.)  12 of the guys in the building claiming she ""wants to be serious"" and when the guys agree, she stops them saying ""she wants to take things slow"". However, she will keep flirting and giving signals that she wants to hookup. T shirts that say flirt, revealing cleavage, etc. One guy in particular she went to his house,  off work hours, and (according to her) was terrified that she would get raped. She told us what had happened the following day at work insisting that she never wants to be alone with him. This same week, me and a co worker caught her in the dark by herself outside in the guys car. She also frequently smokes with him contradicting her previous story of her being scared. He openly says things like ""I'm going to fuck you"" ""we are gonna have sex"" and physically pulls her towards his desk area. She always says ""no"" and ""That will never happen"" and he replies with ""yes it will"". At this point our conclusion is that she likes attention. However, when it really got weird was she declared herself ""HR"" on her own accord, and starting handing out paperwork to complain about other employees. This form asked you to name the people involved in which SHE sees all the complaints from people. If our boss received a form of complaint, he would rip it up and say ""idc figure it out"". Now fast forward a few days, she tells us she really cant stand the guy hitting on her, and told us she will write him up AND us for even knowing about it. I told her she was power tripping and she got defensive and angry. The following week she was talking in private about dating our newest employee. Their time must've been bad because the following work week she talked about how its over, (within a matter of 3 days). Now I want to talk about my relationship with her. Her messages to me were super personal, basically telling me shes in love with me. When I told her its not a good idea she spent (and still spends) a ton of time texting me telling me I hate her and crying (tears) in my office to get me to talk to her. The boss has been slowly merging her into our department and all she does is hand over her work. If I get stern with her, she tells everybody I'm a bully and that I need to ""calm down"".   


The question I have is HOW DO WE GET RID OF HER?",06Feb2019,1
669,"*Throwaway

Ok so as the title says, I'm looking for the best way to deal with this situation. My fiance and I are getting married in the fall and we are both from super big families on both parents sides. We both agree we want a small wedding because we are very low key and just want a nice day adventure and courthouse type thing. 

Basically to cut to the chase, we only want our immediate family, his best friend and I want 2 aunt's and 1 uncle from my mom's side. They are my favorite, I'm really close with them out of everyone. When some other aunt's/uncles/cousins find out they will be judgy as fuck and it will be awkward at all the gatherings. 

I give 0 shits about what they think but a) how to respond to comments in a nice way? I'm fine with saying ""I just didn't want to"" but I'm also down to keep the peace at our 2-3 times a year gatherings. And b) how do I announce that we are getting married? I feel it would be tacky to have them find out on Instagram after the fact or something....but do I send out a card? Or an email? ""I am getting married but just wanted to let you know that's all"". Do I send it before or after we get married? 

Any advice would be appreciated! ",06Feb2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

I am a college student and last night I went to a party and the theme necessitated bringing a date. I brought a girl I was interested in, who I had met a few days prior. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we get to the party and we down a lot of alcohol. I am not going to use alcohol as an excuse which is why I am asking for help from this community. To make a long story short, we were getting touchy feeling on the dance floor and I went in for the kiss. At this point, I do not remember much about the night.  She (obviously) did not feel the same way and the story gets very hazy. She went away from me, and had her friends block me. Reflecting back on this sober, she did the textbook move to get away from a predator. Drunk me, apparently very stupid, kept trying to get to her and I do remember her crying at some point. She left with her friends and we have not talked since. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am looking for advice on how to change myself, not salvage the relationship. As someone with a lot of sisters, and someone who calls themselves a feminist, I feel like the biggest hypocrite. I violated her body and what I thought was my moral code. I call rapists and sexual predators monsters but now i feel like one. Essentially, I am just confused on how drunk me acted to oppositely to how sober me thinks and acts. I feel disgusted by myself and don't know what to do. I feel so bad for her and what she had to go through. I don't want to reach out and make things worse for her so basically just please help.

So, management threatened to start doing something like poo prints and charging for each offense. That was months ago and they haven’t started yet. For a while, I think people were afraid of it and they were cleaning up. Lately, many haven’t been.

Anyway, bf and I still picking up our dog’s poop. However, we had one neighbor text him asking if he’d been picking it up (immediately after he’d taken her out to potty). They said they didn’t want to go to management about it but they would if needed. Then, last night he took her out and caught the same neighbor looking out the window at him and another had casually come out right after he noticed that. The second neighbor lives across from the first two and works with management. They were watching him but he’s not doing anything wrong!

&amp;#x200B;

My coworker, Sally (fake name), was hired in March 2018.  5 months later in August, she started taking on some responsibilities from my department - only 2 tasks.  One takes about 5 minutes per transaction, and we average about 10 transactions per day with those.  The other takes a maximum of an hour to do.  The other 6 hours of her shift, she's supposed to be doing her usual responsibilities in her own department.  What she does, I have no idea, since it seems like she's learned nothing in the past 11 months she's been here.

&amp;#x200B;

The knowledge she should have gained from her department in the first 5 months translates directly to these 2 new tasks in my department.  She's processing incoming and outgoing funds in our bank accounts.  The only thing that needs some training on is the different platforms we use.  The rules that we follow when processing these transactions are the same.  When I first had to train her, I thought I just had to show her the new platform, same as when I first started.  Nope, I basically had to train her from scratch.  When she's 5 months into the job.  Simple things like matching the name that comes in on a deposit to the name we have on file for the account it's going to... somehow that goes over her head.  Bob Smith is not the same as Smith's Popcorn Extraordinaire, LLC., but that looks OK to put into the account in her eyes apparently.

&amp;#x200B;

Working with her has been mildly infuriating to say the least.  Every day she has questions about things that I've either answered time and time again, or I've already sent her a tutorial on it and she could reference it on her own.  At no point does it seem like she does any sort of critical thinking based on what she's learned so far.  It'd be one thing for her to ask me ""I have this situation, would this be the right course of action?  I wanted to check with you first before I do anything in case I remembered it wrong.""  That'd would at least show me that she's TRYING.  But that's not the case.  Every time she comes onto a roadblock, she sends me the account # and just asks ""What do I do?""  I've tried turning it back on her, asking her ""Well, what do you think is the best way to handle this?""  Trying to get her to think for once because I KNOW it's something that we've either gone over or she's should have been doing in the first 5 months she's been here.  But it never goes anywhere and it just leaves me more frustrated, so I just go and give her the answer.  I have my own work to do, I don't have time to babysit.

&amp;#x200B;

It's now getting to a point where I'm starting to resent her, which I feel horrible about.  Outside of work, she's very nice - albeit a bit of... I don't know... like the type of girl you'd imagine was part of the popular clique in high school (she tried to give all the female employees trendy nicknames, wanted a dress up theme for Halloween for all the girls, took the responsibility of sending out invite emails for after-work drinks, getting all the girls to wear pink on Wednesdays - seriously...).  Very outgoing, outspoken, and carefree - but you start to question her IQ at times.  Which baffles me because she's a doctor.  Like her resume said Sally Sparrow, M.D. (not her real name, obviously).  What she's doing in this company making $35k is beyond me, but not my place to judge that.  What I am judgmental about is that she went through medical school, but apparently matching names and basic math is not in her repertoire.

&amp;#x200B;

She also has a very hands-off approach to everything.  For example, I was sitting with her walking her through one of the tasks, and I mentioned something that I didn't write down in the tutorial I gave her, and she goes ""Oh, can you update the tutorial with what you just said and send it to me?""  I wanted to be like ""...can you take notes?""

&amp;#x200B;

She gets an email about one of the transactions she did, and asks me about it.  I explain the situation to her in detail, and she goes ""Can you respond to her email, then?""

&amp;#x200B;

She was having technical difficulties with one of the programs we use that relates only with one of her tasks.  I'm messaging IT about it, emailing my supervisor, and trying to get my own work done at the same time.  In the middle of doing something, IT asks me if we're still experiencing the error.  I message Sally to ask her to try logging back into the platform and see if the same error appears.  Her response: ""I'm waiting for Debra to let me know if there's still an error when they process their batch.""  Debra didn't need to process their stuff for another 2 hours.  And I KNOW Sally wasn't busy at that time.  I was exasperated and just checked for myself.  All she needed to do was log in, and type in 3 letters.  That's it.

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke with her supervisor casually about my frustrations (we're friends outside of work), and her supervisor pulled up Sally's stats... she's processed a total of about 100 transactions since May.  I was able to do that in 1 day when I was in their department.  I don't know if her supervisor has done anything about it, I don't know if her performance has improved at all in their department, it certainly hasn't in mine.  I just came back from vacation, Sally and my other co-worker (been with the company for 9 years, he knows what he's doing) covered for me for 4 working days, and I'm still cleaning up specifically her mess.

&amp;#x200B;

My situation now is I'm going on maternity leave in about 3 months.  She's supposed to be my replacement while I'm gone.  I've been slowly teaching her about the other tasks that I do, but I don't have the confidence that she'll grasp it.  Do I go harder with the training?  If so, what more can I do?  I'm letting her watch me do the tasks, then letting her take control while I shadow her, then leaving her on her own with written tutorials on the tasks.  I'm making sure I answer any and all questions she has along the way.  The only thing I haven't done is build a freaking robot to do her job for her.  Please help, I'm at my wit's end and time is running out.",06Feb2019,1
678,"Next to my bed, in the corner of this apartmeny, I have two a wooden chest with drawers, and in front of that, a Rubbermaid version of the same thing. The pitiful contents of my life are kept in those. Vital documents in the rubbermaid, and things I should not have in the one i intentionally made difficult to access, and needs to be opened to inspect. It is important to know that there really is no reason for anyone, including myself, to be back in that corner, getting to that chest. My mom is not stupid. Cutting up rocks is not quit operation, nor is snorting or smoking. 

The first thing I noticed when I got home on Monday night, was how the top drawer of my wooden chest was open enough for me to clearly see what I already knew was in there, which was a plate, a straw, and a few almost empty bags of my drug of choice. I do not take the time to shut that drawer perfectly every time, but I definitely would not have left it open so wide, without me there to close it if I needed to. The top drawer on the rubbermaid was also open wider than I had left it, and the first thing anyone would see when they open it, is a little stack of little bags I keep for the shake. At the time I thought i had just been too careless, and then i got high and forgot about it.

I spoke with my manager about possibly matching the wage of the other job so I could stay and the answer was a simple no. I worked here for 6months without a single mention of being a bad employee or ever being reprimanded for doing something wrong. Fast forward to the quitting evening. It was a Saturday night (busiest night of the week like really busy) and lucky me I got stuck with a new kid. This kid didn't know how to use the cash register properly (given it is a fairly confusing system) it was only his second shift. So during a constant rush (abt 2 hours long) I had to teach him as we went. It got to the point where a customer wanted a shake and we were out of clean blenders so I ran to grab one from the back that was sanitizing. I made the shake and we finished the rush. Then the owner and the manager and asst manager came into the store. The owner confronted me about how it was not a ""wise choice"" to grab the dish from the back as well as ""we trust you to be a leader you need to act like one"" I am working minimum wage and have never been given the responsibility or freedom you would expect a ""leader"" to have. I told him to read the letter on his desk (nicely) and I am confronted with ""its a wise choice you are leaving you are not cut out for this type of work it is too fast paced for you wouldn't you agree?"" I don't respond and again in a louder tone ""wouldn't you agree?"" i said I guess and then he left. I was so mad I wanted to leave. Knowing how they treat their employees (terribly. Staff consists of family me (6months) another kid (4months) and 3 new people (2weeks) that's it) I didnt want to leave they would probably leave new kid alone. I then get a text to leave my closing key on their desk and that is my last day. I finished up. Earlier I spoke with Asst manager that my check was short (50$ short specifically) and he said their system messed up and they would ""figure it out"" (3rd time it messed up) so I took my clock out receipts and clock out times and figured how much they owe me on my next check and how many hours I missed and texted them my findings.

What I’m confused about is why the interviewer was so mad that I answered the question “yes, I’m 19.” She didn’t ask me my age, I offered it, and being young I like to provide my age in case there a still certain limitations involved. I can’t rent a car yet so maybe I can’t handle certain machines in the store or something idk. I try to be as open as I can in interviews. I just found it so strange that she was actually upset with me at providing my age and I can’t figure out why.

We have practically lived together our whole entire relationship so nothing really would change other than convenience... with his two roommates (20M and 21M). 

I don’t question us moving in together one bit, but the roommate situation makes me nervous. When I was single I lived with a couple and it ended in disaster and majorly affected our friendships. 

The roommate that purchased the house last fall was nice enough to give us the master bedroom downstairs (we had already discussed me possibly moving in at this time) with its own bathroom where the other two bedrooms and one bathroom are upstairs so we have our own little space which is amazing and much appreciated. With that I still feel somewhat uneasy when I stay there. The house is in constant disarray with half drank beers, dirty socks on the couch, a kitchen sink that is always overflowing with dirty day-old dishes. Also the one roommate decided to rescue a dog and does not train or really pay attention to the dog. My boyfriend and the other roommate (and myself when I’m there) find ourselves taking care of the dog and listening to it’s constant whimpering. I have a rescue and have rescued dogs before so I have no issue with helping but it’s extremely frustrating when his roommate sits in his room streaming on Twitch while he is home and his dog sits on the couch downstairs crying. The house is always quiet and they never throw parties and they are very respectful of our space and my sleep schedule so I never feel the way I did in my previous roommate situation (I work crazy hours switching from nights to days).

Obviously this sounds like a ton of negatives, but honestly I am friends with his roommates and I can’t wait to officially live with my boyfriend. Not to mention saving $500-600 per month would really help. I have lived on my own for a while and I see myself stuck in having everything my way (I’m a bit of a neat freak) but I would be willing to stick it out to save money. I do not want to renew my lease and I would hate to ask my boyfriend to get a place just us two when he already made a commitment just because I am nervous about the possibility of it affecting his friendships, let alone our relationship.

Context: student in university, currently live with one roommate in a two bedroom apartment. She’s clean, I’m clean, we’re not necessarily friends but merely comfortable living with each other with pleasantries here and there etc.

Essentially I have been given the option to:

1- stay in the same apartment I am living in right now costing me $635 plus utilities (most of the time I’m paying a total of $700-715/month).
It’s pretty close to my school, about a 30 minute walk and 10 minute bus drive. I like it here but I feel isolated from everyone I guess but mostly just “comfortable” and maybe even bored of it sometimes.

2- I’ve been offered to live with 4 other people in a 5 bedroom house. I’ve never lived in an environment like such and it seems exciting to me but I cannot tell if I’m just curious or if it’s a bad idea to live with a ton of people I only slightly know. This house is $480 plus utilities which is exceptionally cheaper. However, the commute is longer. About 30-40 minutes total taking a bus to the train then train to school. This option entices me but I don’t want to make the wrong decision and regret it later.

Should I try living with a bunch of people as a life experience thing? Or should I just stay where I am for the next school year because it’s securely comfortable living?

695,"To summarize I work within a large importer and distributor of wholesale goods. I work within the transport department, I joined January last year as a temp admin assistant and got a permanent role in March dealing with our exports to europe, I have progressed well within the role personally saving the company £300k on freight costs.

To describe my boss (call him A) he is a white male late 50s and is the transport ""manager"" (I say this as he can barely run the department, he roughly understands but cannot do the simplest of things. He will offer to help out but it's always empty as he doesn't know how to do anything, you can tell him but you might as well speak to a brick wall.) He has increasingly become overbearing, constantly checking up on me and questioning my work to the point it was not making me want to work there, making me emotionally upset. He once tried to send me home for having an ""attitude"" which I was extremely upset by, I went directly to his boss (call him B) and managed to mellow the issue as it was unreasonable and carried on working that day. I should mention I'm early 20s and female, the rest of the department is 3 other males 30, and 42-50 ish. 

As above I have progressed well within the role and completed transformed our export process, but found out that A tried to stop me from getting a payrise for my hard work, B however overid his decision. Since the previous incident I have approached B again to address the issue of how I feel suffocated by him, and said how I wanted to move into another section of the office to get away from him, I had to do this whilst A was off work otherwise I would have been questioned about why I was speaking to B. He understood and said his eventually aim to get me away from A, this was before Christmas.

However cue some company changes, B received promotion to oversee all departments therefore a position is vacant, this is filled by a previous supervisor (Call him C). C has been learning about A's department as part of his new role however A has just been bitching and moaning about how C should never have got the job etc.l and getting frustrated when C is asking question's all the time. 

Anytime A is in a bad mood because of C it feels like it is being taken out on me, I feel this is because I am the ""weakest"" being female and youngest, A's power feels threatened and so A has to exert his authority somewhere to feed his ego?! 

Anyways I'm miserable at work at the minute, in terms of moving departments I am 90% sure it's happening as I have had meetinga to discuss this however as B is recently been promoted there is a lot of work to be dealt with and it's not something  that is happening with immediate effect, personally I just want to get out of transport asap and so I can begin working on a new project and show my value before April (when salaries are looked at.)

I have decided I will at least stay at the company until April however I am losing time everyday to prove my worth even more so.

How do I cope with my current boss who seems to be making my working life hell (can give more examples if needed, i.e shouting at me in a cupboard telling me no one is indisposable)

Advice needed please? (Just a note is I do not want to put in a complaint etc and we don't have a HR department) 

Thanks!

696,"I dropped out of school three years ago and came back this year. I am an accounting student where your GPA actually matters a lot when finding a job in big public accounting firms. 

Well, my overall GPA is handicapped from my terrible grades that I received three years ago. So to overcome that somewhat and have a ""wow"" factor on my resume, I set my heart on getting the scholarship for achieving the highest GPA among first year accounting students. 

My second semester just started and I am experiencing a ton of stress over this goal. I believe I am currently in the top 3 so I have a very good shot at the scholarship if I do well in this semester. But this means that every mark I lose from a perfect 100 feels like a stab in the heart. Even if I get a 94 on a test, I am not happy that I got a 94. I am sad that i lost 6% that i could have potentially earned. I make a silly mistake on a test or assignment and I am agonizing over it for the next two days. 

This is driving me insane. I feel like it will be better for my health to stop focusing on that scholarship and just do my best and be happy with the result. But I also feel like that's would be just giving up a personal goal that I've set for myself. 

Any thoughts/advice? ",06Feb2019,1
697,"I and a classmate have been sleeping around for few months now. She had earlier mentioned that she was in a long distance relationship that wasn'working. (That guy got her pregnant before moving away couple of years ago. She had to go through the traumatic phase of abortion alone.)

Before we agreed to sleep together, she mad it clear that it was not working anymore between the two of them. I strictly wanted us to be FWB.

However, tonight, she started crying all of a sudden and wanted me to pull out and stop midway. I felt very strange but said nothing. As we went to bed, I asked if she was still seeing the other guy and she nodded in agreement.

I was taken aback because she was practically cheating on that guy with me.  I said ""if you're with that guy, you shouldn't be here. It's not that I'm emotionally attached to you or in love with you, but what we're doing right now is cheating that guy."". And she left.

I use body wash, I have a separate bar soap for my face.

my parents and siblings cannot smell it at all, I cannot smell my self, I assume this is because we're all used to the smell.

but here i am. i learned that it’s all the same shit no matter what route you take. at least if you want to make money the “safe” way.

Since then, he walks up to me every class and asks me for help (even though I am of no help and I tell him to ask the teacher everytime) or questions about myself (how old am I, where am I from, etc).. it has definitely been annoying to get my work done when this happens multiple times a class, but I'm afraid to be rude because he seems to have some sort of autism or mental disorder. He talks to himself as if there are some vocal tics and despite me asking politely to be left alone, he was keep coming back as if he forgot I asked to be left alone. Last class when I left because he was bothering me, I get to my car and see him watching me across the parking lot (which means he clearly followed me because he was not about to leave when I quickly walked out of class)

Things got even scarier today when he sat next to me (in a nearly empty class with dozens of seats), leaned in and whispered ""have you ever heard of the zodiac killer?"". Part of me thought this was because I mentioned I'm from the Bay, but when I asked him why he asked, he laughed and turned away.

Here's the set up.  I've got a collection of some really good mutual friends.  We're all in our 30s, married, professional careers, have known each other a long time, all in the same fantasy leagues  etc.   Typical set up.  

It has come to pass that one of the buddies has been having an affair with the wife of another buddy.  Here's a breakdown explaining who was married and who was banging on the side:

* Ted + Bridgette = Married
* John + Megan = Married 
* Ted + Megan = Banging
* Ted + Bridgette + John + Megan = Friends

Everyone finds out today through, of course, text messages and pictures.  Those details aren't super important.  However, Megan has admitted to the physical affair, and Ted has denied anything physical happened.  Ted is most likely lying.  Like a 99.9% chance he's lying.  

This is where advice would be helpful.  It's tough for me to just completely cut Ted out of my life.  I'm just not that type of person.  Same goes for my wife and Megan, who were close friends (I'm okay cutting Megan out.  Unrelated drama stuff in the past).  When the time is right, I want to be able to sit down with Ted and hear his side of the story.  Maybe there's something there that is mitigating?  I don't believe that the worst day in a person's life has to be the definition of that person for eternity.  However, I don't have infinite patience and forgiveness either.

Right now, the group of friends (it's much larger than these four people) is focused on making sure Bridgette and John are okay and being comforted.

We started having late night calls regularly, started watching movies and it was all so fun. We admitted to having feelings for eachother, and we both kept talking. Every time I didn't have anyone to talk to she was there. She showed me more emotional affection than my ex ever could have and I was so happy. Then Monday night, we were having a late night call, she asks me, ""If something happened to me, what would you do?"" and then ""If something happened to me would you move on?"" and I said I would try. I didn't really give it a second thought and I seriously regret it. Then we said our goodnights and the next morning I saw a message from her at 4:53 A.M. going on about how shes sorry she has to go like this, and its for the best. She also said that she wants me to move on and to find somebody better and that she loves me so much, and if there is an afterlife, she will be watching me. I asked her friend I had added on discord and she said that it was true and she was found dead in her room. I don't know how she commited suicide, or when she did.

So my father has taken my only ways of releasing stress away from me, my Xbox, switch, laptop, phone (I'm writing this while he and my mom are not home, I know where he hides my phone), and TV/Netflix. He even took my wallet, now I just carry my drivers license when I need to drive to school or work.

My grades went down because I've been avoiding homework. I feel horrible whenever I do homework, I break down, I feel the time just ticking away, it makes me hate myself and I see how truly unintelligent I am. It almost brings me to tears every night. And my only way of releasing these feelings is by playing some games with my good friends.

So on the 4th of February my teachers pile a huge workload on me and I get stressed out like usual. So I hold myself together till the school day ends. And when I finally get home, all I want to do is go and play the new BR game Apex Legends by respawn entertainment. And I find that my dad has taken my Xbox controllers, I also see that my laptop and switch are missing (he took my phone when he got home later). I freaked out and felt like punching a wall (I almost did, I winded up and everything) and I start uttering profanities. My father has taken away my only way of releasing stress and anger.

By the time he got home I had finished my homework and asked him if I could have my stuff back. Of course he said no. He said that he would give it back when he saw fit.

Now almost 3 days later I've gotten all my grades up as much as I possibly can, but I still only have high to low B's. So I just asked him an hour ago and he said no. I don't know what to do. There is no end in sight and these last few days have been depressing and sad, all I do is go to school, do homework and then go work at Subway for 5-6 hours.

I've been trying to raise my grades, but my school is just adding more and more work, it's so hard to catch up on the work I avoided and keep up with all the new work. My grades are going up slowly but surely, it'll take weeks before they are at his standards again.

I'm depressed, I'm uninspired, I'm bored, I'm sad, I have no contact with friends (I don't have any friends in my classes, we don't even pass each other in the halls), I just want to play Apex Legends and For Honor with my friends.

How do I get past this, how do I entertainment myself for the next few weeks, how can I reason with my dad. Any advise is welcome. Thanks.
