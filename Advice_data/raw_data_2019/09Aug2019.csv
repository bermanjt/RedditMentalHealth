1,"(Sorry if I make mistakes, English is my second language and this is my first Reddit post.)

Today I went to a thrift store (similar to a Canadian version of Goodwill but very small) with my mom. This is a pretty poor neighborhood and a lot of people are homeless in the city where I live so once in a while, people can come up to you to ask for money. I was finished shopping so I waited outside for my mom to come out, and this lady (I think she is in her 60s) came up to me with this very cute dog. Naturally, I asked if I could pet her dog and she said yes. We talked a bit and she was nice, and at one point she asked me if I had money because hadn't eaten in three days. I got my wallet out and gave her five dollars. She thanked me and told me I could visit her if I wanted and gave me her address. I was happy about that interaction but when I told my mom later she was mad at me for giving so much money to a stranger, saying things like ''she's going to buy heroin'' and that I'm naive and stuff like that and I ended up feeling bad about what I thought was a good action. (Just to clarify, I'm working and that money was mine, but I know my mom was just trying to protect me)

So now I kinda just want to make cookies to share with this stranger and become friends with her, maybe I could talk my dad into coming with me to meet her but he will probably react like my mom. once again she seems nice and I want to see her dog again, but I feel like this is a pretty dumb idea.",09Aug2019,1
2,"They broke up 4 months ago (she ended things with him), and we started dating three weeks later.

I felt a bit suspicious because he mentions her a lot so I couldn't help myself but ended up snooping his phone.

They've been calling at night. Usually 4-5 hours at a time till 3 am.

He's been telling her in the messages that he still has feelings for her, and that he feels like she's the one. He's also sent topless pictures of himself to her, and that he always thinks about the future with her despite her having not spoken to him in months. He says he thinks about her everyday, and even more so recently since she's been posting pictures of herself on her instagram more frequently, and that her latest picture made him think about ""how much he wanted to fuck her"". He told her he can't picture anything long term with me because I lack ambition and he prefers someone who is driven (she's a dentist, so is he). 

Would this be considered cheating? What do I do?

tl;dr : boyfriend has been telling his ex he still thinks about her all the time and has feelings",09Aug2019,0
3,"So for a bit of context, i'm a 15-year-old male who moved from Dubai to Belgium last year, which means I had to go to a new school and meet new people.

Like I said in the title, i'm tired of getting complimented at school. The compliments usually come in one of two forms:

1- The first form, the more common one, is people calling me smart all the time because I get the best grades in class and know the answer to most of the questions asked by the teachers, even though i'm 1 year younger than everyone. I'll admit I have above average intelligence( which made me skip 1st grade), but they all make it seem like I don't work or study, and that's it's all in my brain. They also say i'm smart because there is such a big difference between us, but the thing is that they don't work at all.

2-The second form of compliments I receive is from girls who call me cute. You can find the story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askteenboys/comments/cnf29r/im_really_confused_about_girls/). What really annoys me here is that I don't know what these girls want or how they feel.

Am I normal? Or am I just too much? Like expecting too much from people?",09Aug2019,1
4,"please help! -texas-

this is NOT one of those sneaky free-standing emergency rooms. the signs all say urgent care. website says urgent care. i specifically asked if they were emergency or urgent care. i specifically asked if they accepted my insurance. they charged me 30$ co-pay (my emergency room copay would be 400$). all signs pointing to urgent care. it went just like any other urgent care i've ever been to. 

a dr comes into the room i've been waiting in, looks into my ear with that pointy thing, says 'yep, ear infection"". sent me home with an antibiotic prescription. 

surprise!!! they want to bill be 1500$. 500$ facility charge. 1000$ professional charge. what?! they say the DO take my insurance, but that this insurance doesn't cover facility charge. i say, what about the professional charge? o, they are some third party company. i call that company and ask. they are not covered by my insurance. there is only one 'code' and it cannot be broken down or explained. the code is just 'office visit'. i explain to both companies how these are emergency room prices, not urgent care. they both tell me that this is typical and customary for them. my insurance company told me i needed to take it up with the urgent care facility. the companies billing me say try to take it up with my insurance company. 

what can i do? this seems very sneaky, predatory, sick and wrong.",09Aug2019,2
5,"My mother does not want me to pursue becoming a cheerleader because she believes it will make me a ""slut"". I do not hold cheerleading to her low expectations, though, as I see it as a fun sport\* that encourages flexibility, charisma, and teamwork. I also want to join it because two of my friends are also joining, so it will be a great way to bond and maybe make new friends with older girls on the team. It made me quite sad when she told me that her daughter could never be a cheerleader, and how influenced she was by outdated stereotypes. I do not fault her for this due to the fact that she comes from an asian country where simply wearing a school girl uniform is considered inherently sexual and taboo.

I still plan to try out despite this, but I am not sure if this is the correct way to do things. I just need advice on how to go about this, and whether or not I should just quit entirely.

\*Not sure if it counts as a sport... But there are national competitions and it can be very difficult and dangerous sometimes so for the most part I consider it one :)",09Aug2019,0
6,"Some quick profile information

22 year old man, lives with divorced dad (dislikes both parents almost equally, isn't comfortable in either of their houses), finished some vocational studies, can't find a job, but also don't want/is scared of it.

My father keeps saying I'm only looking out for myself, as he's the one working (well not this month he doesn't), how I lack empathy and I never leave my room.

And I don't. Barely. I go out of my house once a week this month. A couple days ago to get groceries, and a week and a half earlier to take out the trash. Why would I go out? I live far (45 min, trash bus connections) from my friends back at my hometown (where my mom lives) and I have only one friend here, who I haven't seen since finishing school back in June. He thinks I'm busy, I'm just not in the mood to hang out with him and whoever tags along him. So why would I go out? I could go for a walk. Why? There's nothing better for me to do. Everything's a waste of time. I just spend my day reading, playing videogames, chatting and occasionally watching a film. I wanted to get into game development as a hobby but my computer's not good enough as it's much too old so that's discarded. I don't even have fun playing video games, it's just a time sink.

I could have landed an awful job but I declined it, almost too early because it was too many hours for very little money. Then my dad's all  ""uHhHhG iTs cAllEd wOrK nOt pLeAsUrE"" and playing this ""I work why don't you"" card. I would like to find a suitable job. He doesn't think I'm really job hunting but in truth just yesterday I submitted a CV for a job overseas. Again shit pay but I'd like to move far away from everyone.

My father keeps saying I have an issue and should see a psychologist or something, how I don't speak to him, don't do anything with him... In fact, I do not like him. I don't. I don't spend more time than necessary (having lunch together I guess) and I'm not affectionate. When he says he feels like we are ""roommates"" it's in fact really close of a depiction of it. 

I applied to two schools to continue studying, one I'm 99% not going to enter (several people would need to drop out for me to have a spot) and the other... Is near my mom's, so I could use it as an excuse to move back with her, but I don't want to live there. Weather sucks, my friends don't want to see me (or they would make the effort to come visit when I offer beds), my dogs are dying of old age (I'm very anxious about their upcoming death but they have been so deaf and blind for so long, I don't want to see them euthanised which I'll have to force whenever I see they are in irreversible inhumane pain which might be soon). My mom's back and forth boyfriend, I hate him. He's so loud, makes me feel very uncomfortable around my house. Oh wait, when my mom changed locks after her main door was forced, I asked for a duplicate of the keys, and she said ""it's not my house anymore"" so yeah I'm resentful. to this day, i can't get into my mom's unless she's there. What if I visit and she's at work? I wait at the doorstep for hours? Add it to the pile of reasons I don't visit.

I have a sister, older than me, but she lived abroad in a distant country, so she's both wealthy enough for a woman in her mid-20s, is in a country she fell in love with... She's living the life I couldn't. I dropped out of college as I was depressed and unmotivated. I don't know what I *am* now, I guess indifference is what I feel.

So all things considered, I don't feel like there's much more for me. I won't go to the school I want to keep studying, I can't find a job, I don't go out, I don't enjoy anything, I just want time to pass quickly. I don't know what will become of me. A fully blown neet? Im not sure what to do, or what I need advice on but I know I do and we can't afford an actual professional. This is a dog chasing it's tail really.",09Aug2019,1
7,"Hello all, I'm in a predicament where I cannot make a choice between two jobs.

9,"We've been a christian household for as long as I can remember. My mother is christian, my grandmother was christian, and all my family is christian. My son, is presumabely also a christian. However, yesterday I walked in on him masturbating in his bedroom. I immediately yanked his phone away, and saw that he was watching ""Lesbian teen porn"".  I'm pretty shocked that this would happen. I'm a devout christian and I've been praying all night for this madness to end. I also installed strict porn filters on his iPad and Chromebook. I'm still scared about it though. Still though, why would he commit 2 major sins (Masturbation, homosexuality)? We've been going to church together since he was a toddler. I'm considering taking him to our local preist to see what they can do about this. In the meantime, I've taken away all of his devices. This sunday, hopefully taking him to church will purify him.

10,"To make a long story short, me and a couple friends went to Iceland for the weekend to get away. We went bar hopping and much to my disappointment, I really overestimated my tolerance. Anyway we stop at this one place and this girl tells me to buy her a drink. I do, I show my licenses, I swipe my credit card, we drink, I leave and see on the receipt that I just paid 130 dollars for two drinks.

So, in short, I got played. It sucks but whats more important to me is the fact that after reviewing this place online, it has a reputation for scamming people and not so nice things.. which leaves me very worried because they took my ID and I can't remember if they swiped or scanned it before giving it back to me or if they just looked it over. Also, I swiped my credit card to pay for the drinks.

Some of the hotel receptionist assure me that aside from me getting fucked out of a good bit of money, I shouldn't worry too much about anything they could do. Their business is right on the main street of Reykajvik and they don't want to do anything that would cause them to lose their license, or so I'm told..

So, in short, I fucked up. I made a mistake and have to deal with the consequences. Now, if the consequences is just me losing that money, I can live with that. But if the consequences are identity theft, fraud, and such things, then I have a loooot more to deal with..

Is there any sound advice anyone could offer me? I tend to overthink things a lot but this place is famous for reprehensible shit. Getting tourists drunk off their mind and charging ridiculous things to their accounts or shadey business behind the scenes.. What should (could) I do to better protect myself now that I brought this on me?",09Aug2019,1
11,"   I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",09Aug2019,0

15,"Past few years I've been in quite a rough patch. All my grandparents died in high school along with 2 friends. Resulting me in getting shitty grades. Some people tell me it's my fault others tell me it isn't. I don't know what to believe anymore. 

My best friend was killed my first year of college I barely got accepted into. I watched him die in front of me as I failed to try and save him. Same thing happened this time around except the criticism was worse. People even accused me of lying to get out of a test. I had to show them the fucking footage from the police department to believe me. 

Grades went to shit again, managed to get them back up. Now in my junior year of college. 

Now I can't afford college because of financial difficulties. I can't even afford any decent food. My family has been scrapping food from the trash can to try and save as much as possible.

Had my birthday recently and no one even remembered, no gifts, no cake, no happy birthday. 

And on top of all that my spouse left me after we got into a big fight. And flew to another state. We are still technically together, but they are 5,000 miles away from me. 

Then just recently I found out I may not be able to get a job I've been wanting my entire life. Due to past actions of mine. 

I feel no point in living life anymore. I feel like everyone hates me or thinks of me as a monster. Even if I continued living I feel like i would be a lifeless individual if I didn't achieve the 1 dream I had in my life.

i can't stand the smell of cigarettes. weed doesn't bother me. but i don't know if the whole apartment will smell like weed. i can say for certain, that i will not be okay with that, because then my stuff will smell like weed too.

19,"Hey everyone this might be a long post but I've had an even *longer* year.

Currently  I'm taking care of my grandparents ( they raised me) while they go  through at home chemotherapy. Both of them are terminal at this point  and probably won't make it through the end of the year. I've been stuck  in this selfless freak mode where I have spent the last year of my life  or so helping people either at work or at home. 24/7. I haven't really  gotten to say no in quite a long time. It feels like I lit myself on  fire trying to keep everyone ""warm"". A lot of people know that because  I'm incredibly burnt out and a lot of the time I get delirious at work  from not sleeping  (busy life) and not eating (sometimes its tough).  So  people see me as really *weird.* I've been getting better little by little though.

I  run  40-70 miles a week for the last few years and that's about the  only thing bringing me some form of stability and the only thing that  reminds me to eat and take care of myself. I try to use that as my  baseline to keep my physical health in check right now and its also my  main form of catharsis.  On days I don't eat/sleep I have a rule not to  run even if I REALLY want to. Its the only escape/break I get from all  my shit so I really hate not getting a few miles in. I also journal here  and there to help keep my thoughts straight and vent. I also have a dog  that is literally perfect. Those three things have kept me in check  through the process for the most part. As best as I can be day by day.

I  dropped/lost all of my friends except one and some of them chose to  walk away during this time because they didn't understand what I was  going through( I was/am changing a lot). Some of the blame has to fall  on me for not saying anything or enough at times.

The  dynamic I had with all of them was that I was their ""confidant"" and all  of them could confide with me about anything. I actually had this  tradition I started around 11- we would do where we would sit in a hot  tub and just talk about life. I did this with everyone(individually and  as a group). Usually I worked out the group drama and was the one people  came to if they needed anything. Fast forward and I'm 21 about to turn  22 (wooo!) and I spent that entire year trying to help people- only one  of them in this process has not been a leech/broke my trust and hasn't  been trying to drain/burden me and was even okay with me telling him  that the relationship was going to become very superficial for a long  time since he was my only way to break away from reality. I'm very  fortunate to have him as a friend. We occasionally talk but its just not  the same. His grandmother who is incredibly important to him is also  about to pass so I don't want to burden him with any of my situation.  I'm just under an incredible amount of stress and I don't really know  how to make other types of friendship where people don't just take from  me. So in response... I've become incredibly social awkward/anxious all  the time because I do not want to deal with anymore drama.

I  was quiet about it so people wouldn't pity my situation ( when this  happened I had just gotten out of a long term relationship and most  close friends kind of forced me out of the group except for one).  I was  also going through massive swings of highs and lows following leaving  my relationship ( like up for 3 days on a high type of deal which has  never happened to me and equal lows at points).  My plate has been  loaded with dysfunctional family for the last year while they have gone  through the mood swings of dealing with the impending passing of my  grandparents.

I just feel guilty  wanting to ask for help/bring people into this drama but I know I've  been isolating myself and being the self consumer of my woes is  destructive behavior so I know I *need to*. I just don't think its *fair*  to anyone to bring them into a situation this stressful since most  people walked out or just tried to funnel alcohol into me. That doesn't   help at all. I know I put myself into this cycle of self isolation on  accident helping everyone around me and accidentally lost myself in the  process. How did you other INFJ's/sensitive people find yourself after  similar experiences and what did you do for self improvement/break the cycle.

21,"This is how I feel on a daily basis. Why am I a monster? I've suffered from depression, anxiety, and an anger problem most of my life. I've gotten into fist fights with friends and strangers. Yelled at co-workers. Yelled at strangers. And the most shameful thing I've done was be physically and emotionally abusive to my first girlfriend. 

I've figured out the why. My parents abused me. Not sexually, but everything else. I remember one incident when I was about 7 when my dad beat me, I told a friend, and his parents called CPS. Once my mom found out CPS was involved, she beat me until I bled and forced me to tell CPS I had made up the whole thing. To his ""credit"" my dad stopped being physically abusive, but my mom beat me until I was a teen. Their emotional abuse continued until I was an adult. I'm not using this as an excuse.  People come from much worse situations and never lay a hand on their girlfriends. 

After my first gf broke up with me (obviously) I refused to date for years because I didn't trust myself not to hurt someone again. I sought out therapy but it never helped and medication didn't seem to do much either (except select anti-anxiety meds at times).  What finally helped was actually SELF-help. I read a ton of books on philosophy, psychology, self-help, etc. Watched a ton of YouTube videos on the subject as well.  Just a 10 minute video on controlling my anger would help. I built up habits and they finally seemed to help.

I'm 37 now and I think I finally turned the corner about 3-4 years ago. I finally started dating again and met and married a wonderful woman who knows everything I've written so far. Frankly I think it's a miracle I didn't end up dead or in prison sometimes.

If you asked people that know me now, they'd tell you I'm nicer and calmer than most people they know. And yet I'm constantly scared. Everyday I feel like a fake, that this monster is inside of me and one day it'll come out.  And that I'll get angry and hurt myself or someone else. I feel undeserving of the life I've made for myself. And honestly I get suicidal sometimes thinking about this. Just reinforcing what I've learned and doing the things that have gotten me this far help, but I'm honestly still so scared of the person I used to be.  Is this just the price I have to pay? Will I always be like this for the rest of my life, being on guard and worried that I'll explode?",09Aug2019,2

24,"Today was a kind of rough day. I had a final falling out with an online friend that I spoke to on and off for a while. He was an alright guy and he gave some alright advice. At least I thought that until today

Several months ago I broke up with my boyfriend. It was amicable and we are still best friends, we view it as a horizontal shift not a downgrade. 

I was talking to my online friend about it things got heated and he finally got to the point that he felt my bf was the best thing that happened to me and I sabotaged the relationship, and I should have forced it to work (kink based relationship) and that I do not actually care about my ex... by keeping them in a relationship they were not feeling good in. I was super offended and told him off. He was talking about my friend like he was a juicy piece of stock or meat that I passed up on. He blocked me and that was that.

My ex is my oldest friend, we’ve been friends since we were five and he and I are still best friends, we are roommates and spend time together, we are both happy and care for each other, just not “in that way”. We discussed this conversation and he let me know that the dude was dead wrong and that he’s glad that asshole is out of my life. Probably for the best because tbh the dude engages in some pretty sketchy behaviors that I was willing to look past because of a stupid sense of obligation to people I see as friends.

The thing is, I’m still mad at this online person. I want to shout at him I want to growl and punch and kick him for being so smugly certain about something he knows nothing about beyond what I told him. I want to see his whole world come crumbling down. This is so pointless but I have no idea how to just put these feelings down and walk off, my brain keeps returning to it.

How can I let go of this and go on?",09Aug2019,2

I went through a very rough patch after my ex took off and fell into a deep depression. My coworker was there every step of the way to help me whatever I needed. We hang out regularly outside of work, although she has cut out alcohol of her life recently which has definitely taken a hit on our life outside of work since we would normally hit the night life scene together. I’ve stayed the night at her house multiple times, but every time it’s been on the couch due to drinking too much.

We have gotten very close and both mutually tell each other how much we appreciate our friendship. I have since fallen pretty hard for her but am afraid to say anything that could ruin our friendship, let alone make working every day awkward as hell if I come out and say how I feel and she doesn’t feel the same way. Today she bought me Madden 20 after I casually mentioned it last week. Dumb I know, but all I can think about is would someone who just sees me as friend do something like that?

Anyways, I was hoping you guys could offer me some advice. Have any men ever been through a situation like this? And if you’re a woman, how do you think I should approach this from a female’s perspective? Thanks you guys!",09Aug2019,2
28,"So I'm trying to bulk up as I'm really skinny. I decided to use myfitnesspal for a week straight just to see what I'm doing. My problem isnt eating healthy. I'm just not eating enough. I get slightly too many carbs, nearly half as much protein and about 3/4 of my needed fats. I'm also usually about 1500 calories short.

I lift weights 4 times a week and play basketball everyday for about 2-4 hours, so I'm burning A LOT of calories.

It's honestly quite annoying having to keep track of what I eat. Is there an easier way to do this? Should I just forget about tracking it and eat a lot more since I usually burn a lot anyways?",09Aug2019,1
29,"I started a new job one month ago and for the past 2-3 weeks, I've been getting so tired while I'm in the middle of working.  I'll be sitting at my desk and I have to fight just to stay awake.

I don't know why.  It's not a physical job at all, I'm sitting at a computer all day.  And I've never had this problem with any previous jobs.

I work 9am to 6pm with a 1 hour lunch break.  I wake up at 7am and am usually in bed by 10-11pm, so I assume I'm getting enough sleep.  And as soon as I get out of work, I don't feel tired any more.

I don't drink coffee, but I do drink caffeinated soda.  I really don't want to resort to drinking 5 hour energy or taking caffeine pills, but I'm not sure what else to do.

Any advice would be appreciated.",09Aug2019,2
30,"So a little back story, I've struggled with self destructive thinking about all my life, I have been getting better at ignoring that negativity but lately its been getting worse, worse than ever. 

I work for as a travel agent. It requires me to put up with alot of entitled people. Recently I got the grueling task of catering to a group of about 20 old ladies apart of a quilt guild. They are the worse people I have ever met. I have already dealt with the head of the beast in a previous trip I organized and guided for her and she is the spawn of the devil himself. She has the type of person that thrives on seeing people fear her. I am about 2 weeks away from having to travel with her and her group and this past week has been non stop calling from them and the interactions haven't been great. We've had some hiccups (things that happen but can be easily be fixed) and they have belittled me and have made me feel like shit.

34,"Sooo I’m gonna start off by saying I’m very nervous to be posting about this (using throwaway account for said reason) and I’ve never talked about this to anyone, never even typed it before, but it’s really starting to bother me and I could use some advice. I might delete sometime after posting because I don’t want anyone to find out.
To get started, I’m an 18 year old girl. I’m a lesbian, and have a history of abuse from a male family member. My cousin is a 16 year old male. 
       We’ve obviously known each other and hung out for as long as I can remember, varying in closeness as time went on. We’d go through periods where we wouldn’t talk at all (his home life isn’t as stable as mine and they move houses/schools a lot) and times when we talk lots. The past year or so we’ve been hanging out a lot because I started driving him home from school. In the winter of last year he dropped out though (he was only in 10th grade) and never told me, he just stopped showing up in front of the school one day and I had to hear from a friend. I was really upset and didn’t talk to him for awhile, but I feel really bad that he’s pretty isolated now, with no more friends at school and no drivers license yet, so I’ve been taking him with me to go to town and hang out etc.
           But he’s kind of a weird dude. This kind of works out because we’re both nerds (into anime and obscure music etc) but he also is into stuff that just makes me uncomfortable. He posts a lot about hentai on his finsta, and how lonely he is. He had a girlfriend for awhile, and after they broke up that agreed to be friends, and he still thought they would have a chance together. About a month ago she told him she’s a lesbian. At first I thought it was funny because it’s not the first time it’s happened to him, he always seems to get Pink Triangle-d if you will and falls for gay girls. We would joke about it a lot, and he started opening up to me about other parts of his life. He’s into a lot of weird porn, and most recently he’s been telling me how into BBWs he is. Now, I’m a bigger girl, bordering plus size (comes into play later) I laughed it off and made a joke out of it as usual. 
          Now comes the part that really bothers me. Recently he’s been saying sexual things surrounding me, and idfk what to do. At first it was little stuff that I brushed/laughed off (he stayed at my house while his parents were away for a few days, and his friend apparently made a joke about that being ‘hot’ and he said I’m a lesbian and also his cousin (weirdly when he mentions that stuff, he always mentions I’m a lesbian before mentioning I’m his cousin. Idk) And when he talks about how horny he is/wanting a gf he’ll be like ‘not talking about you tho’ like??? Obviously???? Why would you bring that up? And he has started sending me bbw porn. 
           The final straw that made me realize this could actually be a thing tho, is when I went to pick him up today the first thing he said was, ‘I know you’re my cousin, but you have really big tits’ I WAS SO FUCKING UNCOMFORTABLE, but again, I laughed it off. Afterwards he talked about his usual fetishes of big boobs and stuff and I just felt.gross.
 I honestly don’t know what to do. Should I say nothing and hope it goes away? Or do I say something and potentially make things even weirder? I’m at a loss.",09Aug2019,2
35,"i have lost feelings for him completely. he makes jokes at my expense, annoys me constantly, calls other girls hot in front of me, makes fun of me in front of his friends, and i am just no longer attracted to him anymore. should i just break up with him? i don’t want to hurt him.",09Aug2019,32
36,"My family acts like they don't like me anymore. They look at me weird, are really rude to me, ignores me, and makes fun of me. They always did this but it seems like it's different now.

37,"I'm terrible at just telling things, so I'm not just asking you to ask questions, I *need*  you to ask questions. I can't express symptoms by myself, but I can sure as hell answer specific questions.

Hi. 14M here. For about 2 years, I thought that I had some sort of depression, but the ""I'm 14 and I have depression"" memes made me think that I was just overreacting and that there are other people that need help more than me.

Recently, I talked to a friend about how I felt, and she told me that they were signs of depression and that I should get help.

I have absolutely no idea what to do, because my worst fear is going to a therapist and getting told off for faking or not having a problem. So I have a couple questions for you:

39,"My mother was already devastated by us finding him on the floor, and the 911 call. We took him to the hospital, and stayed there until morning by his side, feeling bad. 

She took his phone to try and call his co-workers and whoever else to let them know what's happening, but it was locked. Eventually the phone started receiving texts on the lock screen notifications from some woman saying she hadn't seen him in awhile, this woman was obviously oblivious to the fact that he's had a stroke. 

My mom was extremely suspicious. Then the phone got a call, and my mother answered it. She asked who it was, and the woman responded ""I'm his girlfriend."" That's self exclamatory. My mom didn't take down the number since she was completely shocked.

The phone is locked with a pin, it's an LG phone. I want to get into the phone so we can not only have access to his contacts to be able to update them on what's happening with his condition, but also to see what activity he's been having with this woman further.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",09Aug2019,0

Then Thursday night he showed up to her place of work (a bar) 3 times then kept trying to talk to her where she eventually did and said he doesn’t want contact but it was like he didn’t accept that.

There's a lot of good in my life, and this doesn't stem from not having material things like video games or etc; I'm scared of myself because I have a hard time keeping my emotions under control and fear I might lose everything eventually. My hobbies are a bore, math (my go to) is a chore, I can't sleep on time, hard time focusing, and can barely make conversation without losing it all inside.

47,"Hello, as the title says I'm...trapped. It's been 1 year and 2 months since I dropped from school and all that time I've been only at home, doing nothing productive or good, only being on the internet, watching and masturbating to porn almost daily, having very minimal movement - mostly laying in bed or just sitting, having very bad sleeping schedule - staying awake the entire night and going to sleep mostly in morning, sometimes even afternoon and having no social life at all. 

I've been trying many times through out this time to improve my life - trying to get better sleeping schedule, trying to do some fitness, trying to stop my porn addiction, trying to make some new good habbits...But it always took 1 week at most and I gave up, returned to all my bad habbits again. I don't know what to do anymore..

I wanted to at least have some part-time job, but I was always scared of it because of my social anxiety and fear of doing something stupid or embarrasing. Then...I decided it would be best to start going to school again, it's supposed to start in few weeks and I'm not even sure if I'm prepared for that with my current state. It's a high school, but I will have to start from 1st grade again. In my country, we have 3-4 grades, depending on what you want to study. Right now, I could have been in 3rd grade already, if I didn't drop and kept good grades. I'm worried about it, mainly because I will have class with younger people and I would much prefer being with people of my age, but also worried because of my social anxiety.

51,"I apologize in advance for the length of this, it’s very long but there are some details that need to be addressed and taken into consideration in order to make a concrete move about my current dilemma.

Alright, so my mother has been married to a man for the last 4 years, they’ve been together for about 6 years in total but essentially have known each other their whole lives. They grew up together in a super small town of less than 1000 people, my grandmother (moms mom) and his mother were best friends growing up so naturally they ended up spending a lot of their lives together. Six years ago, he and my mom decided to try and give it a go romantically and somehow it worked out. So after some time, marriage naturally made sense to them both.

For the last 6 years, by all outsider accounts anyway, they seem to have had a fairly “normal” relationship. To me he seemed alright at first but as time went on I started to grow a little suspicious of his reoccurring behaviors. Past the whole “you’re dating my mom and you’re not my dad so i automatically hate you” groove that everyone falls into. I made the decision for myself after about two years of them
being together to not spend very much time with them if he was around. He has a bit of an alcohol problem when they are together, to the point of it being obnoxious for everyone around them. He also tended to resort to lashing out in a very child like fit when things didn’t go his way. But ultimately they’re adults and can do whatever they want, so I kept my mouth shut about my concerns and chose to hang with my mom whenever he wasn’t present.

I love my mom very much and I recognize that she is a grown woman and that I have to respect her right to be able to make her own decisions because shes an adult but i’m having a hard time with something that has happened:

In the middle of December of 2018, my mom and her husband threw their annual ugly christmas sweater party at their house. Typically a small batch of my extended/immediate family gets together for this event just about every year. Because I knew an excessive amount of alcohol would be involved, for the first time in a while, I chose not to attend. My dearest and closest cousin and her partner WERE in attendance that night though. 

As the night progressed for them, my cousin ended up getting too drunk and passed out in my moms guest room, her very sober and more than vigilant partner joined her and they both ended up just going to sleep. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, everyone was having a good time all night, they were in a safe space, their wasn’t anything to worry about, so they ended the night on a relatively positive note. Both of them fell asleep. Until my cousins partner was woken up from a dead sleep around 3am by super obvious movement in the bed, she rolled over to find my mothers husband in bed with them. At first glance it didn’t register to her what was happening until she really took a look and found that my mothers husband was taking advantage of my cousin sexually while she was sleeping. My cousin and her partner ended up fighting him off of her and then they quickly left my moms house without saying anything around 4am. Everyone else in the house was asleep. Moms husband went back to bed.

A few days went by and my cousin was continually struck with overwhelming feelings of disgust about the situation. She wasn’t sure if it warranted a trip/call to the police and she was too afraid/shook up to even get the courage to take it that far. She knew something had to be done so she eventually ended up just confronting my mother about the situation and my mom advised her that she would take care of it. 

In the midst of all of this happening, my mother and her husband were in the middle of selling their house and making a cross country move from CA to TN. A few months go by, they sell their house, they both move out of CA. 

Ultimately, nothing is done about my cousins assault. My mother came out of it with the mentality of “ive known him my whole life, he would never do anything like that” and “he says he was so intoxicated that he thought it was me and that he feels so embarrassed”.....time went on, mom/husband were moved out the state, mom adopted the mentality of they moved so far away from my cousin so it was now an “Out of sight, out of mind” situation. Nothing ever came of it. 

Fast forward to the end of June of this year. My mother and her husband get to TN, they get all moved into their brand new home and there’s a knock on the door. The TN police are looking for my moms husband, he is arrested on sight with no warning and ultimately extradited back to California. He was arrested on, what was eventually brought to light, a warrant for his arrest for a sex offense. BUT, it was not related to my cousins assault AT ALL. 

Turns out between the time my cousin was assaulted and them finally up and moving, my mothers husband and another man ended up brutally raping/sodomizing one of their mutual female friends at a party she was having. The woman who was assaulted was drunk and asleep. It turns out the other man in question got everything they both did to her on video as well as photographic evidence so he could have proof and look at it later. One of them told the wrong person about what they did and somehow all of this evidence was eventually brought back to the woman they originally assaulted and she filed a police report. He was arrested, extradited and put in jail.

My mother still does not know that I know ANY of this information. My aunt was the one who eventually ended up spilling the beans and telling me the facts but I was told to keep up the facade with my mother that I still have no idea what’s happening. So until my mom herself says otherwise, Ill keep the face like I was never told. 

When I end up calling/texting my mother every few weeks to bullshit/talk, I keep it as casual and normal as possible. I don’t say anything about her husband, I don’t mention anything involving him at all, I don’t ask any questions. It’s been a couple of months of this and she has yet to say a single word about this. She continues to speak to me as if it isn’t happening and as if it never even happened. “Oh life in TN is good, everything’s fine, just went camping last weekend i’ll send you pics, it was super fun!”. But not once is her husband or her husbands whereabouts or wellbeing ever mentioned. 

Her husband is currently, as of this post date, still in a county jail. I’ve occasionally looked at his booking info online to make sure he’s still in there and to see if I can get any updates as to what’s going on. He’s got a court date in mid August but I don’t have much else to go on. Based on his charges he could go to prison for up to 6 years. But I highly doubt anything will ACTUALLY happen.

My issues here lie in the fact that I have a very high expectation that, depending on the ultimate outcome of his trial/sentencing, my mother will choose to continue to stay with him. When the original assault of my cousin was brought to light, I personally told her that I would not be coming around or attending any family based events/hang outs if he was around or in any way involved. She ultimately understood BUT she continued to stay with him. I fear that this situation will deliver the same outcome. She chose him even when he assaulted her own FAMILY member. It doesn’t leave me much hope to think the outcome won’t be the same this time. I fear this will be the thing that ends my relationship with my mother forever. Since he was arrested, the rest of my family has given her the ultimatum of its him or it’s family. They have said if she chooses to stay with him that they will not be involved in her life at all, they will not keep in touch, they will not answer her attempts of communication, they will not invite her to family gatherings or events, she will be ultimately erased from the family. 

I love my mother and I want to continue to have a relationship with her but ive had enough. When it happened to my cousin I shunned him completely, hoping it would wake my mom up to this being a problem. It didn’t take and she decided to choose him. This time I can’t be lenient and i’m siding with the rest of my family in saying that it’s him or it’s us. 

Honestly, I don’t know what to say or how to even feel about the hypothetical scenario of losing my mother if/when she DOES choose him over family. 

This was more of a rant and I apologize, it’s hard to articulate what i’m feeling or what i’m ACTUALLY looking for here.

53,"My(19f) boyfriend(19m) has always been very welcoming about me going on his phone whenever I’d like to. We’ve been dating for almost 3 years now and I’ve never done it up until just recently. I was on his reddit and came across his most recently search accounts. “Sissys” and “sissy hypno”. Now I’ve know from the very beginning of our relationship that he has a fetish where he likes to think of himself as the girl when getting himself off to porn. I never asked about it further as he was really embarrassed to share and have left it at that. Until I found these accounts, I was in such shock to what he actually meant by being the girl and what comes with it. From what I get out of it, when a man thinks of himself as a sissy he’s submissive and essentially becomes a slut for cock. I ended up breaking down as I was so embarrassed to confess to him what I’d seen. Be reassured me it was okay and he’s not embarrassed, although he clearly was. I tried to be respectful when I asked him if he was into women and men but he just got ever so slightly defensive and responded with I’m not bisexual. I left it at that. I can’t help but feel so insecure about myself now though. 
I’ve always known that he finds vaginas disgusting to the point where he doesn’t even like looking at them, he has said before he’d go down on me if I wanted but then proceeds to tell me how gross it is and must be for the man. This has made me self conscious to let myself be seen down there when we have sex or even when I’m changing my clothes etc. Anytime his face goes anywhere near my bottom front I get so anxious that I moved him away or lead him in another direction upwards. (Note: I have very good hygiene and always make sure my lady bits are clean so I don’t feel like smell etc. is an issue) Is he so disgusted by vaginas because he’s solely into penis instead? 
I’m at a loss with myself and how to approach this. What do I do? I’ve obviously been off the past few days as he can tell , but I’m so nervous to say anything about it as I feel like I’d just start crying and he’d just reassure me again. I love him so very much, and I don’t want this to ruin us but I feel so helpless and sometimes I get in such a rage inside my head when I put this all together because I just don’t know what to think or if it’s even okay to feel this way.",09Aug2019,1

Sorry if this is not the correct subreddit...
I startede university 1 year ago and I moved across the country to start fresh. I know for a fact that university has been extremely stressful for me so I took my precautions and stayed home from lectures and just read from home; or I went to my hometown which also has been helping me. I really like the relatively new town I’m currently living in; I have made friends and met a wonderful man so that’s not the problem.
I have always been an overthinker which has always been a problem for me when I have to sleep but this past year has been extreme. It is often small things I worry about, like things I have to do the next day etc.

One of my problem is that i’m a light sleeper. Everything wakes me up and my main problem is that I wake up at least 3 or 4 times during the night because I have to pee. I tried not drinking water after 7 PM but I still had to pee in the night and I was feeling bad in the morning because of dehydration. I tried good night tea with chamomille and baldrian which only made the peeing worse. I know you can get baldrian as pills but I read that you’ll have to be careful if you take medications for epilepsy (which I do) so that wasn’t an option either. Since I overthink a lot I tried writing all my worries on a piece of paper - that didn’t help either. I also tried yoga, meditation, sleep hypnosis and listening to calm music before going to bed; I also tried reading a book but nothing makes me able to sleep! I even started running because it might make me physically tired - didn’t help either. I also tried sleeping with earplugs and sleepmasks with no succes.

Note: I don’t drink coffee and take naps in the afternoon or exercise late.

About 6 months ago I went to the doctor because I was losing my mind due to the fact that I slept 3-4 hours every night and still having to pee 24/7. She didn’t do anything other than handing me a piece of paper with “tips for good sleeping” which basically consisted of all the above mentioned things and I literally teared up because there was no help for me. I also got tested for STIs and STDs and there was nothing.

Note: I have epilepsy, asthma and on benadryl for allergies and I’m also on birth control - and I have been for many years.

Any help is appreciated and thanks in advance for reading my post. 

TL;DR I can’t sleep, tried anything - need advice!",09Aug2019,2

59,"i recently came to the realization that the man i dated when i was 16 was a pedophile. i’m 19 now, and i’ve been in denial for all these years. he was 23, and we dated online. we met on a horrible website called gifyo - which has since been deleted because of child porn. he met me when i was 13 and he was 20. at the time, i didn’t think anything weird of it. i just thought he wanted to be my friend. however, reflecting on this as an adult, i can see that he preyed on me, groomed me, and used me for sexual gratification. yes, i sent him nudes. lots. and he sent me nudes too, which i have evidence of. before we started dating, he would call me an anime girl and stuff. i’m now realizing how fucking creepy that is bc of how sexualized they are. when i was 15, we planned that i would move in with him and become his roommate when i turned 18. and when we were dating, he planned on staying in a hotel in the town i lived in so we could meet up so he could idfk rape me. 

i’m not the only girl he targeted either. there were at least two other girls that he dated when they were underage. i reached out to one the other day, and she told me that he was so fucking bizarre. he once “jokingly” told her that he was into joining those chat rooms on the dark web where the audience can choose how to abuse a kidnapped girl. a similar instance happened with him and i - he once asked for me to send him the nudes my gf sent me (we were both freshmen in hs) and i was like uhhh no she’s fucking 14, and then he proceeded to be like “i’m just joking weirdo.” she also told me that he was into watching snuff films which are real videos of people being abused, killed, and/or raped. he also once sent her a video of a naked woman with all four of her limbs tied to four different horses, and they ran and ripped her into pieces. 

i had no fucking idea. the dude is a god damn sociopath. he manipulated me and sexually abused me. he’s fucking sick. i literally idolized him so much and thought he was the coolest person i ever met, but no, he just manipulated me and lied to make it seem like we had a bunch of things in common. i’m so disgusted, and i want revenge. i highly doubt that the three of us are the only girls he preyed on, and i definitely dont want there to be any more in the future. but i’m at a loss of what i should do. i messaged his mother and told her that he’s a pedo, and replied saying that i’m just jealous of his wife now and then blocked me. i tried messaging his wife too and i was just blocked. i have so much evidence against him, i never deleted our messages on facebook messenger. i have everything. 

so, i was wondering, what do you guys think i should do? obviously there’s the option of taking him to court, but i don’t have much faith in our judicial system and i really don’t want to see him in person. i could also release his info online to some anti-pedophile group on the internet and let them dox him and shit, but i’m not sure what to do. pls help.

TL;DR: i was manipulated and sexually abused by a pedophile online for three years, and i’m unsure of what to do. i don’t want him to get away with it and i have proof of everything.",09Aug2019,0

62,"It's a long one, so sorry in advance!

I've asked the opinion of a few people, and most tell me I'm overreacting and to just go, but my gut tells me otherwise. 

So at around the beginning of June, a couple of friends and myself were talking about going to a road trip to BC, Canada. We're from Alberta, so not a huge trip. The main point of the trip was to pick up one of my friends' brother from a summer camp in Vernon. We thought about going to Kelowna for a few days which is about an hour away from Vernon, and then pick him up on our way back. We kinda realized that there's not a whole lot to do in Kelowna for 3, 22 year old guys. I wasn't opposed to walking around and chilling by the lake for a few days, but they thought it would be boring. We decided to meet up later and talk about it. 

A week later, one of them calls me at work and tells me that him and my other friend are at his place planning it out. This kinda bothered me, as I'm feeling left out. I am at work though, so I tell him we can talk later. Admittedly, I didn't call him back, but neither did he. This was about a month and a half away from the time we're supposed to leave, so I wasn't too worried, and figured they would ask me for a meet up sometime soon. A bit later, they tell me they want to go camping on the way there, and I'm kind of opposed to it, as I prefer being by water and in a city as opposed to sitting around in a forest for 3 days. We didn't talk much about it, but I made it clear it wasn't something I really wanted to do.


Just recently, they told me that we're going to be camping on the way there, and then spending a night in Kelowna. I wasn't too happy, as they obviously got together and planned it without asking me for any input. Another main issue is I won't be driving as I still have my learners license, so I don't want to tag along in what's essentially THEIR road trip, not OUR road trip. The only input they asked me for was which hotel to stay in. Now, a couple of days ago, one of them asked if I wanted to split the cost in a room in Vernon. I asked him, ""Are we not going to Kelowna?"" He said no, not anymore. That's basically the last straw for me. I don't really like Vernon, there's less to do there than Kelowna. Plus, we'll be camping for most of the time, and literally sitting around in a forest, instead of staying in a nice city and finding stuff to do in it. 

So my two questions are these: 

A) Should I go on the road trip that I had basically no say in any of the activities, and I'll be bored out of my mind for most of it?

B) Am I overreacting? I feel like I'm not, as like I said, I had no input in the planning, not once was I invited to a meeting, and they basically planned it without any regard for what I might want to do? 

Thanks for any input, its much appreciated! If you have any questions, please ask them in the comments.",09Aug2019,1

She even offered to let my dog go over her apartment even though her cat is skittish. She does talk a lot, and tell many stories for what most would consider too long but i understand she’s been alone.

After high school graduation in 2018 i moved to Florida from a state on the east coast, I hated where i lived during High School (drugs, toxicity, bad family, ect) so i planned to move that summer after, and it worked. I received 2 trust fund's (less than 40 grand) and i blew through one aimlessly when i was a stupid, naive 18 year old. and i barley have the other left. besides it paying for my rent till summer of 2020

Basically what i'm trying to ask is how do i play it smart and benefit from my rent being paid for another year in order to get my shit together. i never want to have to depend on it after 2020 (i cant anyways, because it will be gone.) Should i work my ass off and save as much money humanly possible? so then i can pay for my rent or something while going to school as an LPN ? (i also have to wait till i can prove i'm a dependent on my next tax return so i do not quality for fl tuition) so i can get paid more?

i also think i have Borderline personality disorder which makes me think maybe a should be a stripper or porn.. (sketchy jobs).

should i apply for a credit card to build credit so i have something to lean on in the future? bruh. i don't know how to adult.

79,"There is this one cashier at my local grocery store who scowls at me every time I go through the checkout line. Below is more back story if you’re interested, but for those who just want to cut to the chase:

Should I confront her?  I was thinking of saying something like, “Excuse me, may I ask, Have I offended you in some way?  Or is there something you’ve heard about me that’s caused you to strongly dislike me?  Because every time I come through your line you look at me I’m an ex-husband who used to beat your daughter or something.” 


Back Story

I live in an extremely, like, OBNOXIOUSLY, small town, where I’ve, honest to God, witnessed on two separate occasions, two people that know each other suddenly realize they’re related to each other. My point being that everyone knows everyone else’s business, wether it’s true or not, and people in this town LOVE to gossip.  I’m really curious as to why she’s so overtly rude to me.  I’m wondering if there might not be something going around the rumor mill about me.  I’m a gay male, not obviously, like no one has ever said “I could kind of tell” when I’ve told them I was gay.  There’s been several times someone I barely know make some sexual joke to me, and I laughed it off, but wondered how they even knew I was gay and had a partner.  My husband was a lot older than me, he passed away last year, very unexpectedly, and I was a complete wreck the night it happened, and there was a coroner there, some police officers, and an Emergency Response Team there, and they are all well known in the community,  After that happened, it seemed as if random people in the community knew me by name. Also, I tried to steal flowers from this grocery store, for my husbands funeral, or just to plant flowers to keep the deck as beautiful as he always kept it.  After I paid my debt to society, the store owner who had originally banned me invited me back to shop there again.  It is the only grocery store more 30 miles, and frankly, I think he was just greedy and wanted the business, they charge twice as much as anywhere else.  When the flower stealing happened, I tried to say that my husband had just died, and I wasn’t myself.  I mean, I didn’t even try to be sneaky about it, I just started putting flowers in my car in broad daylight, I basically did not care if I got caught, I was just kind of self-destructive and reckless.  I had been with my husband for 15 years, he was best friend, closest companion, I loved him SO much. His death was, still is, very hard for me. I then heard from a cashier that the owner’s wife had wanted to let it slide, on account of my loss and everything, and that the owner had said, “oh, he wasn’t married, he only knew that guy for a little over a year “.  For some reason I was infuriated when I heard this.  Because I knew that it was already out in the rumor mill, and I was devastated by this loss, and now people were going to whisper to one another that I was a liar and a fraud.  It was upsetting.   I wrote a very long polite letter to him, explaining my whole life story from the time I had met Dennis, to the time we moved out here because this is where he wanted to live out the rest of his days.  I never wanted to live out here, it’s even more redneck than where I grew up.  Anyways, he read the letter, but didn’t respond.  Then one day in the evening, I snuck into the grocery store with a hoody to try to hide my identity to buy some ice cream.  I was desperate and addicted to ice cream.  Behind me I heard the owner say “Are you Matt?”, and I said “Yes, I’m sorry, I’ll leave right now, it won’t happen again,” and he smiled and motioned me to stop and calm down and that’s when he told me I could come shop there again.  And that I didn’t need to wear a disguise.  Finally some peace.  Except for this one cashier.  As soon as she see’s me, her expression changes.  She never says thank you or have a nice day.  I’ve watched her treat the guy in front of me with glowing kindness and friendliness.  One time I even lingered behind to see if it was just a coincidence that her mood changed, and I wanted to see if she was rude to the next person.  She wasn’t.  She was all like “can I put that in a separate bag for you honey?”.  


So again, my question is:  Should I confront her?  I was thinking of saying something like, “Excuse me, may I ask, Have I offended you in some way?  Or is there something you’ve heard about me that’s caused you to strongly dislike me?  Because every time I come through your line you look at me I’m an ex-husband who used to beat your daughter or something.”",09Aug2019,2
80,"I enjoy interesting conversations, but now and then I encounter people who seem to think that a good conversation means rambling on and on about what they're interested in and what they think about the matter. Asking no questions and leaving no pause for confirmation, question or interjection, they ramble on and on, ignoring all context clues that the conversation is at an end and that the listener has other matters to attend to. Every now and then, one might interject with an agreement or an argument to their point, but they continue on as if one hadn't said anything at all, continuing their diatribe until they are finished (which usually tends to be a very, **very** long time from now, or until one simply states that they have to leave, to attend to other things or simply just to be rid of their presence.

Also, is their a psychological phenomenon that this can be categorized under?",09Aug2019,39
81,"Ok, this is a long story. Buckle up.

Background Story of me: Crazy Childhood. I and my male cousins are exploring our fantasies. You already know what happened. Aside from that, I was bullied and abused as a child. I was bullied by my childhood friends as someone not masculine enough, I was sexually abused by my former friend when he fishes me to go to his house as we're just together alone and I have no idea what was about to happen. He asked me to suck his dick. But I refused and he insisted couple times and I got home. I am cool with my childhood friends already. But all of my experiences have so much effect on what I am now. 

Before all of those crazy homosexual experiences, I was straight as an arrow. I remember getting mad to men when they look back at my sister's body.

What I mean by 'wrong' here is what I'm doing isn't me, and that everything was just dopamine-driven. I'm not saying being gay is wrong:

This leads me to high school, where I switched to watch gay porn from straight porn (Yes, I watched porn already on grade school) up until recently, where I started to feel it's wrong and understood everything through people's experience and science.  I already felt it's wrong countless times during those years. I feel like I fucked up my dopamine reward system because of porn that I got turned on basically of about everything. As long as sex is involved, no matter what gender, I get turned on. But since I am more saturated on gay porn, I get turn on by males faster than females. But that doesn't mean males are someone I want to be with as in romantically. 

My mind can get wild by watching gay porn and think yea, sex with a male is ok. And that's because porn is basically making me think of one of those men as me doing what they're doing. But after I have an orgasm, there's a sea of guilt, sorrow, and wrongness that I feel that something's wrong. NOTE: If I ever was/am really gay, I would be not afraid to come out, my parents and sisters assured me they will accept for whatever am I. But when I think of me coming out as bisexual/gay, I know I'm not gay and that it would awkward for me, myself and wouldn't feel right.

I want to have a family, biological family. That's what I'm holding onto. I can't imagine having sex with a guy if I'm not feeling wild/horny. I can't imagine having a romantic relationship with a guy. I feel like gay porn has seeped into my system that's why I'm feeling this and I want it out.

Obviously, I can imagine me in a romantic and sexual relationship with a woman. Family, all that good stuff. 

I've read sexuality is something you can't change. Well, I was straight with no doubt before gay porn or porn, in general, was introduced to my brain.

What am I now? I think I'm straight, but I want my fucked-up-dopamine-reward-system-attraction-to-male out. I want to restore my natural inclination to be romantically and sexually attracted to females, and I've heard NoFap or semen retention would help to reboot my system. 

A relevant to story about my friend:

I'm cool with my guy friends and they all good and I'm attracted to neither of them. But I have this close pal of mine. To add, he has the best looks among all of us. We always talk. Like every single day through chat during summer vacation. We're helping each other out in our ventures. Then the classes started, we're almost always with each other, mostly because we love studying. We share with each other the chick's we're attracted with and how we're so awkward with women that we're not gonna get them, for now, because we're both introverted. 

He's my best pal for me because our interests match, we love weird shit, we love math and physics, we love playing games. I want him to become my best friend, the same as his'. But when I think of him, I feel an uncomfortable sensation in my chest region like I'm jealous of his looks, it might be jealousy to it or it might not, I don't know. It could be/you could call it an *attraction* but I can't imagine myself with him like romantically. It's just that I feel like I just wanted for us to become best friends.

I just began NoFap to reboot my gay-porn-fucked-up-dopamine-system-driven-attraction-to-males. To see if I'm *really* straight, or maybe *bi*.

Questions:

What's your call on my sexuality given my story?

What's this *uncomfortable feeling* I have when I'm thinking of my best pal?

What's your advice to me?

She knows how I think about religion and how I'm against it, and I've told her before I respect anyone's decision for belief as long as they don't bother me. To each their own. But she doesn't listen. She's troubled when it comes to the subject, she used to be christian, prayed, but she's been into Hinduism and Buddhism for quite some time now and it's like she worships a mixture of everything, a blind hypocrite who chooses senselessly without any true genuine faith. She's pressured me into attending this, in my own words, ""convention of christian air heads and wannabe-hip teen dweebs"", it's called ""Taizé"". I've told her, respectfully, twice, that I had no interest in it. I told her she knows my take on these matters. But her answer for everything is: ""Someday you'll understand."", the last cry of someone with no arguments who relies on confirmation bias.

84,"I've known my girlfriend for a here. She has a past of sexual abuse from her father and other horrible things. 

I'm always trying to be there for her and help her the best I can. But it's very hard. She had her first psychiatrist appointment a couple of days ago and she will start her therapy soon. 

Her brother, coming from the same family, went through some bad things, so he is not mentally healthy and two weeks ago he sexually assaulted her. 

Since then she had a breakdown and sometimes she gets some type of dissociation, forgets who I am and think that she is in a different time than we really are. This things normally happens when I do something that triggers her, and one of the problems is that is very easy for her to get triggered.

The dissociation happen four times so far, and the first three where kinds easy to deal with, I just started acting like a friend and nothing bad happen. But today she was thinking she was 8 years old, and obviously she was scared because she was seeing a grown unknown man with her. I was trying to make her sleep and then she asked if she needs to do something with me. That affected me alot and I just left the bedroom so she sleeps better. 

There are so many things happening and she is not always honest with me. She is self-destructive, she thinks she deserves to suffer, she hurts her self. I don't know how to help more. 

What can I do?",09Aug2019,1
85," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

86,"5 years ago, I met this girl from class. She was everything I ever wanted in a girl. She had good looks and more importantly, a good personality. We both even shared the same interests in cooking. On the first week of school, she even told me that we would be best friends. But ever since I fucked up and confessed too early that I liked her, everything went downhill.

We started to talk to each other less often and my self confidence took a large hit. My personality changed from being talkative and sociable to introverted and quiet. Even after graduating high school, I still do remember vividly about what she said, and I just can't stop thinking about her. 

I just wished that I could turn back time and be the best friend she wanted. So, I feel that i have grown person wise, and I would like to reconnect with her again.

I recently started a new position in a corporate office. I am the youngest in the office (21). Everyone else is in their mid 20s or older. I have experience around a lot of older men and women in the different roles I had in college.

92,"Let me preface this by saying i have a ton of experience in customer service. 6 years, to be exact. I was an assistant manager of a store for about 3 of those. I only very briefly escaped for about 7 months where I was a commercial mover, and it didn't pay enough for me to keep the lights on, so i ditched that one. Another moving job, literally worked 3 days in 3 weeks, and my boss would crush six-packs of bud light on the way home from a job. Big yikes. 

After that, i found myself a deus ex machina of a job. Hooking up and troubleshooting satellite dishes for $20 an hour + some combination of commissions on extra shit and a higher rate if I could do the job quickly without making mistakes. All I had to do was make it through their six weeks of paid training and they would give me my own work vehicle and set me loose.

No way I could fuck that one up. Except... I did. Two weeks in, I'm at the top of a 3 story tall ladder, (which was on uneven terrain, a problem my trainer 'solved' by putting a rock under one side of the ladder) putting in a dish, and I just start losing my shit. I wasn't afraid when I went up, but I felt it creep over my body like a demon covering me with a shitty butthole clench blanket. Trainer said the job isn't safe if you can't keep it together at the top of a ladder, and that was that.

Here I am, back behind a fucking counter, greeting and kissing the asses of hundreds of people who would rather interact with a robot (so they treat me like one). It pays the bills, but my mental health is spiralling down the drain. I am so socially starved. I talk to hundreds of people, yet not a single interaction counts as an 'interaction'. It's probably the most dead end of all jobs. The furthest I can go with it is to buy and franchise my own store, which is probably the last thing I would ever do. I never meant to get complacent working retail, and now I'm stuck.

Tl;dr
I have worked retail forever and i kinda screwed up. I don't have many qualifications outside of retail but I need to get out. The big thing stopping me is that nobody wants to pay more than minimum wage for a guy who doesn't already have experience. I gotta pay my bills. I feel trapped.",09Aug2019,1
93,"After recent events I've decided I should move in with my mom before school starts.

I was planning to move in with my mom before high school (I'm going into 8th) but recently I think it would be better to move now for a few reasons

1. My mom is currently moving into a new house (which she bought specifically in an area where I could go to a better high school) it would be the best time to move while everyone else is moving in.
2. My dad is going broke. Simple as that and it's getting serious. Wednesday night one of the cars got reposessed and the other was about to be to before my mom bought them. (My dad has a paid off car aswell that he was driving a few nights before I'm guessing he knew they'd be repo-ing them) Last month 1 of 2 of his restaurants closed down and the 2nd is probably going to go down to. He said ""I need something to save me before my life blows up in my face"" after the 1st closed and just said today ""I need to get my life back together""
3. I want to be there for my sisters and brother more. I'm the oldest. Around 2-3 weeks ago maybe my youngest sister(/half sister who has grown up with my dad as her dad and my step dad as her dad) (5 almost 6) and I had this conversation while she was getting put in the corner. S: I want to go home! Me: where's home? S: Nowhere.   I'm sure if she's having problems then the older one is too and even I've had my own problems related to the divorce. My half brother shouldn't have many problems as he's grown up with my stepdad as his dad.

**I've lived permanently with my dad due to him indoctrinating me against my mom after the divorce,  last year or so I realized my dislike was completely unjust. I've had a good relationship with my mom ever since and even gone back to spending some weekends there. Part of the reason this will be hard is my dad still thinks I hate going over there and hate my step dad etc...**

That being said I love these kids with all my heart as if they were family and I would truly be heartbroken to never see them again.

After we became official, they didn’t really talk until recently he sent her something and they had a brief conversation. But everything he sent her after that she didn’t respond to (we had a talk about it). And the guy is from out of state, so I asked what would have happened if she lived in our city, she said she would’ve kept dating both of us to see where it went.

Idk, it just makes me feel like she was less of a loyal person than I thought she was. She hid it and bent the truth to cover it up too when I found out and asked her about it. It all makes me feel less special (and I know, guys aren’t supposed to complain about that stuff, but I’ve had gfs that make me feel special in the past, and I want that feeling).

My question is: Should I try to negotiate?

I don't have to make a decision for several months luckily.

Would I be stupid to just accept the offer as-is? It is honestly already what I wanted but I didn't expect to get it so easily! Would I just be greedy and stupid to seek out more money by talking to and getting a competing offer at the other company?",09Aug2019,1

I haven’t been in a relationship since because I’m really insecure and have a fear that the same thing will happen again. 

Because of that I don’t really surround myself with guys so much, so my guy friends mean a lot to me. One in particular I’ve known since I was 11, and we used to be really close.

I wanna leabe the house anyway so theres no incentive to patch things up other than the fact that i love her unconditionally. Do i even bother defending myself bc in her defense, bringing a guy over is v disrespectful and i did it anyway. ((One of 2 reasons why shes mad. The other is that im a hoe with no morals)
By not defending myaelf im refusijg to fight and therefkre give up on our relationship (she disowned me prior to kicking me out tho buuuuut i also know temper makes people say things)

I'm a 27 y/o male in Chicago, with a B.A working as an Account Manager in the Logistics industry. 3rd job out of college and have had it for 2.5 years. My job is to try and grow current accounts. I was recently put under some serious pressure performance wise and cant see myself in this position much longer whether it be my choice or theirs. I've realized I don't quite have the mindset or maybe even the intelligence for finding ways to expand business/ direct conversations in the right direction with clients in order to help my accounts grow.

I've always been pretty slow with processing information, whether it be at work or in school. Always needed extra time on tests, some memory issues etc.. so I've always been athletic in order to compensate for my lack of intelligence I guess.

Even though it sounds dumb, I really enjoy getting really good at one thing and become the best and fastest at it. I'm pretty competitive and feel that that mindset only truly comes out in a transactional atmosphere.  (Closing 5 sales on a day instead of one big sale every few months for example).

119,"About a year and a half ago I (M23) received a PS4 and the new Spider-Man game from my oldest brother J (M38). It was awesome and I had a ton of fun. The problem is with my OTHER brother D (M28).

D decided to get me a couple games like Destiny, God of War, and Assassin’s Creed Unity. He constantly asks me if I’ve played them, especially because Destiny and Assassin’s Creed are some of his all-time favorites. I know that. He tells me constantly. And I haven’t played any of them. At all. 

The problem is that I’m not interested in these games, with no plan to play them, and I don’t know how to tell him that. I know he’s going to ask why, or at least expect an explanation.

Part of it is that I’m not really a big fan of shooter games or narrative-heavy story-driven games (I’m perfectly fine with my Nintendo Switch right now). The other part is that my brother D was mean and dickish most of my life, and I generally try to avoid him as much as possible. There’s also some irrational part of me that automatically judges anything he does or likes as stupid and crap, because he was (and sometimes is) a stupid and crap person.

Don’t get me wrong, D was never abusive, he can just be self-centered and inconsiderate. Plus he used to beat me up and insult me when we were younger, and even though I’m bigger than he is now, in my mind he’s still bigger and more threatening.

To be honest, I’m scared of telling him the truth (or at least the part of it about me simply not liking these kinds of games). I’m scared he’ll get upset and angry and hold it against me. “I got these games for you, for free, why the hell won’t you play them?! You think you’re better than me?!”

126,"Sup! Looking for some career advice. I'm also writing this as a therapeutic thing because I've been having trouble sleeping since this has been on my mind 24/7 and need to get it off my chest. I'm a 27 y/o male in Chicago, with a B.A working as an Account Manager in the Logistics industry. 3rd job out of college and have had it for 2.5 years. My job is to try and grow current accounts. I was recently put under some serious pressure performance wise and cant see myself in this position much longer whether it be my choice or theirs. I've realized I don't quite have the mindset or maybe even the intelligence for finding ways to expand business/ direct conversations in the right direction with clients in order to help my accounts grow.

I've always been pretty slow with processing information, whether it be at work or in school. Always needed extra time on tests, some memory issues etc.. so I've always been athletic in order to compensate for my lack of intelligence I guess.

Even though it sounds dumb, I really enjoy getting really good at one thing and become the best and fastest at it. I'm pretty competitive and feel that that mindset only truly comes out in a transactional atmosphere.  (Closing 5 sales on a day instead of one big sale every few months for example). I also love to run and help customize running plans as a side business. Just a few customers, nothing huge but something I enjoy. 

Does anyone think they know an interesting position I could look into?",09Aug2019,2
128,"Hi all,

I'm asking for advice on really two separate but related things. So I'm 19, a few months away from 20, and have never been in a relationship before. To this point I've never been that interested in pursuing one, but I also struggle with low self esteem and anxiety so I'm sure that hasn't helped either. This summer has been somewhat of a lonely time for me and recent events have made me start thinking more than ever about girls and relationships. 

Over a month ago I visited an ice cream place near my house and saw this really cute girl who worked there. Me being me I was too nervous to talk to her and ordered my ice cream and left. Now for about a week or so this girl was all I thought about and I imagined her as this perfect person who I could not let slip away. It became an infatuation and I knew this at the time but didn't really care. Another week went by and I went to see her a couple times before I had enough and decided to just ask her out. Long story short I chickened out and felt really bad about it. 

Now fast forward to this week. I pretty much gave up on the first girl which may or may not be a stupid thing to do, I really don't know. Here comes the dumbest part of the story: a few days ago I'm watching YouTube and stumble upon this semi-popular college vlogger. I watch one of her videos and notice one of her friends in the video who is probably one of the cutest girls I've ever seen. I watch some more of the video and watch other videos where she makes an appearance and fall in love with her personality and basically everything about her. I literally smile when I see her. What's stupid is that if the ice cream girl didn't amount to anything, how would this? She does go to a school that's only a state over from me, but the only way of contacting her would be through her popular YouTube friend's instagram, which seems weird.

Ultimately, my questions are: is something wrong with me that I seem so prone to obsessing over girls in this way at this time in my life? Does something need to change? Additionally, should I try to ask this YouTube girl about her friend, and if not, how can I try to get over her?

Sorry if this was long but I needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for your time.",09Aug2019,1

Id go into first period sick to my stomach and have a headache all day along with a constant butterfly like feeling in my stomach that would hurt my stomach. It killed my appetite and all I would do is worry. This is a point where I was becoming regularly physically ill due to anxiety and I can’t go back to this. This year brings a whole slew of new problems. All my friends left this school and I have to sit alone at lunch and I can’t change lunch periods or anything.

140,"Don’t know if trigger warnings are needed, but here’s one just in case. As the title suggests, I talk about mental health, self harm, and suicide. Please take of yourselves.

———————————

My mom has ignored my mental health struggles since she found out I even had problems in the first place. In 6th grade, I started self harming. She once saw the cuts on my arm and yelled at me, accusing me of being in a gang of all things. I yelled at her in frustration and she told me I was a disappointment. I write about how I’m feeling to calm myself down on paper sometimes — I have a whole stack of letters that are at least 5-6 years old, which she also found and ignored even though I know she read them. One time my friends came over when my mom was out to comfort me during one of my breakdowns (I didn’t ask them to, I didn’t let them into the house and told them to leave), but my mom saw them walking back home and proceeded to yell at me for being “selfish”. For almost a whole year I skipped out on dinner completely (I lose appetite when I’m going through an “episode”), which she noticed, but didn’t intervene. I have attempted suicide 2 times (nothing so serious that I needed to go to the hospital), and she knew, but still didn’t do anything.

Despite this, we maintain a good relationship. I blame her ignorance on a cultural difference (my mom was born and raised in a country where people who are mentally ill are generally looked down upon, I was raised in the US in the age of social media where mental health is a lot more open and talked about). She is a loving mother despite her flaws. She just doesn’t understand the severity of my situation. When I’m able to come out of my room, we have lovely conversations and she is a fun person to be around. I really do love her, which makes this sound like an emotionally abusive/manipulative relationship, but I promise you it is not. She just does not know any better.

However, as I get older, I am tired of letting her get away with her ignorance. She still thinks my struggles are dumb and I should “get over it”. I do feel ungrateful in a way, seeing as I have it “better” than most people, which she has said is a reason why I have “nothing to be sad about”. I have never corrected her and let her keep thinking this way. I have received no personal or professional help even when I explicitly asked her (which means I am not clinically diagnosed with anything but I am certain there is something wrong with my mind). I desperately want to call her out so I can finally get the help that I need, but I’m afraid of looking like an asshole since she is my mom after all (we are an Asian household... talking back to your parents isn’t exactly the best thing to do).

So I guess I’m just asking... how should I handle this situation? I want my mom to understand how lonely she has made me feel by ignoring my struggles, but I don’t want to hinder our relationship either.",09Aug2019,1
141,"Okay so.

I'm a rising senior in high school. My mom has constantly been nagging to me about what I'm gonna do after high school, what am I gonna study, how am I gonna study, how am I gonna pay for it, am I gonna move to Nashville with her, etc. 

I know she's trying to help me get prepared but I cannot help but be so damn annoyed when she brings this topic up. I try not to because again, she's trying to look out for me, but it completely destroys my mood when she brings up college. Like I don't even want to worry about it every damn day. I just want to enjoy what I'm doing right now and she's constantly hopping on my ass in the car about college. 

She's constantly asked me if I know what I'm gonna study and I just say medicine as a filler so she can bother me less but she won't. This whole past year in fact has been her bringing up college in every damn conversation.

Yes I know what college I'm going to. No I don't know exactly what I'm gonna study to be frank cause these past years my insecurities destroyed my mood and they were the only things I focused on. I have no fucking idea how I'm gonna do the dreams I wanna do like traveling the world but I wanna do it.

As of March -April I have been working at Home Depot in a seasonal garden sales associate position, however as of right now their hours have been cut at least until Thanksgiving and Christmas. However I've committed to paying rent and utilities off-campus going into my junior year of college. 

In order to make more money and get more hours, I decided to apply for a position at Rite Aid that was advertised as full-time, but ultimately is a 10 hour a week gig unless I prove myself.

On top of that, I have also decided to pursue a job at Shop Rite where I have been told that I should expect 25 to 35 hours a week. 

Both Rite Aid and ShopRite are within walking distance of my house and school whereas Home Depot is a 10 minute drive and I don't have a car of my own.

My question is whether I should work only at ShopRite, ShopRite and Rite Aid, Rite Aid and Home Depot, or ShopRite and Home Depot while going to school full-time, interning, and acting as an event chair for an on campus club I'm passionate about

My biggest issue is that I love working at Home Depot but in my position there the hours are not consistent. I love the idea that I could go around the corner to work instead of worrying about transportation to work and back home.

144,"We recently bought a conure and I thought we fell in love with her instantly. We’ve had her for 5 days, and we’ve managed to teach her to step up and give a kiss. For gods sake she even snuggles up against us when she’s tired. And she’ll sleep on our shoulder or in our shirt until we put her in her cage. She’s beautiful and she’s already gotten attached. The baby climbs down her little bird gym thing and waddles on over to us like a baby duckling. And now my mom wants to give her away. 


She wants to give her away because in her opinion, a bird is useless unless they talk. For 5 days she’s been trying to teach our little Mango (the bird) to talk. Only 5 days. And she expects it to be writing a 400 word essay. She says she wants to return the bird and buy a PARROT. Not only are parrots harder to clean up after, loud as balls and huge, they will hurt our parakeets.


We got our parakeets (1 y.o and 2 y.o) as our fist birds, and they’re my absolute joy. And our conure gets along fine with them. Sure, they fight a bit but most of the time they stay out of each others way. My 2 y.o parakeet is a fighter. She will not back down. Never. Even with the conure, which is twice as big as her. I’m scared that a parrot will potentially kill her. 


My mom doesn’t care about having a bird because you love them, and they’re sweet and kind and make for really cute pics (PM me and I can send you some pics) but rather she wants them to talk. That’s it.


I’n short, I’ve grown attached to this conure and she’s grown attached to us. I can’t just give her back to the store (14 day return policy) I’m not heartless. The poor bird will be heartbroken when we drop her back there and never see her again. I don’t know how to convince my mom to keep her. I’ve made it clear that if she gives away the conure and gets a parrot, I’m not taking care of it. It’s not my bird and not my responsibility.

My bf and I have been together 8 months and I’m 18 he’s almost.  (I’ve already heard everything about how I’m young and can find someone new and so this doesn’t matter. I don’t want that thanks:) ) we are both fresh out of high school and having a lot of problems. First off our living situation is pretty weird and not ideal. So we met when we both lived in Europe but after I graduated my family moved back to the USA. He met me here soon after cus why not we didn’t have better plans and so for about a month he’s been living with me at my parents house. We wanted to travel for a year before college (do it cheap in a van) but recently tensions have been getting really high and I out of the blue canceled those plans. I’ve been really stressed and worked up over everything. I can’t really function with my anxiety and I need to work on that asap right here in the USA in my town. I can’t give myself to a relationship rn cus of my mental state which means I need space. Lots of space. The issue is we can’t figure out how. I’ve been going back and forth on a break up cus that’s the only solution I can see sometimes but I really do love him and I don’t want to leave someone I love. He can’t really go back to Europe and wait till I’m better either cus that is way too expensive. He’s not a us citizen (he won’t even be legally allowed  here in a month or so but that’s another issue), and he isn’t 18 just yet so moving out renting his own place is pretty much impossible not even taking into account the money issue. My anxiety and our constant closeness is causing me to push him away and I’m afraid it will end us. I just need some advice on what to do because I do love him I just need time to work on myself and be on a break before I can commit to being able to be fully there for him and us. Where can he go? What can we do?

He was extremely sheltered at the time; he had never drank or had sex before, but one night we got drunk on vodka and we got in my bed and he gave me a blowjob. I asked him if he wanted to do it and he said yes. A week later, he asked me to apologize to him and I did.

149,"So I just got my first job this week (wooo!) and it's definitely a different experience. For some background information, I work at a franchise that's well known for its hospitality and customer service.  This encounter happened in my first week training. As I was VERY new with no knowledge on how to work the registers or how to make the drinks, I had to learn everything on my own since the staff was busy doing their own thing. It was around the time where I was about to leave so I went ahead and told a supervisor that I was heading out in 10 minutes and if she could show me how to clock out on the machine. She showed me how to and I clocked out right in front of her.

As I was getting ready to leave, I told the supervisor that I was leaving and that my parents were in the parking lot waiting for me. She stopped me and told me that I had to learn how to do something real quick (took about 20 minutes). Knowing that my parents were in the parking lot for over 30 minutes, I went ahead and texted my mom on my apple watch that I'll be out in a few minutes (keep in mind, I was already clocked out so I wasn't working at all and was in the back of the kitchen near all of the personal items. One of the kitchen staff told me to get off my watch and that I need to put that away. After that was all done, I told her that I'm heading out and I hoped she had a nice day. She just replied with ""Okay. At least you learned one thing today!"". I told my parents what happened and they said that I shouldn't have done that work since it all went unpaid and that nobody other than the manager/boss can tell me what to do (regarding the watch thing). 

Another incident happened on the same day with the same manager. She told me to restock the cups. Not knowing how to do it, I told the manager that I was new and didn't know how, and if she could teach me. She flipped out and started going off in front of the customers saying that I should know and demanded me to do it. (Without even showing me lol.) 

I'm not the type of person to say something/complain but did I do anything necessarily wrong? I know that it's something minor and what a lot of people have to deal with when working customer service, but I just wanted advice on what I should do next.

156,"Well so basically, if my mom needs something out of the bathroom, urgent or not, she’ll just barge in while I’m in the middle of using the toilet. Needless to say, I’m a modest person and I find it to be humiliating.

Whenever I go on about it, she says that it’s her house so it doesn’t matter. I honestly don’t think she can grasp the fact that walking in on me is embarrassing. If she does, she just couldn’t care less.

This’s coming from the lady that gets changed with the door open and talks about how her seeing me naked (like full-on NUDITY) should be okay because she gave birth to me. And hey, maybe I’m weird because of how much of a prude I am, but I HATE that and I think it’s ridiculous. I used to only wear long sleeves because I didn’t like having my arms out, this ain’t a game to me.

Anyway, I’m moving out in about a month, but I’ll still have to come back for all the breaks and summer vacation. How do I get my point across to her? Funny enough, she had the audacity to ask me to live with her throughout college, as if she doesn’t treat me like *this*.

I’m also very unliked at my school because I couldn’t keep my mouth shut and dated the wrong guys and even helped one cheat on his girlfriend.

163,"Title pretty much explains it. My roommate has some odd as fuck living habits. One of which he just puts stuff in the fridge and NEVER properly covers it. He'll cook a full meal with chicken and veggies but make too much and just put a paper towerl on a plate and leave it in the fridge for days. 

Currently there is a half used tray of breakfast sausage sitting there uncovered. He stored it on the top shelf, so I put it in the bottom as I was also taught raw shit goes UNDER the cooked stuff. My fucking god I swear this man was never taught how to live. 

So the raw meat is now in one of the draws UNDER everything but still unopened. He doesnt have bags, I could use one of my ziplocks but hell just throw it away tomorrow morning and put it back uncovered cause he's lazy as fuck.

Before you say it, yes I plan on moving out I just need to wait the 7ish months left on our lease. 

But long story short, are there health concerns if he stores uncovered raw meat around my food. For instance I buy 2 iced chais from starbucks and store one in the fridge. Can germs from the uncovered raw meat fuck with my dairy based drink that has the normal hole in the top for a straw? That's the only thing I can think that I store that air can get to.",09Aug2019,1

167,"One of my old friends from freshman year of college that I was pretty close with wrote me while I was on vacation. I didn’t check my phone while I was on vacation because I like to enjoy the here and now, but what I read when I got back was chilling to say the least. 

A bit of background: this dude is MAD smart and genuinely a good guy. He used to write me excited about helping people overcome anxiety and depression and helping people set goals. He said he knew he was making a difference. He was always naturally the center of attention when we hung out with our friend group because he was just so likable. Then out of the blue I get hit with this:

He was on snap and I posted my road trip to the beach on there so he knew I was gone; this is what he wrote.

“Hope you’re enjoying your vacation. I’m going to be taking a vacation of sorts myself. I look back on our friendship and the type of friendships I had back in the day and I found myself asking “when did I become this.... thing”. I put my time in helping people and I don’t have it in me to keep doing it anymore. I went from having regular friends to playing shrink for people I met. The effort just isn’t showing results anymore. Now I find myself waiting around to meet new people and go back to the humorous guy I used to be but I feel like I’ve done my time on all fronts. We had a good run, but I think we both know that it’s over now. All good things come to an end, but I think it’s worth noting I enjoyed life much better back when I was normal. Thank you for giving me that chance while we were still close. Goodbye my friend.” 

Now my first thought was that this dude was gonna off himself and that scared me. It was even scarier when I called him an the number wasn’t in service anymore. I called a few friends from our old freshman friend group and it was more or less the same story for all of them.

We checked Snapchat and he was gone, his Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook were all gone.

I was so scared because he moved back home so I didn’t even know how to find him. I finally found one of his friends I knew he works with on Snapchat. HE QUIT HIS JOB TOO. He was able to get more info tho because he called the police on him. They showed up to his house and he’s alive and safe, but he wouldn’t answer the door for his friend when he came to his house after that. 

I have a number of feelings about this but I wanna know why someone would shut themselves out like that and if it might help to go try to see him?",09Aug2019,1

My older brother is 33 and still lives at home. They don't treat him the way they treat me. He does whatever the fuck he wants. I honestly feel like I'm reverting back to being a teenager. My mental state is that of a teenager and I hate it. The thought of moving out is consuming nearly every second of my life. However, when I'm planning it out, I'm also scared because thus far...I've had to seek the approval of my parents for nearly everything. 

I had to fight my dad to BUY MY OWN CAR WITH MY OWN MONEY. If I wanted to go out somewhere I can't tell them, I have to ask them. I've been told that if I drink in or outside of the house...they'll kick me out. Like tonight for instance I'm seriously considering sneaking in a beer. I'm 28 for fucks sake! 

I feel like this is a big reason for why I can't keep a friend around. Cause when we want to do something I say ""I have to ask"" and I truly believe I have to ask for permission.

178,"Sorry for such a long post but this issue has many layers. I am a 17 year old male senior in high school. I am driving my friend (17 year old female senior in high school who I’ve know for 10+ years and am in JROTC with) to her house after school so she doesn’t have to wait for the bus (we both have early dismissal and leave like 1 and a half hours early). My parents have already gotten on to me for driving friends around. I am not a reckless driver but they are worried that if I am hit and my friends got hurt that I would be sued by their parents.

I want to drive her home because in December, JROTC always has our Military Ball where we all get together and hang out eat dinner then go to a dance. I plan on either asking this girl to go as friends (her boyfriend is in the military and may not be able to come home to take her to the dance) or get her to help me find someone to take (I am socially awkward and have a hard time talking to girls other than her and I am the Battalion Commander of my JROTC unit so it’s not like I can just show up without a date ). So having time to talk on the 30min ride in the afternoon everyday is nice to build our friendship and discuss. I don’t plan to stay at her house after I take her home (she has a boyfriend). 

The issue is my parents will find out sooner or later and I will get in huge trouble. They pay for my gas since I bought my own truck and if they find out that I’m driving her around they may stop paying for my gas. My mom has already seen a text from her asking something like “hey what time are we leaving tomorrow” and I had to tell her she was sending it to someone else in a Group chat. Also, her parents want to meet me since I’ll be driving her around. This wouldn’t be much of an issue if my mom wasn’t tracking my phone. So if I stay at her house for too long she will know something is up since I don’t really hang out at her house. I can drive by to drop her off but anything longer than 2 min will seem suspicious. 

I can’t decide if I should just tell my mom that I’m taking her home from school and hope for the best or just keep hiding it from her. My friend is hoping to get a car before January so I just need to hide it until she can get a car of her own. What are your thoughts?",09Aug2019,1

I have a basic plan for what I'm going to do. After I turn 16, I'll get my permit, start driving school, get a job, then get my license. I know what school I want to go to when I graduate, and it's a state away. I want to find an apartment to stay in as well, which requires a good salary to do.

10 days ago I got my hair cut and colored. I wanted essentially my natural color but to cover the silver strands I’m getting. I don’t have many, maybe, maybe one per every 1”x1” square section. She decided to use a semi-permanent color so it would fade more naturally.

Well the dye it didn’t stick to the silver Hairs. I was disappointed but not upset. I liked the color. But she insisted they were noticeable and she wanted to fix it. She asked if I could come in the next few days but I was leaving for a wedding so I went today. 

I went in, she touched up my hair (super meticulously! I was surprised but the care) by combing and dying mainly just the silvers. She apologized that I had to come back in and that it didn’t stick. 

I went to cash out and the salon owner (not her) charged me the price of a complete dye. I wasn’t expecting no charge but if I know I was going to be paying to dye my hair twice I wouldn’t have come back because I simply can’t afford it and would have dealt with the silvers. I was shocked and didn’t say anything in the moment, I’m not great at being assertive. But I assume she heard the price and didn’t correct him as she was standing right there.

197,"This sounds really stupid, so please bear with me. I think that I am objectively relatively good looking. I get a lot of compliments about my appearence and often get a lot of ""benefits"" from such. 

However, every time I look at the mirror, I HATE (and I mean HATE) what I see. I nit-pick dumb things that I realize nobody notices and then lie down and think about all the times someone implied (or I perceived) I was ugly. 

Growing up, I was bullied relentlessly by my own mother and by my peers. It destroyed my self-esteem and caused me to obsess over my appearance. 

Every time I gain a little bit of weight, I punish myself by not eating. I can't get over how asymmetrical my face seems to be. I hate the shape of my body. I cannot stop looking at mirrors to find something else to pick at. It consumes me. Over the years, it has gotten worse and worse. I'm 23 (turning 24 in less than a month) and already vapidly obsessing over wrinkles.

I know it's stupid. I know it's irrational. I can't stop. I really can't stop. I think I'm going crazy. I have thought about carving my own fucking face in a fit of rage over how much I hate it. I won't ever act upon it, but that doesn't feel normal or right. It consumes me. I don't understand why I hate myself so much.

And it's not just looks, either. It's my intelligence and value as a human being that I often question. I can't stop comparing myself to others, or thinking my life has no value. 

I know it's irrational. I know. When I look at things objectively, I'm doing fine, but it's difficult to look at things objectively when my mind is constantly bombarded by self hatred. I crave validation and attention constantly because I can't stand my own head sometimes.

I know this is super pathetic to write about, I'm sorry this sounds like whining.

199,"So I've been mulling this over since my first job and I just don't see a path forward right now. I hate working jobs. Obviously that's alittle over simplified but that's the gist. This isn't some ""I want to sit at home and play video games all day"" kind of job hating. Once I start a job my mental health slowly starts to deteriorate until I have to quit. I don't want to work for 50 years of my life just to retire and then do all the stuff I wanted to do when I was young. Life seems like a waste to just work for most of it and have small hobbies that I don't actually get to pursue. This probably sounds like some teenage bullshit and that's most likely how people will read it but I'm hoping for a few people who understand me and go through something similar. How would you recommend I try and live in a society that I don't fit into. Maybe a weird alternative job style that I can try?",09Aug2019,2
200,"Hello redditors. Brief break down of who I am: 21 yo female, first gem Canadian and educated, middle class family and just graduated with BSc in Biology Honours, 3.9 GPA

So I got a university degree, in debt free and living with my parents. I don’t know what to do with life. I’m not about travelling or volunteering and getting a job is difficult. I graduated 2 months ago and all I’ve done is go to the gym. Should I just work at a fast food place to get some savings and help my parents or like spend more time “figuring it out”. I am bored and might do grad school but I honestly think it won’t make a difference. Professional schools sound like too much work and I haven’t really looked into it enough. Give me some inspiration!! Maybe you could share your story or someone you know because I feel like I’m falling (idk how, it’s just what I feel). Much appreciated 💕",09Aug2019,1
201,"Gonna try to keep this short and sweet.  Throwaway b/c lots and lots of people know my main, including my coworkers.

So, I've been at my company for 7 years.  Two different departments, and in my current department I know 90% of the work there is to be done, as well as a bit of extra behind the scenes troubleshooting.

A couple of weeks ago my manager and my coworkers and I were having a discussion and we were asking what it takes to be promoted, would we ever be considered to be promoted, etc.  Our manager said to send her an instant message if we felt that we should be promoted.

I waited a few days to sort my thoughts on the matter, then I sent a lengthy email wherein I spoke only about myself and all the positive reasons why I should be promoted.  I never once threw anyone under the bus or spoke poorly against others though I wanted to, if I am being honest!

Nothing came of it and I really didn't expect my manager to answer because, like in many things at my job, there's always big words but nothing ever comes of anything.  And I forgot about it, until today when I unexpectedly and accidentally saw my supervisor filling out a form on his computer that said something about ""promotion"" on his screen.  It was a big, bold title which is why my eye was drawn to it.  I did not see who it was about.  I saw nothing other than it being a form dealing with promotions.  In fact, my supervisor was going out of his way to hide what he was typing.  The only reason I saw it was because I happened to turn around to ask him a question and it was up on his screen.  He does not know that I saw it.

Now, if it isn't me that's getting that promotion I'm going to be devastated.  I've been trying really hard and I put a lot of effort into that justification of promoting me email as well as my work in general.  I'd be happy if it was another coworker but also very upset b/c I truly feel that I'm the most qualified out of everyone based on my work ethic and length of time at the company.  I'd be so upset that -yet again- I'd been passed over for a promotion that I very clearly stated I wanted (and if I wasn't yet ready I wanted to know what else I should be doing to get there) that my first gut reaction would be say 'congrats' to the person (if it isn't me) and just get up and walk out of the office never to return again.

Obviously I can't do that (I mean I really would miss some of the my desk decor and I do need the small amount of $$ I bring in) but I honestly don't know how to handle it.  Just looking for some advice as to what I should do in the event that I don't get this promotion.

204,"So I've been talking with this girl for about a year and a half now and over time I've started to really like her. I told her a long time ago that I was starting to crush on her but didn't like it. I feel really bad about that, not so much for whatever I was feeling, but because of how I went about it/how long we had been talking when I said this (maybe 4-8months in). Fast forward to now and I've been pretty good about keeping romantic feelings away from her with the exception of some ""what if"" feelings every now and then. 

I recently found out that she has thought I was cute this entire time and once again I'm getting myself caught in a ""what if she likes me back, these feelings would be ok then"" train of thought. 

Another big problem here is that I just recently told her how i regretted saying i was crushing on her and how i felt it was weird. All she really had to say about it was that I seemed to have moved on so she shouldn't be worried. I replied with it was one sided so yeah

And for the bombshell on why I feel weird about this-
It's an online friendship and we are on opposite sided of the world. We've never met. We haven't even verbally spoken to each other. I heard her voice once for like 3 seconds but she hasn't heard mine. 
This girl has been one of the nicest friends I've ever had and I am always eager to talk. She is awesome. 

Yesterday we were talking about inboxes blowing up and I told her about how when a post of mine got slightly popular I had notifications randomly for like 3 days and she asked what the post was. The only problem is the post is about her (see post history) I don't know if I should let her see the post after what told her just days ago. I've been just fine suppressing my feelings so I definitely could continue on with it.

205,"I am a 19 year girl who is getting ready to graduate college (i’m very far ahead). My childhood wasn’t the easiest, i was mentally, physically, and sexually abused by my mother and her boyfriends. Because of this I have developed a lot of mental health issues along the way (Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety, PTSD), which I am being treated for. I have been with my now ex-boyfriend since I was 15 years old. I have trouble trusting that he won’t hurt me or take advantage of me, but he never knew why. I recently told him about my childhood and what i went through and why a relationship between us was so hard (i’ve never told anyone before). He was upset but understanding, saying that he the relationship would’ve worked out better had I allowed him to be there for me.

206,"I'm going back to college soon and I have I wanted to start working out. Here's what I have. I have classes after 9am this semester.

Morning:
Stretch for 3-5 minutes
Do 10-15 situps and 5-10 pushups (I have no arm strength)
Brisk walk for 30-45 minutes
Stretch to cool off

Evening (at the gym):
Maybe stretch
Walk/jog on the treadmill for 10-15 minutes
Leg and/or arm workouts (no set amount of time, I don't have a specific number. I'm fine as long as I do at least 15 reps in a set  and gradually increase as I go along.)
Planks for 1 minute
Stretch when done

Is this okay? Do I need to add or take away? Is the stretching too much (should I limit how often I do this)?

207,"I know this topic is subjective to however I am, but I just feel like asking anyway so that I can ease my mind.

I have a couple of friends who were planning to hang out this weekend. I’ve known these friends ever since we were kids, and I’m definitely comfortable with them. But, a lot of them are planning on either getting either as drunk or as high as possible. And I think I’m the only one who just hasn’t been exposed to it due to my conservative parents being strict on me when I was younger + not really wanting to see how any of that stuff affects me after doing it because I had other personal issues to deal with.

Since they engage in this stuff more often now, I’ve slowly learned to become more accepting in their occasional use after doing more research on it. But, somehow, the temptation’s grown stronger in me to join them just because I seem to be the only one who hasn’t done either of those things, and I hate feeling left out in social situations. And I hate how that’s my main reason for wanting to try it. They’re not even outright pressuring me to give in; in fact, they’re okay if I’m just there trying to enjoy the night like the rest of them are, only sober. But, something keeps telling me I’m missing out.

tl;dr: is it bad if I try one of these things just because I wanna fit in with the rest of them?",09Aug2019,1
208,"My daughter (10 years old) and I were having a conversation tonight about secrets (because she was keeping a cookie she shouldn't have) and she let it slip that that wasn't the only secret she was keeping, that her dad (we've been broken up for 7 years) had told her to keep a secret from me, and the secret was that she was going to have a half-sister. 

She didn't know many of the details, just that one of her dad's good friends' (female) wanted to have a baby and he was 'helping' her with it, that the baby is a girl, and due in January. I don't know any of the details around it; whether he intends to be on the birth certificate, whether he intends to be 'dad' in this child's life, whether my daughter will get to know her half-sister, or anything at all. But I assume that she will at least get to see her half-sister, since he told her about it.

And now I'm not sure how to deal with this. Part of me wants to approach him with my questions, so I can help my daughter through what could very well be a life-changing event for her. But then I feel like if I do, he'll know she didn't keep the secret and he'll get very upset with her, and I'll have betrayed her confidence, which I don't want to do. 

Also, on the matter of child support. He does not and has never paid it. Part of me thinks that, with this new development, I should be more firm about it. He's not a great dad to my daughter, only sees her one night a week, if that, constantly bailing.  And he doesn't help with expenses, either.

And then, lastly, I'm livid that he told my daughter to keep a secret from me. I don't know how to address any of this. Or if I even should.

211,"This is not my main account, because I don't know whether 41M (and also other people who know of this) ever browse(s) reddit and might recognise the story. I also posted this in another sub, I hope this does not violate any community guidelines.

I will try to give as many details as possible and go on some tangents, it may turn out to be quite long (there's the TL;DR! at the end) in order to give a good overview of what happened.

I (then 24F) moved to a new city for my studies and moved in with then 38M and his then 61F mother, because I had trouble finding a place and they had offered me a room for rent (they are distant relatives of a former good friend of mine from back home). The plan was to live with them for the first three months before then moving in with other students I had met through my uni board. A bit of info on my state at the time: My dad had committed suicide about 1.5 years before I moved to the new city, and I had spent this time leading up to my move by being confused, angry, drifting around in the world and running away from everyone and everything, so I was not exactly my most 'comfortable' self when moving (I don't know how else to describe it, but I was in an odd state, as if everything that was ‘me’ had been wiped and I then had to come up with characteristics that 'make' me). I was very depressed and frankly just wanted to be alone and focus on my studies and other aspects of my life, and I especially didn't want to be part of a family situation, but I couldn't afford to live on my own.

So, I moved in and was planning to do my own thing and not engage with them more than necessary, but I also felt obliged to be kind and friendly (a result of feeling guilty about my dad’s suicide, which is something that happens with such deaths), and I felt obliged to explore the new city, so I went along whenever they invited me to have dinner with other family members or when 38M suggested activities. It was fun and I enjoyed spending time with 38M, because we shared some interests, but I suspect that I felt closer to him than he did to me; because of that depressed state I hardly felt like opening up/was not really able to share my personality, my interests - you know, just regular life stuff, banter and whatnot, natural interaction. I was so withdrawn and unable to 'show' myself, but it's hard to tell how he perceived this, because these things sometimes appear to be quite different from the outside. Anyway, we hung out on many occasions (living together, duh) inside and outside of the house, and I ended up telling him about my dad's suicide (which was sort of the only thing I ever thought about even though I also didn't think about it, because my mind felt blank all the time - hard to explain, but that's as close as it gets). I liked him a lot, but as I said I felt he had a hard time connecting with me, because I often behaved in a strange manner. (If you want examples of this behaviour, I am happy to answer, but I won't go into more detail here.) All this left me feeling quite 'saturated' regarding human contact, so I rarely socialised when at university, which, looking back, makes me angry, because I feel I missed out on making more meaningful connections that could have helped me through the difficult time that followed (I made some friends, but under normal circumstances I think I would have made way more friends) – I know it’s not fair of me to blame him for that, because ultimately it was my decision. It’s just that I did not want a family and was forced into it and then started opening up, but was eventually disappointed and rejected, but I’ll get to that.

Fast forward towards the end of my three months with 38M and 61F. We went out and got really drunk and stayed awake until god knows when, I suggested we watch a movie and then sleep in my room. He didn't really want to at first and was like 'I won't come to your room, because then we'd just end up having sex (he said it in a more vague way, but that was the message), but I insisted (that's also a reason why I feel bad... essentially it was me who tried to convince him, and he gave in). Obviously, we ended up in bed together. A little tangent here - I am quite inexperienced sexually and with relationships, I had only slept with one other guy before that (and not that many times). And all that obviously really showed, I'm still embarrassed about that. He fingered me, but I didn't do anything for him, and we didn't end up having sex-sex, you know, the actual sexual act (to me, personally, anything sexual that involves the privates is considered 'sex' in other contexts, btw, but whatever, just to clarify).

Next day we went outside in the evening (during the day he went to do some shopping with his mum, which I found a bit annoying because I would have liked to spend the day together which we had planned to do initially, but I just did my own thing as well), and he addressed what had happened the night before and was like 'This was a mistake, it should not have happened, it was just because we were drunk, etc.' And I didn't really know what to say, because even though it was true that we had been very drunk, and even though in my normal state of mind I probably would have said the same about it having been a mistake (which under normal circumstances I would not have let happen, because I am really controlled when it comes to having sex), I had been fully conscious the night before and I had wanted what had happened. I was hurt, but I was unable to express that, so I just got angry and tried to reason with him about why he thought it was a mistake. It led nowhere and I just busied myself with uni for a few days and pretended nothing had happened (after all we were still living together, so I tried to not make things more awkward, and maybe I was hoping he'd change his mind). Then a few days later he went to some work event and got really drunk and high, and when he got home he came to my room (I was still up and my door was open because I had gone to the kitchen before), and he went 'That party really sucked, can you give me a hug?' And I was like, 'Ok, sure, haha.' So he hugged me and fell over, and then we were lying on the floor and kind of messed around (like wrestling sort of and tickling, nothing sexual but flirty - yes, stupid, I should have known better, since he had made it so clear that what had happened was such a mistake to him. Anyway, naive me suggested he could sleep on the floor or in my bed if he wanted, and yes, I was aware of where things might lead, but again, I had not given up hope just yet. When he ended up staying, things obviously got sexual again. He fingered me again, and we messed around for a bit, and then we fell asleep. (I again hadn't done anything to get him off, because I didn't really know what and how. I still feel bad about that, and it wasn't even that I had no idea what could be done, I was just not sure how to go about it and my zapped-out state of mind surely played a huge part in that.) In the morning when we woke up really early, I was like let's have sex. He didn't really want to at first and said it might not be a good idea (yes, another reason why I feel like it was all my own fault), but then I ended up convincing him. I got him a condom (he didn't have any) which was way too small for him, and when he was inside of me he went soft and he said it was the condom (tangent: I also don't know whether that had something to do with me, or with the condom, but I didn't end up asking, I still worry that there was something wrong with me, but that's beside the point now). We both left the house in the morning. Later, when I was in uni he texted me and asked how he had ended up in my bed, so I told him, and he was like 'I don't remember anything, I was really drunk.' It annoyed me a bit and I said something about him avoiding responsibility, but I left it at that. In the evening we briefly talked. He did remember the night and me, but he didn't remember how he had ended up in my bed. Things seemed fine, and we could have hung out (which is kind of what I actually wanted), but I was supposed to meet a friend, so I went to see them. I messaged him when I was with my friend if I could come to his room and just sleep there later; I clarified: JUST sleep. I know, this is such a strange thing to message, I hate remembering this, but it is what it is (once more, I was completely out of it at the time). He didn't reply, so when I got home, I knocked on his door, but he said it wasn't a good idea, so I just went to bed and then focused on other stuff for a bit.

Another few days later I felt the need to discuss what had happened and messaged him (he was out) and asked him to talk about it in person which ended up in a text fight. The thing is, I just didn't want to realise/understand that this guy clearly wanted nothing from me, that it had just all been a stupid 'accident' in the heat of the moment, and that I had a huge crush on him/was kind of in love with him and wanted him to reciprocate these feelings. Anyway, for the rest of the time I was there I mostly avoided him but at the same time we superficially got along (his mum being there made the situation much more awkward and made it hard to talk about what had happened, of course). Then I moved out and we actually left off ok and in peace, we messaged for a bit after and just sent back and forth some texts about random stuff. But I had not really given up hope (looking back that's what it was, because at the time I did not want to admit this to myself), and asked whether he wanted to hang out, but he didn't have time, and then I said I needed time away from him and all that had happened and he didn't reply, so that made me angry. And then I asked again if we could hang out (I know, ridiculous), then got angry again. Then a few days later I apologised for getting angry, and he said it was ok. (All of these interactions were over text, the last time I had seen him in person was the day I had moved out.) Then I was hoping he'd message, and obviously he never did, so about a month later I asked if he wanted to hang out. No answer. And then I sent a really, really long angry text, which was way overboard (I read it before, and it makes me wince). And he then replied quite angrily and called me a damaged person which particularly hurt me (tangent: I suspect he might have known this would hurt me, because we had previously talked about this - I am of the opinion that every life is worth living and change can happen if you work on yourself, and I was a bit sensitive regarding that because of my dad's suicide and all the guilt that goes with a person killing themselves etc.) and that he didn't want anything to do with me. So, I replied one last time, and I think this was the only honest thing I said to him regarding this situation. I basically admitted that I had feelings for him and had wanted things to go a different way, but had been unable to express any of that previously, because I worried/sensed he did not feel the same way and that I had tried to avoid being hurt by this realisation in that moment when he had said that all had been a mistake. I believe the text left almost nothing unsaid (tangent: except one thing he had misunderstood from the previous very long message which makes me mad to this day - he had misread and thought I had called him a 'relation', which I absolutely had not. No matter how zapped out I was, I was never that delusional). Anyway, I feel like there is nothing left to say regarding these events and my feelings at the time, really.

Why post here, then, you maybe ask now. I know it seems a bit like an 'offmychest' situation. It's just that I still miss him and also his family, because they were the first connections I made in the new city (I know I did not want a family back then, because I was running away from one, but of course that changed over time and when I started to heal a bit, at least. I’m aware no one owes me anything, I’m just trying to describe how I feel as candidly as I can). I miss his friendship, and maybe I wish he could see that the way I had been back then is not really me, and that if I had been 'normal' we would have gotten along really well and become good friends. I don't know why that's so important to me, it's as if I wanted to prove myself to him. But what's the point in that? I know it's all a bit ridiculous, but for some reason I can't seem to let go, even after all this time. I think this feeling that he never got to know the real me is part of the reason why I still can't let go; it makes me feel like I 'didn't get chance'.

I would like to contact him and ask how he's doing and maybe explain that I was quite out of it at the time and for some reason feel the need to tell him that to finally be at peace, and whether he'd like to meet up some time. I just feel like things were left off so awkward and bad, that this may be beyond repair and that he will find it weird, ridiculous and most of all annoying and will think of me as a joke. I'm just so ashamed of that whole situation. But again, I'm not sure if all seemed much worse from my perspective than it ever looked from the outside. Sometimes I wish he would reach out to me and asked me how I was, but I guess he either feels guilty about what happened or just doesn't care or thinks I’m a crazy person and too much hard work (also something he said in that angry text).

I am getting therapy for all my family issues, and I also discussed (and discuss) this issue with my therapist, and I'm trying to figure out why I can't let go and just move on and be happy with my life. Another reason why it's still bothering me is that it's inhibiting me from attempting anything new with another guy. I have not been interested in/tried to meet anybody since, and I feel the longer this goes on the worse it gets. And how would I ever explain to someone that I still haven't had a relationship. That makes me worried that I am actually damaged, like he said.

Another thing I would like to add is that I recently saw him on the street very briefly. I was driving past and I think he was with a girl, and no idea whether she was a girlfriend or just a friend, and frankly it’s none of my business (even though I have to admit that it is hurtful to see him happy while I still feel like I can't let go). Anyway, I did not stop to chat to him and I’m sure he didn’t see me. I’m wondering whether I should have and what I could have said, and I still don’t have an answer to that. Because of all this overthinking he has become a weird ghost-like presence in my life, and I fear that any interaction would be so burdened and made awkward by that.

TL;DR! I moved in with a guy 38M and his mum 61F, we sort of became friends (but probably more so from my side than from his, because I was not in the best mental state at the time due to my dad's suicide and was not really able to open up and show my personality), then we ended up in bed together and I would have been interested in more (which I couldn't really express to him at the time), but he wasn't, and if he ever had been, I surely had scared him away with my strange and out-of-character behaviour. Then, a bit before and after moving out (which had been planned since I had moved in with them, it's unrelated to what occurred) I sent many childish and vague texts and wasn't able to express my feelings clearly, which (understandably) ended up annoying him and must have looked kind of crazy. But then I sent a very honest and clear message, which tbf left nothing unsaid, and after that I never heard from him again. I still miss him/his friendship and am unsure whether I could contact him, ask how he's doing, briefly mention that my behaviour was out of character, and if he wants to meet up some time, or whether things were left too awkward and it's a situation beyond repair.",09Aug2019,1
212,"Quick backstory. I have a friend who is in love with my brother. She has suffered through so many horrible, abusive boys that when my sweet brother showed interest in her, she instantly fell for him. 

Except my brother is not sweet. He puts on a remarkably different &amp; kind face in public, but as soon as he’s around his family, he’s a completely different person. Around her, he talks about how loyal and honest he is and how he wouldn’t even consider talking to other girls. Then, he makes out with several other girls, leads others on, and then calls my best friend a bimbo who he has “no real connection to.” 

On one hand, I think I should warn her. On the other hand, I’m worried about damaging family relationships. (my mother said she would be upset that I tarnished his image &amp; he needs a good girl like her to help him shape up.) and, also, I’m genuinely afraid he might kill me. 

He is extremely violent and for years he has beat me, strangled me, and threatened to kill me more times than I can count. I always told myself it was my fault, but I’m starting to think that’s not true. I asked him to grab me a tissue so I could kill a spider. Just a minute later, I was pinned to the wall with a knife to my face because I am a “bossy bitch.” 

Which is another thing I worry about. If he were to end up marrying her or something, I really don’t think she’d be safe. He has tried to snap my limbs, pull up on my mother, snap my dad’s neck &amp; pound in the faces of any of his friends who oppose him. If he can do this to people he supposedly loves, what would he do to her? 

So anyways. Am I wrong to want to warn her? Should I do it? I don’t want to be out of line but I also care for my friend. I don’t know what to do.",09Aug2019,1
213,"I made this account so I could ask for anonymous advice for my TMI situation with my sister and her husband. I’ll try to spare unnecessary details. For some background I will explain that I am in high school (nearly graduating) and my sister is almost a decade older than I am. Despite such a large age gap we are close and have a good relationship. Since school has gotten out I frequently spend nights at her house (typically by her request). She invited me over often because her husband works until late at night and by the time he’s home neither of them feel like driving me home (I have no car). While I’m there we get along well and I even help her with a lot of household chores. They’re both sociable people and frequently have other guests over as well. And it was only a few months ago that I began unfortunately hearing them get intimate while I’m staying the night. This wouldn’t be a large problem if not for a few reasons. One, they don’t have actual bedroom but rather a loft. A.K.A where they sleep is open to the living room where I sleep on their couch. They don’t even have to be loud for me to hear them, I can hear them exhale from downstairs. Second, they have a habit of “doing it” at very inappropriate times such as when we’ve all just layed down to sleep or when their guests are already awake like nine in the morning. Third, they also have a habit of leaving their “waste” like used condoms, condom wrappers and soiled sheets out in the open. They’re have been times my sister sends me into her bathroom to get things for her and I see used condoms right on top of the trash can or when I’m doing laundry with their practically freshly “used” sheets. In the past she’s admitted to me that she doesn’t care about having sex when people are over because they’re “quiet” and she genuinely believes they are. They’re not, believe me. I don’t know how to remedy this besides not spending nights there anymore which I’ve started doing. But I feel like it’s creating problems between us she’s not even aware of. I can’t even imagine confronting her about it. She’d be mortified and her husband would probably find it hilarious. And before I get responses like “they’re married adults, get over it” I’m well aware they have sex. They have a kid and another one on the way. My issue is that they have no decency about when or who might hear. Not only that but the fact they invite me to stay the night then have no qualms about what I might overhear. And believe me I know what it’s like to have these kind of urges. I’m in an intimate relationship but I couldn’t even stomach the thought of “doing it” with family practically in the same room. While this hardly covers what I’ve said, in short, my sister and her husband’s sex life is causing issues between me and my sister.",09Aug2019,10
214,"I (F17) have always been too anxious to use a social media account that wasn’t anonymous. 

Since elementary school, I’m used to being the only one out of my peers without any sort of social media. I’ve struggled with anxiety and addiction at a young age, so I usually tell myself I’ll eventually get social media accounts when I’m less anxious. 

Although my anxiety has been getting better, I’m still too anxious to download Instagram. I’m scared it’ll hurt my mental health, and I’ll start comparing myself to social media too much. I’m also worried I’ll become addicted to it, since that’s something I also struggle with. 

There’s a little bit of a time pressure to get an Instagram, since I’ll be graduating high school soon and I really wanna keep in touch with my peers. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can manage a social media account without getting overly anxious or comparing myself to other people? Taking breaks from social media wouldn’t help me much either—even if I barely upload photos or never use it, I’d make me too anxious to know anyone can be stalking my account and judging me.",09Aug2019,1

I’m in 8th grade, and I’m going to do Math 1 at my highschool (advanced math), knowing that that means I thank take math 2 than math 3 than pre calculus and calculus ab. My brother is a senior and his is doing calculus ab, and he’s thinking of not doing it because of the difficultly and expectations. I know that if I do it, that would look really good on my transcript and such, but I’m scared that if down the line later into senior year when I have to do calculus ab that I’m not going to be able to do it and than I’ll only have 3 years of math, and usually it looks better to do 4 years of math and most colleges don’t take 3 years of math. I’m confident in myself that I can math 1 and so force, but I’m scared of those later years and feel like the choices I make right now impact me greatly down the line. If I step out right now I have to do a whole year of math that I already did, and I don’t want to, and idk i hate having to think about my future 4 years ahead I just want to have fun in 8th grade but at the same time accel and be advanced.

216,"This is my first time doing this or opening up to social media. No one who knows me knows the pain that I am going through. They all know the happy confident and happy guy. I am 22 years old. I’m currently in the Army Texas national guard. I just recently came back from training and felt really good about coming home and seeing my family. After a few weeks, I feel like I’m back in the same dark hole I use to be. I don’t have girl problems. I’m not insecure either so this isn’t about me. It has more to do with my family. My parents are divorced and I am the oldest out of my 4 siblings. Me and my mother along with my 4 siblings live together. My mom still has ptsd from my abusive father, she takes it out on all of us. Her biggest problem is that she doesn’t see it at all. I pay my own bills and help her with the utilities and rent but it’s never enough. I change her cars oil, give my siblings rides, let her use my car when hers broke down. I’ve done so so much for her. Yet she still has zero respect for me and it’s really toxic to the point where I’ve never received a thank you for anything. That I don’t mind, I mean I’m use to it. The biggest problem is the fact that she isn’t raising my siblings right. For the 6 months of me being gone, things got out of control. My sister got a boyfriend and they were caught by my brothers doing inappropriate things. She came home late and made my mom pick her up from work every night. Even tho my mom wakes up for work at 5am everyday. My sister doesn’t listen to me or has any motivation to succeed in life. I fear that if I leave, my brothers will become the same way. I don’t want that to happen. Yet it’s so hard to stay with such a toxic person. She always tells me that I don’t help enough and that I’m leeching off her. The only reason I’m still in the house she’s at is because my brothers need someone to look up to. Someone who will show them respect and discipline. Someone who will be there for them when they feel alone and confused. I’ve tried to talk to my aunts and uncles but no one understands. I’ve tried making things work with me and my mom but she’s so reluctant to even comply with me. I’ve tried to help me get a new car, I’ve tried to get her to eat healthy and get in shape and she just makes fun of me. She has no respect for me or my siblings. The only person she’s cool with is my sister. This truly hurts because they’re my family and I’d love to help them out in any way. Especially my own mother.. I have been thinking about going active and just leaving my family behind me. I also don’t want to regret doing that. The way my mother is, will one day push my brothers to drugs or suicide. I know because she put me through hell in my teen years. My oldest brother is starting to tell me that he he’s hurt and doesn’t want me to leave. He’s only 12... a 12 year old should be happy and worried about video games not about me leaving. Long story short.. I’ve tried to help my mom to be nicer with my siblings and tried helping her be successful. She refuses my help and tells me to leave almost everyday. I don’t want to leave my brothers alone in a dark hole where I once was at.. but I am so unhappy being with my mother who chooses to rot until the day she passes away.. anyways I apologize for the improper grammar. If anyone reads this... I wouldn’t mind some advice or suggestions.",09Aug2019,2

218,"Sooo kind of dumb, but my boyfriend and I occasionally play Minecraft together. We're both in college but hey, we grew up with the game, and it's changed so much over the years that it's fun to go back every now and then. But basically he's been playing it a lot longer than me. 

We did an adventure map that you can download and I joined his world to do it multiplayer. At first, it was kinda fun. We figured out puzzles and navigated a maze... But then the hard stuff came. 

See, whenever I used to play Minecraft, I'd play on Easy or Peaceful (please don't hate me) and just chill. My boyfriend always played on Normal or Hard and pretty much tried to beat the Ender Dragon in every world he started. You can see the difference in our game playing styles. 

So the rest of the map was covered with complicated parkour, difficult mobs, and high-skill tests. 

I could not do any of these. 

Since we were playing multiplayer, he'd pretty much go and do the challenge and then I'd follow. When it was parkour, I'd teleport to him after. 

This was not without my own attempts though too. I tried my gosh darn best at every challenge. I just don't have the gaming skills to jump from a single ladder way off the ground to a skinny tower 6 blocks away. 

Anyway, I could tell he was starting to get kind of frustrated when I wouldn't make it across as fast as he did because I kept trying because I didn't want to cheat. I wanted to do it on my own. But every time I ended up giving up so he wouldn't have to wait. 

Another thing is that he has a very one track mind when it comes to these things. I like to explore my surroundings and make sure I don't miss a single thing. He finds the next clue and moves on. 

Him: where are you?

Me: I'm still looking around. Did you get this chest?

Him: yeah. I got everything. Let's go

Me: wait there's another chest here! It has sugar (not relevant to the quest at all) :D 

Him: we don't need that. I already have the clue. Come on

^pretty much. 

Well, this is how it usually is when we play maps. When we just chill on a survival world, it's fun but maps are also fun too in their own way. And I do enjoy doing maps by myself. 

But when we do them together I know I'm slowing him down and it gets on his nerves. He never really calls me out, but I can tell he starts to get annoyed sometimes. I don't know what to do?

I'm afraid if I bring it up then he won't want to do the maps anymore because they make me worry about him. He really is a great boyfriend and I love him so much and I know if he knew playing maps with him stresses me, then he'd stop. But I don't want him to stop because he enjoys them too. 

I'm just stuck in my head. Please help",09Aug2019,0
219,"So, when I was 16 (I’m 18 now) I had a botched nose job in my country of origin, which is a South American country, keep in mind that my country is known for having cheap and excellent surgeons (obviously the surgeons are like millionaires there) So I had a close rino with one doctor that did my cousin’s nose and was friend’s with the family and is also a certified plastic surgeon. 
My nose before was big, I had a bump in it, was pointy, thin  and the tip was like pointing down. It was like a witch nose.
Despite what I mentioned I was still considered “attractive” people always said she is pretty but her nose is hideous things like that.

I was so excited to undergo with the surgery, because I finally would’ve been able to have a decent “normal nose” After months I noticed my nostrils were visibly asymmetrical, like veryyyy but the doctor said it was just the swelling and also due to the surgery being a closed one, one nostril would recover a little later because he worked more on that side, but that eventually the nose will look normal.

Almost two years have passed and I can’t even look properly in the mirror not only the nostrils are asymmetrical but also he left a big bump in my tip, that’s right a protuberance in my tip and he literally collapsed one side of my nose and got rid of my left cartilage, so my nose looks horrible, I cry every time, people have mentioned me how horrible my nose looks, I can’t take photos, I walked with my head down.
I went to several doctors and they had mentioned thousand of things that went wrong with my nose job.

The best doctor in my home country charges 2.500$ which is out of my own financial league, my parents don’t want to pay for anything, I’ve tried everything, even getting a job which I can’t because of the policies of the country where I live, In which I can’t work due to the fact of being a foreigner and two because I haven’t end school yet. I want to have a nose job before my graduation.
I’m thinking of asking money to my grandma because she is almost a millionaire but she won’t understand the situation I know that for a fact. My birthday is in less than 3 weeks but my father already told me he won’t give me money not even for my birthday... I don’t want to ask him anymore because I know It’s impossible to convince him.

I don’t know what to do, I’ve been thinking of killing myself several times, I’m ashamed of going to school and people looking at me saying how my nose turned out, I feel ugly, sad and hopeless 
I’m frustrated and don’t know what to do but I need the money and literally I’ve tried almost everything and with no luck at all. I don’t know what to do, I just want to die.

222,"Hey everyone. Hope you can help me out. I cross posted this on another subreddit.

I recently went back to work for a previous employer I left last year. Right before I left, we hired a new girl who is around my age and is all around a cool person. I didn't get to know her that much but I kept in touch with everyone in the office after I left and would occasionally talk to her.

Fast forward to today and I am 2 weeks in to my old job. Shes the receptionist and is the first person I see when I enter the office. She always trys to say something to me as I walk past her even when I try to mind my own business. I think its just her being friendly so I go OK and go along with it.

Its important to note I try to keep to myself at work and even during lunch since im trying to focus on getting myself out of a personal rut and really dont want to get involved with anyone in the office.

So a week passes by and she then sends a mass email inviting anyone who is down to go with her on a saturday to a county fair far from town. I ignore it since I tend to keep by myself at work and really just care about finishing my job and going home not socialize with my coworkers. At the end of the day, I head to leave the office when she mentions if I read her invitation and the details of the trip. Me just wanting to leave, told her that I didnt get to reading her email but that it sounds fun and would let her know. I noticed she didnt ask anyone else personally about it but I dont think much of it and go home.

Next day, about an hour into my shift she calls me directly asking if I read the email. At this point, I am like "" sounds fun yeah ill let you know probably not though"". She mentions its just going to be her and maybe another coworker who isnt even sure is going. After hanging up I start wondering why she keeps bringing it up but think hey shes just being friendly and I go on with my day.

End of the day comes and she stops by my cubicle and gives me her number right before she goes hlme and asks to let her know. The thing is I could have just told her tomorrow since I am going to see her again.

I overheard through office talk she has a boyfriend not sure though so why isnt she going with him? Am I looking into it too much? Dont know if I should go honestly I dont want it to be awkward.",09Aug2019,1
223,"I feel really un feminine. I have baby fine, thin hair. Growing up as a child everyone complemented it but now as a teen its looked down on. I can't grow my hair past my shoulders or else its stringy.  I hate it so much because growing up I was told that long hair was desirable on females. My mom and my siblings had thick beautiful hair but I got my dads hair. Up until 12 I was forced to have long, very long hair. Scissors never touched my hair because long hair was girly and desirable. You can imagine how bad of a wreck that was if you have a similar hair type to mine. 

In social media a lot of influencers, dancers, actors ect all have beautiful thick hair and the few that have very short hair it looked better when it was longer. 

It doesn't help that man tend to hold the opinion that females should have long hair or they think its very attractive. Almost all my exes told me I had to have long hair or keep it since long hair is beautiful on woman. My current bf prefers long hair but he's okay with my short hair.  I've seen a lot of men say that woman with short hair look better when their hair was longer and if they are attractive its not because of the short hair, they were just attractive to begin with but longer hair makes them prettier.

Alright, now that that's out of the way I can start.

So I have one main friend group that I'm around quite often. This group has great people in it. However, the problem started about a couple months ago. My main or even best friend has become quite hypocritical, and I'm afraid to say anything that might get him going. Now I'm quite quiet when it comes to my emotions or how I feel about something, especially if it's related to something my friends want to do. I try my best to hint a little bit that I don't want to do something, but it never works. Now I understand that you need to just tough through it a lot because it isn't like you always get to do what you want to. The problem is though that there is rarely anything that I'm happy with doing, and if it is something I'm happy with, usually at least one member won't like it and advocates to stop or leave early intensely. If I try to do that though, I'm greeted with harsh tones and in rare cases insults. So now I usually try do just find something that everyone is happy with, but it's never enough because someone wants to do something else that they like more. Now I rarely get to do anything with my friends that make me happy, and my other friend groups are online in different timezones or kind of distant. This has caused some constant sadness for the past few weeks now. I'm not very happy when I'm without friends, and I'm not very happy with friends either. 

Just a little glimpse into it all, it's just a scratch on the surface but it still works as an example.

One night we were having a bit of a game night online. So I decided that maybe it would be cool to do some variety and tally scores for a friendly competition. It went well at first. Really well. Until one of my friends lost a game immediately and asked why we didn't just keep doing the previous game where he won (This competition was also to find a new game/gamemode to play more often as well, so he was suggesting us to just use the previous game as our new game/gamemode). I tried to keep us on the track, but the other two had no vote and the other friend outdid me in arguing (as I said before, I'm quite quiet so I didn't do very well). We ended up doing something that he was happy with, while I disliked it, and the others only felt neutral. 

Now everyone of them has their fair share of this, this was one of the more extreme cases, but it's just causing me to be unhappy with how I'm spending time.

I don't know how to approach them about it. I just never have had a serious talk with them before, and it feels akward trying to bring this up. I have no clue how to even start.

238,"I have a year and a bit left of my bachelor's degree, but I feel remorseful. Don't get me wrong, i love to learn, I love the subject. No matter how boring the class is, or what class it is, I always end up excited about something within it. But not as excited as I am with game development. 

I got involved when I joined the game dev club on campus. I got so interested in it. Basically, each team makes a game, and I did the art stuff. It was a 2d game since none of us have done much before. It was broken, but it worked, and I loved it. 

I havent really drawn digitally before so it was a good time to learn. I've been terribly shy and self conscious and always felt judged and inadequate my entire life and I've never really had friends. But I found myself seeking advice from other artists and didnt feel embarrassed about my work. Which is significant for me.  We didnt have an animator, so I took it up. I have never even heard of Unity before, but I downloaded it and opened YouTube to learn to animate the characters' actions. It was way to much work but i was so engrossed in it, even though I had a full course load. And over the summer I find myself making simple things in Blender. 

I could have gotten to the point, and I could have gone on, but I think I want to actually do this. But I have doubts. It's a difficult thing to get into, but the gaming industry here is huge. I'm 22 and I don't know if starting my education over is good. I want to get my life going. And I don't know if I could afford school for this. I just dont know what to do.",09Aug2019,1
239,"Video games have always been something I enjoy,  but I have a new problem and it's weighing me down.  

This isn't super serious so  I feel weird about posting common but I guess I am being negatively affected.  

I like to play runescape. Played on and off for years. It's one of the few things that make me relaxed, but I can't get past the fact that I'm putting effort into a thing that doesn't really matter and at the end of the day I've put energy into something that means nothing in the grand scheme of life.  

I want to enjoy it and still do, but I can't anymore and I just feel empty.

241,My boyfriend has like noticed that I have shitty eating habits and I wanna tell him that I don’t like eating (bc I always tell him I’m just not hungry or already ate.) but that also means he’ll try to make me eat which I don’t want.

244,I was thinking about it today... I’ll spend any amount of money that I have on my girlfriend to make her happy. and I hardly need to spend on myself. I just have so many easy ways to spend money on her like restaurants she likes and travel and cute things for her. She doesn’t use me I know damn well what I’m doing but she makes me so fucking happy to be around. I also feel like I get happy seeing her excitement about things i may purchase for her/us together. In my experience spoiling and trying to get her anything to make her smile is what makes me happier I guess. Is this an acceptable behavior with the way my reasoning is? Or am I just crazy on a love drug?,09Aug2019,2
245,"I used to be legit depressed in high school - I tried to commit suicide, but obviously I’m here. After that, I actually got better - it was slow and took several years but I was so proud and happy to be where I was. I had ambition, a plan for my future and I was executing that plan. Somehow... during my peak, a part of me was chipped away because I was also dealing with personal family issues (basically going back to my whole childhood of my mom abusing pills, domestic violence and my father being mentally abusive, but it still happens to this day) and I was still living at home at that time. I tried not to let it affect me, and some may say ‘it’s not even a big deal’ and it’s not... there have been worse to others... but for me, it chipped away at my sanity, at myself every time an incident happened. It wasn’t that ‘bad’ but for me, mentally it was a big deal and I couldn’t handle it. Since then to now, I’ve lost all interest and ambition in my former life goal.

I can’t deal with my life anymore. I have such a good life compared to other people, but I’m so entitled and spoiled that I can’t handle the simplest inconveniences. I feel like it’s not even worth living life if I get caught up over the smallest inconveniences. 

Today I tried to reconcile with my mom and went out to have dinner with her and my sister but I found myself unable to eat w no appetite but I forced myself anyway... while my sister went to the bathroom, I casually told my mom how stressed out I am, but I just couldn’t handle it and started just to cry but try to pull it off and blink before any tears fell. I’m so overwhelmed by my life. 

I got fired from my job last week - and while that’s stress it’s not like I’m depressed about it because it was just a part time. My boyfriend, I love him but I’m sad because he doesn’t make me happy. He’s very distant (emotionally) but that’s how he is. I’m the opposite, I need and want and crave deep emotional connections, romantic gestures (not gifts just quality time). He doesn’t do that. I know he cares about me, but his actions sometimes don’t show that. He acts very mature, like the stereotype of a married couple for years: decent sex life, not romantic anymore, very straightforward etc...

I don’t want to get into details about his actions, but just... I’m not happy. I’ll never be happy because I know what he does/ how he is. I trust him, but just because I trust him doesn’t mean I’m happy and comfortable. I know he won’t do anything but it’s still unsettling. But I love him and just that also makes me depressed knowing this. This is also just a major part of me constantly being sad deep down... just what he does without thinking of how it’ll affect me, or knows it but does it anyway... 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I look like I have a great life because I go out to party every week, but in all honesty instead of going out to party to have fun, I go out to party to forget about my problems. It’s such a sweet relief to get drunk and have other people see me having fun because they would never suspect me to be this depressed useless person. I socialize because it makes me feel normal. 

Can anyone give me help or advice? Will / can therapy help me? I’m 21 and a female. 

TLDR: My job situation sucks, I’ve been trying to get a new job but nothing. My boyfriend - I love him - but I’m so unhappy and I wish I wasn’t. I sacrifice myself for everyone else around me in hopes of me getting happiness out of it, and I do until I get screwed over. I don’t know what else to do with my life I have no more ambition or motivation.",09Aug2019,1

258,"As the title suggested, my family and I recently moved into a new neighborhood, and our neighbors immediately started acting out towards us. We were told that these people had verbal altercations with many of the other families on the block, and we were not the first, but the big difference is we live right next door. Luckily the adults have kept to themselves after an initial confrontation over a noise complaint involving the kids, which ended with cops being called due to the mother of their household showing up on our doorstep screaming threats. 

But, despite the adults moving on for the most part, the teens (14-16 yrs) have not been so eager to do so. For the last few weeks they have cursed my mother out whenever possible, even yelling into our windows when we have them open, which can be annoying since the kids tend to stay out for long periods of time just sitting out front of the houses. We've tried talking to the kids, which resulted in even more of the same behavior, and talking to the parents, which spirals into yelling and curses. 

I'd at the very least like a simple way to get these kids to stop looking through our windows and harassing my mother, we've done our best to ignore them and hope they grow out of it or get bored, but that feels like such a long time to wait, and clearly they wont respond to conversation.

260,"My (21F) ex boyfriend (19M) and I split up recently. A lot of small fights built up to a loss of feelings and a distance between us. He tried to break it off first, but I clung on to the relationship for a bit because I didn’t want to be alone. (Bit if background, I only have about 2 real friends bc of depression and anxiety issues, so I tried to cling pretty hard.)  Ultimately it wasn’t a good relationship, but I tried to hang on because I liked the physical affection, the constant texting, the going out to places nightly. But I realized going through the motions of a relationship was hurting me more than being alone ever could. A part of me still loves him, but I know that what I really loved was the idea of being in a relationship, so I pulled the trigger and ended it for real. 

The problem is that I want to stay friends. We work together, and I want to become closer friends with my co-workers, which means we’ll have to still see each other. And even more than that, he’s a good person, he made me happy, and we got a long well as friends. He’s a good guy just not the kinda of guy I need to be with. 


TLDR: I split with my boyfriend, and even though it’s for the best I’m still hurting about it, but I want to maintain a friendship with him and our mutual friend group.

He’s been seeing and hearing things and it’s becoming too much for him. I told him to go to therapy and get medication but he’s still neglecting to. He’s finally going insane.

263,"While in college, I (female) made friends with a guy in one of my classes who was married and we would occasionally have coffee or go to a donut shop. Now, I'd like to give some perspective on what I mean when I say ""occasionally"": we've known each other for about 4 years and we've only gone out to places like this about 3 times, so this is really not a frequent thing AT ALL. Now normally I wouldn't be having outings with a person who is married, but since neither of us were really attracted to or looking to be in a relationship with each other (whether sexual or otherwise), I didn't think it was such a big deal. However, after getting back from one of the times we met up, I told my mother where I had been and she was so *upset.* She basically said that this guy was being extremely disrespectful to his wife by going places with me and that if he wanted to go out with a girl it should be the one she is married to. She was of the opinion that he had no business going anywhere with me at all and that I should cut contact with him.

So now I am confused and I don't know if we were in the wrong or not. It's not like we were running around making out or screwing each other, we were making small talk over mundane shit while drinking iced tea or whatever. Even when we would text, it was really infrequent and we'd mostly talk about how our classes were going or things like that. I don't think it was anything that would end up ending a marriage. I will admit that we would exchange small gifts at times. He is from Japan, and since he knows I am interested in visiting there, he sometimes gave me things like a little decorative handkerchief and some snacks, and a few times I gave him some inexpensive candy to be polite and return the favor. My mom also thinks it was inappropriate for him to be giving me things, surprise surprise.

But if this guy was really so eager to cheat on his wife, wouldn't he have been a lot more persistent about it? I talk to him every few months on average and there are huge stretches of time where we don't say anything at all, so if he really is a potential cheater he's doing a very poor job of playing the field, imo.

I have talked to a few other friends who told me we weren't doing anything wrong but my mom acts almost like I'm just playing dumb and she feels that deep down I know things crossed the line so I'm not entirely sure what to think...

264,"I had been upsetting someone for long period of time and I'm not sure where the line between acquaintance and friend here lies for our relationship, but I did something considered inexcusable to this person. It was a stupid mistake, I did a very stupid phone call to this person and the circumstances were absolutely not appropriate by doing that I ultimately crossed the line. I unconsciously already had been a burden to him by sending a lot of emails to him. 

This person is twice my age and I'm a youth. He has said to me I'm just really young so I assume he would know that I'm prone to irrational behavior.

After this event, he said as of now he will be filtering all my emails directly into trash and that I should stop contacting him because he feels very upset and at the end he wrote goodbye. Just that same month he was remembering my birthday at 6am and I unexpectedly got a birthday email from him. 

I will honor his request of course, I had been sending him emails for every week from April to August and he probably feels very annoyed, but he never said anything until now as most of the emails were left unanswered. 

My question is this person neither blocked me on social media (we don't follow each other through) nor do I not understand why he doesn't put me in his spam folder instead of putting my emails into trash which means additional work for him. 

He has a Gmail account and there's a difference between trash and spam. I believe spam is what the system automatically filters out so it doesn't even land in your inbox, but trash are emails you put into trash by yourself from your inbox. 

I always thought that I can't contact him anymore because he wouldn't even get them, but now I know that he would see them but just wouldn't even read them and put them in the trash because he is upset with me. But why doesn't he just put me in his spam folder instead of doing all the work of filtering all his emails by himself? Is this how Gmail works or are there programs which filter emails automatically into trash? 

Although I will honor his request, I do will apologize regardless only for once and for all. I want to do it differently this time and write a handwritten apology letter, make a photo of it, and send it to him and say that I would like to continue out conversation and leave it at that.

265,"To catch everyone up, I was raped this past December. I suffer from PTSD, I'm afraid to be alone and I can't even be touched and this has been possibly the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. I've been working with a detective; I gave them everything I had on this person, they have the kit the hospital took, every message sent between us, the person's phone number, etc. And he was taken into custody. 

Fast forward to today, I get a random message on Facebook which is odd because it's from a person I don't know. To make it even weirder it was a completely blank profile, no friends, no nothing. This person started out by saying ""hey, have you ever met with a person at blah blah blah"" and essentially, the person who messaged me was my rapist posing as his mother.  I found it threatening because they said things like, ""you know he has a video"" which yes I do, and so do the police, and also saying things like ""they'll never believe you"" which I know is an intimidation tactic because I'm not the only person who came forward about him (there are four other women). 

My problem is that I don't like the fact that my rapist is able to find me. I've completely deleted 100% of social media now because of this and I am terrified of what is going to happen to me. I'm an anxious mess, and I am so utterly nervous over everything that could potentially happen. What if he uploads the videos? What if he hunts me down again? What the heck do I do? I've already sent the full conversation to the detective and they said it's being handled but that isn't helping me calm down. I'm completely distraught. Who does this?? 

I'm just looking for advice on how to cope with all of this because honestly I'm losing my mind and all I want to do is lock myself in my room and cuddle my cat and cry but I know I can't. I have to work and go to school and keep going but everything in me doesn't want to.",09Aug2019,1112

This is going to be long, I'm sorry about that. Skip to last paragraph if you don't like reading.

In 9th grade, I was in a normal highschool in August and September. In October, I switched to do online school because I was failing and having panic attacks everyday. My depression got the best of me and I missed alot of school, leading to me failing and my anxiety getting worse. I ended up doing well in online school, as I got all A's except a B in geometry. My depression and anxiety have gotten better after going through therapy and taking medication. But I've gotten tired of staying home all the time and a public school would open up dual enrollment for me in 11th and 12th grade.

So this year I'm going back to a public highschool, but I'm kinda scared. My boyfriend has tried to switch to the one I am going to, but we don't think they'll accept him, meaning he'll be going to a different highschool. I have a few friends from middle school that go there, but I barely talk to them. I only really talked to my boyfriend and my friend who is in online school still since I made the switch, as all my old friend made their new social groups.

I'm not 100% sure about what my schedule is even, as the school didn't recieve my transcripts so I had to give them my transcripts the other day and they haven't updated my schedule yet. All I know is that I'll have algebra 2, chemistry, english 2, world history, and most likely spanish 1 and maybe some sort of performing/fine arts course.

272,"For some context, I’m a 20 year old male college student. The last few years have been incredibly difficult for me, and I don’t know what to do. I want to stop hurting but there are so many interwoven issues that I can’t untangle them all. 

Death:

&gt; A year ago my friend in college committed suicide. He had been brought to a hospital for a third time for drug-related issues. Since the beginning of the fall semester I had been with him during most of his blackouts, because I didn’t want him to be alone and I wanted to look out for him.
&gt; Two weeks ago one of my best friends committed suicide. It really, really, really is hard to put into words exactly how much he meant to me and how much of a good person he was.
&gt; For the last few months my grandma, who I’m very close with, had been slowly succumbing to cancer. She passed away just one week ago. This has been extremely hard on me, as well as the rest of the family and especially my mother (her daughter).

Failure:

&gt; I failed two of my classes in college. This shattered part of my identity as a good student, but even more importantly I had to drop out of the honors program and take out more loans (as I lost most of my scholarships). The thought of giving something my absolute 100% and still failing terrifies me, so I self-sabotage in order to have the mental fallback of “well, if I HAD tried my best I would have done much better”
&gt; My first and only relationship was a complete failure. The long, messy death of that relationship hurt me by deeply impacting my self-worth and sexual ability.

I think I’ll probably attempt suicide in the next year or two. Even if I get through this particular bout, these thoughts and feelings are going to always come back.

276,"This started a while ago when my ""friend"" (lets call him Oscar) started insulting me. At first it just seemed like a joke, and he did say it as if it were one, but oh was I wrong. Now, when this started, I didn't think much of it because that was just our groups sense of humour, but after a while I noticed he only said these sorts of things to me. Later on, he started getting more angrier at me for smaller and smaller reasons, but was more forgiving with everyone else. One time, I accidentally confused 'we will rock you' for 'another one bites the dust' and he started making fun of me for it, which makes sense because as mentioned this is our groups sense of humour, but after doing it for months on end it lost its comedic value and he was doing it just to insult me and make me feel embarrassed. He'll never do this sort of thing for other people and will always find ways to try and make me feel horrible and embarrassed. And the worst part of this, is that after months of this I finally brought it up to him and told him to stop it, but rather than apologising or even admitting he did it, he laughed at me and said I was overreacting. 

And before you say anything, before I brought it up to him I kept track using an actual notebook and saw his interactions to see if I was just making a situation out of it, but no matter how I look at it, I can't see a way in which he's innocent and I am just overreacting. I've talked about this with one of my other friends and he did say that he's been noticing Oscar making fun of me a lot more than anybody else. I'm not really sure what to do about it because I don't want to embarrass the guy, I just want him to truthfully say that he's sorry about everything he's done.

I cannot post anything or do anything on there because as soon as he sees that I post he will immediately message me and talk to me. It's so annoying at this point. Then when I dont answer he will go through my profile and spam me with heart reacts and comments. It's so annoying and I dont know how to get him to stop. I dont want to be rude and I know it is but lately I've been ignoring some of the messages completely.  I dont wanna say anything mean to him but how else can I make him stop?,09Aug2019,2

I’m twice his size and I workout but whenever we play videogames together he will randomly blurt out dumb shit like “your ugly” or “shut up” like some mentally handicapped kid w/ tics (no offense to anyone just to describe his persona). I’m a very chill person so I just tell him to fuck off and that’ll be that. But he constantly does it to the point where It makes me uncomfortable. Not because I let what he says get to me but rather how bad I am at controlling the conversation. I’ve never been good at being that kind of person. I know for a fact he won’t act like this in person but my god is it annoying. Mostly because I never know how to respond.

283,"So I was offered a job as a restaurant general manager. I’ve only ever worked as an assistant manager for mom and pop shops, so I don’t know if the pay for this job is pretty standard for large chain restaurants or not. 

Basically they told me that the job isn’t salary, I would still need to clock in and out but I could make around 50K as long as I work a minimum of 55 hours a week. I would be paid $12 for 40 hours and $18 for every hour over that. So that’s before taxes around 36,000. And they’re telling me that bonuses would make up the remaining 14,000 or so. 

To me this sounds like garbage. I would have to bust my ass for 55 hours every week to hope that I do well enough in sales to make bonuses. Otherwise I might just end up making 36,000 and never have a life outside of work. 

Apparently I don’t even get to have two days off in a row, or make my own schedule as the district manager would do that. They also don’t believe in going digital so there would be tons of paperwork I would have to do all the time (like keeping track of time stamps) in addition to running around all day. They also don’t believe in direct deposit. 

Does this sound like a fair deal to you guys? I’m just not sure that most chain fast food restaurants run like this. Sounds almost like slave labor with the potential of a big payout but no promise.",09Aug2019,1
284,"Teenage situationship with a classmate (17M), the usual kind you'd see at highschool, except that we don't talk at school at all because of a few issues. Our relationship is exclusively on our phones. We're both preparing for fiercely competitive exams (different exams for each of us but both STEM) to get into uni. Both of us are very driven and are working extremely hard to get what we want. However, of late, I find that I think of him too much, and it's interfering with my work.

He's been a little extra busy the past two weeks and hasn't texted me. I completely understand and am not angry or sad in a typical angsty teenager way. It's just that I'm kinda frustrated I haven't been able to find it in me to do the same when I get a little busy. I'm able to say that us texting is second priority to our studies but somehow I can never manage to put it into practice. If he's studying and I text, the text waits. If I'm studying and he texts, the studying waits. I need help changing that.

He got a fresh new haircut a couple of days ago and I told him he looked cute (via sign language, from one corner of the room to another. Cringe.) He gave me a thumbs up, no smile, like it didn't matter to him (I'd be a blushing hot mess). Again, my issue is not with how he reacted, it's that I'm thinking of the reaction more than I should be.

We had a fight about a month and a half ago following which we didn't talk for a whole month. I saw a different me. Since I was so sure there'd be no text from him, I didn't check my phone at all. I studied hard and I studied good. I was so fulfilled and happy with what I was doing. Reconciling after the fight made me so happy I could cry but the loss of drive after that, being petty, checking my phone every five minutes - ""didhetextme-didhetextme-didhetextme""- I'm embarrassed about myself.

I miss the no-shits-given, my-goals-are-my-life me. Should I cut/reduce contact with him?

I texted her to ask if everything was alright and mentioned that this broke my heart a bit, and I really wanted to know what the issue was. Got left on read. I still have Snapchat, but I’m worried she’s going to unfriend me from there soon too.

291,"My father is an alcoholic and he has been since well before I was born. When my mom found out she was pregnant with me she decided that if he wanted to be apart of our family he had to stop drinking. He did and seemed to do well for a long time. The first time he decided to drink and then attempt to hide it I was like 10 or 11 and it turned into a whole fiasco and he had also ended up cheating on my mom and neither me or my mom had any idea. Over the next 7 years or so since that he has gotten drunk out of the blue on random occasions, each time he attempts to lie his way out of it and all that. It's extremely stressful because my dad is the main source of income in our family and without him me and my mom would have to move. I also know that if my mom left him he would go back to his old habits of drinking and he would disappear and or end up dying because of all the alcohol. I feel terrible about it because it just destroys my mom when he lies, and every time he does it she has to decide to forgive him or not. Today he ended up skipping work and getting drunk, and when he came home and my mom realized he was drunk, they were fighting(not physically just verbally) and he was saying how he hates his job and he wants to quit and start drinking again. He has a really good job especially for where we live and if he starts drinking he is throwing all that away and his family. His excuse for all of this is that he can't help it he will have to drink every once in a while, but he cant just have one or two beers if he drinks, he has to gets drunk. If we allowed that it would turn into his old habits of drinking every day really fast.

300,"So I’ve worked at CFA since November, my main job right now and has been for a while. I only get about 20-28 hrs a week, which isn’t the best for me since I’m growing older and actually have a car to pay for now. I found a nanny job online but my CFA schedule is so midday, I have to only work CFA on weekends. On top of that I plan on taking online college classes. I’m taking the nanny job 100%, it’s minimum 40 hours a week. The nanny job itself isn’t so bad, it’s three kids, two of which are in school, the baby is 17 months old. I just have to take the older kids to school, pick them up, take them to practice and then watch the baby. Fortunate enough for me, the baby sleeps three hours a day so I have time to do my work, help around the house. However, I won’t have time to give my job a two week notice. 

I told my manager it’s due to college, and that I’d be free fridays 7 pm- close and Saturday all day. He told me I need to be available at least four days, so I said I could do the four days just 7-close. He said 6-close would be ideal but i cannot do that, I need to drive to and from different towns to get to CFA. A month ago i applied for a part time at another fast food place, but this was before the nanny job was even an option, AND it’s been about three weeks and they haven’t gotten me into training, so I’m just going to own up to it and tell the lady school got in the way and i won’t be able to work (she told me just to tell her about how my scheduling is, they’re hiring a TON of people right now).

I (21M) have been pursuing a telecommunications bachelors degree for a year now and about to head over to my third semester. 

In the beginning, I really loved the idea of working with computers but as time flew, I found it drastically difficult and have already failed a few classes. 

As part of the course, I should take up an internship at any IT company of my choosing and so I did. I had hoped that it would help me gain more interest in what I'm doing. 

That didn't work out.

The internship was terrible. I wasn't given a lot of work to do and the theory that I learnt during the internship didn't interest me at all.

303,"I am a 38 year old man and I have been married just over 10 years. Most of my marriage has been sexless, meaning I can probably count on my hands and a few toes the amount of times we've been intimate since our nuptials. Within those times we were trying for children. Which we now have 2 great, healthy kids. 

I have been really considering divorce lately. I feel lonely, unloved, and forgotten. I have always cut my wife some slack because I always felt it was an underlying medical condition. She had cryo surgery to freeze pre-cancerous cells in her early 20s and since then our sex life had dropped off the face of the planet. I kept faith, stuck with her. Figured it would return once she was healed and well. But days, months would go by. I would vent my frustration and she would accommodate with sympathy sex. Then, back to months and even years between sex. I am currently in a 3.5 year dry spell. My kids are 8 and 4 now. She recently had a hysterectomy for endometriosis and other factors. That was in March 2019. She had been cleared for sex for nearly 3 months now and still nothing. I bought her a new toy to ease herself back into a sex life on her own but she refuses to use it. She claims it gives her anxiety to even think about sex. I am at a loss. I figured clearing out the pain of endometriosis would bring back my wife. I try really hard to understand but I keep making excuses for her. I vent then have to apologize for explaining my needs. My frustration is leading me down the path of resentment. My patience is now gone. I have asked for counseling for years without getting her on board. She always has a reason to not go. She seems to drown herself in making sure the kids are well taken care of. Which is fine, I am all for making sure the kids have their needs met but at the end of the day mine are not. 

We don't sleep near each other anymore. It's been a few years. By the time we get near each other she is to tired or has a chore to do. I am constantly volleying times for us to have sex, because I read scheduling it helps rekindle. I am always texting her at work letting her know she looked wonderful that morning as we all shuffled out the door to get to work/school/daycare or I comment on her lingering perfume in the morning if she left earlier than I. Where do I draw the line in the sand? I love her and want to be happy, but she continually stonewalls me. How can I fix something that doesn't want to be fixed? I live in Illinois. I know leaving means time with my kids will drastically change due to a divorce. I am really close with my kids, naturally. And limiting my time will be heartbreaking for them and myself.

I fantasize life with other people. I chat online/apps with people to feel a connection. It's not for love I don't think but to feel wanted. The fact I do this gives me extreme guilt after the fact, but I literally live in a fantasy world to stay sane. My sex life is literally my imagination. I am depressed and get anxiety because I suppress it. Its starting to show in my work. I'm short with coworkers, developing social anxiety. I push through it but I feel myself transitioning to a more private person. Maybe because I feel like my silence would speak volumes to friends and family about my marriage. I don't want to change people opinion of my wife, no matter if I leave or not.

Fast forward, I decide to trade the phone for cash at GameStop, and buy a headset with it, and this was only a few days ago. 

Then comes now when I send my dad in a rage/panic saying that I sold the phone, obviously fearing that they’ll check the phone and find that my father’s company owns it, and then call it in. Obviously I should’ve done some more critical thinking and I am stupid for assuming the phone had no strings attached, but is there a way to get it back?

308,"I have this really good friend of mine and he's in a really bad spot and desparately needs help but I am unsure how to help. The two of us have been discussing what to do but I would like additional input that may open our eyes.

My friend comes from a bad environment so he moved across the country to get away from his family. He's currently living far away from them with a family friend. He's been job searching for a couple months now and he's down on his luck. The roommate suddenly dissapeared, my friend has no idea if the roommate is paying rent or where the roommate is, my friend has no money to pay for food, he hasn't received a phone call back from any place he has submitted applications to work. He has no way to pay for his phone plan and will lose communication by the end of this month if he doesn't figure something out quick.

We discussed a couple of options. Most of them involving coming down to where i live, in Kansas. I'm a college student living with my parents. We suggested that I would talk to my parents and see if they would be willing to allow my friend to stay with us for a couple months to help him back onto his feet. I would take him to his job and pick him up from work as he stays at my parent's house as well as help keep the house tidy. 

Another plan is in the scenario where my parents don't allow him to stay with us. I would get him down to Kansas by buying him a Greyhound ticket. He would stay in a local homeless shelter. I would help him find jobs and food as well be his transportation to said places.

The most unlikely possibility is that we would see if his mother can get him a greyhound ticket back to his home state and he would live with his family again. He'd work there until he had enough to get his own place here in Kansas. He doesn't want to take this possibilty because his family is toxic and the reason he left his home state is to get away from his family.

We really are confused on what to do and how to proceed from here. He is a really good friend of mine and I can't bare to see him struggling like this. If there is any suggestions that we can take, I am all ears. Thank you to anyone that helps make a suggestion.",09Aug2019,2

314,"Alright Reddit, hopefully this isn’t above your pay grade because it is a LOT. So here goes.

I’m getting married in a couple years. I’ve already started planning due to the fact that we won’t hire someone to plan it and we want it DIY. It takes a long time so we’ve begun planning already. 

When I told my parents, they seemed extremely happy for me and offered to each pay half of the expenses for the wedding. 

I went and had a bridal appointment, and found the most beautiful dress. I’m so happy with it. Well, my dad said he would pay the deposit and because I don’t like people giving me money I said I’d pay the rest off. It was after bank hours on a Friday so the bridal shop said they could wait until Monday for him to deposit the money (he wasn’t AT the appointment, but he knew when it was and saw the dress before agreeing to the deposit). 

He never showed. The bridal shop called me and said he never called or came in and now I’m paying it off myself. Which is fine, I’m just frustrated he promised to help and flaked. When I texted him, he wouldn’t respond. I haven’t heard from him since.

My mother, on the other hand, hasn’t spoken to me in weeks. She started using money against me and talking about my finances (that she has nothing to do with given I haven’t lived with her in years) as if me having bills to pay puts HER in debt. It doesn’t, I’ve paid my own bills for years. I also discovered she’s been talking to my sister, who’s my flower girl, badly about me, my fiancé, and our wedding plans.

They seemed so happy for me and so willing to help, now they’ve both ghosted. I don’t want them there anymore, but I don’t want to be the asshole that doesn’t invite their parents to their wedding. Also, if I don’t invite my mother, my siblings (all under 18) won’t be able to go either, which my mother knows would crush me.

How the hell do I handle this and them respectfully?",09Aug2019,1

318,"So in mid 2012 my father passed away in the middle of the night due to copious amount of stress caused by a leak that was going through from my bathroom to the downstairs at about 1am. The toilet in my bathroom had ended up getting a leak and no one knew until it was too late so as he was trying to fix what he could, he suffered a massive heart attack and died nearly instantly. I was gone that night at a friends house leaving just my brother sister and mother there with him. As time passed I started to think about what I could have done or if I could have done anything, made me think about the days prior to it happening and remembered. I had not gone into my bathroom for about a week all because of a large spider I had seen behind my toilet. I tried to kill it but with no luck it ran and hid underneath the seat. Me being absolutely terrified of spiders made it my #1 priority to stay away. If I hadn’t been such a pansy and gone into my bathroom could I have been able to address the leak at a earlier stage? Could I have been able to prevent the stress that I believe killed my dad? I don’t know what to think and it’s been eating me alive recently.

321,So for some context im going into highschool next year and my girlfriend is also going into HS but a separate one. Im worried some senior will try and flirt with her or someone will have a crush on her and try something.

322,"My mom and dad split up when I was young and my stepdad has been raising us since then (about 12-13ish years ago) I’ve had no contact with my dad since then so he’s really been my only father figure growing up. He’s a pretty good guy and did a good job of raising 4 kids (all were my moms, he’s never had any of his own) and has been a loving grandpa to two girls. I had been suspecting my mom of cheating for a couple of months now and when I was taking a picture with her phone a dirty message from a man who is definitely not my stepdad popped up. I said nothing to her but went through her phone later that night and discovered she is cheating with MULTIPLE men. Many dirty texts (no nudes thankfully) but also lots of messages that would indicate that this has been going on for a long time. Some of these men are married so not only could I be splitting up my family, i could be splitting up others as well. I have kind of hinted to my mom that I know she’s cheating but I don’t think she’s caught on yet. I know I should confront her but I feel terrible knowing that I could possibly split up the family. My stepdad is a very nice man but a little lonely. His family lives across the country and he works a lot so he only has a few people who would be here for him should they divorce. His family absolutely adores us kids and have been so loving and accepting of us from the day they met us. My mother’s family has taken him in as well. He has become close with almost everyone on that side and they care for him. I am scared to ruin things with both sides of my family. Out of us four kids, 2 are living on their own and have kids, 1 in college(me), and 1 who is in high school. If my parents split up, my younger sibling and I would lose all stability in our home. He is definitely the breadwinner in the house and I fear that I will have to drop out of college to help my mom support my sibling. I also would have no way of paying my tuition. I have known about my Mom’s infidelity for about a month now and every day I sit in limbo with my decision it eats me alive. If I say nothing I will live with the guilt for the rest of my life but if I do tell I could be responsible for splitting up multiple families.

327,"Keeping in mind I do experience symptoms from contamination OCD, from things I've read I'm not sure how realistic a risk this is. 

Basically my toothbrush was on a shelf, and another person in my household was reaching for something on a higher shelf. In doing so, his shirt lifted up and his bare skin might have come in contact with the bristles of my toothbrush. 

He has some possibly open skin sores on his body that I think are due to acne, though I am not certain, and I do not know him well enough to ask. Because of the angle of where I was, I could not see if he had sores where his skin might have touched my toothbrush.

My OCD wanted me to not use the toothbrush because of the risk of hepatitis B/C, but I thought this was a silly fear, and I used the toothbrush. I then decided to google it afterward, and it seems like using the toothbrush might have been a potential risk? 

The information I found implied that very little virus, undetectable to the human eye can cause infection when it's on contaminated objects like toothbrushes and razors.

I do not know if the person has hepatitis B or C, but I think there's a reasonable chance due to his demographics (he's from a part of asia where it sounds like hbv is more common).

I'm mainly scared about contracting hepatitis B or C because I don't want to infect my partner. I'm scared of putting him at risk of something that could harm him. I want to ask a doctor because I feel like this is probably an unrealistic fear, but I don't have one where I live. If anyone can help answer how risky this exposure was, and how at risk my partner is or if I should get tested, I would be very appreciative. 

Thanks to anyone who might read this!",09Aug2019,2
328,"I am posting here because I don't know any other better sub. This happened 2yo ago and still happening. All of this convo happened over text messages. English is not my first language. So this bestfriend (now ex) of mine sent me a message 2y ago regarding helping him with a girl he just had a fight with. I didn't live in his city or that girl's that time neither they, she was his bestfriend according to him. Both were my past classmates. She was not my friend that time. He asked me to text her that he is sorry etc, I helped when he requested many times. After few days she read the text and they were fine. He told me he will say that he didn't know I texted her to help him and will act like he didn't ask for help. I became her friend that time too. Then I started talking to her, he started getting jelly that I am talking to her more than I am talking to him. Then he will say that he will do an act or something or he will play a prank on her. I will always object but he will do it anyways and it always lead to a fight between them and he coming to me askin to help him again. I started getting resentful towards him like why can't he behave normally. Then when he said he will pull-up another one, I screenshoted and sent that text to her thinkin I'll dilute the situation before it becomes a fight. It worked and she told me she will not be angry on him this time. They both chat. Then when something happens between then she texts me asking me how to reply n I'll tell her a reply which won't hurt him. He was sad these days, so I didn't want to hurt him more. Then he started telling me that I am taking her side more than his. I said it's because he is in the wrong according to me and should check his behaviour. He says that because I am his bestfriend first I should take his side even if he is wrong, I should tell him he is wrong and why but still take his side and also that I didn't know meaning of friendship. I told him to start behaving normally and we had a fight. He came to know about screenshot and stuff. He asked my why we both did that, I told him that I didn't want anymore fights. But he won't listen. After few days, he is still like you don't know meaning of friendship. I asked him to explain the meaning, he says that I won't understand but keeps saying that I don't know the meaning. He is a big hardcore fan of naruto anime and told me to watch it to understand the meaning myself. According to me, his behaviour is because of that anime, he thinks that his past is same like the past of some character and everyone betrayed him in the past ( everyone ( I think he) used to fight with him and turn him down in the past ). He is an angry person and has 0 tolerance. If someone does something he didn't like, he will just leave or get angry at them. That's why most people were not his friend at school but they still talked with him. Ok so here I watched whole naruto and told him whatever I understood, he said I still don't understand and that I will never understand. Then yeah, after few days we had a fight again, this time we are arguing about stuff that who's mistake is there, I am telling him that he should've stopped behaving like that and played no pranks and stuff on her which he knew she didn't like. He told me that i should've took his side than hers and shouldn't have shared ss. He had a fight with her too and she is short tempered than me, she blocked him, I did too. Then we removed block, he came back but it lead to a fight again after few days. He will send tons of paragraphs, she didn't like that, neither did I. We were tired of him. This kept happening till she blocked him for many months and after me deleting my insta because of him. Between these months, we fought on fb too, he abused me for the first time. He was depressed or something and after blaming everything on me, he said that he will end the world or something. When I said I'll tell eveything to his parents and all, he stopped but after making me delete the text (which i archived) he flipped back saying what will I do I don't have any proof. When he realised that I archived, he stopped. I realised he has no one as his friend because the other friend of him left the city for schooling and he was alone. Rest of the classmates were there too but they both didn't care about each other. I should've left him long time ago but we kept coming back. I didn't leave him bc I didn't want him to get more depressed. We fought over chat for many times, for many months. I was so tired of him that I left him too. Then after few months he came back, I told him that to forget everything, don't text me paras, let's start again, and I forgive you for everything. I told him I don't like her (fake) and he was happy and I knew it that he wanted to hear that. ( He considers her only her friend nothing more ). But 2 days later he sent me loads of paras, I was tired so I deleted Instagram n blocked him on whatsapp. Then on my bday he called, I said thank you but I was away so didn't talk much. Then this year starting we both argued again then few weeks ago, he came back saying the same he doesn't have anyone and let's start new and forget everything. He told me he was depressed and was treated too and that he stopped taking medicine also because that's his choice and that I have no say in his decision. I was mad and wanted to leave. My body, my gut resented him and I had a feeling to run away. Next day I told him that I couldn't continue friendship and end it for good. That night we argued and it ended up with me saying tomorrow we will start new and him saying tomorrow our friendship will be over because of a fight. Next day, it did ended up in a fight with same whose mistake was that and him saying that he is not sorry for anything and telling me I was wrong everywhere. I said I am sorry about everything and I cared about him, sorry if I he didn't like anything but lets forget and start something new but he didn't listen. He told me to send something to her that he wants from my account and he started asking me questions and telling me to reply as he likes and sent it to her. I declined and he said that I can't be his friend if I can't do this. Later he started abusing her n my other friend, I abused him back ( i never abuse first ) n sayin why he is being like this. Then he called me I rejected then he said that I don't have any balls to face him over call. I called him and screamed at him then hanged up and he blocked me. Then he unblocks me, I didn't want him to get depressed again so I told him sorry many times so that he can feel good or something and we made peace properly sayin we couldn't understand each other and its over. I was with him these times just because I didn't want him to get depressed anymore. Then yesterday my friend added me to a group, he was there too. He started behaving like why they added me and people like me should not be there. Our other friends didn't know about our fight. I asked him something and he ignored me. I told him to shut up. It was night so I texted him to not involve others and delete the chat, he deleted for everyone and I did too. Then I asked him if he wants to try again ( call me an idiot but i wanted to fix everything ). Then yeah, this time fight too, he didn't listen. He said he cared about me and shit. I said sorry even if I didn't wanted to but he was like sorry doesn't do anything. Then he texts her he is sorry and tells me that if she forgives him, we both can be friends again. If she doesn't, then he will cut everyone from his life. This makes no sense. I said that if she forgives, good for him. Otherwise whatever he will do, that's will be his decision and not my fault. He was like whatever I will do will be your fault only. I said that I am leavin, he was like if I leave, he will make me regret my whole life. He tells me to keep thinking that I ruined his whole life. I was so sad that I started cryin, I was like please try to understand but he says that if she forgives him, he will do whatever I like. If she doesn't, then he will cut everyone and that's final because he said that it's final. I started sending him audio recordings, explaining him for the last time that I did cared but you didn't, telling him everything from the start. He told me he is not sorry for anything and everything is my mistake. He was like stop sending recordings, stop it right now and started countdown that I'll regret if I don't stop. I didn't. After it was finished, he was like pls pls stop it rn. I stopped after sending everything then blocking him and going to sleep. Now 1 of my friends know about this fight, not the details. I asked him to take care of him and don't make this fight huge and don't tell anyone else about what happened in group.


His family know about his depression. Also he told me that he had no friend other than me or her and everyone else didn't matter. But he was laughing and chatting with these people he didn't like yesterday like a completely different person.

Also I feel very sad right now, I regret making him my friend. I didn't sleep much and was feeling depressed in the morning. What if he do something to him? He told me he won't end his life or something because of his family and that he is not a coward. I am very scared. What should I do if he approaches me again? Help me someone with any advice about how to get over this pls :(

TL;DR: Happens over text. Friend (he) fights with my other friend (she). Asks for help. After helping another arguement after few days, I take her friend's side, then he argues with me for taking her side. Then we argue for 2 years many times, he argues with her too. He gets depressed, gets the treatment but stops taking meds after a month and his family knows that, and he comes back. We try but friendship won't work. We make peace. I get added in group and he was there too. He starts arguement with me in group. We leave group and argue again. I say sorry just for the sake of his depression, he says sorry won't do anything and texts her and says if she forgives him then we can be friends n he will do whatever i like. I decided to leave, he says I'll regret if I leave. I still leave after a while and block him. I am feeling very low right now and scared about what if he gets depressed again. He blames me for everything and says he is not sorry for anything.

Edit 1: That one friend who knows about this is his other friend who went for schooling. He is his neighbour so yeah I told him to take care of him. The friend who fights with me doesn't consider him (his neighbour), afaik, his close friend but his neighbour consider him his close friend.

Edit 2: He told me not to tell her to forgive him and it will be considered cheating. Now he told my other friend to tell me that if I truly wanted friendship, I'd have cheated and made her say forgive him and made him my friend. I am mad at him. I told my other friend to not text me about his sms anymore.",09Aug2019,1

331,"Thanks for taking time to read this. I recently graduated from college and when searching for a job I really prioritize the quality of human interaction over other factors such as weather and rent. I was not raised in the US so I can be ignorant of the demographics. 

Part of the reason I don’t trust google and had to ask on reddit is that most of the nominated ‘friendly cities’ are deep red and only selectively friendly to those who look/behave like them. I felt it boils down so much to one’s personal identity so here’s a list of mine: 

- Grew up in Hong Kong and Vancouver. Not a native speaker of English but might pass as near native. 

- Origins are Chinese and Russian. Looked more Asian than Caucasian. Light brown skinned. 

- Liberal. Likes down to earth, sincere, nice people. Don’t like privileged, bubble-dwelling, and snotty liberals. 

- 22 yo female. Constantly being catcalled in public space (for being Asian? Young? Vulnerable? I have no clue. I think most harassers are trying to intimidate me in a hateful and aggressive way.) Having to go through this everyday makes me chronically angry and uncomfortable. Top priority please. 

- Moderate level of social awkwardness. Do not get or enjoy typical white humor. Hopeless at making random small talk. Like to hold more specific conversations. Studied physics and linguistics so a nerd I am :/

I hope the descriptions are helpful. I mean zero offense and apologize if anything came across as divisive. So far I’ve enjoyed Chicago expect for the misogyny and catcalling part. The major Californian cities I’ve visited were sort of self-segregating despite its demographic diversity and some spaces felt exclusively rich&amp;white.

338,"I’m about to go into my senior year of high school and I’m so overwhelmed with fears of growing up. I’m so scared of not getting accepted into college and what I will do. My passion is film but I’m choosing to go into medicine like my parents because I think that I care more about financial stability, but I don’t really know if I will be happy because my heart is always going to be chasing the film industry and wishing I could find my role there. I care a lot about where I live, what kind of house I live in, I care about the lifestyle that I would have if I have money because I have grown up both around a family that has at one point had nothing, and later has grown to a relatively wealthy lifestyle. 

Another huge factor that scares me is my parents dying. I am very close with them and our relationship with each other is the best I feel. They have so much to teach me and they have always guided me and I can’t imagine living a day without their advice, their encouragement, their guidance and it scares me even to be a mature adult, to be independent, and not have them around. I almost wish that I could die right now or die before them so I don’t have to be without them. 

It’s also not my plan at all to find love, to find marriage or start a family. As of right now, I really am disinterested in anything like that and actually would prefer that it didn’t happen because I see everywhere around me the unhappiness in couples and families. I just don’t like the idea of having getting married or having children and raising them. When I was younger I thought that I would grow out of those thoughts, but I haven’t yet. I’m so career driven. There’s so much I want to do with my life, so much I want to built in my future career and so much I want to do for myself. I truly don’t want to find a place for someone else in my path. I thought maybe this stems from my OCD because sometimes that restricts me to functioning efficiently and I can only put my focus to my goals when I am independent and in my head and I set my plan by myself and I just don’t like having others around in my way or making a commitment like that.

At the same time, I’m scared of being alone, having nothing and no one but myself with my parents gone. I’m truly a mess in my thoughts and it circles everywhere constantly. And I feel kind of stupid saying all of this because I feel that I don’t know anything about life or about the world.

340,"Was wondering what peoples thoughts are:

I often feel like I have to be the one who has to provide financially for my family (dad, mum, sister). 

Whilst I don't mind to an extent; it has given me drive and I've done quite well so far (taught myself 5 languages fluently, got a masters degree from one of the best universities for my subject, good paying job). But because all I do is work to try and meet this expectation I often miss out on social aspects of life. For example, I never really get to watch tv, go to sports games, see friends etc. As a result I've lost contact with my close friends, and all my contacts are pretty much business related contacts. Fortunately I am still able to socialise at work, but other then that my life is very solitary. 

Without going into too much detail, the reason I feel this is because my mum's health isn't good, my dad just throws all his money away (he earns at least 6 figures but never has any), my sister has a large family but no qualifications. 

It often feels like, I was the only one to make sensible decisions and now I have to just give a lot of what I earn to them. Of course they are family so I do it, but it's getting very frustrating.

How do I approach this?",09Aug2019,1
341,"I’ve never been one to exaggerate, but these past couple months have been the hardest/worst of my life (22M). I guess I’ll start off with my dad getting laid off earlier this year. It’s put a real strain on my family. My parents are currently losing everything. They are selling what they have left and jumping ship to another state to live with other family. But they’re also getting a divorce so they heading to different states at the end of this month.  I’m currently working 2 jobs and in college (which I’ve done since graduating high school). It hasn’t been easy balancing 60 hour work weeks with a college schedule. Now with my family losing everything, any extra money I’ve been making has been going toward trying to help my family stay afloat. I’ve fallen behind on my own bills and I’ve barely put a dent in my parents bills. They gave me and my younger sister the ultimatum of moving with one of them  or staying here in our hometown and supporting ourselves. We both chose to stay. 
 
They are also both sick. My dad has had 5 heart attacks (heavy smoker) in the past 8-9 years, along with plenty of surgeries to go with them. Literally just yesterday, he had an episode and had to take his medicine that stops it from turning into a heart attack. I was the only one here to help, and the only words he would say are “I’m tired” and “please take me” which is something a son doesn’t want to hear a parent say.  My mom is a recovering alcoholic who is in mild need of a liver transplant who also has a past of suicidal thoughts/tendencies. 
 
 Trying to pay my bills and also help them has really been stressing me as well usually leaving me almost penniless just a day or 2 after payday. I know I should focus on my first, but it’s heartbreaking to see my parents suffering so bad even though they’ve given me and my 2 sisters plenty of suffering throughout the years. 
 
 So I guess the overall story I’m trying to tell is, my family is financially broke. I mean absolutely no money broke. My parents are divorcing and moving to different states. I’m broke and behind on bills. I can’t go back to school right now because I’m going to have to pick up more work since I’m 100% on my own. To make matters worse, my car broke down tonight and I don’t know where I’m going to find the money to have it towed and fixed, which in turn is going to cost me 3 shifts at work over this weekend because I have no way to get there. All this has happened in the past 2-3 months and it’s like whenever I find some kind of temporary solution, a bigger problems arises the next day. I can’t seem to find a way to make anything work.

Also learning at a faster pace would help, it’d help pass the time. And right now I’m just at a loss of what to do. I don’t have any Spanish or French speaking friends that I know well enough to broach the subject.

343,I'm(18 years old) going to university next year and Its tempting to move out of the house away from my parents. My Mother has struggled with her mental health for years. She did things I will never forget and she's always actively searching for a fight. I have saved more than enough money to study without making any debt. However moving out will cost a lot of money and I don't know if it's wort it. I'm afraid that me moving out will push my mother in a suicidal state back again. But on the other hand she has made my life a living hell.,09Aug2019,2
344,"I’m about to go into my senior year of high school and I’m so overwhelmed with fears of growing up. I’m so scared of not getting accepted into college and what I will do. My passion is film but I’m choosing to go into medicine like my parents because I think that I care more about financial stability, but I don’t really know if I will be happy because my heart is always going to be chasing the film industry and wishing I could find my role there. I care a lot about where I live, what kind of house I live in, I care about the lifestyle that I would have if I have money because I have grown up both around a family that has at one point had nothing, and later has grown to a relatively wealthy lifestyle. 

Another huge factor that scares me is my parents dying. I am very close with them and our relationship with each other is the best I feel. They have so much to teach me and they have always guided me and I can’t imagine living a day without their advice, their encouragement, their guidance and it scares me even to be a mature adult, to be independent, and not have them around. I almost wish that I could die right now or die before them so I don’t have to be without them. 

It’s also not my plan at all to find love, to find marriage or start a family. As of right now, I really am disinterested in anything like that and actually would prefer that it didn’t happen because I see everywhere around me the unhappiness in couples and families. I just don’t like the idea of having getting married or having children and raising them. When I was younger I thought that I would grow out of those thoughts, but I haven’t yet. I’m so career driven. There’s so much I want to do with my life, so much I want to built in my future career and so much I want to do for myself. I truly don’t want to find a place for someone else in my path. I thought maybe this stems from my OCD because sometimes that restricts me to functioning efficiently and I can only put my focus to my goals when I am independent and in my head and I set my plan by myself and I just don’t like having others around in my way or making a commitment like that.

At the same time, I’m scared of being alone, having nothing and no one but myself with my parents gone. I’m truly a mess in my thoughts and it circles everywhere constantly. And I feel kind of stupid saying all of this because I feel that I don’t know anything about life or about the world. 

TL:DR I’m scared of to growing up, entering into life after high school, university, a career, adulthood, losing my parents...",09Aug2019,1
345,"Hello, I am making this post because I really need some help.

My close friend, whom I've promised to help with this, is getting a circumcision next week because of some health issues.

The thing is, he hid it from his parents (we're both 19), he hasn't told them about the check up at the doctor's nor the operation he has to get done because ""it's too embarassing and there's no way he's telling them.""

Well, after the operation you're supposed to be in bed for a few days with minimal movement in order for it heal up a bit, and then start moving. But, we don't know how to make it seem less suspicious that he's gonna be in bed for about two days without his mom getting mad or too worried.

We thought about saying he got the flu or sth but his mom will most likely take him to the doctor and it's gonna be obvious that it's a lie if he doesn't have a high temperature.

So, the question is, does anybody have an idea for an excuse as to why he's in a bed all the time? And please don't say just to tell his mom, he's gonna avoid that option at all costs.

Thank you",09Aug2019,3

347,"Sorry if this seems scatter-brained, it’s tough for me to put it all into words so if something doesn’t make sense feel free to ask. I also don’t expect a clear answer since this seems like a complicated situation. 

So about 5 years ago my parents divorced, and my mom (being being too prideful) didn’t want alimony. The tax returns were around $20k that year, and my dad decided to take all that money for himself (before they finalized the divorce). My mom had made no objection which really bothered me.

A little backstory:
I also come from a Muslim family, and my dad’s family pretty much cut ties with her while my dad bragged to everyone how he bought her a house and a business (not true at all). Before the divorce they told her she would go to hell for wanting the separation, and they made some sort of “intervention” with her. 

Throughout their 25+ year marriage my mom worked full time, while also doing all the cooking, cleaning and taking care of my sisters and I (there are 3 of us). My mom also supported my dad while he studied for his masters since he was barely present. Around 10 years ago my dad started working outside of the country, so now we see him about once or twice a year. My mom pretty much raised my sister (from 5 and beyond) on her own while maintaining her own new business. My other sister and I helped as best we could, but we also had school and work. We were in high school at the time.

Present day:
So basically at this point my mom barely has any money since her business is failing, and my dad refuses to help her. He still thinks he’s been the primary financial provider throughout the entire marriage, even though she made the same as him for 15 years. He even spread lies to my mom’s family and friends during the separation which made my mom lose a sister and many friends. He even thinks my sisters and I were tainted by my mom since two of us have tattoos and colored hair.

My sister is almost 16 now and she helps out with the business. She buys her own clothes and things while my dad only gives her enough to probably pay for her food. My dad makes really good money and is barely present in her life. To spite my mom he even bought a brand new, huge 4 bedroom house in a gated community WHICH HE DOESN’T EVEN LIVE IN SINCE HE WORKS OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY. My mom might even lose her own house while my dad offers to pay the somewhat large school debt my other sister and i have. I could use the money, however my mother and youngest sister should be the priority. My mom refuses to ask for more child support even though it barely covers the cost of her food. He genuinely thinks he’s helping and we talk everyday, but I’m not sure how to approach this situation without it getting heated. At this point I’m starting to resent him, but I don’t know what to do.

I’m beyond stressed since my mom is barely staying afloat and I quit my job to help the business, however at this point I’m not getting paid anymore. There’s a lot going on and I’m not even financially stable myself, but (like my mom) I don’t want to ask my dad for help. I’m wondering if at this point I should threaten to cut ties with him unless he helps my mom and youngest sister. What can I do?",09Aug2019,1
348,"We are both in our early 20s so this is new. I have never felt loss like this before and I want to help him as much as possible but I don’t know how. I just remind him that I’m here and just to tell me if he needs anything, and he’s been doing ok. 

Tomorrow he wants to go alone to her apt (where they found her a few weeks after it happened) and all he needs to do is unlock the door, he can go inside but it is not recommended. I don’t think it’s a good idea for him to go alone, I at least want to drive him.

351,"Okay so i need to get this off my chest and just want advice on how i should react without being impolite. So lets start from the beginning my friends, this summer i decided to go back to the gym to get ready for next years boxing season, so every morning i wake up get to the gym by walking really far and taking a bus up the hill, when i get to the gym I say hi to some regulars including our friend the 40M who im going to call Jack. So i say Hi to Jack shake his hand or whatever then go do my thing until one day while waiting at the bus stop after a long session i see him go by in his car, wave at me, and ask me if i want a ride, of course i want a ride but i don't know him to well so decline. A few weeks later the same thing happens ans i accept the ride, so he drives me to where i need to be, we chat in the car, it was quite pleasant. So up to here nothing special no red flags or anything. One of the days following him driving me down he comes up to me and aks if i want to go to the beach with him, i was super confused and blurted out ""if you want"", he then gave me his number and i decided i was never going to text him but he asked me to call his phone. So now im stuck with this guy texting me asking me if i want to have an ice-cream with him one evening. How do i tell him i don't fucking want to go see his weird ass outside of the gym politely even though i somewhat ""led him on"" by saying ""if you want"", i think i just need a good excuse to never see him.",09Aug2019,2

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

353,"Now, here's the thing. I belong to a delinquentish group, a very unstable one. My existence there rocks the boat that the group was riding as I am one of the weaker students in the group, with a weak physique and heart. A mere anomaly, but it's not like I belong anywhere else, I really don't.

The group's center figure, let's call him Jason, is a really cool dude. We got along while working part-time and he's a pretty chill guy who gets along with everyone. He's the reason why I'm in the group in the first place. 

There's another person, let's call him Dave whose entire being is utterly focused on making me life miserable. He's lowkey trying to maks it a living hell.

 Stealing me lunches(""as a joke"") and tricking me to eat food that was dropped to the ground(again, ""as a joke""). It got to the point that, to avoid being the butt of the joke for the group, I was bullying someone weaker than me to make HIM the butt of the joke, and not me. Extremely fucked, I know.

Earlier, Dave and I got to a fight. It was inevitable, but I didn't expect it to be too soon. The reason for the fighting is quite stupid: he straight up accused me of opening his bag, yup that's it---opening his bag. This guy's just looking for a reason to beat me up, isn't he?

The class was in a deep silence as this guy pushed me, telling me to fuck off. Now, here's where you might get frustrated with me... Yes, I'm weak, but hot damn am I prideful, I don't want to be the guy that backs down because he's scared... This attitude of mine caused me to taunt him, and making jokes about him to the class, to show how fucking in control I was. It was a joke to calm his tits, not something offensive. But, Dave suddenly punched me, hard. Just when I thought it couldn't get quieter, the class fell to a deeper silence.

His punch was directed towards my heart, something that is very very weak. With all my will power, I was trying to act unfazed despite being shook by shock, anger, and helplessness. I was glaring at him, still acting the tough guy. Sad thing is, this guy could beat me up, no sweat, he's that strong. He is, after all, an upcoming boxer, or so the school claims.

Now, seeing that he punched me in my chest, several of my classmates suddenly called him out on it. A friend from the same group, held me back, saying that I'd rather just keep quiet. But, I don't like keeping quiet, that's just not me, so I kept taunting him, ready for another punch. 

Dave glared at me, I glared back, then he got out of the class. I did the same, cutting classes, as my heart started to show signs of stress.

What do I do now? I don't want to get out of the group(so that's not an option). I don't belong anywhere else. I'll become an outcast, again. This is literally the only path I could imagine myself taking.

Because of this incident, there'll be a fracture in the group. I don't think that 2/3 of them would be by my side. Jason might also choose Dave instead of me, seeing that I'm quite a problem child, and he's probably hated me for some time(relating with my past with arson and theft, the latter I had attempted the week before because I was showing off.)

In many ways more than one, my acts that I thought were courageous backfired. But, Dave's not justified in screwing me over all those months. I didn't do shit to him, even helping him at times. Now, I'm the unstable group might break or push me out. 

I would do anything remotely under my limits, even the underhanded ones. Just... Just not leaving the group. That group is all I have, the closest thing I have to actual friends. I'm an outcast, shouldering previous cases of arson and theft. I'm being constantly avoided, and, the sad part is, I'm not good at starting the conversations, which pushes me deeper into isolation. So, I can't just leave the group. I don't even know what tell them or Dave when I'll finally face them again.

What should I do?",09Aug2019,1
354,"It wasn't working. I had been feeling like he was on and off for a while, and when I confronted him about it he admitted it. He proposed to just take some time apart - but what I needed was for him to be all in and fight for us. The time apart was just another arms-length-move and it would put me in further limbo waiting on him to decide if he fully can be in a relationship or not. So I said it would be best to break up and he figures out why he cannot deal with being loved and why he walls up, and I finally move on to other adventures and eventually to someone who can love me better.

I hope I did the right thing. It stings and sucks all kinds of ass, coz we were so perfect for each other in so many ways. And it hurts to hear him say that he sees me as the person for him and that he loves me still and yet he can't be with me. 
But I think it's important I move on. I just wish it didn't hurt so much and that the mere thought of dating other people didn't give me the urge to throw up my insides. 

Sadly I seem to be drawn to these emotionally confused men and probably I need to take a good long hard look into why that is. But I just feel like I'm tired of waiting. Tired of bs. I really want the next time to be more honest, vulnerable and strong.

I dunno what advice I'm seeking tbh. Maybe ideas for how to deal with the loneliness I know is coming. To swap war stories. Not to feel like I'm a failure coz I'm in my 30's and single again.
I do feel like a full person with good values, great carreer and friends. But being broken by love is just something that always leaves me feeling 'mission failed'.
But I guess that's normal. My people relations have always meant more to me than carreer, money or status. So failing on that front will always hurt more.",09Aug2019,2

I’ve been with my current boyfriend for half a year now but as much as I love him, I can’t get over my most recent ex who is also his best friend. Seems fucked up, I know. Things weren’t exactly clear when we broke up and I think I drove us apart because I needed more attention than he was giving and I have become much more mature in that sense, but when we ended our relationship it was very confusing to me and I think about it everyday. I’m still good friends with my ex, we don’t text or talk a lot unless we are in person and we get along very well. He’s told me that he really cares about me and loves me but only in a platonic way but also that at some points he regrets breaking up with me. He is not super great at picking the right words in social situations, and sometimes would reference our past relationship in an awkward way that makes me feel confused. I do however love my current boyfriend just as much, but because we are all good friends we hang out a lot together, sometimes in groups and sometimes it’s just the three of us. Most of the time, whenever we hang out or even if I just see my ex I get extremely depressed afterwards because I miss him so much and I wish I could go back in time and change everything. I feel unfaithful to my current boyfriend because of this but I’ve never told him that I never got over my ex/his best friend.

363,"TL;DR I lost my eligibility for financial aid, so I can't pay for upcoming semester; consistently poor grades since Spr 2018 semester; can't balance work, studying, and practicing (music major). It just seems like higher education isn't the path for me. 

I started at my 4yr uni in the fall of 2017 and have so far only taken 3 semesters of class. I took a semester off for Spring 2019 because of mental health and the fact that I lost my eligibility for financial aid. When I took the semester off, I planned on appealing for financial aid for fall 2019, little did I know I required an official document to support my testimony of why my grades were so poor, but there's no medical record for ""felt suicidal so I didn't show up to class"" because all I did was go to therapy. I ended up opting for getting some loans for this coming semester. 

Since I lost my eligibility for fin aid, I didn't get any federal student loan offers, as they are offered through the school, so I started looking into private loans. I did my research and most people say private loans are rarely worth the education they're paying for because of interest rates and such. This is what initially made me consider dropping out.

To go through all this, to put myself into all this debt, stress, and depression, just to struggle for another 3 years.. That doesn't seem worth it. When I was enrolled, I never even performed well academically. I feel like I'm just setting myself up to fail over and over if I go back to school. 

I don't want to quit, but if I keep stressing myself out with school and money, I'm going to fall back into the depression kept me from class and forced me into therapy. But this time, I won't have a therapist because it was through the school that I had one at all. 

My plan is to stay in this town even after dropping out, get a full time job to pay my bills and start paying back my student loans (I think it's in the $12,000-15,000 area). After that, I don't know what I'd want to do for the rest of my life.

378,"I have a boyfriend, and this is my first serious relationship. I have dated both men and women in the past, and don’t have a preference of one over the other. I’m in my early twenties. For most of my life I have been staunchly childfree, but that is slowly changing. 

I was thinking about possibly getting pregnant by my boyfriend (in the far future), and the idea of a long pregnancy and birth through my body both scares and disgusts me, though I am very open to adoption. This has been the case for all my life.

A few days ago I found a YouTube video of a lesbian couple talking about their experience with IVF and I realized that thinking about getting pregnant and going through all that when my partner is a woman doesn’t give me the same gut, visceral reaction that going through pregnancy with a male partner does. I have no idea why I never thought about this before, maybe because this is my first serious relationship and it happens to be with a guy, but it scares me a little.

I love my boyfriend and I am very, very attracted to him. I’m pretty sure I want to spend my life with him. But the intensity and difference of feeling when thinking about this is making me second guess myself. Am I just deluding myself into thinking I’m attracted to men? I don’t know what to think.

So essentially, is it normal to want different things based on what gender your partner is?",09Aug2019,2
379,"I moved country three years ago, but on a recent visit back to my home country, I visited my grandma. She told me that, since my granddad died a year ago, she's been so lonely - she hates living in the assisted living apartment she's in, and she sees her children (my dad and his two brothers) about once every six months. They all live in the same country, about 4 hours away, but in different directions.

She says she'd like to live in between all three, so they could each be only 2 hours away. My dad actually has a (currently empty) small bungalow on his property, which he usually rents out, but it has a few stairs in it, and grandma can't do stairs any more. I also can't imagine my dad agreeing to let her live there. Not for any cruel or selfish reasons, I just don't think he'll think it's a good idea. I am also pretty sure he won't think her moving at all is a good idea, and she won't be able to do it without his approval and aid.

What can I possibly do? I live across the ocean and I can't afford to come home often - maybe once a year, if that. I sent her a letter after the anniversary of my granddad's death and I know she appreciated it, but it's not enough.

So we get to hanging out and it’s okay. But then towards the end they thought that it would be appropriate to talk about their sibling’s sex-life in front of my mom (of ALL PEOPLE). Specifically that they had caught them doing it and told on them. I was beyond amazed at this and my mom and I talked about it. I didn’t know how to casually bring it up to that person, and things have continued to go downhill from there.

385,"Hi all

This is not related to my recent post concerning leaving my job. 

I have done some self reflecting recently and have found that I must lack the ""screw this"" ability. Basically I am 30 years old now, like to keep my nose squeaky clean at work and in my personal life (not much of a risk taker etc), but I have one thing that affects me above all else is the ability to ""not care"". Basically Ive seen people at work take a kicking for doing something wrong and literally it doesn't phase them. Its like water off a ducks back as the saying goes. Me however, any little mistake, any big mistake I take it massively to heart. I cant seem to move passed it. It plays on my mind, it makes me think that everyone hates me, it makes me hate life, want to end it (I should mention I have depression and take medication for this), if its work related I feel like I have to quit.

390,"I have been working in this job a year now. It is much better than my last job, but, the majority of what my work entials is just copy and pasting which as I'm sure you can imagine gets boring very quickly. It's only taken me a year to get bored rather than a month or two because I didn't fully understand what I needed to do for each query. Now I know, it all just entials copyign and pasting information.   


This would be fine and all, buy my manager will not let me do anything to keep me from losing my focus. She won't let me listen to music. We're not allowed breaks others than our lunch hour. I pretty much just find myself doodling on paint or on facebook and twitter because my attention span for copying and pasting for 9 hours a day is now none existent.   


I have never asked my manager directly about listening to music, I have asked my supervisor who has said that it is absolutely not allowed. I've asked why and the best answer I have had is because colleagues need to be able to communicate about work. Wich okay, fair enough, I understand with the other people on my team as they do a slightly different job to myself which does require them to be able to communicate. But I sit in a corner allllll day doing the same stuff and nobody talks to me all day. Even if they needed to and I had my music on they could just tap me on the shoulder or IM me the question or anything. I really don't see a reason not to allow it other than stubborness.

Is there any alternatives I can turn to to help me keep my focus or am I forever doomed as approaching my manager to ask if I can listen to music is not really an option, she is the kind of boss you can't approach about anything if you don't want to be belittled and spoken to like a child for making a suggestion.",09Aug2019,1

394,"Hey this is a throwaway because too many friends know my main account. 

I am just hoping to seek out advice regarding a summer job. I was employed at this summer camp job last year, and had a great experience with it so I decided to return again this year and because I returned, my pay also increased above the minimum wage. The first week of summer camp season I was working, then I got no shifts for 2 weeks. Seeing how it was my year returning and I was given more shifts last year, I asked my new manager if it was possible for me to get more shifts or to do any spare jobs needed at the camp because I also have to worry about making my rent payments. My manager told me that camp hours are based on registration and that there’s not enough kids for me to be called even though I saw other employees being scheduled. As I was going into my third week of not working, I decided to email the main manager and cc HR (HR never replied to me) and ask them if there’s anyway possible I could get more shifts like the amount I had last year. He emailed me back and told me that shifts are given based on performance and that my new manager does not think that I have very good performance compared to the other employees. Okay this is a fair reason I thought, but I emailed him back asking if it was possible at all to get reassessed as my manager at camp last year had no issues with me and that I was worried that the current manager and I may have had a miscommunication of some sorts. One week goes by and I still don’t hear from him so I decided to email him again asking how he is doing and hoping to get in touch with him about the scheduling (sent the second email to him last Thursday). Again, I wait one week and still no response. Then a few days ago, I get an email from my manager saying that she doesn’t need me anymore for the rest of the summer (even though there’s 3 weeks left now and last year at camp the last few weeks were the busiest) and she took me off the email list and removed me from the Facebook work chat. I am really frustrated because all I wanted was to work the same amount of hours as I did last year to be able to make my rent payments and most of the workers I work with are still in high school or under the age of majority (my manager is even younger than me) and probably don’t have to worry about rent and college fees like I do. 

I am really not sure what to do - I am thinking of calling the main manager to speak to him directly but I’m not sure what to say or I could just move on from this job? My college program does not recommend working during the semester and I don’t think I’ll be able to find a summer job for another 3 weeks. I feel that my manager this year got a bad impression from me somehow and I feel very sad about this or maybe they did not like it when I was asking them for more shifts in order to make my rent payments. 

Thanks for any advice.

395,"Hi everyone, I'm a 33/F and I'm finding myself in a really weird place right now. In the last couple of years I've lost interest in most things other people are interested in and the resulting alienation has started to get to me.

My life situation is a bit complicated. A couple of years ago I had a serious health problem which the doctors additionally overblew, telling me that I can basically expect to become disabled in a few years down the line, which turned out to be wrong, but nevertheless the trauma remained. Soon after that I met a wonderful guy who helped me through everything and we're now living together in a harmonious relationship. 

So, where is the problem? Well, I think that the trauma made me consider my life more deeply and greatly transformed me as a person. I am now a lot more focused on meaningful and long-term things and almost unable to live in the moment. I stopped deriving pleasure from hedonistic things such as going out or holidays because I see no benefit from that. Instead, I am obsessed with home improvement, developing a business, thinking about raising children, taking major steps for the future and so on. I'm also extremely happy with my boyfriend and the two of us are having a blast, always cracking jokes and doing stuff for each other, so I'm rarely motivated to go out. I'm forcing myself to go out and hang out with people, but when I come home, I'm only exhausted. When I'm with my friends I feel like I'm observing them from a distance, as they're all a lot more engaged with each other's stories. Usually when people talk I just nod and listen without feeling the need to say anything, while, for example, another friend of mine will put in a lot of feedback or say something witty which will make everyone laugh. I've noticed that in a group, people will subconsciously turn to other people when talking and overlook me, which makes me feel crappy. Or another example - social media - I find posting selfies and pictures of one's daily life completely idiotic (something I enthusiastically did in my 20s), but other people seem to be enjoying that a lot and they engage with each other more. I do care about the people around me, but I can't seem to find a connection. I like serious and intellectually challenging conversations, but I'm afraid that I'm turning into a huge bore as I don't think being so-deep-you-can't-have-a-laugh is a positive personality trait. On the other hand, I'm being extremely silly and playful with my boyfriend, so there's a huge contrast there.

I'm not sure this is all due to trauma, because my brother is actually similar. He's extremely successful (not that I am) and focused on his work most of the time, but has  a hard time relating to other people because he finds them boring, and he's kinda neurotic. I wanted to avoid being like him, but the older I get it seems like it's my destiny.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated.",09Aug2019,2

I live with my family who don't understand my mental illness at all. 

My mother set up a therapist appointment for me but I couldn't go because I couldn't control my actions. One of my family members even asked me if I wanted a ride there and I said no because that's what my body wanted to say. I'm in deep despair now because my life is depressing and lonely and I have no hope for my future.

I consider suicide frequently but I can't even begin to try it most of the time. I don't want to die I just need to send a signal to someone that I need serious help. If I can someday try to leave my house to walk around the block or somewhere equivalent I might be able to keep walking until I die. Though I don't want to die.

Its mostly impossible for people to tell that I'm not in control of my actions because I look normal and act normal outwardly. That isn't what I feel inside most of the time. I'm not on any medications or anything.

I usually can't make or answer phone calls, drive, or talk to anyone outside my immediate family. So I haven't been able to solicit help from anyone. I can write emails usually freely for some reason, though. But even when I can control myself I still don't want to embarrass myself with my family.

My body fights any effort I make to control it. I'm sorry if this post sounds really robotic, I haven't been able to sleep tonight because of my despair. I live in the USA so mental health care is complicated.

401,"Hello,

I’m 25 and have never had a boyfriend. I’m not sure why, I think it’s a mixture of a lot of things, including bad luck. Here’s an overview of my abysmal dating history 

14-18: Guys weren’t really interested in me. I had a couple of crushes and a couple of guys that had crushes on me for short periods of time but it never led to anything. I found out that one guy I liked did like me back but he wasn’t going to pursue anything because his family was racist and I’m black.

19-23: First 2 years of college I was a premed and division 1 athlete. All I did was go to school, go to practice, and sleep. I didn’t have a social life outside of my teammates. My last two years I went out slightly more— I had one guy confess that he always wanted to talk to me but only got the guts to do so during the spring semester of my senior year— so that led nowhere. I ended up going on a date with one guy who was friends with my best-friend’s boyfriend, he had asked her to set us up. That date didn’t lead to much because he was not over his ex.

23-25: I’ve been dating people solely off of dating apps. My first year out of college I moved back to my hometown and knew I wasn’t going to be there for long so I only passively dated. I recently moved to a new city where I know no one so I’ve kind of started over. In this new city (I’ve lived here for 8 months so far), I’ve gone on 14 online first dates (and more 2nd and 3rd dates). Half of the first dates I wasn’t interested in, a quarter weren’t interested in me, and the rest the feeling was mutual.

OKAY, so now that you know my dating history, how worried should I be? I don’t want this to be a red flag because I feel like there’s nothing wrong that I did—I just have really bad luck!

Any advice on what I can do differently? I already know that I need to improve my social life. I’ve got so many friends from college but they’re all spread out and none of them live near me. I’m still working on building my social life in this new city I’m in.",09Aug2019,2

407,"I (18f) went to a two-week-long seminar. I met a lot of new friends there, including “Hannah” (16f) and “Laurel” (17f), who are both from the same city about an eight-hour drive from where I live. 

Hannah and Laurel aren’t particularly good friends with each other. Over the course of the seminar, I became close friends with Laurel, but not with Hannah. Hannah and I were just acquaintances. 

After we parted ways and went back to our home cities, I added both girls on Instagram. First I added Laurel. I noticed that her bio included a link to a modeling agency page. I thought it was a little odd, because she never mentioned modeling, but I wasn’t all that surprised because she’s very tall and has the perfect figure to be a plus-size model. Then I added Hannah and noticed that her bio contained a link to her page from the same modeling agency. This seemed off to me. Hannah’s very pretty, but she’s shorter than a typical model and taller than a petite-size model. Also, it struck me as unusual that I met two girls from the same city, neither of them mentioned modeling, and both of them happen to model for the same agency. 

Anyway, I went on the website for this agency. The website claimed to be an exclusive, award winning agency based in the city Hannah and Laurel live in. I thought this was weird because the city the girls are from is a rather small city that’s about an hour and a half drive from a big city. You’d think a major modeling agency would be based in that big city, right? 

I’m wondering if this “agency” is preying on teenage girls’ hunger for attention and acceptance to get money out of them. It just seems really sketchy.

410,"So I've been talking with this girl for about a year and a half now (she is 19, I am 20) and over time I've started to really like her. I told her a long time ago that I was starting to crush on her but didn't like it. I feel really bad about that, not so much for whatever I was feeling, but because of how I went about it/how long we had been talking when I said this (maybe 4-8months in). Fast forward to now and I've been pretty good about keeping romantic feelings away from her with the exception of some ""what if"" feelings every now and then. 

I recently found out that she has thought I was cute this entire time and once again I'm getting myself caught in a ""what if she likes me back, these feelings would be ok then"" train of thought. 

Another big problem here is that I just recently told her how i regretted saying i was crushing on her and how i felt it was weird. All she really had to say about it was that I seemed to have moved on so she shouldn't be worried. I replied with it was one sided so yeah

And for the bombshell on why I feel weird about this-
It's an online friendship and we are on opposite sided of the world. We've never met. We haven't even verbally spoken to each other. I heard her voice once for like 3 seconds but she hasn't heard mine. 
This girl has been one of the nicest friends I've ever had and I am always eager to talk. She is awesome. 

Yesterday we were talking about inboxes blowing up and I told her about how when a post of mine got slightly popular I had notifications randomly for like 3 days and she asked what the post was. The only problem is the post is about her (see post history) I don't know if I should let her see the post after what told her just days ago. Also when I made the post my mindset was just that she is a bad ass friend. I didnt really have romantic  feelings at that time of posting. I've been just fine suppressing my feelings so I definitely could continue on with it. 

Should I show the post and explain myself?

411,"There's someone I'm interested in and who seemed to be interested in me too. The problem is that recently, for reasons I don't want to detail, I've had a big lapse in confidence that has resulted in me bringing back bad habits. Basically I've been people pleasing and acting like a doormat and it seems like this person has picked up on it and lost romantic interest. 

I will put an end to the people pleasing regardless but I really like this person and I want to try to salvage things if it's even remotely possible. Is it possible? If so how do I even start? I guess if nothing else how do I stop myself from relapsing like this again?",09Aug2019,1
412,"So my girlfriend had met some guy right after our first date. They apparently hit it off really well and had awesome chemistry. The thing was he was from out of state. (She also said if he wasn’t from out of state, she would’ve talked to both of us for longer to see where things would’ve gone).

So they talked and sexted for a month until she said she met someone (me) and didn’t want to be sending nudes anymore.

Then after that they flirted pg style until the day before we became official (exclusive). This was during and after she took me to meet all her friends. Her family. And we even went on a 3 day trip together.

During this stuff though, she was curving him when he’d say stuff like “stop talking to that guy already, I want you” and she would say too late he missed his chance.

And he sent a couple messages after we were official, but she only replied to one that started a slight mini conversation, but nothing out of line. But when I asked if they messaged AT ALL during our official relationship, she tried to bend the truth. But she ended up showing me all the messages when I asked when she told him about me.

She had also deleted him from Facebook and unfollowed him on Instagram on her own before I even knew about him.

So she’s handled things fine since we’ve been official.

And now I have no doubt at all that I’m her #1 100%. She handles things great now and treats me great. She definitely shows she cares.

But man, I just cannot get past being her second choice at the beginning. I remember the messages she showed me clearly because it bothers me so much.

Why would I wanna be with someone in which I was their second choice? It makes me feel super crummy and not special. Everyone deserves to feel special in their relationship.

And all the things she does now would make me feel very special if it wasn’t for that other stuff.

What’s your take?

TLDR: I was my gfs second choice and it sucks.",09Aug2019,1
413,"I'm 22 years old and while I've had relationships, I'm still a virgin because my last relationship was 6 years ago, was short lived and we were both ""good kids"" who just enjoyed  eachothers company. Our relationship ended cause she moved far away.


One of my 3 college teachers found out I'm a virgin (can't remember how, think my friends and I were joking about it) and he has mocked me for it for essentially a year; he's the kinda guy that does one night stands. 

Before anyone suggest: while I haven't personally said anything about it to my head of year, others have complained about his behaviour (he got a student in a fucking headlock) and the head of year just laughs it off and essentially says: ""boys will be boys!"" (Sounds shocking, but education here is notoriously terrible where I live; it is literally considered third world.)

I'm not actually that upset about being a virgin at my age: it's more common than you think and even then, I want to lose it to someone I actually care about in a loving relationship rather than ""Dude! You gotta do her, it's your only chance!""

Not going to lie and say that being a virgin is amazing, but I'm a nervous wreck working on my self image and confidence; having therapy and going to the gym to help rebuild what I lost. I've got friends and video games, I'm pretty content at the moment.

But I've got another year with this guy and I'm not really looking forward to it. What should I do?",09Aug2019,2

Since the first day, I was anxious if his friends would be my friends as well. 2 months since the first day, we started fighting alot since he was losing his time spent with me. He became quite focused on his friends, but still the same sweet guy since we first met.

Recently, one of his female friends (she’s quite beautiful) have been hinting (I think) that she likes my boyfriend. Just recently, me and my boyfriend were talking thru chat and I noticed he was quite distracted. I found out it was actually because he was comforting his female friend (apparently, the female friend is one-sidedly in love with a friend that has a girlfriend (what a coincidence,right?)). I can’t talk to him about it because I know he has alot of problems right now and I don’t wanna be a burden.

416,"I am a General Manager at a small retails tote in Virginia. I have worked their for three years. The problem with my store is that no one stays and works long. I am constantly hiring. I hired 4 people this past April to work as parting associates and out of this 4 only one person is still currently working at my store.

I had the opportunity to give one Peraon the title as 3rd assistant manager. It was between two females. One was a girl that had started in April and the other was a girl that started in February. 

I chose the girl that started in April because she catches on quickly and because she dresses more like a person who works at a retail store. The problem is she has a poor reliability problem. She acts like a manager but she calls out for stupid things, she tells us that she needs days off all of the time and we always have to work around HER schedule. Managers at my store are required to work 36 hours and this week she could only work 30

The woman that started in February. She has a good work ethic. She comes to work she covers everyone’s shift she’s never lte and she hasn’t called out yet. But, she is a slow learner. She isn’t stern and she doesn’t dress properly for a retail store. She comes to work comfortable but, her work reliability and her work ethic is there.

The thing is my team's manager think I have not been very oriented towards work and has given me a very low rating for my mid year review. This review is just an indication and nothing final.Final review is at end of year. 

Now, I do watever work with a good/satisfactory performance but I am not being assigned conatant work. The frequency of projects is uneven and there are sometimes days/weeks where I don't do anything that contributes to company. ( I utilise this time to study /research or sometimes do absolutely nothing)

Not being assigned work isn't my fault, but the upper management makes it seems it is by pushing for a low rating. If the ratings dont improve I might be pushed to a different team or worse, fired. There is also an issue that team doesn't have a budget for me that comes up and I think this is a way they are doing this.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

I tried to help him when he first was released, but he quit talking to me when I wouldn’t call his parole officer over something that was 100% his fault and problem(he was in jail). He is hateful towards me mainly because he thinks my life is easier then his  and because I told my mom he is stealing from her. He never confronted me about it but knows I told her.

423,"Hi, it's the school holidays at the moment and everyday we are stuck at home 24/7 because our parents never take us anywhere.  Whether it's a beach, a theme park, a zoo, cinema, or a drive, or a meal out- nothing.

My mother watches TV all day and it's like she can't hear a thing we say when she does, she's like so glued to the TV. My dad doesn't take us anywhere, he's the only one that drives too. He's a bit verbally abusive too. We can't have a nice normal conversation with him and we don't like to be around him.

What has been upsetting me is seeing my 7 year old sister have no one to play with. She has to play on her own at home and she's always bored. This ends up with her going on my mother's phone watching YouTube for hours and playing phone games. On YouTube I've noticed she watches other kids play and family kid vlogs

If she could play with kids her age it would have been great. No one comes to our house and we can't go to others houses.

424,"Alright so I'm 15 and I've been hitting the gym for the past couple of month or so, which seems pretty common for my age. Ive been doing the general program until now. So aat the gym it is a common sight to see protein shakes taken either pre or post workouts. So the other day I went to ""fitness shop"" basically like a pharmacy that is specialized in fitness products mainly protein powders and shakes. So the dude there told me that I need to be 18 years of age or older to use them and that he doesn't really recommend them in general. I didn't really mind that as I mostly wanted to know about them and if they suit me, but he also tolde that I really shouldn't be getting into lifting until I'm 18 and that I should stick to sports like swimming and the likes, and that hitting the gym now (lifting) would negatively effect my vertical growth and could result in back problems.
One thing that he said made me kind off doubt him though which was that I wouldn't get any muscle and strength gains in the first 6 month of working out, which goes against my and my friend's experiences. As I have defently noticed muscle and strength gains over just 1 month of working out 3~5 times a week. Plus I don't really see how working out would negatively effect my vertical growth. So if there are any trainers or physiotherapists or anyone that can help me with their experience that would be very appreciated. Thanks!",09Aug2019,2

428,"Every time we argue, my boyfriend says it’s me. He says I twist things, but I don’t purposely try to twist anything? I’m not purposely manipulating anything, but I guess I want to know if you guys think I am subconsciously? 

I’ve expressed to him that maybe it’s a communication issue, and the way he says it, I misinterpret what he meant. But he says no, it’s me, not how he said it. Sometimes he’ll admit to not even remembering what we’re arguing about but he’ll stand by what he’s saying, and says he wouldn’t if he didn’t have a moral reason to and so he knows he’s right. 

It seems like he thinks he’s so smart and always right and honestly I’m just tired of it and want to know if it’s me or him. Or just miscommunication. But he seems completely unwilling to acknowledge it could be a communication issue, as if one of us, as in me, just has to be at fault. So if that is what it is, do I just give up since we can’t work on something he can’t acknowledge? 

It feels like he doesn’t even listen to me and my points feel valid to me... he is older than me so maybe I am a little more immature but it just feels like he becomes unreasonable and implies things that really hurt. I’d like to think I’m a decently good, nice person so hearing him say he thinks I’m twisting/manipulating things hurts because that’s not the person I wanna be. 

An example of what I mean is right now we’re arguing because I told him a story of how he got drunk and asked me for a popsicle. I got him the popsicle and he proceeded to let it dangle in the wrapper from his fingers while our cat batted at it and bit it before eventually getting it from his grasp. 

It then played with it shortly before taking it into the litter box and back out, at which point I was grossed out and figured that was enough playing before they poked a hole and made a mess. So I picked it up, we passed out and that was that. 

So after telling him about it he says, “For all I know you could be making that up.” And it’s like wtf when have I ever lied to you... and then he proceeds to say I’m twisting it, and he wasn’t calling me a liar and it’s now a huge argument and I’m the manipulative one. 

I’m not trying to twist it, it just sounds like he can’t trust me. So when I asked when I’ve ever made anything up, he proceeds to bring up a time over 3+ years ago when I was shit faced drunk and barely made it into my house (I just lost my grandmother who I was VERYYYY close to and thought getting wasted was the solution) and basically I was belligerent and said some real fucked up shit I shouldn’t have. 

He threw this in my face as if it were proof of my character, and it made me feel so worthless. I KNOW I shouldn’t have said those things, I knew the next morning. The only one I had said them to was him and I never acted on them. I was grief stricken, wasted and stupid. I regretted it the next day. But he cuts me no slack. Maybe I don’t deserve it. But I knew I was wrong and wouldn’t do it again. All I can do is learn, but it seems like he loves throwing it in my face. 

I just don’t know what to do. We’ve been together almost 5 years but I’ve been having doubts lately, as much as I love him. I feel like his negativity is rubbing off on me, as in how I think about people and situations, and I’ve been supporting him for over 2 years now while he doesn’t work. 

What do I do? I would like to make it work but I’m not so sure we can work this out. If he doesn’t respect me and can’t forgive me and love me... then idk. I have mental health issues (depression and anxiety) and zero self esteem as it is. He doesn’t help, he just reminds me of all my fuck ups and makes me feel like I’ll never make up for them and they’re all I’ll ever be... not always, but when we fight like this and it feels like how he really feels comes out... 

Please help!",09Aug2019,7
429,"   I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",09Aug2019,0

432,"I (F18) have been with my boyfriend (M18) for about two years now. He was my first serious relationship and we lost our virginity to each other when we were both 16 – needless to say we're very close and have generally been pretty happy. 

We're both headed off to different colleges in the fall, about a two hour drive away from each other. I don't have a car (I don't even know how to drive), but my boyfriend can borrow his mom's car. So naturally I told him that if he wants to see me he'll have to drive down quite a bit. He seems okay with that, and we've decided that he'll come down for the weekend every two weeks, and we'll spend time together over vacations. 

Every summer his family stays in another country for about six weeks. At this point in time he's been away for five weeks and honestly I've been doing really great without him here. I've been about to focus more on hobbies and friends, and worry less about what he's doing out how he's feeling. That being said he's gotten extremely clingy and insecure over the past few weeks. He's exhibited this behavior a couple times before as well (he freaks out if I hang out with another guys I'm friends with). 

He'll call me just to tell me that I don't call him enough (I call him nearly every day), or that I seen really ""off"" or ""weird"" when I do call. We got into a big fight about the potential of me studying abroad yesterday, even though I've made no plans to do so yet and don't even know if it'll happen. He really seems like he's constantly  panicking about us staying together in college – he'll ask me if I think we'll be together forever / be able to keep up a LDR. I always say yes, but a big part of me doesn't think it'll work. 

I kinda want to experience college as a single person, at least for a little while. I kinda want to explore others options. I kinda don't want to deal with my bf panicking about me hanging out with other guys as friends. I don't know what to do!",09Aug2019,2
433,"Hi reddit, its my first time making a text like this, and i kinda ran out of ideas on who to ask for an advice. I'm 17 M and have been dealing with heavy depression for the last 2 years, i feel the need to explain how it went down and how that affect my daily life.

So, since around I was 12-13 years old, I started experiencing bullying, for 2 years since neither my parents nor the school had taken it seriously, that caused a lot of trauma I'll explain later on. My mother and father are divorced since my birth. My dad, who I stopped contacting after I was 10 decided for the second time he needed a DNA test to prove I'm his son, because he wanted to get the terrain my mother uses to work on her recycling company to build a apartment (2 stories high) and he still did not believe I was his son, this happened when my mental health was already bad (2 years ago).

I've always been a person who cares about others, would almost never go over violence, and after it started going down I started having problem with rage, and other emotions all boiling inside my head and also the endless sadness, it made me try suicide twice by Xanax overdose, and then my mother finally understood it was serious, she is 56y/o. at the time I was at a really good private school since I got a 2 year full scholarship by being luckily selected among good students on public schools, but my 2nd year was lost because of those problems, I didnt lose the scholarship.

I've always tried my best on school, I want(ed) to study computer engineering on a abroad university (I'm from Brazil). Now, redoing my 2nd year i've started to struggle going to school, according to my psychologist and psychiatrist I've developed a social phobia, and some thing based on my low self-esteem. So basically I can't go to school because I always feel a horrid feeling someone is looking down at me, that I'm bothering someone, etc. My psychologist is trying to find a solution to it beside my medications, but its already half of the year and I lost 2 months of school.

And finally the advice I would like from the people here. I started feeling down and I'm thinking about giving up on school if I lose this year again, it's not because I'm tired of school, but because I can't. I feel like trash every time i think about it, I also feel I'm disappointing my mother who worked so hard alone for me to be where I am, but now I feel stuck on a loop, I really am out of ideas and can't think of a way out. Thanks for reading too, and if anyone has a advice I'll be glad to hear.

434,"This might be a bit long.. But I have to get this out of my chest. I have been bullied for a long time. People always took me lightly. Hence, I believe that there is some fault in me. I tend to say 'yes' all the time and that affected me badly. But now, I have learnt to say 'no' atleast 30% of the time.  In my college days, I was the butt of many jokes.

438,"I need a little advice on how to explain to my mother that she's the one causing my anxiety if anyone could help? Sorry this post is really long, I just need to get it off my chest, you can skip it if you want. I just need help on how to explain it to her. 



I've had severe anxiety for quite some time now, and it's only gotten progressively worse as time continues. It got to the point last year where I'd been self harming and crying myself to sleep most nights and I had no idea what was causing it all, and it's starting to near that point again.

The only time I was more slightly more calm was after I got sent to counselling. I went for 3 months with little to no progress aside from me feeling a little better about being able to talk to someone like a normal human being about my day and what I'd been doing. In the last few weeks me and my counsellor managed to get to the route of the problem after all, and most of the final session was spent talking about how it was my mother causing it. I didn't exactly know how to react at first, but I managed to at least understand the issues.

It was a lot of factors really, and it was all caused by her and a lot of pressure and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy she was causing that I couldn't (and still can't) handle.

It's been months since then, and it's been bubbling back up to that point again. I recently threw away all of the things I used to self harm, just so I couldn't be as tempted, but it's getting worse and worse. My mum has work a lot, which I understand because she works two jobs to support us, which I'm extremely grateful and thankful for, but it causes a lot of issues when I'm home alone. When I'm alone for too long while she's working, I start to get this awful chest pain and everything seems so slow and I feel like breaking down because I feel so alone and it's so quiet- I just can't stand it.

On weekends and during school break (like it is now), I wake up quite late because I don't have the motivation to get up as early and don't feel like I can really do anything other than go back go sleep, though this is likely just be a teenager thing with feeling super tired. However, this leads to me waking up alone and somewhat afraid as my mum is already at work by this time. It kills me every time and my chest starts to ache again and I don't know how to stop it from getting worse.

My mum puts me down quite a lot, but also puts herself really highly. She often brags about her achievements to people, and talks about how she did so great in school and that she's so intelligent and then blames everyone else whenever she doesn't get her way or does something wrong. For example, she used to be really overweight when married with my dad, which I know was her fault because she used to eat so much and never exercise, and to this day she still blames my father for it despite it entirely being her fault.

Recently something that's happened quite a lot is that she's been insulting my weight and going on about how I should be skinnier and that my face, arms, thighs and chest have gotten loads bigger. She says it's too be kind and that I'll thank her later, but it just makes me feel so awful. I was extremely negative on my body image already, and I'd spoke about this with my counsellor who explained that I'm a perfectly healthy and ideal weight for my age. I've been put on diets and exercise plans by my mum, and every time she mentions it it just feels like a kick to the stomach and like she's telling me that I'm still fat and people will absolutely despise me for it.

Whenever I get home from school, I have a set list of chores to do and I'm perfectly fine with that. It's just when she adds extras on days I'm supposed to not do anything or days I've already done things, then yells at me if I haven't done them or haven't done them properly (despite her not having taught me how to do them properly) and then never does anything herself. She's explained to me that her mother used to make her do all of the house work, but also that she doesn't want to be and isn't like her mother, but the more I listen to it, the more it sounds like they're the same. 

She has en extremely short fuse, which is one of the things I'm most scared of. It's gotten to the point that every time I hear someone yelling, even if it's not at me, I feel like crying my eyes out because I feel scared of guilty over nothing. If I make a mistake or accidentally knock something over, I get yelled at for it. It scares the life out of me whenever I do anything wrong, so I usually try to hide any mistakes because I'm too scared to confess, which then just gets me yelled at more. 

My school grades are something she goes a little far on too. It's understandable, everybody wants their kid to do well in school, I would too if I had one. But since I'm supposed to be in one of the top classes at school and was always one of those 'gifted kids' at primary (I am incredibly stupid, I have no idea what they were on putting me in a higher class), she expects me to do better than anyone else. It's really bad though, cause I don't do as well as she thinks I can and I struggle understanding a lot of things like maths, Re, geography and science and stuff. Every time I say I'm trying my best, she snaps at me to 'try harder' if something isn't good enough. I broke down crying at school at my last report and had to rush to the bathrooms to hide because I was so afraid of being yelled at for it.

Every time I go home from school, part of me just doesn't want to go. I have a field with some trees behind where I live, so I tend to just sit there in the trees most days to avoid going home because I feel sick and afraid just walking in there. Even Sitting here now feels terrible and I feel like something awful is about to happen at any moment, just because it's where she usually is. 

She makes fun of me and insults me for a lot of things like what I wear and stuff. I got my hair cut when I was with my dad a couple of weeks ago and it's a few inches shorter than it was before, but not by much, and when I got back to see my mum she started yelling at me about how she didn't like it and that I'm not allowed to have it shorter again ect. Whenever she brings up that I'm a lesbian and that I have a girlfriend, I feel like she's mocking me with her tone and she keeps saying that 'I'll get over it eventually' which absolutely kills me because it makes me feel like who I love is wrong and that I'm something that needs to be fixed.

A few months back she promised me that if I walk to and from school every day, she'd give me the money I'd usually use for bus fares at the end of the school year. I should have it by now because she told both me and my dad that whatever money would usually be spent on buses (half of which my dad pays for every month) would be put into a pot and saved. Surprise surprise, she didn't. She's been taking the money from my dad every month and been using it to go out for drinks instead when she keeps complaining about not having enough money. It just makes me sick thinking about it. I feel like I'm not enough and I'm not worth it.

Once when she was going on about my weight she said that she wished I lived with my dad instead. Honestly I can't say I haven't thought about it, and some friends that know about everything she's done and how I feel told me that I probably should go and live with my dad, because that's the only place I feel safe, secure and loved.

Please, does anyone know how to help me explain to her that she's causing all of this?",09Aug2019,1

440,"So I went on vacation last week and left my pet hamster with my sister to pet sit. While I was gone my mephew strangled my hamster to death (the second one he's strangled the first was his). So instead of calling me she calls my sister and mom who advise her to just replace the hamster and not tell me. Then they all go about covering it up. So when I come back from vacation to pick up my hammy I tried to tell them something was different and he was acting weird. They convinced me he just needed to be back on his environment. So I take him home and he just wasn't right I call my sister out on it and she finally admits what happened. Everyone else is still denying they knew which is annoying. So I sent the hamster back he's a baby and I never wanted to get another one.

I was more upset that they lied and replaced him as if he was so easily replaceable. I don't have a husband or kids and he's the only thing I was really close to. I even trained him. The worst part wasn't that he was killed but that EVERYONE lied to me about it. At the moment I'm not talking to any of them. All trust I had for them is gone. My sister claims it was to spare my feelings, but I say it's because they are cowards. They stole the opportunity for me to grieve. Or even bury it. She just THREW IT IN A DUMPSTER!

Now he tells me he hasn't had his weekly pay yet for his groceries as his money is under administration, so he doesn't have access to it.

I've been told I am not approachable, that I emit so much negative energy, and that I look like I have a wall around myself preventing anybody from talking to me or even looking at me because they think I could snap or do something to them. My family and boyfriend (who don't talk) came to the same conclusion, and are kinda avoiding saying anything to me. 

I feel like ""shutting myself out"" from everything. I am empty, I stopped thinking. I just want to be alone and silent, I don't want to talk, I can't. I can hear what people say, but I just can't answer anything. It is like I am catatonic, totally unresponsive sometimes. I just blankly stare when people are saying something. I am normally very opinionated, and not afraid to say what I think, but recently, last month or so, this is happening, and it is getting worse each day.

I’m currently with a large corporate company that will let me transfer with my current pay to another school. Issue is it’s an hour commute or more depending on the school I transfer to and if it’s anything like my current school, it’s very hard to get time off. 

There’s no way I’ll be able to make my current salary elsewhere. I got offered a job to sub in the public school which would mean I would have more days to come home for holidays(thanksgiving, Christmas etc.) but a much lower pay $3-$5 less per hour.

&amp;#x200B;

I have 4 years experience in the food industry and 4 years experience at another job which gave me a ton of experience for management and how a business operates. I made 50k+/year at my recent position which makes me proud but I'm no longer there and feel as if I am starting fresh now. So I have a decent amount of work experience but zero education. 

I'm not sure what to do in life. I never really knew. I picked up stock option trading a year ago and absolutely love being in the stock market, I wish I could do this forever but it is borderline gambling.

I don't know what to do. Currently I just want to hold down a job, any job that isn't labor intensive and pays at least $10-15/hr to pay bills and trade my heart away for cash to supplement my income. It probably won't work but it is what my heart wants, that plan is dumb, risky and will not give me any true benefits. It works out pretty well but might not stand the test of time.

I do have a clean criminal record though. Also, I dislike drinking and would like to smoke marijuana during my life but it isn't that huge of a deal.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

455,"My whole life I’ve been in denial my parents were abusive until now. My mom would control me and my dad would just follow her along. My younger brother is autistic and he hates me. I’ve never gotten along with him. My parents gaslight me a lot and lie to my face. They also tell me to never talk about family issues with anyone. Not even a therapist. 

Some examples are one time we were on vacation in Florida and we went to Universal Studios when I was 15 and my mom slapped me in public for being impatient and called me stupid. An employee walked up and asked me what was wrong and my mom jumped in and lied and the employee called me spoiled. My mom then proceeds to say I shouldn’t cry because she spent thousands of dollars on this trip. At Disney world, she saw a lady that looked like a witch from Snow White and started following her around saying she’s evil. This makes me think my mom is mentally ill. 

Some of the more recent abuse was probably the last straw for me. I’ve been trying to eat less meat and my mom and dad say I can’t because I’ll die. In June I asked my dad for some chicken because I have given up on trying to be vegan. He bought me some and we talked about how we hated the police. Later that day I felt mentally horrible I started yelling at my parents for feeding me meat. I have never seen my dad kiss my mom and he literally started kissing her on the cheek saying he loves her and he’s on her side, not mine. I screamed at them too. I know I was in the wrong for screaming, but immediately afterwards they called the police saying I was trying to hit them. I just left and my boyfriend’s friend picked me up. I felt upset and I only had the clothes on my back and a laptop. The police didn’t let me get my documents and made me hang up the phone. I didn’t talk to my parents for months. 

The only reason why I started talking to them now is because they are paying for half the rent in my apartment I share with my boyfriend and college tuition. My boyfriend and I don’t have credit scores and they refused to sign on as guarantors because it would lower their credit score. My parents are back at controlling me again and haven’t apologized properly. They’re pretending nothing happened. 

I’m mad. I don’t even know how to handle this. My boyfriend gets stressed out talking to them and my parents haven’t even been talking to me directly. I find it stupid for them saying I can’t block them or ignore them, but they are ignoring me now. They only communicate with my boyfriend since we moved in together. 

They only treat me like this and no one else. It pisses me off and every time I talk to them I yell at them or I say something stupid. 

How should I deal with this?",09Aug2019,1
456,"First, a summary of me. I'm a gay scrawny 22 year old vegetarian living in his parent's basement. I have no career skills, social skills, and I probably have mild autism/mild intellectual disability. I have no hobbies, I have no life.

In highschool I always had my hand up. I knew everything. Un/fortunately, life has been serving me humble pie and I've recently come to the realization of my intellectual disability. No one told me and I'm starting to suspect that no one ever will. I was into Shakespeare monologuing and poetry recitation even though I was terrible at it. I'm not any good at performing; I performed two bad covers of the same artist infront of the entire school. I covered Kanye West's gold digger in front of the entire school. I performed god awful poetry infront of the entire school. I'm a fool without any self awareness. I'm also a dumb nerd. A contradiction that I think is very accurate.

I was in debate club and I cried tears when everyone else won awards and I didn't. I cried when my coach didn't put me in the championship game even though I suck at basketball. I'm soft. Like a little girl.

I'm gay. I'm an obvious fag and I couldn't pass for straight. Not with my mannerisms.

I'm a manchild. I don't even know what a beta cuck soyboy is but I feel like one.

I'm not asking for a pity party. I'm not asking for kind words. I'm asking for you guys, for someone, to be real with me for once in my life.

How do I kill the old me?

Do I give up being a vegetarian and go back to eating the meat that'll get me buff?

I'm gay but I love looking at boobs. Is it possible that there's a latent heterosexuality that I could awaken and how?

How do I grow the fuck up and be a real man for once? I'm tired of being a soft and sensitive loser with no ambition going nowhere in life. I'm done with that person. At the same time, there isn't some millionaire alpha waiting to be chiseled out of the marble. I have my God given limitations. Intellectual disability and all that jazz. Still, I'm willing to act radically different until it sticks. I'm ready to fake it till I make it. Don't tell me to be myself. Myself is going to get nothing that life has to offer and I'm running out of time.

I walk into my uni exam hall and put my bag down, and then infront of the invidulator I switch my phone off. Before putting it into the bag I was pushed to go forward and without realising had slipped it into my jacket pocket, a thick denim jacket. 

I did my exam innocently and it was going So well i told myself ill take a pee break before my last question. I arrive to the last question,  it's an essay question and all the other exam questions have been answered. So as I prepared myself to ask to go... I realise my phone was left in my pocket as i moved about... now ...

I was bursting... to go.

So regardless i had to go to the loo. I couldn't take my phone out in the middle of the exam to put it away or anything there was truly no win.
Filled with anxiety i didnt know what to do and i had to go toilet. So i took my chances and kept my lips shut...

When arriving infront of the toilet they did a body check on me and FOUND MY PHONE OFF. 

When i got back they marked on my last question ""phone found off"".

To me this is evidence I could not have cheated... and in a uni exam how can you even cheat for an essay question. Not only that my charge was 3% when switched on. And it died minutes after. I was able to take a screenshot of my charge at 0%!

I got an email today about the level of my misconduct. And even though this was an accident, they class it as a serious offence.

They know it was off, they know i didnt get ""caught"" cheating, they know it's before the last question. If it had be plus 1 more serious... I would have been excluded from uni for a mistake i could not fix by the strings of fate cus of a bursting bladder!

I have a meeting in 2 weeks. And was wondering if anyone knew what i could even say? If they tale me there just to inform me and not discuss anything, I'd be so annoyed, cus i have to travel an hour or more to get there.

This interactions are usually minor and meaningless, yet they make all the difference I think. 

Yesterday I met three strangers and we sat down and talked for an hour or two. We told some stories, talked and generally just connected for a while. I felt a high during the rest of the day. I was more social, confident and more assertive and honestly it felt awesome. 

Maybe it's the connection with others, maybe it's that I felt validated, or maybe it's something else. 

Whatever it is I just want to feel like this regardless of other people. Making sure I have this kind of interactions daily seems very tedious. 

Maybe it is normal to be this dynamic?

The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",09Aug2019,0
468,"I (15F) strongly believe that my bestfriend (16M) wants to profit from our friendship. We have been friends for 5 years and we had good time until this year.

He started to go out with some 'bad guys' and drink and smoke weed. His mother likes me and she lets him go out just when I am around. Now my friend is always saying to his mom that he goes out with me (even when he is not) and we don't talk like we used to. I think he is using me just to go out with his other friends.

He is always saying to me that he wants to change but he is repeating the same mistakes over and over again. We had a lot of disscussions about his behaviour but he doesn't want to listen to anybody. 

I tried to stop talking to him but he keeps texting me like nothing happened. Now i really want to help him but I don't know how. Any suggestions?

475,"So the beginning of the relationship, I wasn’t that into her. She wanted to be in a relationship badly and was head over heels for me. Eventually the more we started hanging the more I feel for her and now I thought she was the love of my life and we’d spend our lives together. She was the perfect person, so caring, loving, and just had a great heart. 

I was a real asshole in the middle of the relationship, calling her names like saying she’s fucking dumb if she made a mistake on something. I stopped calling her names and that stuff after we talked but the asshole-ness was still there over dumb shit. 

Besides that and arguing here and there,  I thought our relationship was magical. We’d spend every day together for 2 years. We were inseparable and I had the best times of my life with her. From special talks, to crying in each other’s arms out of happiness at a wedding when our song came on, to talking about our future with excitement, picking out dog’s names and stuff. It all just seems not real that it’s over. 

She said she’s been holding onto something that hasn’t been there for months and isn’t in love with me anymore but still loves me. She says she feels this way mostly because I was an asshole and our future goals don’t match. She doesn’t care about money, I care a lot, and probably way too much. But honestly at this point I’d be fine being homeless with her. 

The fucked up part about this is the timing. She lived with my parents rent free (and food paid for, laundry done, etc) for two years. We lived an hour from her job and family. My brother lives in that area and just had a son so i pushed my parents to move down there and they did. I wanted it for her. I was going to sacrifice and drive the hour commute so she didn’t and so she could be around her family. Well we moved down there and now she’s gone so I have to drive the hour each way and be next to her for no reason. At least its a fresh apartment without the memories of the old house we shared together I guess. 

Well she decides to break up with me 4 days before the move. She did it over text and didn’t say thank you to my parents for all they did for her. This makes me angry but I would honestly still give anything to be with her. It feels like I’ll never find anything even close to the relationship we had and sometimes that makes me just wanna die. Well now she’s living literally .4 miles from my apt. I can basically see her house from my driveway. 


I don’t know if I’m being dramatic or not but I hate my life right now. I just don’t know if I’ll ever find someone like her again and it kills me that I ruined the love. She was everything to me and I could rely on her for anything, it just feels like I can’t do anything for myself without her. It’s been 2 weeks now. I never meant to be an asshole to her I just couldn’t handle my emotions. I feel really genuinely bad for what I put her through and just hope for another chance someday",09Aug2019,1
476,"At 9 my parents divorced and both became single parents, At 13 I needed a part time job to pay for any sports and activities I wanted to do, at 15 my mom remarried. At 16 I started financially supporting myself because my mom continued to tell me she was saving for university. At 19 my mom was promoted and started making 20,000$ extra dollars a year. Both my parents make well over $90,000 dollars a year and have help from their jobs for my sister and i’s schooling. They each pay no more than 15,000$ a year for both children to go to school. They have almost no mortgages and are both remarried.


She stopped buying food for me in the house at 16, made me keep a part time job during high school, college and now university while I should be focusing on my studies. Right now I’m working 40 hours a week saving, and during the school year I work 32 hours a week, travel an hour each direction and go to university full time. 

I get help with rent from both parents and they cover the tuition but it’s not a lot considering how much they make and how much they  get from work to cover tuition. I’m expected to cover all my living expenses while away at school, while maintaining a part time job, paying for a car, insurance, gas, food and have been since I was 16. My expenses this year are going to total 16,000$. I had to miss classes and fail to go to work last year to pay and I can’t do that again. I won’t have another loan to pay for it and I just need more help but am not getting any.

477,"Sorry for any formating problems and blah blah I'm on mobile.

I just started my first job (16M) in a food department in a supermarket and I work the closing shift with another dude (35~45M). He's supposed to show me all of the closing procedures and cleaning aswell, but it's been one week already and all he told me to do was to do the dishes.

At first I didn't think much of it, but I brought it up to some workers on the morning shift and they all told me that he never does the dishes and is irritating (that's why they work in the morning).

A few days ago, I started work at 13h00 and finished at 22h00, he starts at 16h30. So for the first 3h I didn't take my 15min break, because I was concentrated and forgot, so when he arrived, I told him I'm gonna take my break. He said no, because he didn't want to serve the station all alone (even tho another worker was on duty until 17h00). This went on and I was straight up tired after working 5h without break. And this dude had the guts to tell me that I was too slow doing the work!

He left me do both of my breaks later on after I was constantly asked for them. I didn't take my lunch break because he told me that if I don't take it, I would be able to go home at 21h.

That day, I sparked an argument (after the manager told me to talk to him about it)  about how I'm only doing the dishes and cleaning the machines and he is only doing all the easy stuff like making the food boxes, cooking the chicken and etc.. and he told me to not tell him how to do his job!

He doesn't do the dishes but when I'm doing it, and I miss a spot, he tells me to clean better.  There's other things he does like when I'm doing something, he asks me to tend to the customer. Both me and the customer have a WTF face because we clearly see that he isn't doing something task worthy like me.

I'm so mad at him and I don't know how to talk to him anymore. This is my first job so I'm scared as to what other asses are up in future jobs. Changing my shift is currently impossible because they hired me for night shift only, the manager already spoke to him and he is constantly blabbering as to how slow I'm doing something. I still don't know the basics to closing the department since he didn't show me anything else.

PS: This is more of a vant, but I still want advice.",09Aug2019,2
478,"Hi I am an HR analyst and coordinator for a small start up in Silicon Valley.

Recently, we had a position open for a systems engineer and a mid 40’s man came in for an interview and was offered the job pending background and social media check. I am actually the one who performs both.

The hiring manager seemed like she liked the guy a lot and he had great skills and experience but she changed her mind when the results of the checks came back.

The thing I cannot understand is that the results showed nothing controversial whatsoever. No drug use or lowlife behavior or criminal past.

The guy turns out is a deacon at his Catholic Church, teaches Latin lessons on the weekends and even volunteers to bring communion to the elderly. He has four beautiful children with blonde hair and green eyes and a lovely wife from Brazil.

I cannot imagine why the hiring manager is rescinding her offer to this man except for the fact that either he is white or maybe cause he is Christian? Idk. I can say that at company outings this hiring manager has said negative things about whites and Christians so I believe that this is even more a case of discrimination.

What are my options as an HR analyst here? Should I MYOB lest I get fired? Or should I go to bat for the guy and see what happens?

Also we have a part time general counsel maybe I could talk to him?

He has confronted me about using my phone too much (which I agreed and have made efforts to use it less) and even told me that other people on our team had complained about my phone usage which I later found out was a lie he made up to scare me. He has even accused me of not doing enough work and being a forgetful person which doesn’t make any sense because I don’t work for him. He said some very negative comments about me to the other interns, after which they brought it to my attention. There was an instance where I was slouched at my desk and he slapped the back of my chair and said, “Sit up” which I thought was an extremely inappropriate way to tell someone to stop slouching in an office environment, especially since he is much older than me. 

The thing is, I only have a month left with the company and I’m not very confrontational but his behavior has made me very uncomfortable and irritated to the point where I would confront him about it.

I've had a pretty terrible past school year. Like a lot of people, depression has been a big issue for me for many years, but it really hit me hard this past year and I have just been quite lost with what to do and how to do it in regards to school-work. I have extremely important exams at the end of this coming school year (May-June 2020) but here's the catch- I have no notes from this previous year at all. Well to be precise, I have a very small amount, and they are completely useless. I feel like it's pointless to go into how I got myself into this awful position because there were a lot of contributing factors, but I'm here and I need your advice.

I basically only have up until the 2nd week of September to catch up completely.

I have been researching a little each day how best to write notes, and I will make sure I've finished that research by Sunday. (the reason for this is that I've managed to get through school until this point without really taking notes, so I never learned)

My issues: the main issue is that I feel so overwhelmed with the workload I don't know where or how to start, which is completely suffocating. I have little motivation and even less discipline. I feel like I'm going to fail anyways. I feel like everything's pointless because we're all going to die soon. It doesn't help that I have a pretty horrendous family dynamic and general life outside of school.

The good thing is that I have a huge amount of resources so I have all the information that needs to have notes taken on.

Any guidance would be hugely appreciated at this difficult time.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

513,"My (25f) older brother (27) has been dealing with alcoholism the last 5 years or so. He refuses to call it that, but in reality he is an alcoholic.

I’ve tried to talk to him several times -I try to talk to him when he’s sober but I can’t tell anymore. I don’t think he’s really sober anymore.

Any time I bring up how his drinking is not only tearing our family apart, but also slowly killing him; I’m all of a sudden a bitch who doesn’t know shit, or whatever profanities he decides to call me.

The saddest part, is with all his support around him, he shit on every one. Friends, my parents, his ex girlfriend when they were together. 

For some understanding, we’ve lost a lot of people since this has been going on. He found a friend who died of an opioid OD, along with the dealer, another friend OD a month later. A few people killed in Hit and Runs (CAUSED BY DRUNK DRIVERS) and family through disease. On top of all of this he also came out to me with a deeply traumatic experience he went through and doesn’t know how to deal with- he was fully raped by a coworker when he was living away from home, potentially a father, he doesn’t know. I don’t even know if he remembers telling me this, so I don’t feel comfortable talking to him, he had a hard time even telling me about it, but he was drunk AF. 

He’s also randomly told our entire family multiple times, during events like our Christmas dinner or even just celebrating someone else, how much better it would be if I weren’t there. Mind you, I purposely ignore my brother at these events because I know how he is. But how can my brother have so much hate towards me that he’ll get riled up even if I’m not near him, not talking to him, or straight up just being NICE to him.

He’s attacked my ex for him trying to stop my brother from drunk driving. He’s beaten up his friends for the same, and even has attacked a known and violent gang member because he was drunk and stubborn or misheard something and took it as a threat. Before his recent drunken adventure one of his good friends stole his motorcycle keys and called the cops on him because he was being threatening and tried riding his dirt bike home.. cops only drove him home.

I’m beginning to worry the only way he MIGHT learn is if he get arrested for drinking and driving (DUIs are not a financially easy thing or mentally easy thing to deal with), or he’ll kill or badly injure himself or someone else. He’s damaging himself, while we’ve been witnessing a close family member go through liver failure cause by excessive drinking. He’s damaging every relationship he has. My father can’t look at him without disgust. No one can. No one can get through to him.

Do I recommend rehab? Do we intervene? Do I let him make his mistakes and let him suffer? I feel guilty because I’m at the point where I’d rather drop him from my life. He’s always been a duck to me for no reason, we were never friends as kids, teens, or in college. Why would I want to help someone who’s only behavior towards me has only been hostile and aggressive?

I don’t know what to do.",09Aug2019,1
514,"So I have a boyfriend on the opposite side of the country from me. We’ve already met for a week back in April and it was a wonderful time. I bought a plane ticket to see him this News Years but I miss him a lot. I know long distance is hard and we both knew that going into this.

I had the chance to go out and see him the 14th-19th of this month before we both go back to school but he had plans with some of his friends flying to visit. Which is totally fine, I told him I don’t want him to ruin his plans to accommodate me.

There were times during these conversations that he made it seem like it could work and that I could come but then a little bit later finds another problem with why I can’t. I’ve just been so upset but I don’t want to tell him that because I don’t want to seem like a person that wants him to change his already made plans and be needy.

I haven’t been able to leave bed and just have hit a really sad point. Am I wrong for being so upset? I don’t know what to do and he knows I’m upset just not the big picture.

515,"I'll keep this short and sweet. I'm kind of looking for advice from older redditors who might have a bit more perspective on this issue. 

I'm 30, I moved back home recently to pursue an education. I moved out at 19.

I can either apply for school in fall 2020, or pay $1500ish to go to university and get the prerequisite courses I need to start in winter 2019. 

My parents think I'm starting in the winter, they thought I was originally going to start in fall, but then I told them I needed to wait. It's a mess because I don't have the credentials and I was given some bad advice from an admissions counsellor. 

I'm not sure if I should just work this year and save money for fall 2020, or pay to take the extra classes and start in winter 2020. 

Any advice? I feel like I can't trust myself right now. I'm 90% leaning toward paying for the extra classes, but I don't have very much money saved up and that worries me.. The courses are online and I can still work full-time while I take them, saving money.

i told my parents about this and they ended up saying i could stay here since itd be easier for me and im honestly really torn

on one hand, i can stay here in my childhood house with all my stuff and bypass the stress of moving and still have a place where im super comfortable, however, theres a lot stricter rules here and its messy and i feel trapped &amp; anxious

on the other, i could be moving in with people who have already accepted me as family and know how to help and support me, but the drive is 25 minutes opposed to the 3 minutes it takes me to get to work, plus id have to move and adjust into a new family

520,"okay so, about 2 weeks ago at school, this boy came up to me and asked for my number. we spoke for awhile and he walked me to class. everyday after that we call for at least an hour and we flirt A LoT. After a few days of talking (in person and on the phone ofc) he told me he’s in love with his best friend. now obviously this stung, because i thought he was interested in me, he told me he was which is why i was startled. He told me he wants to keep his friendship with her but shift romantic focus to me. 

From the way i understand it, it sounds as though his best friend is using him as a safety net. According to
him, she knows how he feels but isn’t doing anything about it. She knows that he’ll come back to her no matter who he talks to. 

Him and i call everyday, for at least an hour. On the calls we just sit and talk about the most random things and do our homework or other things we need to get done. I do feel comfortable around him, which is new to me. 
The other day he said to me “people think i’m going for you” and honestly i thought he was too? so i don’t know entirely what’s happening and i don’t want to actually start liking this boy properly if he’s just using me to get over his friend.

524,"Hi, I am a new grade 11 student transferee at a big famous school. I used to study in a small school near my house with no standards at all for 9 years. So my first day was yesterday. It wasn't fun and I felt suicidal and in pain. My thoughts there was like I have to transfer back to my old school or transfer to the school with my close friends. I can't handle the stress anymore. I got culture shock there literally. Everyone in my classroom was all smart and confident also rich af. I felt like I am the only one who is shy and I say lack of knowledge. At first, when I was at the student orientation, in my head was like ""Mom thanks for transferring me to a good school, this is such a blessing to be with the rich students. I waited for so long for this new change"". But now I regret working hard to pass the admission requirements and entrance exam. I regret transferring schools. Waking up at 3:40 am picked up by school bus at 4:15 am, and to be back at home at 6:20 pm. There is no hope for me to enjoy life anymore. I felt like what was I doing with my life.

526,"Needless to say I'm nervous and afraid that I'm waking into a trap and that it is going to be a shit storm.

A little background:
A couple months ago, a ""friend"" of mine and my sister revealed herself as a complete narcissist, toxic, control freak type person that I don't want in my life. Since I got engaged (mind you, she has never met my fiance) she has told me he is no good for me and tried to make me doubt him. For no reason. She doesn't know him nor our relationship. (I met this girl through a friend on facebook of all places btw which is why I used ""friend""). 

So anyhow we had a falling out through a group message between her, my sister, and me. After this girl bashing my fiance and saying horrible, upsetting offensive things about my fiance, I told this girl how I felt and that I didn't need this. She blew a fucking gasket because I stood up for myself to her, and I quickly removed myself from the situation and blocked her every way I know to. 

My sister never stood up for me or anything. She eventually unfriended me on Facebook and after that, I made the stupid decision to air our dirty laundry (asshole move on my part, I acted on emotions and I was boiling by this point).

Because of my actions, I am labeled the asshole in this situation and it is the reason (I assume at least) that my sister hasn't spoken to me in months. 

Well now, she is ready to talk. I have told her the chances I've got that I love her and I miss her. She  ever says it back. This is a huge part of what makes me nervous about talking things out. I'm afraid she will take this opportunity to either shit on me or just simply tell me she doesn't want a relationship with me. I don't want to lose her. I just want to go to a time before any of this happened, before we met this psycho chick, and live there. 

I just don't want to lose my only sister. I'm scared that is going to be the conclusion.",09Aug2019,1

529,"Ok, so things aren't going well at my house currently, and I'll just list a bunch of stuff that I need to get some perspective on, life is kind of a mess rn so please don't mind if this post is absolutely scattered

1. My parents may or may not split up soon, they probably won't, but should they decide to go ahead with it, I will suddenly find myself with 2 dependents I need to support (mom and lil bro)
2. I'm working at my dad's brothers firm currently, but should the split happen, I will have to leave that job. 
3. I guess I'm dealing with all of this just fine? I mean I have gotten a little desensitised to it all after just months upon months of fighting, which is why I fear coming across as a shallow/emotionless person. I'm not! I think I'm just all cried out.
4. The real point of this post is some financial questions I have-   
a) For example, I've had an idea for an app, which I began developing (can barely operate a computer, but have managed to finish it at least 40%). Now, I know how slim the chances are that my app even makes it in the top 1000 list- which is why I want to ask, does it make sense for me to continue building the app in my spare time instead of doing something else?  
b) The reason I'm asking is because my life could go two ways right now-  
(i) Parents split, am left with an unfinished app and without a job (I'll be stable for some months, before I'll need to get a job  
(ii) Parents don't split, keep my current job, finish the goddamn app sometime soon hopefully and publish it. In this case I can actually afford to not have my app ""take off"".

I know how this post started like it was about some family thing and ended up with such a mediocre question, but this is all the trouble in my life rn. I don't want to let my mom down in case they do split up(fingers crossed everything ends up being fine though!).

So we started talking and after a few weeks of catching up, I finally said fuck it and told her how I felt, and to my surprise, she said the crush was mutual. So I asked her if she was interested in a relationship, and she said “maybe”.

She said she had just went through a bad breakup and didn’t know if she was ready for something like that yet.

I told her it wasn’t a problem, if she needed time to think it over, it’s fine with me, and that I didn’t want to make this and uncomfortable situation for her, no matter what she chose, I’d be fine either way.

The thing is though, I can’t stop thinking about her. I honestly can’t get her out of my mind, and the suspense of not knowing how she feels is killing me. I don’t know if she just hasn’t made up her mind, or if she just isn’t interested and is trying to spare my feelings.

We haven’t spoken since she said she needed time to think. It’s driving me Fuccing mad. I want to give her some space so I don’t come off as clingy and desperate, but not knowing if killing me from the inside out.

536,"Hello dear reddit people, 

I don’t tend to post here at all but I’m after some opinion from complete strangers. I’ve been working for this company for almost 2.5 years and been hating my job for a solid year. I’ll give you a brief summary. When I’ve started the role, I was told that the company is a close knit family run business with roughly 10-12 staff where everyone’s equal, that they look after the staff and that the role is very creative (all of the things I highly value). The business was much closer to my home which also was a bonus as at the time I was commuting. However, in the last year or so, the company changed drastically. We’ve had roughly 10 different employees walk out without notice, one of them being a longest serving employee. The company is still the same size, however, the staff turnaround is very high. Last year we’ve had our hours reduced because the company was about to bankrupt, yet when we got back on our feet, our director spend half a mil on piece of machinery going against his accountants advice. The director itself is very sexist and doesn’t ever consider males for office run roles as he believes that these are only for women and vice versa. After all this time, I’ve asked for a role change as I’ve taken a lot more responsibility and this was not accepted with the reason that if I get it, everyone else will want it. I did not ask for a pay rise. Basically, there are a lot of things that personally and impersonally infuriate me about the company. 

Now to the positives.  After successful application process, I’ve been offered a senior role at another company. They seem to offer me a better salary and better working conditions. I am planning to hand in my notice and keep wondering whether to just lay it all out on the table and get all of the things I’m not happy with off my chest or whether to keep quiet and just say nothing? My worry is that if I don’t say anything I will always regret it and also they will never know so they won’t ever improve but at the same time I wouldn’t want this to haunt me in the future and also when I have brought some of the issues up in the past, the director was very defensive and cannot take criticism at all. 

Any advice would be appreciated !",09Aug2019,1
537,"Ten years ago I fell in love with an abusive con artist. I stupidly dropped everything and moved across the country to be with him (from Midwest to El Paso, TX). We had been together for several months prior, and there were very few warning signs. He was able to pretend to be sane and sober during our visits. 

Within nine days of moving there I got pregnant with my son. I majored in psychology, I was never around domestic violence growing up. I left a city I loved, friends I loved, a job I liked, and my family. I accepted a friend request from a stranger. He had a whole family bed hidden from me, along with other women. He kept me trapped, taking my car often leaving the gas tank on empty. He kept bullets in the kitchen to remind me that he could kill me and get away with it, claiming PTSD (his words) as he had seen combat in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan. It didn't matter that I was carrying his child, the choking, the pushing, the tackling didn't stop. He took my money if I didn't hide it. He was on hard drugs, so I assume that was where all of money went. I didn't know that until after my son was born. 

I escaped ten years ago, but I'm nothing close to the woman I was. Thankfully, he hasn't bothered to come visit me or our son ever. I got child support set up, after I tired of his games and control (even after I moved back home to the Midwest). I am in therapy, but it's really fucking hard to talk it. It fucks me up for days. How do I forgive myself for being so stupid, gullible, ignorant, reckless, and having that horrid man?

539,"Good day! First I'd like to introduce myself, as I feel like this plays a major part in my situation. I am 16 years old and only just graduated from high school. I'll be starting university soon, but that might be delayed due to our poor financial state. My mother is divorced (not by legal standards yet, but we're getting the paper work done soon). For the past 8 years, my mother has been trying to support our family alone. I come from a conservative Asian family, and I'm very introverted, so expressing an opinion within my family is either disregarded or, in their terms, flawed. My little twin sister however is open minded.
The root of the problem, I believe, is my older brother who has been unemployed for over an year now. Throughout his unemployment period, he's only played games on his ps4, hung out with friends and just sleep in. All of this have financially been a negative effect to us, as the electricity bills have increase drastically and constantly spending money on his friends and luxuries. 
He plays for over 5 hours long on his ps4 and by the end of the week his wallet is empty. He's addicted. He argues like a 3 year old when my mom doesn't allow him to play or hang out, and doesn't talk or respect anyone if he can't get what he wants. Whenever we ask him how his hunt is going along, all he says is that the only jobs available are for women or stuff that he doesn't have experience with.
My mother doesn't help either. As I previously said, I come from a conservative family, so there is an obvious hierarchy system even within our tiny family. The guy comes first and the girls second. This often also means that he is prioritised more. She gives him an allowance every week, does not put strict curfews or rules in the house. If she has a problem, she only complains to me and sometimes verbally abuses me out of anger. I don't necessarily get offended by them, judging by how I know she's very stressed, but it's very very tiring.
If I could, I would work. However, the country I live in has no law that allows a teenager of my age to work. I must be 18 or above.
I'm trying my best to be very understanding. At first I thought he was going through a depressive state, but right now, the only thing he does is trying to uphold his rank in Apex Legends.
The only reason I'm writing this is because I'm tired and unhappy. I missed out on so many things just so that my mother can avoid spending too much money on me. I didn't go to prom knowing that the whole thing would cost about $1000 ($2000, since I'm counting my twin as well) and never spent my allowance. I hoped that this could at least lessen our expenses and even worked my hardest for a scholarship. But, the admission fee costs $7000 for each child, and that's a hefty amount for us. I hate that, despite all my sacrifices, I can't even get into the college I want. I find it unfair that he gets anything he wants, but I can't go to the university of my choice. I envy him and I'm incredibly jealous. I might seem spoiled, and I'm sorry about that, but I can't help it. I need some advice. I don't know what to do anymore, and I'm already losing my sanity thinking about my exam results (which will be due the 22nd of this month). 
I'm open to anything. I was thinking whether I was judging my brother's unemployment a bit too quickly, and wanted to know whether it actually is pretty hard for an adult to get a job (sorry if that was too blunt). I live in the United Arab Emirates, which is a prospering country, so I always assumed that it would be easy to find a job, but I may be wrong, so please correct me if I am. 
I want to go to university, and although it is selfish, I feel like of I don't, I missed half my high school experience on nothing. Sorry this was long, and thank you!",09Aug2019,1

Problem is, I’m afraid of telling my dad. He’s a hardass and has no understanding of mental health and I don’t wanna look like a pussy to him.  Plus my mom knows but she doesn’t understand how serious it is and keeps putting it off/forgetting it.

We've got a pretty intense few years, between kids and work.  Wife came out as bi about a year ago.

She told me recently she has feelings (romantic and sexual) for another much older woman.  She has had them for three years, but not done anything about it.  They've gone frequently for lunch, and spent quite a bit of time together (work related).  

She says she hasn't given her full self to me over these past years.  Says she has been restless, wants a quiet heart.  She has fantasied about having a completely different life.  He says she has allowed a bit of resentment to form.  She knows she has drifted away from me a bit.

She's in counselling.  Had a couple of sessions.  Thinks there's stuff about low confidence in her identity outside of 'us'.  She thinks she's been happy to go along with the identity of 'us' in the early stages of marriage but now needs to build her own sense of herself.

We've spoken about separation.  She is able to talk about it but has got upset thinking about the reality of it.  I've been clear I don't want that, and she said she only considered because she thought she'd destroyed us/ beyond repair.  She wants to stay together too, says it's a healthy relationship and I'm her sanctuary.

548,"Here’s a bit of backstory: 

Me and this girl were talking and we met up in person. 

We talked and then started kissing and we both established we wanted to date each other. 

Skip forward a couple days and shit hits the fan with my family and it was a lot of stress. 

Combine this with the fact that she always wanted my attention (not a bad thing but I can’t when I’m having mental break downs) and you can see where this is going. 

For the people who are asking why didn’t you just explain it, it’s cause I didn’t want to bring my family drama onto her. 

I blocked her out of no where because I was stressed out and just wanted everything to end. 

Skip forward another couple of days and everything blows over. My family drama is over and we are back to normal.

This is when I started thinking about her so I unblocked her and sent her a message. 

She tells me how she’s been crying for the last couple of nights, how she’s cut herself because of me, etc, things that I wasn’t thinking about when I blocked her. 

I told her I’m sorry and that I actually want to be here for her and that I’m willing to make the effort to fix this. 

She said she also wants to fix this but is trying to get herself together now.

I’ve been alone for a very long time. During these years I’ve lost multiple jobs, had my wallet stolen, had my car crashed into. all the while trying to hold it together but just progressively feeling more and more depressed and angry. things such just seeing another people in public not looking after their children properly makes me think about killing them. - example. I was in subway and I saw two children climbing the drinks fridge to reach the drink... the mother did nothing. My thought process that the mother needed to die. Otherwise the children would grow up to be as useless as she was. There is a family just down the road from me whole leave litter everywhere the children swear, they all look disgusting, the mother is vile. i want to burn the house down. they don’t deserve to live. She has kids to gain more money. She is rotten. I hate people. and this is where I’m at now. im taking my life because I can’t stand these evil thoughts, i don’t want to act upon them and be remembered for another ‘sick human’ I want to be the person who didn’t act.

553,"It's the 6th day my mom is in the ER. Yesterday was the first day I went. 

I told her I'd go everyday, but now I'm not sure. I feel like I'm catching a cold and [I've heard](https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-dos-and-donts-of-a-hospital-visit-2614912) you're not supposed to go there when you have symptoms of something that can be. I also saw that on the ER's front door. I started catching cold symptoms I think when I was in the hospital or maybe a while after.

Yesterday she called me at around 7AM and said she wanted me to go, so I went there.

I think I have a weaker immune system than others and when I went there I can't help but feel I made things worse. My mom's room neighbor said on the phone to someone else that she was catching a cold. I feel like it was my fault. I didn't have cold symptoms yesterday.

On top of that I made a crucial mistake: I didn't wash my hands and I even handed her a get well card.

I was there for about 2-2.5 hours. Near the end my mom coughed once and I think she said that could be dangerous because it could rip stuff in her. She said it's because they made her eat some ice, since she hasn't eaten anything. I feel like it was my fault though.

She still has another operationto go through in a few days which will be done at another hospital, she told me.

I want to go because she told me to take her chap stick and because I told her I'd go everyday, but now I'm not sure.

I haven't been able to bring myself to call her and tell her I won't go or that I'll go the next day. It's seems cruel. When I went there yesterday, a couple of her friends were there. They told me I should've visited her earlier.

I told some people in a health chatroom and they said they'd go and wear a face mask. I wonder if they'd still let me go in if I walked in with a face mask.

On top of all of this today my eyes are a bit too red. This isn't really unusual for me. They're sort of always reddish, but yesterday they were more on the clear side. I think because of a sleep problem I have. I guess I could go to the store and buy some red drops so I don't worry people about that.

He had never shown any signs of this and is a very upstanding member of the community (good job, wife, daughter, etc.). Her brother recently told her that he didn't do it, and that the files must have gotten onto his computer when he was streaming or torrenting, because he had now idea how it happened. When he was first charged, he had also said to her that he didn't do it, and that he thought it must have happened when he clicked on something. He said that his lawyer had advised him not to even speak to his family about the details, so he had been quiet up until recently about them. But things recently developed and he had to register a plea, so he also spoke to his family. He is planning to plead guilty to avoid a potentially harsher sentence because his lawyer doesn't think he can get off. If he pleads guilty he will get a 2 year sentence but potentially be reduced for good behaviour. His career will be ruined either way.

I worked for a mobile video game company. They have offices in Europe, Asia and the United States.

Those 3 or 4 players are young adults in China. And when you see the instagram or Facebook of even the most popular game of the company you see that there are perhaps 200 likes, and that's a lot.

Lately things weren’t good with my girlfriend, and we used to argue a lot. One of the things we agued was that she thought my best friend was in love with me (she told me moths before I realized). I told her that she (my best friend) is not, and even if she were, I am not in love with her. 
Fast forward and when my girlfriend told me she wanted to break up, I didn’t even tried to avoid it or change her mind, because even if I still love her, I know I’m not in love with her anymore. I want her to be happy and if I can help her with anything, I will, but I don’t want to be in a relationship with her anymore. 
I recently told my best friend that I was in love with her, and indeed she felt the same way.

571,"I recently moved to a different country for university but because my landlord doesn't speak English our contract is written in his native language. His son, however, speaks English and was present during our contract meeting to explain everything in English (I also have this recorded and him on record saying I am allowed to record him).

During the meeting it was explained that I can't have visitors stay over but when I asked about visitors popping by to say hello or stay for dinner they said this was fine. 2 weeks later (today) the landlord's son pops by to fix a broken tap but after seeing my boyfriend he starts rambling about how he shouldn't be here. We explain that he has a hotel and hasn't stayed over but the son carries on saying that he can't be here. He then states that I can't have any visitors. I explain my confusion and he repeats you can't have any visitors and just walks off.

10 minutes after this I get a text saying visitors are not allowed and I need to tell him when my visitor has left. I repeat that I am very confused because he told me previously that this was fine and send the clip of him saying that (in its full context). I haven't had any response from him since...

I know this is a very small disagreement but my concern is that this behavior is going to continue and I'm going to be exploited in someway. Every exchange I have had with this man has been quite uncomfortable as he often responds rudely. For example, if I ask a question about something he has said previously he will just reply with 'did you read what I said?' and if I explain my perspective he simply repeats 'did you read this?'.

572,"Recently my boyfriend of almost 3 years who I’ve known since the first grade has told me he doesn’t think we’ll work out long term and out of the blue broke up with me, we still talk everyday and he is taking me to work as my parents are of of town this week on vacation and i do not have my own car. 

I am having a very hard time with this. At first he told me that the breakup was no way my fault and that he feels we just won’t work out long term and there no second chances, that we are done. And then i kept pressing because i felt like not even 2 months ago on my birthday he wrote on my birthday card he felt we were soulmates and couldn’t wait for many more years together.. so i was very confused. Then he started saying that he is depressed and is worn out from having to deal with me all the time(i am quite depressed and have very bad anxiety and my job is quite stressful) i am now on medication for my depression and anxiety and have been working very hard everyday now for the past month to better myself. Eating better, making my bed, doing things i enjoy, just little things that make a difference, he was well aware of be trying to better myself and was very supportive telling me he was proud. I am also going to speak with my doctor about seeing a counselor. 

I did not know he was depressed or felt this way at all or else i would’ve tried to help him as he was helping me. I often asked about how he was doing or how he felt. Recently his dad passed away in November and a few days ago was his birthday. I asked him if he felt sad about it and he said he was feeling okay. No signs of him being depressed or anything, i know he has struggled with depression in the past and did not hide it from me at all so it is very strange he tells me that he cannot focus on us or the future because of how hard it is for him to carry on day by day. 

So at first it was “we won’t work out long term, no second chances” and now he is saying he is depressed and can’t focus on a relationship but he will think about giving us another chance, i would never force him to be with me, and i don’t want to pressure him into jumping back into a relationship of course when it is not healthy for him.  But we still talk everyday because we were best friends even before we started dating and he set boundaries for our “relationship” and he said we could still say we love each other because of of course it didn’t just go away, but he has stopped saying it back, he won’t make eye contact with me in the car, he won’t make plans to even hang out with me as friends. And it just really hurts. I am very confused about what i should do in this situation. I would like to get back together with him when he feels comfortable and can take care of himself again. 

But am i being stupid? Are things over and i should really just let it go and move on? I don’t want to move on i love him so much. All the best pieces of me are made because of him. I am who i am because of him. I never knew was love was until him. 

I would like advice on how to handle the situation. If i should stay and be his friend and wait to see if there is another chance? If i should just remain his friend and give up hope on there being another chance? If i should cut off all ties and never speak to him again? I am very confused about what to do in this situation and how to handle it.

However, my appointment ended up being with someone who wasn't my normal doctor. I have a lot of anxiety issues, and this doctor was extremely intimidating to me. I panicked and ended up lying to my doctor a couple times out of fear, lying about things such as:

&amp;#x200B;

* Smoking. I said I had never smoked. I have smoked on a couple of occasions, maybe 10 times in total. I haven't smoked in probably 2 years, give or take (though I genuinely can't remember when I last smoked). And, when I smoked, I would only smoke one thing every couple of months. Nothing crazy. 
* Recreational drugs. I tried marijuana once with some friends years ago. It wasn't my thing and I haven't done it since. Funnily enough, when my doctor asked me about recreational drugs, I genuinely believed I hadn't done any because this one time I tried it with friends was so forgettable.
* Drinking. When my doctor asked, I said I have about 3-4 drinks every couple weeks. I turned 21 last year, so I've been taking advantage of being able to legally drink. During the school year, I'd have maybe 3-4 drinks every couple weeks, but during the summer, I drink much more. Over this past summer, I'd binge drink (usually shots) once a week or once every other week and have a glass of wine or two throughout the week (maybe 16-20 drinks a month + a bottle of wine). And over this past weekend alone, I had 10-15 drinks (shots). Drinking is my vice, and it's something I've worked on curbing during the school year. 
* Being sexually active. I said I had never had sex, but that's not the truth. I'm very uncomfortable talking about my sex life in general. I've had a couple of partners, but I haven't had sex more than 10 times total. Oral sex is a different matter, though. Past that, I haven't been sexually active in over a year and a half. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to be honest when my doctor asked, but I panicked and lied. Even when I tried to be honest, I still kind of downplayed how much I drink on average (doctor asked if I had 2-3 drinks and I said I had 3-4). I feel terribly guilty, and I don't know what to do since I've now lied to my doctor. How do I fix this?",09Aug2019,1

585,"Hi there reddit,

I have been lurking around reddit for years but this will be the first time I am posting something. Sorry if it's a long story but never in my life have I been this depressed and anxious. 

Background: Got a masters degree in Sociology, got a good job as a researcher for the dutch government, I called in sick 2 weeks ago and explained I was dealing with severe mental and physical issues, had a traumatic childhood due to alcohol abuse from father and beating from mother, I got a scoliosis with a leg length difference of around 1 cm. 

Hi everyone, 

  
I am 27 years old and from the Netherlands here. Last week I was diagnosed with stage 2 Hallux Rigidus. It scared the death out of me as I, figuratively speaking, saw my own image shatter in a mirror and I am now in a very bad state of mind. Here is what's going on and I hope someone can ease my mind and offer some advice and basically tell me it's going to be okay... I am not a lot of pain yet, but I do have an osteofyt on my left toe, the right is limited but has no apparant bone spurs.  


* I feel alone, scared and as if my life ahead will only consist of pain and suffering.
* My childhood was traumatic and left me with some mental and self-esteem issues, I seeked help from a psychologist for this and I hope treatment will start in about a month.
* In conjunction with these issues I was diagnosed with Hallux Rigidus. The combination of my poor mental well-being and physical issues broke me.
* I explained everything to my manager and colleagues. They were very supportive and understood my situation. I am now on sick-leave to deal with this and hope to return to work when I feel emotionally stable again.
* I have a scoliosis which left me with a leg difference of around 1 cm on my left leg. I wore orthotics for this that have a thickness of 8mm.
* I went to an orthopedist at a private clinic but I felt that he was just not that interested in my case and gave me a generic story, he gave me no advice on what exact physical therapy to take and what brand shoes were useful. He did tell me that the progression of the limitus to rigidus could take between 10 and 15 years or even be stable. I hope that I can keep the progression to a minimum.
* Surgery is out of the question for now and I will be focussing on conservative treatment now.
* I made a new appointment to have new orthotics made for me that deal with hallux rigidus.
* I will start physical therapy next week to work on making my muscles stronger.
* For now my biggest concern is finding footwear that looks presentable but also offers relief for the joint. The orthopedist said that orthotics were sufficient for now in conjunction with shoes that have a stiff sole. Can anyone give me some advice on good shoe brands in Europe or specific shoes that have helped you a lot? 
* I work for the government so I am also looking for shoes that look a bit more formal than regular sneakers.

I am sorry for the long story but I am just so scared. I hope someone can give me some advice. Thank you!",09Aug2019,2
586,"I want to preface by apologizing if this post is all over the place I'm running on 2 1/2 hours of sleep and I'm depressed and stressed.

So I, \[23F\] and my (ex) boyfriend \[26M\] (of 1 year and 9 months) and I have recently broken up, about three weeks now, and keeps telling me that he wants to try to work things out but that he is still on the fence about whether he wants this relationship or not. He continues to tell me that he needs his space, but we live together and are in couples counseling. We have only had one session which was on Monday, and he is yet to do any of the homework that she gave us. The first part of the assignment is to just take the 5 love languages quiz. He hasn't even done that yet.

He keeps telling me that he still is unsure if he wants to continue or not, but that if he chooses not to its not because of me. He also continues to remind me that we are broken up. It's been three weeks since the argument and he still isn't over it. We barely talk when we are both home so it's not like he doesn't have time to ponder whether he is in it or not (which is one of the assignments the therapist gave him) **But like I said previously, he continues to say that he wants to try to work on things.**

However, I just feel like this argument  is not enough for us to be over for good. I'm in therapy now and working on myself, so I just don't understand why he still has to ""figure out if he wants this or not"" especially considering all of the things that I have done for him, including taking off of work and driving 5 hours to another state to pick him up, in the middle of the night, because he had a huge emergency(he has health issues) Our good times DEFINITELY outweigh our bad times.  Idk. I guess my question is, am  I being stupid? Is he giving me hints that he isn't going to choose to stay with me? Or am I reading too much into everything? Should I just give him time? I just feel like I'm waiting for an inevitable death sentence. It's making me extremely anxious and depressed. I just need to know what we are going to do.  I just don't understand why he is willing or almost willing to throw everything away over things that I can work on and am working on. I'm not a perfect person, but neither is he.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe its also important to note what happened to prompt all of this. Long story short, I broke up with him out frustration I immediately regretted it. He chose to stay broken up because we needed to work on things. During this time I had multiple nervous breakdowns and my mom came down kind of hard on him. He feels like I wasn't listening to him when he told me that he **was** doing the things I asked of him, and he has animosity towards me because now I believe that he was doing the things I asked, when i just couldn't see it before. He also keeps saying that we argue about the same thing every time, which is some what true. But over the course of our relationship we have had 10 arguments (that's including big and small) which I don't think is a whole lot considering we have been together almost 2 years. He just feels like everything that happened was  a lot for him and that he needs time to process whether it's worth it or not.

I'm just so terrified because I don't want to lose him. I can't.",09Aug2019,1
587,"I’m not asking for medical advice or advice on how to get insurance necessarily, I just don’t know how to handle this situation.

Of course she looked up her symptoms and one of the leading causes was apparently colon cancer? I’m not really sure what she looked at but she’s been taking it really serious. 

My mom and I have been arguing a lot recently and this past week it’s like she’s trying to be super nice to me in case she actually dies. She’s been talking to me about stuff like how she loves me a lot (she never really tells me) and what she wants after she dies.

We’ve also had a lot of people in our family die from cancer and she saw what they went through and she doesn’t want to fight it I guess. It’s so fucking scary to see someone give up before they’re even diagnosed.

611,"TL;DR: Emotional support cat passed away last year, I want a cat but roommate is being immature because I don't want her to have a dog in a small apartment.

I have lived with my roommate for over a year now and we just signed another lease. I'm posting because I'm not 100% sure how to go about this situation. My roommate has stated that she can not afford where we live. In an effort to help her out as well as myself (I'd be completely screwed without her staying because I'd have no roommate) I offered to pay $100 extra a month, given that my room is almost double the size of hers as well. 

She has been wanting a dog forever, but our apartment is not that large and I'm not okay with living with a dog because in a space of our size, it would be like living with another person. I have always struggled with clinical depression and anxiety disorder and my emotional support cat (that lived at my parents house) unfortunately was diagnosed with cancer and passed away in December, making my depression way worse than before. I expressed to my roommate that I would like to have a cat because I think it would make me feel a lot better and like I have something that depends on me. She expressed that ""If I can't have a dog then you can't have a cat"". So, here we are. After I am paying ONE HUNDRED extra dollars (that I can't even really afford as a student) a month so that we can have a place to live. She is primarily being eye for an eye and very petty, and also saying that cats ""tear everything up"". While in some cases this can be true of cats, she has never owned a cat and growing up in a household with 4 cats, my family never had an issue with cats ""tearing everything up"". And, slightly unrelated, I provided our apartment with 100% of the living room furniture, so if the cat should decide to tear things up, it's my stuff.  She's not acknowledging the fact that living with a dog is a way bigger responsibility. She works restaurant hours on weekdays and weekends and would never even be home to tend to a dog properly. Cats are great about fending for themselves for the time being.

612,"I am 23 M and my friend, we'll call Jack, turned 21 about 5 months ago. I've known Jack for 3 years now. I have had a few friends come and go over the years, but Jack has pretty much only had me to really rely on for those 3 years. He has a personality that is very prickly to many people, and it puts them off, also he can be very needy which puts off many people who would be his friend. Also makes turning him down hard because he gets salty pretty easily. 

When Jack first turned 21, he went to this bar where we knew the bartender. He only went maybe once a week for the first month. He quickly upped that pace. Soon he was going 3 times a week, then 4 or even 5 times a week. He loved the bar. He loved to drink. And I think he likes the attention he pretends to not notice from ladies. Whenever we're out attractive women always check him out. I notice it all the time. When we're at bars, it's a much more concentrated occurrence.

Well now, Jack has found that he likes to go to clubs rather than bars. And he wants to go almost every other night. 

So this problem has two parts:

 Jack is a VERY good looking dude, I'm saying that as a heterosexual guy. He is also still a virgin, he has no ladies skills, and his personality is kind of hard to enjoy to be honest, but his looks carry him very far, he could be a male model. First, I learned when I was 18 that having sex with a woman you barely know is awful and unenjoyable, so personally, I don't have a desire to hook-up with strange women. These bar trips are basically me giving in to Jack's requests that I come with him. I don't like to drink that much. I rarely drink when I go out with Jack to the bar/club. It's not my scene. Jack is just afraid to go to the bar/club alone, he essentially needs me there as a safety blanket. But to add insult to injury, when I go out with Jack, women constantly check him out and talk to him. I have a good poker face, I don't put on a bad show when I'm out with Jack, but man, hours of that over the months just makes me feel like shit. 

The second problem is that, this is simply not the kind of life I want to live. I am a college student, and because it's summer, I've had more free time, but even then, I DON'T like going to bars/clubs. I really rarely drink. However, in the last 5 months, Jack has been VERY involved in the bar/club life. Going several times each and every week. Because I've known Jack for 3 years and this change has happened relatively quick, I'm thinking we are diverging rather quickly into two different lifestyles where I can't follow him and partake in his new hobbies. 

Should I tell Jack why I don't want to go out with him to bars/clubs? Should I be honest and tell him that the women checking him out and ignoring me doesn't make me feel good? Also, sooner or later I'm going break and straight up tell him that I'm not going out to bars/clubs with him anymore, is it just inevitable that our friendship will probably be over after that since his life has become so involved in bars/clubs? 

Thanks in advance.",09Aug2019,1

Now 4 days ago i got hacked, i tried to reset my password with my mail but i couldn’t access my mail on outlook, wrong password again and again. 
I called Microsoft and talked to them and said what’s the problem i can’t login and i knew the password to the account and always knew it. 
I gave him the hotmail name and he said that they removed the account a month ago due to ”inactivity” and i was like yeah okay but like give it back to me cause i need it for my Facebook. And then he told me someone else created the same mail like the one they deleted 1 month ago.
So the guy probably just wanted to create a Facebook with his mail that he created but then probably it Said ”you already have an account with this mail” and then just resetted it on Facebook.

617,"It started when I was younger, I'd get an itchy rash after taking a shower but a few years ago, I started to get a reaction to drinking water. Doesn't matter if the water is purified or not, the more pure the water is the worse the reaction is. I'd get this weird tickle in my throat after drinking water, then half an hour later my lips and tongue were swollen up.

Though now I can't drink water at all and stopped trying to drink water full stop after I was thirsty after doing some running and chugged a bottle of water as i was out of soda. About 10 minutes later my tongue and throat swelled up so much I was considering going to the hospital because I could barely breathe.

I can drink soda without having a reaction, I can eat soups, basically any water that isn't straight water is okay.

According to my friend who is a nurse, she says it seems as though my body is intolerant to any water with a higher purity than the water already in my body (which would explain why I can swallow my own saliva with no problems for instance), so when I drink plain water, my immune system thinks ''oh, plain water'' and over reacts to it.

623,"Hi all. So I recently got fired from my job. I waited 2 weeks to apply for unemployment (silly, I know) thinking I could get by on my severance. It's starting to become clear to me that it won't however, and that I'll need to find a form of income soon- like by the end of the month.

I've applied for unemployment benefits and was told that since I was fired, the claims investigation into it would take up to 21 days. The reason why I was fired was because I was told by my past employer that I'm not a good fit for the position. I made quite a few mistakes on the job, performance and professional-wise, so I'm a bit worried as to what my employer might reveal to the unemployment claims examiner. And of course whether that will affect my receiving of benefits.

If I take on ""any job"" between now and the next 3 weeks waiting on my unemployment claim to succeed, I will not be able to receive unemployment. I have been offered short-term temp positions by local recruiters (like one-day to a week, a few months etc) and have been looking at coffee shop positions. I would rather not stand on my feet though since I'm not made for that kind of work, I have tried it before and it wasn't for me. I also would rather not do temp stints.

My newly discovered passion is computer programming. My ideal job would be one that would have enough down-time for me to study at work, or a financial/operations analyst position that will eventually lead to some coding work, or a part-time job that will pay enough for me to live (harder to find) and study on the side. If that PT job is a tech field, that would be great as it would give me a segway/intro into computer programming.

What do you all recommend I do in my position? I am very much at a crossroads and want some guidance as to how to proceed. Thank you very much.",09Aug2019,1

629,"To introduce myself and give context, I am a teenage girl. I recently moved to a new neighborhood on the edge of town, which features a clubhouse and a gym, both of which I used lots when I just moved in, and decreasingly often after the following events started. Also, I'm transgender, but because of being on hormones for over a year, and starting hormones relatively young, most people cant notice anything out of the ordinary when they look at Me, because I pass as cis(born as the gender you identify as, it means I look like a girl). I've passed as cis since I moved to the new neighborhood. Also, my mother works business and therefore I have the house to myself most nights. 

So let's get started with the actual events.

It had been an especially hot couple of days when my mother and I layed rock and did part of our own landscaping for the house. We had to do this during those couple of days because she was soon to leave on a business trip, and because grass was getting put down, and we didnt want to have to rip it up to lay the rock we were planning on putting down anyway. Because of this, we were outside a lot during the first few days that we moved in. During that time, a young man (looked over 18), and what looked like his father walked past our house multiple times. This isn't out of the ordinary, but it didnt make a bunch of sense because they always came from a part of the neighborhood that was much more developed, where they had really nice sidewalks, alternatively where our house is theres just a bunch of construction equipment and generally less pleasant place to walk.

I went to the gym about once a day at that point. There was always a older man there, but it was a different guy every time so whatever. However, I always got the feeling I was being watched. Originally, I was like, ok whatever, I'm just trying to run here, but I'm probably getting checked out. Perv but not anything out of the ordinary. Until one night I went down there, and there was no one else in the gym, or in the clubhouse at all. I still felt like I was being watched, but I have anxiety, so I played it off as that and called it normal. I did intervals, which meant it was quiet in the gym for short periods of time during my workout, when I heard footsteps halfway through my workout. Whatever, maybe someone came into join me in the gym. Heard nothing. Footsteps out in the lobby, where there was nothing to do, and no doors opened, just a weird feeling. I got my miles in, finishing about twenty minutes later, and I was almost done stretching when the lights in the gym (which are NOT on a censor, light switch only) turned off and left me in the near pitch black in the gym. I went to go get up, kinda freaked out, and then I turned the lights on and left. As I was leaving, I closed the glass door, turned around to make sure it completely closed, and through the door I saw the same young man peering from around a corner ghost-face style, just watching me. I jumped, called my mom, explained the situation as I walked home. I kept checking behind me to make sure I wasnt being followed, but it was dark. She told me to not go down to the gym at night anymore.

Finally worked up the courage to go down to the gym about a week later. From the place the treadmills are, I cannot see the entrance to the gym. During my workout, I heard the heavy doors of the gym open and close multiple times, no one entered. Got freaked out and left immediately. Nope nope nope. 

A week later, went down to the gym again. Nothing out of the ordinary, but I saw the man again at the back door as I left. I really wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, but at this point its getting scary. Hes at least six inches taller than me and I am a small teenage girl, so i need to be careful about this stuff. I stopped going to the gym alone. Havent seen him since.

Every once in a while when I'm home alone, I get the sinking feeling that I'm being watched. I've swept the house on every occasion, brandishing a buck-knife. Everything has come up completely clear, except for two strange things.

The room I hang out in and binge video games, shows, etc has one of those windows where the room is in the basement but it's been dug out to let light in and there's a ladder so you can escape in the case of an emergency. 

Once, at night, I turned around to get a drink of water, and from the surface level out the window, I saw a white flash in the window. The next morning, there were fingerprints and marks where hand had seemed to try to open the window from the outside.

I might have missed some details, but that's the core stuff. 

I dont know if I'm being paranoid, and I dont know what to do in this situation. I'm terrified to go anywhere alone. I just need advice right now.",09Aug2019,2
631,"Hello Redditors,

Ever since I (M20) was little I’ve wanted to join the armed services, and as I’m setting up for my last year at community college, I’m beginning to prepare for my future at a four year university and I’d like to join the Illinois National Guard and eventually the Army’s Medical Program so I can serve my country and pursue my dreams of becoming a surgeon as well.

However, there’s one problem. When I was 17 I was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts in an inpatient to outpatient program. I went through the department of defense disqualifying standards and inpatient was one of those.
While I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I only stayed inside for about two weeks as required by the medical standards at the time (plus my family has good insurance). I was not required counseling, but have decided to see a therapist for my own self exploration and clarity on certain familial issues.

Long story short. How screwed am I? Is it possible to leave out that certain information since I was under 18? Or am I just SOL? Please Help!",09Aug2019,2

634,"Lately since moving back from University the relationship between these two has become increasingly toxic. They both essentially treat me like a dog.

My sister is (bipolar or something), her mood chops and changes constantly. She’ll take me out on a drive somewhere (although only on her terms and always at the last minute) on occasion, whilst the next day she will lock herself in her bedroom and refuse to talk to me.

If we get into an argument she will not talk to me for week +. 

Quite often she will have a grudge against me for no reason. For ex, she will get up and tell me to “fuck off” when I say hello in the morning or she will ignore me when I ask her about her day. She also has a tendency to ignore my messages and calls. 

Today I was in her work place (a grocery store). I went up to the counter where she was working and she turned her back on me until I left, right in front of her colleagues. This was humiliating because these colleagues do not know me and probably thought I was a creep. 

My father is somewhat the same. He seems to sort of get into irritable moods and take out his frustrations on me. 

He constantly digs into our arguments and always takes her side. Always telling me to wise up or “fuck up”. 

He doesn’t have much of an interest in what I do or my interests. In fact he’s said this previously. It’s like pulling teeth to get something out of him conversation wise.

He doesn’t approve of me getting involved in my mother/his conversations and will get up and leave shortly after I come into the conversation. If I ask what they were discussing (anyone actually) he tells me to keep out.

My mother of course will not tell any of these people off and just lets them persist with their hateful behaviour towards me. Today for example she said that my sister was “joking”. How is someone blanking you joking? That’s not jovial behaviour. She also says that it’s “normal” for siblings to fight as a justification for her lack of involvement. I.e she thinks that all siblings argue and that we should be fighting.

The best part of this is that it’s not actually instigated. Whilst I argue with them, a lot of the time my presence seems to just set them off. I.e a simple hello or asking them what they’re doing sets them off.

I.e yesterday they were discussing my sister buying a car. I said to my sister “what car are you looking at” she ignored me, I said it again to which she said “fuck off!”. I asked my father the same thing to which he said “uhh would you piss off”. 

And there was no arguments before this. This is the manner that they were talking to me unprovoked.

I want this to work but they seem dead set on resenting me for no reason.

I have tried to talk to my father about this and his response is always “wise up” or “catch yourself on”, he’s always making me seem insane or crazy as if I am making this all up. (I just had a blow out with my mother over this right now and my father came in after I left all saying that I was crazy and making this all up about his hateful behaviour. Note he didn’t come in when I was in the room.)

I am at the end of my tether with this behaviour now.",09Aug2019,0

And even dee (the older lady working cashier who trained us both( goes “did she call you dear??” And he goes “Yeah we are just having fun, right (my name)?”.

In November I moved in with him and my grandmother, left my job at a elderly &amp; assisted living facility, and became his full time care taker. I am not being paid for this. He also has two able bodied daughters who do not participate in his care aside from rides to appointments. One daughter is married to a man whom my whole family knows molested me for 3 years; he confessed. They also have an unemployed 22 year old son who does not help. My mother is an abusive alcoholic with untreated &amp; uncontrolled bi polar. My grandmother is a severe hoarder. She screams at my grandfather. She gets overwhelmed by his symptoms, tells him she hates him, ignored him etc. So a lot of the weight falls on me. All of these people are increasingly toxic to me. The situation overwhelms me. I’m restricted deeply in my personal life; I see my fiancé once a week. I’m treated like a child; limited access to our kitchen &amp; the utilities. Washing and drying my clothes is monitored and limited. I’m asked not to do these things if she’s not home; I have her go out one day a week to relax &amp; play at the casino. 

I’m reaching a breaking point. I see my offender and his wife weekly. He does odd jobs for my gram like mowing the lawn or repairing broken utilities. My mother calls here and lashes out on me; “I have no responsibility &amp; the life I have is provided to me, not earned.”

Meanwhile my grandmother just bought her a car, while I forego income to assist her parents. 

I’ve tried applying for income but it’s a lengthy process through the VA and has not been a priority to my gram.

I deeply want to remove myself from this situation but I feel like my grandfathers wellbeing depends on me. 

I lash out at my gram &amp; her obsessive need for control. She doesn’t even want me to be gone over night ever. I feel infantilized and trapped. I feel guilty for feeling any of that &amp; I’ve reached a point where I don’t trust my own feelings. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know how to find a solution that will rest easy on my conscience. 

I’m so tired.",09Aug2019,1
661,"My biodad was just released from prison and is now doing parole at my grandmas house. They live next door to us and my 4 yr old son goes over to grandmas often. My biodad and I do not get along. He is a 50 year old leach who has never had a job and has always relied on his mom to pay his way through life. The only times he wasnt doing that were when he was in prison for met. Hes been in prison for drugs over half his life on and off now. He has a chip on his shoulder and a huge victim complex. It's never been his fault and hes always gets set up or the police reneged on an undercover deal they had with him, that's the bs he tells grandma anyway and she believes it. Shes a huge enabler, it's really her biggest flaw because otherwise shes the best person I know and shes a second mother to me. When my son was 2 my so and I lived with her and my biodad lived in the house we now live in. He got into a fight with his junky girlfriend, I went out and stopped it then went home. He then came in and plopped a bad of meth and needles down in arms reach of my 2 year old son saying ""see those are her drugs not mine"" and I flipped my shot telling him to get it outta here he wouldn't so the cops were called and we left before they got there. I told my grandma and her response  was to just flush the drugs. A year later he then went to jail for supposed to be 10 years but nearly served 1. Anyway to get to the point I dont want my son around him. My son has asked to go see him unprovoked and I just dont know how to handle it. I dont want to try and keep him from him so much that I end up making him some sort of mystery that my son wants to be around him more. I dont want him I influencing my son and dont know if being strict that hes bad and he doesnt need to be around him or if I should allow him to be around him and make his own judgment on his shittiness. 

Tldr: I dont want my son around my biodad but he is asking to see him. Is it better for me to forbid him from seeing him or allow him to and hopefully become disillusioned on his own?",09Aug2019,5

665,"Don't mind the new account, I just don't want my family finding out just yet.


I've been a little obsessed with furry culture for a while, I love the looks of fursuits and fursonas, and I finally want to make one of my own. Although, I do have a few things holding me back from it. 

First, my parents. My mom is generally very accepting but if I were to tell her I have a fursona she would not be very happy. She thinks it's a sex thing only, that it's extremely weird, and despite my defending of the community, she just never can agree with me. My stepdad would make fun of me, and certainly try to distance me from that culture as much as possible. My dad probably would call me juvenile, and my stepmom might not even talk to me.

Second, my friends. Again, it's weird to them, only a bad joke. I've dropped hints about this before but they have always laughed it off as if it was a joke, I don't live in an area that would accept different so that would never go well unfortunately. I don't want to lose my friends over this.

Third, my own self esteem. I don't know if I could hide something I enjoy from my parents and friends. I go to college next year so maybe I should wait but I would love to at least get a fursona now. I know artists who make fursonas work very closely with the people who want them made, which means voice chats and shit, and I have no idea how I would explain that to my mom.

I really would love to at least try a fursona and see if I like it as much as I think I would, and it certainly would be something for casual for me, but I have no idea how to handle these problems. I suppose I could just not get a fursona or do any of this, but I really want to at least try. Anyone have any suggestions?",09Aug2019,0
666,"So about a month ago me and my girlfriend had unprotected sex on the last day of her period, I didn’t finish in her but I had finished earlier that day and didn’t pee before we had sex the second time so it’s possible for a pregnancy, so we decided to take a plan b but didn’t take it till three days after that incident, about a week after this she had some bleeding that ending up being basically a small period the week after she took it and now she is over a week late on her normal period which should have started on the first or second, she’s had some cramping this week and sore breasts and that scared me so we took two tests that came back negative but I’m not sure if it’s too early for it to show up cause it’s hasn’t even been a month.

667,"She (T) has a 3 year old and lives with the father, but they broke up a while ago. T has intense mental issues, and also has health problems brought about by past trauma. She can’t leave the house alone or she has a seizure brought about by her PTSD, and she offend has panic attacks in public. This has rendered her unable to work, so the baby daddy (C) works and provides. 
C often comes home and verbally (and sometimes physically) abuses their child. He had a temper, so T would let him have sex with her because she was afraid to piss him off if she didn’t. When I told her that having sex against your will due to fear of repression was a form of rape, she finally told him she didn’t want to have sex anymore. C responded by guilting her, that he works hard and “a man’s needs must be fulfilled”. She actually felt guilty. But she stuck to he boundaries.
Naturally, he ended up getting frustrated a few weeks later and ended up hitting her in the face with a plastic cup, it smashed on her cheek and cut her skin. She blamed herself for provoking him. 
A few weeks later, she was having a panic attack in the living room. He comes home, sees her tweaking out, and proceeded to have his way with her. She couldn’t say no, so he took that as a yes. Even though she had told him before that she never wanted to have sex again, he took the opportunity. 
I’ve tried to get her to report him, call social services, etc. but she’s convinced that due to her mental illness, he could get her child taken away (which he has threatened to do before). She also doesn’t want to leave him because she believes she would be robbing her child of a father.. she feels sympathy for her rapist.

670,"The beginning is easy, I want to be with my boyfriend in New York City. I am a thirty year old adult, okay, not a big deal, go do it then, yeah...

I want to move across country to New York City to be with my boyfriend, my mom has ALS and doing so would lead to my Dad virtually cutting me out of his life.

The problem that I really need help with is that doing so will result in my father all but ending our relationship.

My mom has ALS, and a rather odd case of it. She has had it a long time, for 15 years in fact. I have based almost all of my life decisions around this. And I take ownership of those choices, I made the choices I did-I don’t regret them, but the number one factor in my life has been my mom.
When I went to college, instead of going away, I decided last minute to go to one near home.
At that point she’d had ALS for five years, and a quick wiki search will tell you ALS usually kills in 2-5 years, sometimes 10, so I thought that she might go any time and I wanted to be there for her, to spend as much time with her as possible.
But she beat those odds to a pulp because she is badass and I went to college and lived at home. Then after school, I thought, well, I want to go away and live somewhere far off, and chase some dreams as a young twenty year old.
But I ultimately decided I should stay with my mom, so I did.
My mom was always supportive telling me I was good to go, but I didn’t know how long she might have, and I wanted to be there for her. So I stayed at home, I worked as a legal/personal assistant.
But mostly I helped my mom and was support for my dad.
In the end I’ve spent ten years here, doing little and having an isolated existence.

My dad is the other part of this equation.
He is...complicated.
As a teenager we didn’t get along, even in college he treated me with distain. He only  started to act nice to me once I all but gave up my life to be the family’s helper.
He has let me live rent free and pays for most of the food.
But he trades in his affection. There are times he treats me or my mom like we are annoyances. He is actively hostile to my sister when the mood strikes him.
I don’t want to go too far, but it is not unfair to say that he is emotionally abusive. And I would have not stayed so close to him if not for my Mom’s illness.
But anyone who was been around someone like him knows you want them to love you. The more distant he is the more I try. 

Now to the present. 

Somewhere in all this mess I managed to meet an amazing man and we fell in love. He makes me happy and I feel like I be myself with him. We’ve been together for two years and he recently moved to NYC for work. I want to be in the city with him. Imagining living in that crazy place is the most excited I’ve been about anything in years.

I brought up moving to New York with my father, just asking to talk about it. He said it wasn’t a good Idea, a lark, and no point. I told him it was a low risk transition. I have a place to live and even a job that will sustain me while I look for something that I want to do. I don’t want money from him, I just want to be allowed to go, and for him not to hate me. I think for him it’s about him not wanting his child to leave. Even if that child is living a half life. He doesn’t care if I’m just surviving as long as he’s got me near.

I don’t want to be cut off from my mom. And I don’t know what will happen to her with my father. I can call, and I have it set up that mom and I can see one another, and I talk to her other via video. But I don’t think I’ll ever be welcome back home. I may be tolerated, but it will be over, and I have tired so hard to avoid that; to please my dad so one day he’d recognize the sacrifices I’ve made and let me go without hating me. 

It feels like I am throwing an atomic bomb into our family. 

Is there anything I could say to my dad that would make it easier for him? Anyway to deal with someone like him, where you can make them come around to your side.
Am I an asshole for leaving my mom who is still living with ALS and to whom I provide a lot of care and affection?
Is it wrong to go after a life that is mine, even if it’s “stupid”. Maybe going to New York to be with my boyfriend of two years is stupid, maybe living in that city is stupid, maybe I’ll fall flat on my face, but am I allowed to chase that?

TLDR 
I want to move away from my family, but it will cause a rift with my father and he will never forgive me. Is there a way to keep him from emotionally cutting me off?",09Aug2019,1

672,"Lately I’ve just been dealing with a lot of anxiety and overthinking about my current relationship and I don’t know how to help or stop it. 

Honestly it probably really started in the beginning of June after I tried getting certified for scuba diving. My girlfriend is a semi avid scuba diver and almost her entire family are divers as well. Anyways I did the classes to get certified and during our open water dives, I freaked out and had a panic attack 40ft down and ended up shooting to the surface (not safely). Since then, I guess I’ve been really anxious and freaked out with the whole diving stuff. I told my girlfriend about everything that happened and she told me about that she hasn’t dove since March because she freaked out similarly during one of their dives in the ocean and they were around a bunch of sharks, which scared the hell out of her and she hasn’t dove since then. So she consoled me and told me that it wasn’t a big deal, and that was that. It still bothers the hell out of me, as just thinking about the whole ordeal from the class makes me have small anxiety attacks that aren’t anything serious but they just get me worked up. Since then, I’ve started to notice myself become slightly jealous of my girlfriend because of the fact that at least she’s gone on dives before and she’s experienced it, where as I can’t even do that. We eventually made a pact a couple months ago and promised each other that we would both leave diving in the past and not bring it up or bother with it anymore cause of what it does to each of us. But today she went with her family again and dove for the first time since her incident, after being pressured for months by her family. I’m trying my best to be supportive and I am proud of her for overcoming her fears that she had. But at the same time I’m just angry, jealous, and a little hurt because of it. I guess I’m a little angry because of what happened to me and the fact that I haven’t let it go and that I “quit” and I hate myself for that. I’m jealous just cause, I at least want to experience what diving would be like but I just don’t have it in me and I’m jealous of my girlfriend for being able to do it. And lastly, as dumb as it sounds, I’m actually a little hurt that she broke our promise/pact thing. I have conflicting feelings about that last part because I shouldn’t be hurt because, diving is apart of her life and I should never have expected her to avoid diving when it’s such a big part of her family and life. But at the same time, I’m a little hurt because I felt like we were supporting each other with our problems and she was my partner but now she’s overcome her problems and anxieties but I still have mine. So in the end, I don’t really know what to do, I know I should try and just accept the past, let it go, and try to forget it and move on with my life without letting it affect my relationship. I’m also a bit scared because now that my girlfriend is good with diving again, I feel like I’ll be stuck on the sidelines because that’s just something I cannot do and I don’t know what to do. So in the end, I don’t really know what to do, I know I should try and just accept the past, let it go, and try to forget it and move on with my life without letting it affect my relationship. But I have no idea where to start, so if anyone has advice, that’d help a lot.",09Aug2019,2

689,"I’ve always grown up in fear of being branded as having a mental health issue. Largely due to my mom’s issues involving her own mother who was schizophrenic and often neglected and once tried to kill my mom and her siblings. My mom has her own issues, and in the past I have seen her get angry when someone mentions getting mental health help. For instance, following the death of her brother, she told me that she had been feeling sad and gloomy for months. I suggested that she talk to a therapist to work through some of her feelings about his death...and in response she stopped talking to me for several weeks. She was so angry at me for even suggesting she was not mentally healthy. I have never ever had her get mad at me like that in my life. I’m 26 years old and although we’ve had plenty of arguments through the years, that was the only time my mom gave me the silent treatment. 

Being brought up in this environment of fear and anger towards mental health taught me that seeking help for mental health issues was a horrible thing. That having a mental illness is absolutely the most shameful thing a person could ever have. That I should try to hide it and work through it on my own. And for the most part that’s what I’ve done.

Through the past 4 years, I have gone through some pretty severe depression. There have been times when the only reason I haven’t attempted suicide is the knowledge that my dog would miss me. 

I’m high functioning. I wake up every morning, I go to work, I take my dog to the dog park. Routine is key. I’ve had my ups and downs. But right now I’m in a terrible place mentally. I just spent the last hour at work practicing my cursive with the phrase “I want to kill myself” over and over again. I absolutely hate my job. 

I was always an extremely happy, bubbly, cheerleader type person. And I was always a huge overachiever, and excelled academically. Was great socially. Had tons of friends and never had a problem holding a conversation with another person. That’s another reason why it has been so hard to admit I have a problem. And then I went to law school and it’s like my mental health was shattered to pieces. I gained 100 lbs in my first 2 years of school. Most lawyers I know who have mental health issues are alcoholics. I turned to food instead. I would come home from class every day and binge eat. And although my weight has now been stable for the last 2 years, I regularly contemplate suicide and I have started having panic attacks while at work where it feels like someone is sitting on my chest and I start texting my mom begging her to take care of my dog just in case I’m having a heart attack.  

I think that I would benefit from getting mental health help, but considering my upbringing, I don’t even know where to start. What options are out there for me? Do antidepressants even work? Do they make you gain weight? How do they make you feel? Do they make you actually feel happy? Or do they just numb the pain? Are there any other side effects I should be aware of? Should I look into both antidepressants and anti anxiety meds? 

Thank you in advance for your advice.",09Aug2019,1
690,"My mother went through a lot, I love her dearly she does her best. But being 18 and living with her is so draining. She grew up with learning disabilities that they never gave her help for or diagnosed her. She still doesnt get it diagnosed either. She missed school a lot when she was younger and in highschool she ran away with her boyfriend to Hawaii and missed a lot. She went through shit and all she had as a coping mechanism really was Christianity. Fast forward to now, shes a hardcore a bit on the delusional side Christian woman but shes so sweet to everyone she meets. The problem is that she is ignorant and just doesnt know SO much because she never bothers to read, watch movies, and only looks at youtube political propaganda and the bible.

691,"I'm a 24-year-old woman, I have been ugly since I went through puberty. As a child, I was very cute and small. But when I began going through puberty, my nose got large, and some of my facial features became more pronounced and rather unattractive. I can take good pictures of myself, and look attractive if I try hard enough in pictures.. but in real life and in full-body photos I look hideous.

I did recently lose a lot of weight. I lost 30 lbs. I thought it would make me more attractive but it didn't. The problem doesn't seem to be with my body but with my face. I have always been on the uglier side but a few years ago I was in a car accident that fractured my face in a few places.. this changed the way my face looked and made me even uglier than I was before.

I literally cannot attend school without being an RA, all of my other options have been cut off.

I am stuck as an RA and the mass amount of rules and responsibilities is really sketching my out, especially as someone who has pretty self-admitted commitment issues.

709,"Hi reddit! For clarification; i am an 18 year old female with a boyfriend.


I recently got my first apartment, and the walls were looking kinda sparse; so I went poster shopping with a friend. At the store we saw this poster that had six naked woman on it, sunbathing by a pool; typical playboy stuff. I thought it was great, bought it and it now hangs in my tiny studio. 

The reason I bought this poster was mainly because why the fuck not. I finally no longer live with my mom, and for most of highschool we shared a house with a pastor, his wife, and another woman whom Ive never interacted with. The pastor and his wife were really kind people, but I fucking hated living there. I had no privacy as the walls were thin and had no locks; and sometimes people would walk in our room without warning. I also had to share a bed with my mom and I didnt have my own space to decorate or call my own. My mother is also slightly homophobic; not to the point where she would kick me out, but I remeber her expressing rather extreme relief when my first romantic partner happened to be male. (Little does she know im into girls too lmao) So now that I finally have my own apartment where I can do whatever I want, I decided fuck it; lets get some titties in here. I also thought it would be hilarious since its hella off brand; im usually the mom friend who doesnt go out and owns too many plants.


Now that Ive had it for a while tho, im starting to feel conflicted. I feel like having the tiddy poster; im contributing to the objectification of women. Its weird how the models are just presented in this black void; i know nothing about them or who they are yet I literally possess their naked photos. I essentially reduce them to objects of sexual desire by doing so. Also, the way they smile at the camera like theyre tryna fuck disturbs me on some odd fundamental level; theyre people too but this poster seems to rob the viewer of any notion of that. Also, as a female, I feel like owning this poster kinda sends out the message that this objectification is ok, as look, a female owns one too! 

I still like the poster, and the tonal constrast between it and my goverment issued portrait of queen Elizabeth right next to it; but I feel as if its somehow morally wrong for me to own it, ya feel? What are your thoughts, reddit?",09Aug2019,0

I try to look busy, but I can't stare at a screen with nothing to do all day. I usually end up doing crosswords, reading articles, working on my writing, or occasionally on reddit or twitter (okay, more often than occasionally).

I expect (hope?) this will change over time, as I get more integrated into the workplace and gain more experience with the job. but in the meantime...what should I do? do I keep ""looking busy"" until the next project comes along? should I be asking my supervisor if there's more I can be doing? I'm pretty efficient and get through projects fast, and I don't want to feel like I'm pestering him every week for a new project. sometimes my anxiety REALLY gets going and I start wondering, ""is this a test? does my supervisor KNOW I'm finished with my work and dicking around on the internet for 8 hours a day? oh my god, is everyone else SWAMPED and I'm the ONLY one sitting here twiddling my thumbs?""

724,"A friend of mine has a tendency of getting very grabby and cuddly when he drinks a bit around me. He is never like that when he is 100% sober, but I am normally also drinking and am way too affectionate in general so I never thought too much of it. Some of our other friends did point his actions out to me, but I brushed them aside because I assumed he was just messing around or a little drunk.

Well, it escalated into sex and he was super chill about it the next day. I don't have any feelings for him outside of sexual attraction and that seems to be reciprocated.

I thought after that one night, it would be the end of it because any sexual curiosity is gone. But over the weekend, we were drinking again and his habits haven't changed at all.

I have no issues with continuing a hushed sexual relationship, but I feel really uncomfortable talking to him about his actions because he is ONLY ever like this when he's had a few drinks to loosen him up. He is never drunk in these situations, just a little more relaxed than usual; I know because he can hold his liquor 20x better than I can and we keep each other's pace with drinks.

It would be easy for me to just continue what we were doing, but I'm not sure if I should instead just stop being a coward and ask him for a casual sexual relationship. I also don't know if he even wants that or if when he starts drinking, that flirty behavior starts happening and I'm just a consenting, available option.

Today, as a last resort, I had to get the staff to open it with their spare keys before I moved out... Except it still didn't open. So now I've had to hand in my keys and move out of the room which is still containing those items.

I was told by a member of staff that I should email them and they would eventually get my stuff out and mail it to me, which is obviously not what I want them to do. And they obviously don't know what's in there.

Even without the embarrassment of having a huge fucking dildo locked in my safe, I'm pretty nervous about potentially getting into legal trouble for the weed... It's less than a gram, and some of it is pre-rolled. It's in a tin and wrapped in a sheet to stop the smell.

Anyway, there is no real way of finding time to resign face to face because its a small space and someone else is always on site and usually within earshot. I feel like email is the best way to detail my resignation beyond asking to meet my boss(es) off site, which I don't want to do and that would also take logistical planning. Does this make sense? 

Additionally, how do you guys approach giving notice? Does anyone else always feel guilty, how do you overcome it?",09Aug2019,1
730,"So, I'll just get to the point. I have this huge crush for someone I've been spending the summer with. And I'm not really sure what to do with that, because she has feelings for another guy.

Well call him by ""M"" and my crush can be ""S"" for the sake of simplicity.

Honestly, he seems really great for her. I won't attack M at all because he makes S happy in ways that I simply can't right now. And, he's not a bad guy at all. M's everything that I'm not. He's got his life together, he's making good money, and they both have major feelings for each other. They've known each other far longer than I've known her. I just don't have my life together to support S and her two daughters, and yet I'm pushing myself harder than I ever have to get on my feet. Not only for S, for me too. She's the only person I've met to actually push me to be great! The only person to motivate me to follow my dreams! We literally talk 24/7 and we usually get to see each other at least once a week. I'm just always having a great time with S. And I've been really emotional about if I'm just a big bother to her. I'm really afraid of falling for S because my feelings have never been reciprocated. I just can't deny that I'm growing feelings for her. S is my everything, and I love her.

We've told each other as much, but I'm pretty sure she doesn't mean it to the extent that I do. I mean, how could she? She's been talking to me about her feelings for M, and it brings me down a bit. But, I really appreciate seeing her smile after so much heartbreak. I've been considering the idea of confessing my feelings to S, but with my experience in past relationships, I'm afraid it's not a great idea. Plus, they both seem really happy. I'm actually glad she's found happiness with M, and I wouldn't dare to take that from S. I just can't help but miss her when she's gone. I feel like all my problems fade away when I'm with S. She has this crazy superpower that just warms even the coldest areas of my heart, no matter how sad I am. My heart skips two beats everytime I think about her. She's made me better in ways I never could've imagined.

At the end of the day, when she's finally passed out, I'm left alone with my thoughts. And everything in my mind is telling me to quit.

""She doesn't love you."" 
""You're always gonna be lonely."" 
""You're nothing, just give up.""

These are just a couple things that my mind just loves to repeat to me. And history wants to prove it true. But, when I'm with S, she stops me dead in my tracks and tells me I'm wrong. I've NEVER had anyone do that before. It keeps bringing me back to S, and I can't get enough of her. I.. I'm falling in love, and it's the most amazing feeling. And at the same time, I've never felt lonelier.

So let me know, am I crazy? What can I really do? Should I give up?",09Aug2019,1
731,"So I’ve been super busy this summer and haven’t seen or hung out with my good friend in 2 months. We went on a nice 6 hour date and promised to keep in touch.

They wished me a happy birthday by sending a long message. I then said haha thanks you made my day, give me a tour at your new school someday. 

Then the convo went like this:

Them: We don’t have to wait that long we should meet up soon

Me: *10 hours later as I fell asleep* haha okay just tell me a day and we can plan something or whatever

Them: *thumbs up emoji*

Me: Also the next time we meet drinks are on me!

732,"I have been with my boyfriend for about a year, it feels like longer. I have never met anyone who loves me like he does, but I’m ashamed of how we met while he doesn’t. I have a careless past where I was the mistress to married men, cheated on previous boyfriends who I never really cared about. They were all horrible mistakes and no one should have to go through that. About two years ago I was in an abusive relationship and cheated on my then bf with the man I’m with now. I still feel guilty for cheating but my current boyfriend (who I cheated with) does not. He has told me in the beginning of our relationship that he was involved in two different affairs with married/engaged coworkers during the same time and got caught by one of them. He told me he didn’t feel guilty about it because it wasn’t his relationship he was jeopardizing and that he has never been unfaithful to past girlfriends. I have learned from my past and would never even imagine cheating again. But I’m left wondering if he would. I have no reasons to suspect him of doing so. I feel confident in our relationship but still get scared of all the what-if’s. If he would develop feelings for someone better, more interesting, more compatible... if he would pursue them and enjoys the chase. How do I shake this fear off...",09Aug2019,8
733,"I’ll start this off by saying that I have a problem and that is that whenever a girl likes me back I often lose feelings the moment the say they like me back. I’ll try not to sound cocky but I know I’m a fairly attractive guy I have a good body and I am fairly muscular. I often get from girls that I’m “cute” or “hot” and again not trying to sound cocky but just telling it how it is. So what finally made me come to reddit about this was this girl I met and that me and her hit it off right away. Now we were nothing serious but I sent shirtless pics and she sent some booty pics and I kind of developed a crush for her and she got one for me and I decided to ask her out on a date. Now we went on that date and I lost feelings right away and I don’t know why. She is a great girl, great personality, great body but I just lost attraction. The thing is this isn’t the first time, this is almost every girl that I flirt with and have a mural attraction towards each other. Now there has been a couple girls that haven’t followed the pattern and when I found out they like me I still like them the same. But other than the rare girl that makes that happen I often have to end a thing with a girl and I feel terrible for doing it but I can’t lead them on and I’m an honest dude. So my main questions are, Is this a normal thing that happens to you or anyone? Would you consider me a player? And finally How do I fix or deal with this?",09Aug2019,4
734,"I want to preface by apologizing if this post is all over the place I'm running on 2 1/2 hours of sleep and I'm depressed and stressed.

So I, \[23F\] and my (ex) boyfriend \[26M\] (of 1 year and 9 months) and I have recently broken up, about three weeks now, and keeps telling me that he wants to try to work things out but that he is still on the fence about whether he wants this relationship or not. He continues to tell me that he needs his space, but we live together and are in couples counseling. We have only had one session which was on Monday, and he is yet to do any of the homework that she gave us. The first part of the assignment is to just take the 5 love languages quiz. He hasn't even done that yet.

He keeps telling me that he still is unsure if he wants to continue or not, but that if he chooses not to its not because of me. He also continues to remind me that we are broken up. It's been three weeks since the argument and he still isn't over it. We barely talk when we are both home so it's not like he doesn't have time to ponder whether he is in it or not (which is one of the assignments the therapist gave him) **But like I said previously, he continues to say that he wants to try to work on things.**

However, I just feel like this argument  is not enough for us to be over for good. I'm in therapy now and working on myself, so I just don't understand why he still has to ""figure out if he wants this or not"" especially considering all of the things that I have done for him, including taking off of work and driving 5 hours to another state to pick him up, in the middle of the night, because he had a huge emergency(he has health issues) Our good times DEFINITELY outweigh our bad times.  Idk. I guess my question is, am  I being stupid? Is he giving me hints that he isn't going to choose to stay with me? Or am I reading too much into everything? Should I just give him time? I just feel like I'm waiting for an inevitable death sentence. It's making me extremely anxious and depressed. I just need to know what we are going to do.  I just don't understand why he is willing or almost willing to throw everything away over things that I can work on and am working on. I'm not a perfect person, but neither is he.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe its also important to note what happened to prompt all of this. Long story short, I broke up with him out frustration I immediately regretted it. He chose to stay broken up because we needed to work on things. During this time I had multiple nervous breakdowns and my mom came down kind of hard on him. He feels like I wasn't listening to him when he told me that he **was** doing the things I asked of him, and he has animosity towards me because now I believe that he was doing the things I asked, when i just couldn't see it before. He also keeps saying that we argue about the same thing every time, which is some what true. But over the course of our relationship we have had 10 arguments (that's including big and small) which I don't think is a whole lot considering we have been together almost 2 years. He just feels like everything that happened was  a lot for him and that he needs time to process whether it's worth it or not.

I'm just so terrified because I don't want to lose him. I can't.",09Aug2019,1
735,"I graduated from high school a year ago, and went straight to work as I had decided that attending college wasn’t something that I wanted to do.

737,"I’m 16 years old, and my family is slowly becoming more and more toxic by the day, but for some reason I don’t care. I have my mother and father and my older brother. My brother has been treating us like strangers for a long time. He always puts his friends over us, never helps, or anything. He always goes to his girlfriends house and stays there till 3 in the morning, than comes home and messes up like 4 dishes and sleeps. Then he just leaves the following morning when he wakes up and rinse and repeat.

Whenever we asked him for help with something he would make up an excuse of why he can’t help, but when his friends or girlfriend needs help, he’ll break his neck trying to help them. For the past year I have ignored my brother and stay far away from him. I never speak to him, even when he tries to speak to me. I always leave his dishes in the sink, and a lot of other stupid stuff. I don’t hate him, I just want him to realize that he’s selfish. I asked him to clean the kitchen one time while I mop and he looked me in my face and said “I don’t live here, I’m just staying here for the time being.” I wanted to tell him something soo bad when he said that but I didn’t. 

We have always helped my brother whenever he needed it, but when it comes to us, we aren’t worth his time. My parents have spoken to me about my behavior towards him multiple times, saying I shouldn’t treat my brother the way I do, and I should be the more mature one. He’s 24 and I’m 16, I don’t wanna hear anything about me needing to be the mature one.  Now it seems like those words have backfired on them though as they too have started to ignore him. They don’t respond to his text, answer his calls, or speak to him the rare times he is here now. 

But now my parents are arguing with each other all the time. My mother says it’s my fathers fault for not making him do things around the house, and just let him do whatever he wants. My dad blames her for it too saying she’s his parent as well. And they even started arguing about stupid things now. Remember when I said that my brother comes home and just messes up dishes, and I leave them there. it’s because we barely have dishes as my mother never cooks. My father keeps saying that she should do what most mothers do and cook for once, but that’s not her fault really. My father never buys groceries, he just likes to eat out at fast food and restaurants everyday. Surprisingly I don’t know how none of us are overweight cause eating out everyday isn’t healthy at all. 

So now my parents argue over things that shouldn’t even matter and my brother is basically an outcast to our family now. But my issue isn’t with these problems. It’s with myself. As being a part of this family, I feel as if I should be stopping this drama but I’m not. Mainly because I don’t care. I ignore everything they argue about and I ignore the issue with my brother, I act like I don’t have emotions for any of them. But I don’t get why this is, I know I love my family but I can’t seem to give any interest to the issues they have been carrying for months now. Is there a reason I don’t care about these things, am I just a bad son, or something?",09Aug2019,1
738,"Dear people of Reddit,

I'm an 18 year old male who is about to start his last year of high school. 

I have always been a bit confused about my sexuality, I have always known that I am not completely straight, even after relationships with girls. I knew I was attracted to guys, however I thought I could never be in a romantic relationship with one.

This changed about a month ago when I started following a guy who I thought was 'cute' on Instagram. He followed me back and replied to one of my stories, from on there we started talking. 

We talked all the time for a couple of days straight, and on a drunk saturday night I asked him if he would be interested in meeting up (he lives 60 km from me). He told me he'd be down, so the next day we met up at the station.

That day when I first met him was one of the best days of my life. There was such a strong connection, we literally thought and felt the same about pretty much everything and we just sat near the port and talked for like six hours. I had met my soulmate. 

A week later I travel to his city, couple days later he travels to mine and this continues for a week or two. After those meet-ups we decided to go to my house since my parents and brother would be out of town.

At this point what we had started to look like a relationship, I felt that I was (/am) very much in love with him and I got the same vibe from him. Because of things getting more serious I came out to several people who play a very big role in my life such as my dad, best friend and a bunch of other friends. The coming out felt necessary and the right moment for me. 

So back to where I was: We watch some Netflix at my place and as things go, we start to get a bit closer and cuddle. He kisses me on the cheek, I kissed him back and..well.. things went from there. After we were done he told me he felt sick and he pretty much took the first train he could.

I call him the day after, crying because I was absolutely heartbroken knowing dang well he did not feel sick, and he tells me he doesn't have any feelings for me. He still wants to see me, but he doesn't feel that spark he felt with previous relationships. He told me that it doesn't mean we do not have a future together at all, he just 'doesn't feel it right now.'

This absolutely broke me. I came out to friends and family because this guy made me feel like we were going towards an actual relationship and then at the last moment he just sails off. I have no idea what to do, except cry and lay in bed all day. I had mentally prepared myself for a relationship, one with a man, and then it turns out to be nothing more than a fantasy.

So, Reddit, how do I cope with this? Should I keep hoping that he does get that 'spark' or should I try to get over all of this? I feel like I will never find someone like him, someone who is so much like me and who I am so in love with.

Sorry for the messy post, I am such a bad writer and can't seem to make it whole.",09Aug2019,13

740,"I'm from the Netherlands and just recently moved to the other side of the country to study Biology. I've finished high school 1 year ago, and took a gap year working fulltime.

At first my dream was to study veterinary medicine, but after two failed attempts to get into this, I enrolled in biology. Next months the study officially starts and I'm getting huge doubts.

A part of me, is stuck in the mindset that I should just get over my feelings, and do this. But at the same time I already know, that I'm not 100% behind my own decision to actually start and finish this study. I don't even know for sure if I want to study at all, which makes me worried that I won't even make it through those 3 years bachelor. (So it isn't actually just about the subject I will study, but more about studying at all). Also I would be building up debt once I start, and if I don't finish it, it will only be more. Which, theoretically isn't a huge problem as it's not the biggest debt, and my parents told me they would always help me, but it feels just so wrong. 

I kind of just want to work fulltime, I always dreamed of just driving cars from place A to B, preferably even international. But this also just feels like a dumb dream, not really doable. (I'm 20 by the way) 

I would love to know what others think, as I don't know if not studying is a good decision and what I could do with just my high school diploma. I would probably need to do some kind of extra education to get some decent jobs right? Or is this just me going crazy because I moved out, and have to start making big changes?

741,"For anyone who would like a backstory, this is a post I made about my same friend “Betty” back when she started to date this new guy I’ll call Bill. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8h0y55/one_of_my_good_friends_bf_flirts_with_everyone_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

Basically two years ago she started hanging out with this guy and he flirted with my entire friend group and Betty just seemed ok with it. She has low self esteem and would do anything to be with this guy she’s in love with.

All has seemed okay with Bill and Betty for a while until they’ve gotten engaged over a month ago. A man who relentlessly flirted and tried to get all of my friends in our group to come “Netflix and chill” with him at some point popped the question to Betty. The flirting got calmer over the last year and we decided as a friend group to tell Betty about his behavior, basically to be told ""Oh well that's okay, that's how he is."" But anyways, the engagement has happened. He still has his flirtatious nature I guess. 


Except now I believe I’m starting to see major red flags (if not more) in their relationship especially with Betty’s character. She was always shy and meek girl but ever since she got with Bill she has become even more subservient. I've noticed these ever since they basically became an official couple, but we've reached the breaking point again. 

Literally Betty can’t make plans unless she tells Bill or makes sure he can’t come along. Every time she's hanging out with anyone in our friend group (we're a group of five adults all between ages 21-28), she's on her phone texting Bill incessantly ""updating"" him on where she's at. She seems to want to volunteer these updates at all times. If we're hanging out more than an hour, she asks if we can go over to her place to see Bill and hang out there. It was annoying at first but now I'm concerned. Betty does this with everyone. 

The other day, Betty was telling me about how she got in trouble for trying to leave work early .The reason? She ""needed"" to come see Bill before he had to leave for night shift. Night shift didn't start at 3 PM, his starts at 6! She supposedly just needed those extra couple hours to see him. I also went over late to her place around 10 PM that night, where for thirty minutes straight she had to Facetime him during his break and paid zero attention to me. Keep in mind, technically they have their own places, but Bill has decided to fully move in with Betty. He keeps his house in name only and I believe he's begun to rent it out to make money for the wedding.

Betty missed out on another close friend's wedding reception last year because she had to drive home and see Bill....before he went to work that night. Betty and I were bridesmaids in this wedding - and she literally skipped out the reception to see this stupid guy.

Now that me and the four other girls in our group are bridesmaids for Betty, she asked us to go to David's Bridal last weekend to shop for dresses. Guess who *had* to come? Freaking Bill...just standing around awkwardly watching us try to go through racks of dresses. 

Part of me suspects Betty - having never had a serious relationship - is just unable to control herself and feels the need to be up Bill's ass. The shadiness on his side is the constant flirting he used to do with *all* of Betty's friends. I don't want to come out and accuse someone of being a controlling partner without more proof but I'm honestly not sure if I even need any more at this point. Betty cannot do a single thing independently throughout her day anymore.

Again, the rest of our friend group came together in our group message sans Betty, super concerned. Our married friend - whose reception Betty missed - brought it up first like she brought up the last issue. They wanted to task me with confronting Betty again because Betty seems to...trust me the most. I've seen her through some pretty bad anxiety episodes and I think she feels a deeper connection with me. I don't know how to bring it up honestly. Last time when I had to bring up Bill's flirting, I at least had screenshots I was prepared to show her. This time, I don't know how to bring it up. 

I never want to throw the word ""abusive"" around, I know it's a delicate subject. It's just plain weird and shady. She's coming over to my house again tonight, I made it a point to ask for just her to come over. How do I approach this, or does it sound like I even need to?",09Aug2019,3
742,"I'm 36, male, pretty much straight, and living in central Wisconsin. After years of monogamous relationships that I look back on with varying degrees of fondness or frustration I'm kinda ready to be done trying to pursue them. They always start out well, but after a while I start to get bored, then I start feeling trapped and frustrated because I feel sort of obligated to keep going. Breaking up usually isn't pretty and I don't enjoy hurting someone's feelings over ending a relationship for no real substantive reason other than just not being interested in that relationship anymore. Makes me feel like a jerk since nobody forced me to commit  to it. I don't want to put myself or a partner through that again, so I'm looking at other options.

I'm not looking to become some random fuckboy wolf-whistling at anything with a pair of tits on the internet because A) that's creepy and sleazy, and B) that's fucking sleazy and creepy. I'd much prefer to have some companions that I know and get along with and also have sex with when we feel inclined to do so, not be tryna spit game at some females for a drunk one-nighter.

The problem is that on OkC and Tinder, a solid 90% of the dating pool in my area have profiles that boldly state NO HOOKUPS and generally feature language expressing a desire for long term monogamy. Which is fine, I can respect that. But it's not what I'm looking for. When I changed my profile to say that I'm seeking something casual, I went from getting matched with decent regularity down to pretty much nothing. No change in pics or bio, other than the addition  of the sentence saying I'm seeking casual relationships, in pretty close to those exact words. I travel a pretty wide area for work so when I get around the bigger cities I take a look and I can easily find lots of people looking for non traditional relationships. Not to say there aren't any people like that closer to me, just not nearly as many and often times they're male/female couples looking for a third and that's not really my bag either.

Outside of the dating apps, I created this new Reddit account to try to get active in the personals subreddits specifically for this sort of thing but I have the feeling that results will be just as underwhelming. Time will tell.

Naturally, I waited a few days just to see if my crush on him was genuine, and it was. So I confessed to him, and he said he also felt feelings for me. We started online dating.

Then, one day I tell him I love him, but he says he doesn't love me. I asked him if he didn't mean it, and he said he did. I went offline quickly and I went here, heartbroken. Can I get some advice on what to say to him?",09Aug2019,3
748,"I've been going to an annual camp for two years now and tomorrow, precisely in 7 hours, I'll take the bus for the third time.

For once we started to plan living arrangements ahead of the trip, but I feel like I got the short end of the stick. Everyone else is happy, some of them are going to live with a friend they haven't seen in a year and I love for them to be happy. Usually we have big rooms with up to ten people, but this time we got more and smaller rooms. She (I'll just call her Jasmin) and I will share a two bed room.

We have been in the same room the last two times and it hasn't exactly been pleasant then. She gave me an anonymous message, detailing how gross she thaught I was the first time, made fun of me and tortured me in the most despicable way imaginable to me, laud, crappy music. 

I'm very sensitive to sound and until I actually find someone and spend my whole live with them, no one will replace music as my one true love. I'm a very patient person, but after taking away anything that could keep that noise out, I threw my book at her. I had never before even thought of using a book as a weapon.

Last time she explicitly went to me to ask me to go into the other room so she wouldn't have to be in one with me... the other room was full, so guess who got to be Jasmin's bunk mate.

She took food out of our bags and ate it and tried to blame it on the other's, anything but admit that after her being alone in the room for hours and our food missing she had done it.

My parents don't want to hear me complain about her again, and if I'd do, they wouldn't let me go to that camp anymore. I want it to work, but I just don't know her in any other way than mean and bitchy. How should I approach this?

751,"Well as the title states, I have a new job offer.  The problem, it pays 1$ less an hour.  My current job offers part time hours at best ranging lately anywhere between 12 and 18 hours.  It does offer bi-yearly .50 cent raises however and is less than 3 miles from my house.  The new job however offers full time hours and a static schedule.

Pros:
Quarterly bonus
Static Schedule
Full time hours

Cons:
A few more minutes of commuting (around 8 minutes total)
1$ less an hour in pay
Raises are much smaller and less often

753,"My post is multi faceted, and there are a few bits regarding how to process it all, I will warn it is long! 

I am 25 years old, work a meaningful job and have many interests and passions. I  still a virgin and this is causes me a lot of anxiety.

To tackle the now: I am physically fit, am told I am pretty and attractive, have had plenty of opportunity (hookups are not really my thing so I haven't responded to this). What I would want is to have sex with whom I have connection, and with whom there is mutual respect and trust, and I do value monogamy. I have had quite a few guys ask me out, a few of whom I have pursued and a few with whom it has lasted longer.

I realise that anxiety is one of the biggest hinderances to forming lasting romantic  relationships, and have tried to work on this. I also have a lot of guilt and regret I know I am still working through. I will say however, I have come into myself a lot more in the last 2 years, and have more confidence, extroversion, sociability and openness. I have always tended to form close relationships, and value human connection a lot.

However, this hang up, shame and regret is really clinging internally, and I am having difficulty processing it healthily. I'll talk about the past and regret first.

I grew up in a Muslim household. I have over the years come to realise a lot about my upbringing and past mentality having opened my mind up to the world that I didn't realise at the time because I didn't have access to it. I have come to know the following: my parents have never loved each other and have an awful marriage, they have only stayed together for my psychologically struggling older sister. My mother is extremely imposing with her beliefs, we were basically screamed and threatened into a lot of our 'beliefs' as kids that revolved around shame, guilt, ostracisation. She has really toxic ideas about men, sex, relationships and has made life for my dad (who is a really good guy and I'm actually really close to now) a living hell. I grew up very embarrassed of myself and culture, it's taken me a long time to feel integrated-my dad is the only other person in the family who has integrated himself. Because of the unhealth with which I grew up, I really want to create a nurturing supportive family that has a lot of love, humour and acceptance. 

The first relationship I had was around 19/20, when I hadn't realised a lot of the above and had met a lot of people at university who were quite dogmatic in thought, and I was quite influenced by it. Despite our different cultures, we didn't stop talking. A lot of the friends I made then were other people that didn't drink, not people who had the same curiosity about the world. Anyway, he eventually said he wanted a relationship. I did too, but I was scared. I told my dad, he told me be careful. Eventually had to tell my mum (we didn't want it to be a secret), the ultimatums started. She started taunting me about whether I had told him I love him, met his parents, that he would cheat, that our race was viewed as inferior-she didn't stop and my anxiety levels escalated. I had never viewed myself as someone defined that much by culture, so all of this was a shock, and I didn't deal with it well, I emotionally shut down, and I couldn't talk to him openly. He had known about the sex thing at the time, and said he respected it. One day I was home, and my parents had put loads of pressure on me to end it, mum was shouting (he heard on the phone). He asked if the sex thing would change. I didn't say what I wish I had, and I wasn't thinking straight (that was the first time I started having panic episodes). I said it hadn't changed, he broke up with me. I wish I had said- 'I want to, I understand this is important, and I want to work through it together but unfortunately I am going to have to battle some stuff because of what I grew up with' . Anyway, I initially dealt with it realising some of the things he had said hadn't made me feel great, but ultimately I blame myself a lot, and haven't really learnt to forgive myself because I feel like if others knew they would find it so off putting. I understand that putting time limits on sex is not healthy for a relationship and that it is an important part of intimacy, I understand a lot more about being emotionally open, expressing myself honestly and in a level headed way. However, when I read something about putting limits on sex being bad for relationships or some of the unhealthy things I did, I feel such a pang of shame and guilt that feels awful and the regret resurfaces. Perhaps it is partly due to not being able to look back and say that was honourable character, but having to say, that was naive and short sighted, and being a poor partner. The other part is what I feel was lost, because I deeply valued that relationship and respected a lot of his character, I looked forward to the idea of building a life together as he had said, and I blame my lack of knowledge or understand of what sex means as the reason for that.

Anyway, by the time I had introspected and realised my mistakes, dealt with the aftermath with home and myself and learnt to view what I had grown up with through new eyes, within months he had moved on. I did apologise but not as specifically as I wanted to, and I didn't because I wanted to respect that was in a new relationship. There is some other stuff on his views, things he did which hurt other people, and views of race, gender, hierarchies that also took me ages to process and to admit that perhaps it wasn't the best match at the time- but the question right now is not about that but the shame, regret, anxiety and embarrasment I have about being a virgin at this age and the reasons why. 

I guess my question is how do I process that regret and shame in a healthy way- it is combined with the fear that having lost that has condemned me to never finding someone which will get harder with age, or becoming my own saboteur through being so hung up about what someone may think because of it. 

Because of this level of regret and shame, I am worried about the future. I don't like that this is part of what defines me, though I understand the level of regret had made me so much more empathetic to others needs and what it takes to be a good partner. I have, like all humans, so many other things about me- I love nature and a deep connection to it, I love exploring science and humanity to the point of seeing thr fabric of reality, I love dry dark and outright stupid humour and belly laughs, I love playing sports and exploring the outdoors, I love trying to find meaning, literature, people's stories, and music, I love learning and being around people- but I am scared that this one part of myself and my past that is so fundamental to relationships will be too much for someone to have to deal with. Through my introspection and exploration over the last few years, I understand that I don't want to drink (although an not bothered by it, and hang out with friends who do) this though may be a hindrance. Most people I know either don't realise I don't and sometimes when they are pushing for a drink it can feel awkward having to explain I don't (I try not to mention it unless I have to). Most don't care, but I can see why a lot of people would be uncomfortable with this. 

The question regarding the future is how do I a) find people, in this culture, who wouldn't have an issue with it b) process my anxieties about it c) develop belief and hope that even though I grew up in unhealthy ways I can make a connection with others to change that for myself and future generations

All of that + trying to find someone with mutual attraction + compatible personalities seems hard, and I can't help feel I have made a grave mistake early on that has changed my life trajectory and outcomes for the worst, though I try to see it as growth

I am no longer my prudish past self, but mainly explored sexuality through literature and discovered I have some kinks, though some are probably less healthy and come from trying to cope more than anything else. I am still receiving 
shouting lectures about marriage sex reputation etc, which does cause a lot of anxiety about my ability to withstand the pressure and not stay suffocated within it. I realise that boundaries with home are necessary and I do, though hard, try to stay away as much as I can, and my resolve and understanding is far greater than it was back then.

I have a lot of processing to do about a lot of things, and such, though I have liked people and met people with whom I have clicked (unfortunately a lot of them already had girlfriends-I am currently in a city with very few single people), I haven't found anyone I have had that level of comfort with that I can be this open with.

Any help with processing the regret shame and guilt I have towards the past relationship and feeling of loss, and anxieties about being a virgin and future relationships would be much appreciated

I understand a lot of people with have dealt with worse situations in better ways than I have and I am open to criticism, but please try not to veer down the path of insult

760,"Hi reddit, its my first time making a text like this, and i kinda ran out of ideas on who to ask for an advice. I'm 17M and have been dealing with heavy depression for the last 2 years, i feel the need to explain how it went down and how that affect my daily life.

So, since around I was 12-13 years old, I started experiencing bullying, for 2 years since neither my parents nor the school had taken it seriously, that caused a lot of trauma I'll explain later on. My mother and father are divorced since my birth. My dad, who I stopped contacting after I was 10 decided for the second time he needed a DNA test to prove I'm his son, because he wanted to get the terrain my mother uses to work on her recycling company to build a apartment (2 stories high) and he still did not believe I was his son, this happened when my mental health was already bad (2 years ago).

I've always been a person who cares about others, would almost never go over violence, and after it started going down I started having problem with rage, and other emotions all boiling inside my head and also the endless sadness, it made me try suicide twice by Xanax overdose, and then my mother finally understood it was serious, she is 56y/o. at the time I was at a really good private school since I got a 2 year full scholarship by being luckily selected among good students on public schools, but my 2nd year was lost because of those problems, I didnt lose the scholarship.

I've always tried my best on school, I want(ed) to study computer engineering on a abroad university (I'm from Brazil). Now, redoing my 2nd year i've started to struggle going to school, according to my psychologist and psychiatrist I've developed a social phobia, and some thing based on my low self-esteem. So basically I can't go to school because I always feel a horrid feeling someone is looking down at me, that I'm bothering someone, etc. My psychologist is trying to find a solution to it beside my medications, but its already half of the year and I lost 2 months of school.

And finally the advice I would like from the people here. I started feeling down and I'm thinking about giving up on school if I lose this year again, it's not because I'm tired of school, but because I can't. I feel like trash every time i think about it, I also feel I'm disappointing my mother who worked so hard alone for me to be where I am, but now I feel stuck on a loop, I really am out of ideas and can't think of a way out. Thanks for reading too, and if anyone has a advice I'll be glad to hear.",09Aug2019,1

762,"So in April I started going on dates with a guy from my work. Was going great in the start and he was very clear from the start that he didn’t want to rush into a relationship as he wasn’t long out of a previous relationship. Which I was totally great with, I don’t wanna rush into any relationship either.

Fast forward 2 months and he text me saying that he wanted to take a break from everything and focus on himself as he was struggling with his mental health. “I can’t expect to be someone’s priority if I’m not my own” is what he said. I was totally empathetic as I was there myself a year ago, and I was constantly calling Samaritans and considering ending it as I couldn’t handle it anymore. I still have my off days but I’m so much happier in myself now. Thanks to great friends and family!

Fast forward another month and he has said to multiple people at work that he doesn’t want anything romantic from anyone, he just wants to focus on himself and what he wants to do. So he has started going out drinking more and more, and doing drugs on this nights out. Only a week ago he was bragging about taking MDMA (otherwise known as ecstasy) at Brighton Pride. Which is a major turn off for me.

Earlier this week, I had placed a note in his bag saying that if he had feelings for me that he could ask for me for a date if he wanted to. If no feelings are there, that is fine and I would still be his friend and also saying how I proud I was of him to work on himself mentally and that I had been there myself and understand. Yesterday, he has told me to my face that he has started getting feelings for one of his friends down in London and is considering pursuing it more. As you can imagine that cut me a little, considering he has said that he wants nothing romantic at the moment.

I’m not a spiritual person AT ALL, but I had this weird epiphany about this guy and how wrong he was for me. Making snide comments about other’s appearances, constantly seeking attention from everyone he interacts with. And to top it all off, his manager’s brother recently died and has had 2 months off for grieving - he said “she’s had 2 months off, isn’t is she over it yet?” And “she isn’t doing anything. Can’t she leave and I have her job?”

Okay so it turns out my Dad's a narcissistic liar, controlling much like my mum and a bully. He's started an argument with me with my mum including yelling at me for no reason whatever demanding me not to have a Pullup bar in the house otherwise it'll cause damage and if I disagree then I'll get thrown out of the house. Even though the pullup bar is designed for doorways and holds up to 300Ib.  I weigh 160Ibs, near underweight and all I wanted to do was doing some stress free working out in my bedroom. My Dad said, 'If you keep on I won't buy you a MIDI keyboard' I raised my voice to him and told him the facts and said I don't need your bribes as a bargaining chip.   My Dad's being very aggressive toward me saying to me 'If you don't like it, go live somewhere else. No doing gym stuff in this house, send it back. You abide by the rules, or you'll get thrown out. You don't pay any rent shutup' My Dad continued to threaten to use the, if you don't shutup I'll force you to pay rent' manoeuvre on me.(edited)  


After being put under the impression that I was allowed to do something like that. Then being mislead and wasting money in the process. I do have a job, but I don't earn enough money, I don't pay rent and neither does my older brother, though he used to. I struggle to save up financially for things I need. I'm kinda comfortable with my position of employment at the moment since it's a stress free job and it doesn't involve interacting with anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't believe my parents have chosen the immature route, unable to listen to simple reason despite losing my temper in the process of being threatened. I want to feel safe in my home, I'm 20. I can't go outside to gym or anywhere in town since it's too dangerous and I'm avoiding very dangerous people as I suffered from traumatic event and want to recover mentally and I want to strengthen and improve my physique since it'll help me improve my overall mood and I won't need to count calories and starve myself anymore. My parents don't understand. They won't let me do anything.

I can't leave home since I can't afford to and have nowhere else to go, no real friends. I hate to have to do this, but I don't want to apply for a deadend job and be stuck forever, when I already have a small source of income and I enjoy the job mostly, compared to doing a job thats full time and being lumbered with bills constantly and never having a life outside of that. I don't wanna be like that, just trapped, trapped emotionally/mentally/physically. I can't do that.

My Dad and mum and brother unfortunately all are indifferent unsupportive assholes that unfortunately do not really care. They seem so quick to pre-judge that I'll apparently cause problems for them but reality is, I did nothing wrong. All I did was purchase an Iron Gym pullup bar, despite it having a manufacturing issue, I think I have no choice but to either save it, figure out a way to use it that doesn't require using a doorframe, something safe. Or I may unfortunately have to keep it, let it dust collect, or just inevitably may have to return it to the seller that I bought it from on EBay. It really pains me to do this. I feel like I'm not really welcomed by family, being the youngest sibling and all I feel that maybe that has something to do with that, a few past bad experiences where I did few things wrong, unintentionally. And, it's resulted in my parents babying me and making me feel ostricized. Either I get treated like a criminal or I get treated like a child. And I hate it. I don't think I'll be able to breakout of their dumbfounded mould that they percieve me as.

So as a result I'm not sure if I want to really live anymore, since finding jobs are extremely hard. It's 10x harder with no friends, no real people skills, no other skills that could be used in the working world other than the ones I obtained through doing BTEC media and performing arts as well as the singing and really that's about it.

Theres no hope for the future. I hate to say it but I'm starting to be convinced. Since my parents are the ones that are blocking my life path to a promising future. They probably wouldn't want me to go to University to do a rock/pop singing degree either or even a drama degree. Although I'm not really ready to do that, all I ever wanted was my freedom. Spent 7 years in so called school, feeling like I was imprisoned and indoctrinated by the education system, bullying and loneliness also went hand-in-hand.

I'm sorry. I'm not really too sure how I'm going to deal with this, and if I try those other options then I'm sure if I even want to consider living anymore. Everyone hates me, no one really likes me. I have zero real friends that care, I only speak to a few strangers on the internet and really thats about it.",09Aug2019,0
769,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety more than two years ago and I've been taking my meds since then. Four months ago my doctor decided that I was too young to be on meds all my life and that we should try to stop using them and try a psychological method.

It wasn't that bad at first, I supposed the meds we're still on my body or something but I wasn't feeling so bad. I met my psychiatrist and he was nice. He gave me an appointment with a nurse and I got some breathing lessons to control my anxiety, so far so good. But that was then, in a relatively calm part of my life. Some close friends lost family, my own family's been struggling financially and I've got to work in some places that I don't really like and just breathing exercises are not doing it for me and I can't see my psychologist until October.

So I've been buying things that I don't need to cope. Nothing that may hurt me. I don't drink, or smoke, or do drugs or bet. Mostly because I've always been afraid of starting because I know myself and I know I wouldn't be able to stop. But now I think I'm starting to feel what a smoker feel when they need a cigarette, and I just need to buy and waste money. First it wasn't that much but today's been almost 60€ and I'm afraid the next time it can be even more. And, as I said, we've been struggling and 60€ is a lot of money for groceries in my country.

That's it, mostly. What can I do? The fucking breathing exercises are breaking me, I have to put my hands on my chest and belly and I get even more anxious because I feel my heart pumping really hard. I've always loved reading but it doesn't help any more, my thoughts are louder than the words I'm reading. I need help but I don't have anyone else.

772,"Few info about us: We both are boys and students. I have finished my studies and am doing research. He is doing internship and has gone to the university twice in past 2 months. Rest of the time he just plays games in his Xbox. I really like that guy because he's funny and generous and wants to go out to explore. 

TLDR, He almost never cleans the kitchen and utensils until I or the landlord tells that the kitchen is dirty. How to tell him nicely to make him do it often. 


We share share the same kitchen. He kind of tries to clean it after cooking but does half assed work. He literally cleans the inside of the utensils or the top of the plate but doesn't clean the other half. And he tells me that it's enough to clean only one side of it.

He most of the time does not clean only the pans that we can cook with. And when I confront him that he is lazy and he didn't clean stuff, he gets back on me and trys to prove that he did and I forgot to do it last time.

Before he came, I was living alone in the house. The landlord never confronted me that I had to clean the kitchen. But after he came, this is the 3rd time that the landlord tells us to keep the kitchen clean. I have to keep pushing him every time to make him clean dishes. I'm not telling that I am perfect and keep things clean. If I have a busy week, sometimes I do the dishes later (dishes that we do not share)

Why are gamers like this? How do I tell him nicely to clean the kitchen and utensils often? I do not know how to tell nicely. Every time I tell, he tells me that I make him sad by telling the fact that he doesn't clean the kitchen.",09Aug2019,1
773,"My dog passed away this past Sunday. She was the best, and I grew up with this dog. She would run to my bus stop throughout middle and high school and walk home with me, and she was the only part I looked forward to when coming home from college classes. I loved that dog so much, and it still hurts when I walk around the house and see the spots she used to lay down. 

My father wants another dog, and he seems to want to get it soon. I don't really think my mother is ready for another dog, and I know that I'm 100% not ready for another dog, and I don't think I will be for a while. Our dog just had so much personality and loyalty, another dog just doesn't seem right. 

Add that to the fact that my parents can't afford another dog. They couldn't afford the dog that we had. They don't have the money to spend on an emergency vet visit, and they're very frugal with money. What I should say is that while they can afford a vet visit(and having to be cut costs for the next month or so), they'll delay it until it's absolutely necessary. 

On the other hand, I feel like an asshole for saying that ""I'm not ready for a dog"" when I'll probably be moving out in a little over a year. As much as I love dogs, it just wouldn't feel right and I think it would hurt even more to have another dog. I don't really know what to do.",09Aug2019,4

778,"Basically there's this guy I already know for like 8 years. We spent a lot of time together in our youth, while growing up. Our friendship didn't always consist of good times. Sometimes he was annoyed by me, sometimes I was annoyed by him and we didn't talk to eachother from time to time when we were younger. Yet he's the only guy I'd call my best friend. I can talk to him about anything, even deep emotional stuff, knowing he can not only listen to me, but also understand me quite well.

A few years back he moved to another town, and keeping in contact was difficult ever since. There were months where we didn't talk at all. And he built up a new peer group and has a gf in his new home town.

Two months ago I had a very difficult event to manage in my life. My depression hit me with a very hard down phase as result, and as I had nobody else to talk to, I decided to open up to my best friend with a few of my problems. Since then we had contact on a regular basis, skyped with each other, and talked about virtually everything. Yet I can't meet him, as he lives too far away. I'm heading off for stationary therapy in a few days, and I told him that I'd like to talk to him a bit more often as I don't really know when I'm able to contact him again while in therapy.

Enough backstory, now here's the problem: It is totally understandable for me that he doesn't always find time to talk to me. He has other friends, his gf that takes a lot of his time and he doesn't always want to sit infront of his computer skyping with me. We usually talk once a week, but as I don't really have much other social contacts where I'm able to reall talk about everything openly, for me it feels not enough.

I tried to ask him twice a week for a few hours of time where he could talk to me. And he doesn't like to accept or deny until the last minute. It hurts me when he writes me a short message that although he told me that we'd talk this evening, he had spontaneously made other plans with his friends. Or that he told me that we could talk and yet he forgot that he had plans for that day and so he had to stave me off again for which he is sorry.

I feel annoyed and angry by that, but I also feel that it's wrong to think that way. He doesn't belong to me, and I can fully understand that his and my social situation are the opposite, so he has a lot of friends and his gf, which are his ""RL friends"", yet I'm only one friend from the past hr talks to sometimes. So it's somehow understandable that I'm not as important as like his gf in his mind, and that talking to me once in a week would be really enough for him, although he genuinly enjoys talking to his best childhood friend as much as I do.

But I still feel that I somehow deserve some more of his attention. My situation is special, my depression isn't something that helps me just finding other social contacts, while on the other hand he is super extroverted. It hurts me, and I get the feeling that I annoy him, but as I said before, I also think that this way of thinking is irrational.

793,"TW: Mentions of suicide

My girlfriend has been friends with this one person since they were really young. They pretty much grew up together and were really close, but recently the friendship got really toxic. After a lot of convincing some mutual friends and I convinced her to cut her off. It was really hard, especially since they had been close friends for so long and the friend desperately didn’t want to lose this friendship, but I could tell that my girlfriend felt really good about it once she cut ties. 

One thing about this friend though, is that she has some serious mental health problems. Severe depression, anxiety, and other things as well. Now obviously there’s nothing wrong that, and that is not the reason why my girlfriend decided to stop being friends with her, but it’s caused some serious issues between them. One of the reasons why my girlfriend had such a hard time cutting ties with this person is because she was genuinely afraid that if she did, she would try to harm or kill herself. 

I didn’t talk to my girlfriend a lot over the summer since I was on a trip. When I talked to her for the first time after coming back, I learned that she was back to being friends with this person. I asked her why, and apparently the friend had messaged a mutual friend of ours saying that she was going to kill herself.  My girlfriend reached out to her asking if she was okay, and the friend blamed my girlfriend for her wanting and threatening to kill herself. One thing led to another, and basically, my girlfriend got guilted into becoming friends with her again. 

The thing is, my girlfriend is fully aware that this is a manipulation tactic. She knows that this friendship is a toxic one and that this friend is just a manipulative person in general. But she’s still genuinely afraid of her trying to harm or kill herself if she cuts ties from her again. No matter how much I try to convince her she refuses to cut her off. At this point I don’t know what to do. The longer she stays with this friend, the more draining it’s going to be on her mental health. I saw how happy she was the first time she broke off from her and it devastates me to see her roped back into this friendship like this. Even if no one can give me advice on this, it feels good just to get it off my chest. I’m worried about her.",09Aug2019,1

796,"Title is pretty self-explanatory. I'm a virgin at 23, and it's pretty much a constant background source of shame in my life. I won't bore you with the details, but I came pretty close to losing it twice, once at 20, and again at 22, but due to a combination of finding the circumstances dubious and cartoonishly bad luck, I didn't. I'm worried, because I feel like I'm past the ""acceptable"" age to be a virgin, and that I'll be seen as a loser, a creep and an irredeemably bad partner just for that going forward if I don't lose it (and lose it without paying someone; paying would just make me seem like a repulsive creep who had to buy my way out of it because no one would ever fuck me under ""normal"" circumstances).

Moreover, I worry that the pool is slim to none, that there just aren't enough people willing to help in a situation like this that I'd ever meet one, and that not telling someone and having sex with them would be traumatizing for them. My family is oddly sympathetic, but they all insist that I shouldn't worry and that ""the right person"" won't mind, which I can't agree with, especially when studies [like] (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2016.1144042?fbclid=IwAR0Sof-3gbU88kAohKz_DO20CdN-wk7VzsNQ4xM4keJZZH9vJQKYfDJsHNM&amp;scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&amp;journalCode=hjsr20) [these] (http://match.mediaroom.com/2013-02-05-Singles-in-America-Match-com-Releases-Third-Annual-Comprehensive-Study-on-the-Single-Population) exist. If anything, I'm sure ""the right person"" would run away screaming. The self-loathing from my feelings on the matter is out of control. A part of me wonders if there's something wrong with me that makes this the case.

See, that's the other thing. I don't think any of the ""normal"" reasons people are virgins at my age apply to me. I'm tall, handsome, extremely charismatic and personable, and pretty strongly against religion, especially if said religion demands a model of sexual morality. In a weird way, that makes it worse in my head. There's no reason for this, except bad luck and the fact that previous opportunities seemed unethical for case-specific reasons. Because of that, I hate myself for still being a virgin, and I feel like there's so much that would be set right in my head from not being one. And well, here we are.

I've tried a bit here and there. I use Tinder and Bumble, but the going is a bit slow at the moment, and it really seems like people are more after relationships, which due to the fact that I'll be moving around a lot over the next year, I'm not going to be able to hold that down at the moment. I go to bars, but I'm not so confident in the approach, so that's gone nowhere. I post on VirginityExchange from time to time, but it seems like women in my region are almost never seen, and on the rare occasion where one shows up, I always see the post a good 8 hours later, and someone else has always gotten there first. I know there is a kink that involves being someone's first, but I don't know what it's called and have no idea how I'd get involved with that kink. I've technically graduated from college, but I'm going back soon for one semester, in order to do a project for my alma mater's benefit. I'm not sure what avenue to take, and ultimately, I just need to get this monkey off my back, and I'm not sure how. Sorry for being so long-winded.",09Aug2019,2

 His letter consisted of the regular ""I think of you often, love you so much, wanna be the dad you need, be a better man, etc...."" the part I have an issue with-- the next page and a half, he wrote about his fights, how he got beat up so bad he almost lost his eye, had to have surgery, then he got jumped again, then he sucked punched someone else during lunch so now the gang is pissed at him for that and for disobeying them so he's gonna be fighting even more, he's been stabbed, he hopes he doesn't die and everyone is mad at him so he hopes the prison will send him somewhere else, and he's so lonely.

My response to him/this is what I need help with:

I appreciate your taking the time out to write CHILD. I wanted to inform you that I did not give this letter to him. I do not believe it'll be beneficial to CHILD, knowing about the current and upcoming violence you seek out. He was told about your injuries/medical needs back when it happened (it's been over a year since he needed facial reconstruction), but I believe some conversations need to happen face to face and perhaps this is one of them. 

I know you used your free inmate envelope on the letter to him, so I am enclosing an embossed envelope in return for when/if you write him again. Please bear in mind that it is not CHILD'S responsibility to worry about you, it's your job to worry about him. In future letters, i ask you to consider how he could feel or may interpret what you write. I'm not trying to control the conversation, but with everything going on in his life, I wouldn't like to add unnecessary stress and worry. 

I do hope you write him soon.

Does that sound good or do I need to change things? My son suffers from depression and anxiety, he's starting school in 5 days, taking classes at the high school and middle school (he's in 8th grade), so he's a bit heightened more than usual and if he starts ruminating on whether his dad will live or die, I believe he'll end up back in the hospital. His dad does know he was previously hospitalized (that was almost 4 years ago), but even then, his dad thought he did it to seek attention. (It wasn't attention seeking.

807,"So I (17M) have a friend (17F) who recently lost her little brother (12M) to cancer. Her little brothers cat was a tabby cat with white paws. Because my friend moved into her boyfriends house (21M), she could not look after her now-passed-away little brothers cat. Her boyfriend is allergic.

As a result, she asked me if I could look after him. I live in a council flat on a council estate, so it's very Soviet-style brutalist apartments. I said yes.

The boyfriend, being very kind and supportive, opted to buy me food, a litter tray, etc, etc, and helped me out. All was well. I was looking after him. However, he started to urinate and spray all over my flat. I couldn't accept this - I'm very sensitive to smells etc. Here is a post on /r/AmITheAsshole of me wondering if it would be wrong to give him back, [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c2ip61/wibta_for_giving_back_my_friends_cat_because_im/) 

I opted not to give him back, and train him instead to walk up and down the apartment complex, to get in and out the apartment. I did this successfully. Eventually, he was going out and coming back everyday. So I put a bowl of food and water just outside the front door, for him to eat when I'm asleep.

At this stage I'm only seeing him every few days, because he eats the food and water when I'm not looking or not there. As a result, I just continue topping up the food and water, knowing he's well and knows his way home.

At some stage, he shakes off his collar (which had my phone no. on it) and I think nothing of it. Sometimes cats do that. I had one before that did!

At this time, my neighbour below gets kicked out. They were a family of about 6, and had about 4-5 cats. When leaving, they abandoned their cats. This means their cats became quite rugged and scratched, and often injured, getting into fights etc. 

I wrote, on my notepad, at my desk, 'Injured cat annoying me outside'. I tend to jot things down a lot. Keep this in mind for later. 

Yesterday, Socks (the cat I'm caring for) came home, looking injured, and limping quite heavily. My first thought was - he's gotten into a fight with the cats downstairs.

I decided not to notify my friend &amp; original owner immediately as I thought, sometimes these things happen; I'll let him rest for a day and see what happens.

This morning he was still very much very in pain and injured, so I called my friend. I explained to her the situation and she rushed over to take him to the vets. She said the vets was closed, went out and bought some medical supplies such as bandages and anti-septic etc, and came back to my apartment to drop him off. We treat him, comfort him, etc, and he hides behind the couch. OK, I go to get him - he scratches me! Ouch. So she comes over to pick him up and he allows it. I think nothing of it. 

My friend and her boyfriend stay for several hours, chatting, before they finally get up to go. Getting up, they walk into my office, and see a note: 'Injured cat annoying me outside'. So, they immediately assume the worst.

And I understand why: it does look suspect. His collar was gone, he bit me when I went to grab him, and now they find a note seemingly that indicates I was annoyed by him being injured, and outside. It doesn't look brilliant.

But I genuinely never laid a hand on him, abandoned him, took off his collar, or meant that note for him. I'm almost tempted to laugh because the situation developed is so remarkably strange and somewhat silly. But the point remains: my friend still believes I abused her cat. I never did. 

She immediately said 'You've abused him!' and grabbed Socks, the cat, and her boyfriend, and left my apartment. I wasn't about to argue with her, so I just said, OK, I didn't do anything bad, but if that's your decision, you're the owner and that's fair enough.

She leaves, gets in her car with her boyfriend, and drives off. I think it's pretty silly at this stage, but yeah.

I text her over Snapchat to clarify that, obviously, I would never abuse her deceased little brothers cat, never abandon him, etc, and that the note was not meant for him and it's pretty hilarious that this has happened all at the same time. She doesn't buy it, obviously, and tells me she'd rather rehome him where she can guarantee he's safe. To me, that's fair enough. Although I never did anything wrong, I sympathise with her, understand her worries, and genuinely do think she's making the right choice; she has to prioritise her animals welfare and safety and I get that. So I don't argue.

I ask if she wants her boyfriend to come over to pick up the food and toys etc, and he drives over to pick it up, I give it to him, he says he's not getting involved, and that's it. She drives off.

I no longer have a cat.

I'm wondering how I can explain or rationalise this at all. It's pretty hilarious how this has unfolded but actually it's serious too: if she accuses me of animal abuse, that's a lot of hassle I don't want to have to deal with.

811,"Hi everyone,
I want to make this as short as possible because I’m quite disturbed by this. Last year I was going through my clean underwear and found a cum stain on the outside (ive never had sex with a guy but I’m 99% sure that’s what it is, basically like whitish dried snot). I mentioned the stain to my mom and she said it was probably white residue from the washing machine. At the time I brushed it off but now I’m unsure. I definitely know what it was and I also took a picture to be sure to remember it correctly. The underwear had already been washed after I had worn it because there was no discharge on the inside. So the stain happened after it had been washed. After the wash my mom puts it in a basket to either take it outside or inside to dry, and then folds+ puts it in our closet. I have anxiety so with situations like this I have no idea whether I’m overreacting with or not. Also I live with my mom, dad and brother. It really pains me to think about this and it seems like such a small thing, but when I really think about it I can not think of any logical explanation of how it got there. Please any input, thanks",09Aug2019,1

813," Yesterday I had my 4 year old black German Shepherd put down. Now, since he was a puppy, he was always the protective type. Due to my living situation, i had asked my older brother to watch after him for a month while i was working out living arrangements. This wasn't really a problem for my brother then since he loved the dog. His wife, decided it was a good idea to go get another male shepherd since she supposedly thought my dog was ""lonely"". Anyone with common sense knows mixing two male dogs from different litters is not a good idea. My dog was very well behaved and wouldn't hurt anyone or anything unless he truly felt they were a threat. This is important for later. When my brothers wife brought home another dog, he always had his guard up. She would always cage my dog up, never discipline hers and would let him get away with anything. Due to this, my dog developed an anxiety issue. I was never informed on anything that was going on, was never allowed to go visit because they were ""busy"". The other night, i got a phone call from my brother saying my dog attacked someone and police were called. When i arrived, it became clear to me what had occurred. My brothers wife had brought someone over while my brother was at work (she was cheating) , and my dog realizing that it was stranger danger, bit down on the guys leg in what he was assuming was ""protecting"" my brothers wife. Police were called and the guy demanded that either my brother was arrested for holding a dangerous dog, or the dog was put down. You can guess what happened next and it kills me even writing it.

That is the last straw. She stopped texting for almost a month and she finally texted back. I asked her if she wanted to hang and she said yes. I am ALWAYS the one making plans so i asked her what day would be preferred, she said idk. My mom always has to contact her mom ( I am 15 F). I asked her what she wanted to do, she told me to pick even though she suggested games. I don't want to let her use my brother's games ( he probably wouldn't like that anyways) because she gets so absorbed in something, she forgets she is even in my home and ignores me for a while! I let her use my mom's piano, which I wasn't supposed to, she refused to get off the piano. I got work done while she was busy. We were supposed to play something else together and she forgot. She harshly put my old xbox ( not actually mine) remote on the ground and didn't clean up her food. I know she is the guest, but it was rude of her to expect me to clean her food crumbs. Is the guest supposed to make the bed ? Plz comment about that. I don't really have people sleepover but she leaves the bed as a mess. She has been going to my place for a while so I expect her to at least keep the bed tidy. Or to not make me take her dish or run around finding her food. Unrelated, I am half asian ( more asian than european), I am expected to have a tidy room and good work ethic. Her mom is not like that, my friend does not know how to make a bed or such, not expected to clean up. Basically babied around. Both of us have very different families, I spend my time looking for work typically, she does not have to find a summer job. I started at 14, no luck this year. The fact that she has a care.free mom does not give her an excuse to clean up after her. Its pure laziness. About fussy eating, it can be annoying feeding her. Picky as hell. Hates a basic walk. REFUSES TO WAKE UP AT A SLEEPOVER! ( hey, ya mind commenting about whether or not you should sleep in at a sleepover? She sleeps till afternoon while I am cleaning her belongings and making food. Refuses to wake up. She plays music at night which disrupts my sleeping. I expect her to wake up because its a damn hangout, no later than 9. Its not like we stay up the entire night). I am not to judge one's parenting, but its either you eat what you are given, no requests, or you dont eat at all. Am i being unreasonable? I have never gotten pissy at my friend.

817,"I had a person at work that i really got along with. We are both grown adults.

 I thought we were close, we talked a lot about life, good shit and bad. Health issues and life events. We even got each other's dogs Christmas gifts. I cared a lot for her as a person not just a co-worker. We had in jokes and a great vibe. We'd been friend for about 2 years.

A couple months ago her whole persona changed. She stopped responding to me in the same way as we have always communicated. She'd blow up in anger or rage cry for seemingly no reason. Or simply stare through me when i speak to her, and walk away silently. 

All of a sudden I'm the worst piece of crap. She hates my guts. Tries to get me in trouble with our DM, but won't specify what I should be in trouble for.
We never had a fight, never had a disagreement. I literally don't know what went wrong.
I tried flat out asking if i did anything wrong and explained that I care if she's alright. I got silence and she walked out on her shift.
She wouldn't tell me. She won't tell anyone else. She only told other people that talking to me about it was out of the question. 

I have wracked my brain way too much trying to figure it out. I'm already the type of person that will replay conversations in me head and criticize myself pretty harshly about saying something stupidly.

Before all of this she started to hate the type of work we do and has been looking for other jobs for a few months, and before she started acting like a dickhead child I wrote a really awesome letter of recommendation. Actively encouraged her to do what she needs to be happy, and tried to help any way she needed. And didn't demote her or kick her out even though her attitude and performance seriously degraded. As a company we always err on the side of compassion. Even when her attitude started to make it harder for everyoe else to work.

Today was her last day and she only stayed an hour of her shift before she just took off.
It's going to bother me for a long time that I will never know what i said or did, and that i stayed silent because I didn't feel like it would matter if i said goodbye and that i truly wish her well.

I'm so angry and if I'm being honest, really hurt.

822,"Backstory: My boyfriend and I have been living in this duplex for almost 5 years. We have a shit landlord, but the rent is INSANELY cheap for the location so it's worth it. We pay our rent online and literally never see him. He doesn't care about maintaining the place, so we make our own repairs.

Present day: 3 people knocked on our door and when my boyfriend answered a man tried to push past him claiming to be insurance agents checking out the place for the landlord. A man and a woman are behind him, both dressed like they are going on a safari. I let them know that I was not made aware of any visitors and they would have to come back tomorrow. They started to walk away, but I then asked what insurance agency they worked for and they all stammered and gave me guilty looks until the lady admitted she wasn't really an insurance agent.  I asked if they were there looking to buy the place and she said yes. She admitted that she was a real estate agent and just met my landlord yesterday, she said she was told to go along with the insurance story.

823,"For some context I’m in the later years high school so it might just be my stupid “teen drama” making me feel this way. I’m pretty happy for a teenager but my parents moving me to around 14 different schools with my diagnosed Asperger’s syndrome didn’t help with my social life. Overall I did pretty well, gaining at least some friends in my current school which I’ve been attending for nearly 3 years now (my current record). I’m pretty well known in the school although I wouldn’t see myself as popular. I’m generally known for just attending loads of school activities like being prime minister of the school if you can believe that. I’ve never really felt a deep bond with anyone since I naturally learnt it was better to stay away from relationships as to reduce emotional damage from my inevitable move to a different town or country even.

Anyway...
So around December of this year I started to hang around these two girls, Kat and Laura (fake names). We always had a kind of mutual respect for each other as they had a similar “not give a fuck” edgy humour but we only shared small jokes before that time, nothing worth being considered a conversation. We didn’t really have many lessons together except literature class which when we had the chance Kat chose to sit next to me with Laura sitting on the table in front of us. I did initially have a thing for Kat but it was never my priority for having a friendship with her and Laura, which didn’t really matter in the end since I shortly found out she had a boyfriend.
Kat and I would talk about just random stuff in class everyday, which made literature my favourite class even though I had been losing any and all attention for the class, unusual of me since I would normally be the “teachers pet” like the Eugene from Grease. Time goes by and it progressively gets better with Kat, making me love school again and just waiting for that class again. 
It was like a friendly love even though weren’t even that close, leaving our relationship to only that single class and us spotting each other down the hall.
My other guy friends were a bit anti social all being pretty immature, and I say that trying not to get bitch slapped onto the face of r/iamverysmart. I never really spent time with them outside of school because I felt it didn’t and wouldn’t give me anything of worth. Admittedly, I was a bit of an asshole to my friends throughout my story.

After a while I invited Kat out for lunch via an overly long text, as friends obviously. I never really invited anyone to anything, never having any kind of celebration like a birthday party or something. This gave me no indication whether it was normal I do this and I was honestly just taking a gamble. The next day she sent me a text saying she was sorry she didn’t see it but she couldn’t see me most days because she was at work or with other friends. With my lack of proper judgement I thought I made a wrong move and stepped completely out of my boundaries. A few days later I sent a text that could be compared to an essay. I basically broke down and told her how I had never had a friend that I actually liked and all I wanted to do was spend time with someone, anyone. It was an incredibly dickhole move of me to do that but I was on the verge of emotional collapse and it was just unfortunate that Kat was the one dealing with it. She responded saying she was sorry again for not being able to do stuff outside of school and that she was terrible when it comes to emotional advice and stuff like that. 

It remained weird for around a week but soon recovered and was like nothing had happened. Later on I asked Laura out for lunch in a much shorter more socially acceptable way. She actually agreed and we set a date on the same week. I could not begin to describe how exhilarating this felt. For the first time in ever I would get to talk with someone about something other than horse shit. I wanted and needed this and it calmed me down knowing that lunch wasn’t such an out of reach proposal after all. I had taken my best outfit and left them clean for the following days and took out my dusty aftershave which my dad got me ages ago and I never wore because I would never have any special occasion. On the day Laura said she had to cancel and move to the next day which I handled pretty well. The next day I texted her asking where we should meet.
No response
An hour and a half later I text again asking if lunch is still okay.
Another two and a half hours go by and I’m still waiting by the door in my outfit.
It’s 4:00pm
Still no response.
At this point I might as well have dinner. When we get back to school she says nothing, nothing to indicate anything out of the ordinary. To be fair, I never asked out of shame. I overhear her speaking to Kat about how her phone went all glitchy or something like that. I text her later down the week asking if this was still her number. She replied later saying how she was sorry that she didn’t come and explaining that her phone broke. I say it’s “no problem” (bull shit btw). I had been let down so many times and this was what I thought would be my redemption, my “rescue” from loneliness as a 16th century writer would put it. I wasn’t angry with Kat or Laura because I don’t expect much from people and someone doing something like this would be typical. I thought it was normal. Months go by and we’re still friends at school, much better actually, Kat starts to become more comfortable and affectionate which is what I would want in a friend, not someone held down by there own insecurities. I decide again that I shouldn’t have to keep our friendship constrained to one hour in class. So I decided to invite her to lunch again, she’s in another town, again, she’s going away with her boyfriend, again, again, again. I do the same with Laura and ask her out to lunch. Doesn’t respond. Again. Doesn’t respond. I ask once every month to see if I can get some kind of progress.
Nothing.

This really hurt me as overdramatised as that sounds. I’ve never had a true friend before and I hoped this was my one way ticket out of my shitty friend group.

I know I sound like a super emo edgy teen  like one of those people who cut themselves for attention or something, but in late June I had planned to drown myself in a nearby lake. I was standing on the side of the lake when I had one last ditch effort. I called Laura.
It went straight to voicemail. I tried again and nothing.
I thought if I was meant to be alive then maybe I would get that lunch or maybe just be able to talk with my friend on the phone. Thank bajeebus because someone shitty kids set a line of dry hay on fire which I went over with a few other people nearby to move the hay so it wouldn’t spread. The fire brigade go there around 20 minutes after the fire was actually out. We joked about how poorly our government was funded and that got me to raise at least a portion of my spirits. In the end, my life wasn’t saved by some grand ending of me getting that lunch but just me having some banter with a few strangers about our shitty country.
I know nothing that happened or didn’t happen wasn’t the fault of Kat or Laura and that it was just incredibly bad timing but I just wanted someone to rely on. I just wanted an actual friend. But I couldn’t help but feel angry at anything, whether it be Laura and Kat or myself for being so immature just anything.

829,"This entire post might be confusing and switch topics pretty quickly, honestly it's probably not even that serious, but sometimes I just have thoughts that make everything else feel insignificant. 

One example is what comes after death, to me it seems like everything we do in our lives, whether you're a good person or a bad person, rich or poor, beautiful or ugly, just doesn't matter because eventually everyone dies, our consciousness just stops and every single thing we've experienced holds no more value. You could say that it matters to other people but one, they also die, and two, you're consciousness is the only consciousness you experience. That may sound selfish but it doesn't matter because nothing matters once you're dead. My family is religious, but to me, religion just seems like something people use to trick themselves into believing in ""eternal life"" or being good people, then again, ""good"" is relative. Something may be good for one person but another person may just not care at all.

Feelings are another thing, they may hold some significance to you right now, but as soon as someone starts questioning them it all just gets narrowed down to things going on in your brain. Sadness, happiness and pain start to matter less when you realize that they're relative. The only reason they matter so much to some people is because of the mindset they hold.

There's also the scale of the universe, and how long time has been progressing. Time is infinite and will keep on going for eternity, the consciousness of living things progresses only with time, so maybe it's just us perceiving it as infinite, but it still just feels like life doesn't really matter because when you die, time will keep progressing for others, but it won't for you. The scale of the universe is infinite too, again it may just be the perception of humanity that it is infinite but that's just because we haven't experienced nothingness before, if the universe had an end to it, what would a human who was past the edge experience, nothing?

836,"Some background information; in 2015 I went for an mri scan because my tinnitus (from loud music) was getting worse, these scans revealed I had very very small benign growth in my brain, the neurologist didn’t say what it was but he did say it’s something that occurs from birth when like a flap of skin sort of folds over on itself? Anyway, fast forward to 2017, had another scan but never heard the results back from it so I assumed it was fine (like you do, “no news is good news”) but then I had a seizure a few weeks ago, rushed to hospital etc took bloods and all the tests, kept me in over night then sent me home the next day. They said it’s cause was most likely the heat, and my sugar levels dropping (I’m type 1 diabetic) at the time it seemed likely. A few days after I went to my GP because I was in a lot of body pain from the seizure and I just wanted to make sure it was just that and nothing else (it was, I’m fine now) whilst I was there I asked him if he could bring up my notes and look for the 2017 mri scan results because I hadn’t heard anything, he flicked them up on the screen and we were both shocked. The scan/doctors notes revealed that the mass had grown a bit in size and they were now calling it a “cyst” (it had some special word before it but I can’t remember that) and that it was located in my meckels cave. We then concluded that my seizure, my daily headaches which aren’t that bad but I never used to get them, my not great vision and slight random lightheadedness could all really be caused by this little shit of a cyst. I’m still upset and angry, that they decided not to tell me this in 2017, I don’t know what to really do, I’ve searched everything about growths in the meckels cave and I’ve found absolutely nothing. Completely nothing. I’m terrified about brain surgery too. We did phone back the neurologist and I now have an appointment with the team next month.

838,"Throwaway just in case. I have been in my current job for about 3 months now. I had a little voice inside my head saying “don’t take it” after my 2nd interview, but I hadn’t been getting much response from previous applications &amp; interviews so I went for it. 

At first it was okay, I was just excited to be working again after being laid off unexpectedly and searching for a few months. I had a small amount of training/shadowing and then basically was thrown into the fire. From the outside, it probably looks like I’m doing great and am successful and collected. But inside, I am struggling HARD. When I get up in the morning, I’m actually sick to my stomach. It has taken over every aspect of my life, as in I’ll always been thinking about mistakes I’ve made or stuff I still have to do that’s just piling up. I work with some awesome people but management is harsh and also have poor communication between themselves (I receive conflicting information a lot). I am of course looking for a new job now as much as time allows. However, I feel like I won’t be able to go on interviews because I’m always at work. Besides that, I’m just so unhappy. I’ve never felt like this in a job before. Oh, and from what I’ve heard 2 weeks notice is not a thing; if you say you’re leaving you leave that day.

So my question to you is, should I quit now and focus all my energy on the job search? Should I attempt to get another job while keeping this one? I’m mentally checked out already, and I feel like a failure for it. But I know it’s bad for my health to be so stressed I can’t eat a banana before work. Any and all advice would be much appreciated.",09Aug2019,1
839,"My roommate and I have been living together for just over a month now and will be getting our first electric bill soon.

I at first expected to just split all things 50/50. (Rent, internet, electric). But now I am unsure if that seems fair.

He moved in before I did and chose the larger bedroom with a window AC in it. He never asked about it and I never said anything about how I believe he has more living space so should be paying more rent. I don't have that much stuff anyways so I didn't mind that he took it too much.

But since we have both been here, he uses the AC in his room constantly and when he does venture out of his room to make food he will then turn the one on in the living room. It being a communal space this doesn't bother me as much, even though I have never used it (in fear of our bills being to high).

I am wondering if it makes sense for me to ask him to pay a higher percentage of the monthly electric bill due to the fact that he uses the AC unit in his room, which I get 0 use of.",09Aug2019,1
840,"So basically there's this guy I already know for like 8 years. We spent a lot of time together in our youth, while growing up. Our friendship didn't always consist of good times. Sometimes he was annoyed by me, sometimes I was annoyed by him and we didn't talk to eachother from time to time when we were younger. Yet he's the only guy I'd call my best friend. I can talk to him about anything, even deep emotional stuff, knowing he can not only listen to me, but also understand me quite well.

A few years back he moved to another town, and keeping in contact was difficult ever since. There were months where we didn't talk at all. And he built up a new peer group and has a gf in his new home town.

Two months ago I had a very difficult event to manage in my life. My depression hit me with a very hard down phase as result, and as I had nobody else to talk to, I decided to open up to my best friend with a few of my problems. Since then we had contact on a regular basis, skyped with each other, and talked about virtually everything. Yet I can't meet him, as he lives too far away. I'm heading off for stationary therapy in a few days, and I told him that I'd like to talk to him a bit more often as I don't really know when I'm able to contact him again while in therapy.

Enough backstory, now here's the problem: It is totally understandable for me that he doesn't always find time to talk to me. He has other friends, his gf that takes a lot of his time and he doesn't always want to sit infront of his computer skyping with me. We usually talk once a week, but as I don't really have much other social contacts where I'm able to reall talk about everything openly, for me it feels not enough.

I tried to ask him twice a week for a few hours of time where he could talk to me. And he doesn't like to accept or deny until the last minute. It hurts me when he writes me a short message that although he told me that we'd talk this evening, he had spontaneously made other plans with his friends. Or that he told me that we could talk and yet he forgot that he had plans for that day and so he had to stave me off again for which he is sorry.

I feel annoyed and angry by that, but I also feel that it's wrong to think that way. He doesn't belong to me, and I can fully understand that his and my social situation are the opposite, so he has a lot of friends and his gf, which are his ""RL friends"", yet I'm only one friend from the past hr talks to sometimes. So it's somehow understandable that I'm not as important as like his gf in his mind, and that talking to me once in a week would be really enough for him, although he genuinly enjoys talking to his best childhood friend as much as I do.

But I still feel that I somehow deserve some more of his attention. My situation is special, my depression isn't something that helps me just finding other social contacts, while on the other hand he is super extroverted. It hurts me, and I get the feeling that I annoy him, but as I said before, I also think that this way of thinking is irrational.

What do you guys think of my situation?",09Aug2019,1

843,"So I made a post asking why my ex texted me asking for his jacket. It was sus. Turns out my gut feeling was right.  

He just wants sex. I am 18 and this is my first heartbreak.

The breakup was mutual. I asked him what he’s done since we broke up and he said he has only kissed a girl and gave me her exact name. She was in my grade in HS. I cried about it even though I’ve slept with another guy since and told him that when he asked too. He didn’t seem to react and instantly said “eh I don’t care”. I don’t understand how he doesn’t care and moved on so fast. This hurts.  I don’t really know what my question is. I just need advice it’s been a hard day. Thanks.",09Aug2019,1

845,"Hi, 

I had a job interview at McDonald’s a few months ago and this girl ( 19-20yo?) was partnered with me for my little trial run and I must have impressed her because I got the job. But I didn’t last long because the managers were not supportive so I left due to anxiety. 

But every interaction I had with her was great and I felt she liked me back and she always smiled from across the room at me etc, she’s the only thing I miss from awful McDonald’s. 

A few months later I now have a fantastic job at a cinema and the managers are amazing and I’m finally happy with a job and content with life. I’ve recently found the girl from McDonald’s on Instagram, and I even found her on Tinder (I used the app when I was bored for a laugh, never added pics or anything) so she appears to be single. 

What can I do to contact her without looking like a stalker with creepy intentions? Especially after I left McDonald’s without her knowing anything about my situation, and I assume she could be creeped out that I found her insta?

I’ve never had a girlfriend or dated so I don’t know what to do or how to start a convo with her without it coming across weird. 
I thinking something along the lines of ‘hey this is ___, remember me? I just got a new job and was wondering if you’d like to go watch a movie with me as I get free tickets!’ ?

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

849,"Alright, made a new acc for these kind of  questions. Hope I'm at the right subreddit.

Some weekends I'm with a big group of people (we're like 15-20) and I know everyone more or less. There's one girl that I've known for some years but we have never had a real conversation or a connection.

Some weeks ago I started to get feelings for her. I hope I'm not desperate for writing this here but I would be really glad to get some real help for me.

How do I show her that I'm interested, some ""mild"" flirting? And how can I tell if she is interested?",09Aug2019,2

Maybe they know something I don't."" I'll even start looking for things that might confirm what they said.",09Aug2019,1
851,"I've given the two main people in this situation identifiers to make it easy to follow.

""Father"" who turned out to be grandfather (A)

""Step brother"" that turned out to be biological father (B)

I (M27) learned a couple months ago that the man I had considered to be my father (A) was actually my grandfather and his son (B) was my biological father. 

(A) died when I was about 11 years old and that sucked. Got a step father but we've all but killed each other over the years.  I accepted that (A) had died and I would grow up without the ""Male"" figure in my life (I still resent that).

(B) had reached out a couple times but under the guise as my step brother and I he lives very far away so it's not like I can see him whenever I want to. Talking to him was never easier either as I guess we are very different (But perhaps not as different as I had thought) and since he was my distant step brother it wasn't really worth the try.

About a couple months ago I get a call and basically learn that (A) was sterile but my mother really wanted a kid so he got (B) to be a sperm donor. 

Still not sure how to feel about it. I feel a bit cheated and angry that he lived on assuming I would be fine and only finally told me when i'm at the age it's not as important/meaningful in my life.

After watching many shows my love for acting is way bigger and my dream of being an actor is in my head all the time unlike before when it was just like whatever if i become an actor then good but i didn't think about it a lot back then. Im seeing those teens that have already achieved their dreams , they have my dream work which is acting, have money, fame, everything, and im here watching them knowing i wont become anything. The problem is,i live in the middle of nowhere, i have never seen any big acting star or big celebrity in general from my country. 90% people here end up with bang average jobs that will only give you a salary enough to cover the bills and main expenses. I dont wanna be like that, i want to achieve my dream but it's hard when you live here, there is still shows and movies here , but they are not that good at all and im not gonna get recognized because no one ever got recognized here. Im still a teenager, i have no motivation at all , i am not excited to become an adult because im gonna study in college for 4 years then just try hard to find a job that will pay me just enough to cover all the expenses and have nothing left by the end of the month.

He doesn't read the room or ever think, 'I'm right but it wouldn't be appropriate for me to say so right now, especially in a strong way that's going to make the people I'm saying are wrong dislike me.' He has a friend that's stopped interacting with him recently and he's really upset about it. I know it's because of this and he's just so unaware. We've talked about how he's abrasive before and he says he's working on it (it's caused problems for him outside of our friendship too, which is why we were talking about it) but it's like he's blind to the fact that he can be so terrible rude sometimes and rub people the wrong way, come across as insanely critical and entitled, exc. He hasn't gotten the extent of it every time I've tried to gently bring it up.

He's also very sensitive and I'm worried talking about this bluntly (like I never have before) could send him off the edge but it's negatively impacting a lot of areas of his life and I just don't know if I should say something or not.

865,"I apologize in advance for the long post, but I feel this situation needs a little backstory: I own a small machine shop, and I have a long time customer who slowly became a good friend, who has within the last year been diagnosed with a terminal illness. We have known each other for about a decade, trade beers, fishing tips, motorcyle parts, and hang out once in a blue moon to get a drink. We do not have what I would call a very diverse friendship, he usually comes by the shop once or twice a month around closing and hangs out to shoot the shit for a few hours. He is a single guy about 15 years older than me, with no wife and kids.  
  
A month or two ago he asked me if I was interested in a very high end fly fishing pole he has, and I said sure, bring it by some time and Ill make you an offer. I came in one morning and this $1500 rod was just leaning up against my front door. He came in a few weeks ago and just dropped off a box without saying a word, and it was a brand new $700 leather coat and a $400 pair of boots. I saw him this week, and he asked me if I wanted to just take one of his motorcycles, so it doesn't sit around and rot. For reference this is an almost $20k bike. I told him he we could have dinner sometime and talk about it, and that I would be happy to ride the bikes so they don't deteriorate, but I didn't want him to just ""give"" it to me. He brushed off the offer non-chalantly and said ""just come over sometime with a helmet, Ill have the title ready"".   
  
I am very uncomfortable with all of this, and I just cant wrap my head around how I should feel and how I should handle the situation. It is very obvious he thinks he is dying soon, and that he is very depressed about it. While I feel very sorry for him, and very sad that there is no viable treatment for his illness, I also feel bad about myself for accepting gifts from him. I know he has few friends and no family to give things to, and I know you cant take possessions with you when you die, but I also know that there is a possibility he could live for years and actually use this stuff, or at least sell some of it to pay medical expenses. I also grew up very poor, and work my ass off to be at borderline of the middle class. I would never buy myself a $1500 fishing rod or a $700 dollar riding jacket, and I feel guilty even having them when I know that I need work on my car, a new hot water heater, etc.   
  
Am I crazy for letting this get to me and weigh on my conscience? Has anyone been in a similar situation and have any advice? I don't even know what to say to the guy other than thanking him profusely over and over again, but a part of me wants to turn down his offers so that I don't feel like I am taking advantage of him. I see that he gets joy from giving me gifts, and I know that he made alot of money in his life, but that doesn't change the pit in my stomach I get when I think about it. Any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated, I have worked myself into a corner of anxiety with this one and am not sure how to proceed.",09Aug2019,1

I (24F) could write a book on the tumultuous relationship I had with this guy (24M), but in short, it was 3 years long and extremely unhealthy.
