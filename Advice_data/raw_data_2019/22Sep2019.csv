0,"I (21F) am just a college student looking for a nice Halloween costume/cosplay. I love Avatar Kyoshi and think she's pretty neat. However, her design, while explained separately from any particular culture in the books, is modeled after real-life Japanese Geisha. Is there a way to do this without offending someone? Would this be offensive? I am assuming this will matter: I am a white female.",22Sep2019,13
1,"Hi, I lived with my landlord and three other roommates (including his girlfriend). I thought it was a good situation and we were all friends. Very unexpectedly my landlord texted me telling me to leave, no warning, no face to face discussion... Nothing. His reasons were that he enjoyed living with me an my dog and that I was a nice person but I was 'too stressful to live with'... Which was confusing. I was blindsided and devestated by this and while I was busting my ass moving a my stuff into storage (because there's no way I could find a place with my dog in that timeframe) I just ignored everybody in the house. I just couldn't talk without breaking down and was feeling very depressed and had a lot to deal with moving everything. I did it though, got all my stuff Into storage and fixed the holes in the walls from hanging things (I had permission to hang things), cleaned up and even left everyone a nice note, chocolate, and a bottle of whiskey. Nobody reached out to me, asked if I was ok, or made any effort to help. I feel like I've lost a bunch of friends as well as my housing. Anyways, the landlord's girlfriend texted me to say she was ' really upset with how I reacted' and that there was 'no need'... I don't get it. I think given the situation I handled it pretty fucking well! Do I respond to this text and tell her and the rest of these people how I feel or is it best to just ignore it and move on. I feel pretty sad right now and I'm torn on what is the right thing to do. Cheers all!",22Sep2019,1
2,"Hi everyone I was hoping I can get some advice on my situation. I go to college and the teacher announced a group project. We all choose a country and do a presentation on it. My group members have not been replying to my messages for days or what they would be contributing to the PowerPoint or the poster that I made. Also they rely too much on me to speak on behalf of their presentation. I told the teacher about it in an email.

The teacher told the class people would lose Mark's if not communicating with eachother. I thought that would be enough to scare them. Guess I was wrong? I recently tried to get in touch. They either are too busy with their jobs or they just dont care enough because it is mainly on me.

Someone suggested to me that I should threaten them about losing Mark's for non contributing as much as I would like to see.
Would that be right or wrong of me? Should I just wait at the end and tell the teacher after the presentation on their part of the ""work"" given?

I'm trying so hard to pull myself together before this group presentation.",22Sep2019,1
3,"This might be a little long, but any responses would be greatly appreciated...

So in one of my classes (college) I started vibing really well with this girl (I'm a guy btw). On the 10th we were put into groups and she and I were in the same group. I was being very funny and she and the other two members responded extremely well to my humor. I also feel like there was a tiny bit of teasing that transpired between she and I. 

On the 12th which was the next class, we had presentations. She went that day and I told her she did a good job and she thanked me. Another person went and people took pictures of the others person's presentation. I was unable to get a pic so I asked the girl if she could send it to me. She did. I didnt save her number though. Also there were some exchanges between us with a tiny bit more teasing I feel like unless I misread. 

Fast forward to this past Tuesday the 17th which was the next class. I was up for the presentations and I noticed she played very close attention to me while I presented whereas with other students she didn't pay 100% attention. After class we chatted. A brand of food was mentioned that I recommend she try and I told her I'd tell her the brand next time I saw it which reminded me that I didn't save her number. When I said that she jokingly was offended. It was a very good convo though and I even suggested we could get together to practice our future presentations which she seemed open to.

Weenesday the 18th I didnt see her because that class didn't take place. While I was hanging out with classmates from a class I did have that day, I got a text from her which was a welcome surprise. She said hey with an exclamation point and asked about the name of the brand of food I recommended the day prior. I responded saying hey back and then the name of the brand. She responded back basically thanking me with an exclamation point.

Thursday the 19th. After class we hung out together again while we waited for our next classes. I shared some of my poetry with her because I was going to share some poetry during my presentation but couldn't because of time restrictions. She liked my poetry. She also complimented my phone which she was holding to read the poems. We also shared stories from our lives with each other. We also found another thing we had in common which I suggested we could get together to do which she seemed open to. She mentioned again how now that I saved her number it would be good. I jokingly said I deleted her number and she jokingly said that that's understandable since she thinks she is weird. It was time to go so I said to hit me up so we could do that thing we have in common and then we parted ways.

Throughout my next class I was worried because I wasnt sure if I ruined things that saying that I deleted her number ( i didn't btw). After my next class was over i texted her thanking her for giving me a piece of gum when we were hanging out. She replied saying anytime and she never runs out so i know who to go to when i need gum.

So that's where it's at right now. This is kind of a first for me so I don't really know what to do. I don't fully know if she is interested or not; my mom thinks so but I'm not 100% sure. I'd like to keep talking to her but my phone is dry so I don't know the rules of texting very well. So yeah any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.",22Sep2019,1
4,"So this happened last night. I was laying down, facing away from my husband. I heard him moving closer to me so I turned around, at which point he put his dick on my mouth covering my mouth in pre-cum. I got a little upset and was like “babe...you didn’t even ask me.” He said he was sorry and started cleaning off my lips. I left it at that and then had sex with him. Is there something wrong with me that this is bothering me? I mean it’s not like he shoved it down my throat, he just rubbed it on my lips? I’m afraid if I bring it up to him I’ll either a) make he feel really guilty or b) make him get mad/defensive. I really don’t want either of those things to happen. What do I do? And am I overreacting? This seems like something small but I’m feeling really anxious over it. I would really appreciate any advice or thoughts, thank you.",22Sep2019,7
5,"Apologies in advance for excessive length and/or potential incoherency at points. I’m a bit of an over-explainer (I like to be as clear as possible), but also pretty tired at the moment. I’m going to try to run through the situation in a somewhat timeline order (the order I write stuff in will be the order it happened in), but for things not time-specific, I’ll just include them where they’re relevant. I will throw in a tl;dr at the end (even though I don’t much care for them since, as I mentioned before, I like to provide as much detail and context as possible, so a short little one-line summary doesn’t feel adequate to me) for anyone who doesn’t feel like reading the whole thing. 

This explanation involves a couple of different people, so for the sake of clarity for any readers (so I’m not constantly saying “they”/“this person”/“the one who ____”/etc, which could make things confusing), I’m going to assign them (fake, naturally) names. The person who this post is mainly about, I’ll call Bucky (as they’re a Marvel fan, and that’s one of their favorite characters alongside Cap). The other main player on this stage I’ll name when they come into the picture.

Before I start, one thing you should understand about Bucky is that they have BPD, and have been known to “split” in the past. For those who don’t know, splitting, at least the way they described it happening to them, is where someone takes on a very black-and-white mentality, specifically towards people, and can’t really see the shades of grey. Bucky described it as seeing every single good thing or quality about the people around them as “fake”, and them either going completely numb/detached or being full of a “white hot rage”. This tends to last anywhere from a couple of hours up to a week or more at a time. Bucky has told me that they’ve gotten better in the past year or so at recognizing an oncoming split, and said that they’d text/message me a signal when they knew one was coming, because during that time even an “are you okay”/checking up on them would be perceived as a bad thing. However, they have yet to ever actually use that signal (which isn’t their fault - perhaps they forgot, or it came on too quickly for them to get a heads up to me, or perhaps they just didn’t want to - having not lived in their shoes, I try not to judge too much or think too critically of them) - generally they’ll just disappear on me. 

About 2 weeks ago now, it was Bucky’s birthday. I took over the cake I’d made them and the gift I’d gotten them to their apartment, and we hung out with their roommates for a bit. They were pretty pleased, and thought it was sweet. They chose not to read their card at the time, as they didn’t want to end up crying, which I completely understood and respected (the only reason I mention it is because it’ll be mildly relevant later). 

The day after the birthday, I texted Bucky to see if they’d opened their card yet, and got no response. I’m pretty used to their silences by now (it’s not always a full split - they also have a lot of times when they just don’t feel like talking to people. It can be hard to tell the difference, though, especially as they don’t really give any sort of signal or indicator).

Before I left Bucky’s apartment on their birthday, they invited me to go with them and their roommates and some other friends on an outing that weekend. I eventually ended up declining, as they planned to smoke, and I have this thing about people being high/having to deal with them when they are - I don’t understand why, but it really bothers me. I spent most of the week between the birthday and the outing struggling with the choice (didn’t want to let Bucky down or lose one of my increasingly more limited chances to spend time with them, also didn’t want to put myself in an uncomfortable position or have them realize I wasn’t having a good time and possibly be hurt/offended if I had gone), but eventually I chose to bow out the day before the outing. When I did, though, I still hadn’t heard from them since their birthday. Between knowing better than double-texting them by that point and the fact that, even if we had been talking normally, I was scared of disappointing or hurting them, I didn’t break the news to them myself. Instead, I told their roommate (another close friend of mine, who I actually met Bucky through - let’s call this person Darren (after their favorite actor)), who then told Bucky. Bucky said they were fine with it, but I still felt pretty shitty over it. I didn’t give them my reasoning (at that time), just that I didn’t want to go. 

The day of the outing arrived, and given the circumstances (my aversion to high people and the fact that we at that point had not spoken in almost a week), I had no intention of talking to Bucky that day. However, I did tag them in a meme I saw on Facebook that I thought they’d like, figuring they’d maybe like the comment and have that be the extent of their reaction. Later that night, I ended up talking to Darren, explaining how difficult the choice not to go had been for me to make, and exactly why I made that choice, because I felt like they deserved to know/understand that I still care about them every bit as much as I ever did, I was just deeply personally uncomfortable with the circumstances of the gathering, and that’s why I opted out. Darren was quite understanding and respectful of my boundaries, and offered to pass the explanation along to Bucky. However, during all of this, Bucky messaged me. I hadn’t thought much of the meme when I tagged them in it, but they were apparently offended by it (they said they weren’t mad, but I’m starting to have my doubts considering it’s been a week since that day and we’ve had next to no contact since), and messaged me asking not to be tagged in that sort of thing. For context (and I’m hoping the spoiler tags work - I’ve never used them before), the meme was an Endgame meme with a line of dialogue for Captain America saying &gt;!”we won, and everyone survived except my”, followed by a box of rigatoni pasta with the r replaced by an n!&lt;. Again, I hadn’t even noticed (my first year roommates used the word in practically every sentence, so I guess after a while I stopped seeing it as an atrocious unforgivable sin like Bucky did, and saw it as a word - not one that I’d ever personally use (I’m still aware that it isn’t a good word to use, I just didn’t really register how bad it was when I saw the meme, due to being more used to it), but I didn’t react as strongly to it as Bucky did), but they disapproved of the use of that term as a punchline, and were sure to message me to tell me so. Given the whole circumstances of the night, with it being the first time Bucky had acknowledged my existence in nearly a week, the fact that I was still feeling guilty and frustrated with myself for not going/the reason why I didn’t, the fact that I knew they were in a state I don’t like talking to people while they’re in, and the fact that the first acknowledgement I got from them after that silence was to tell me off for something... I reacted poorly. I told them I’d remove the comment tagging them, then promptly blocked them on messenger so they wouldn’t talk to me again that night, because the notification from them literally made me feel like I was going to throw up - that’s how scared/rattled/caught off guard I was to hear from them that night, particularly in such a critical manner. Once I had time to calm down, I respected and understood their concern, but at the time, it just felt like they’d only bothered to come back when it was time to criticize me for something. 

I did try to make contact with Bucky once after that, and while they did respond, they were short, dry responses that gave me vibes that they didn’t want to be bothered with me. Whether that was the case or it was just me being overly sensitive, I don’t know. Regardless, I haven’t tried a one-on-one approach since. I have sent a few messages to the group chats between Bucky, Darren, and myself, but while Darren reacts, Bucky just leaves it all on read. 

If I’m being honest, at this point, I’m a little scared of Bucky. I’m tired of always reaching out and making contact while I never know what version I’m going to get. Will it be the cheerful and friendly one who I heard squealing with Darren as soon as their apartment door shut behind me on Bucky’s birthday? Or will it be the one who either ignores me for days/weeks at a time or gives short, passive aggressive, thinly-veiled “fuck off” responses? I’m so tired of having to tiptoe around them so I don’t drive them back away when they actually are around, or piss them off and keep them away longer when they’ve gone off again. I’m so frustrated with not knowing whether they’re not responding because they’re busy/forgot, in which case a follow-up text as a reminder would be okay, or whether they’re in “everybody piss off” mode where another message would only make them mad. And since I know some people might be thinking I’m an asshole right now (after all, Bucky is not choosing to be so inconsistent/distant/terrifyingly unpredictable and hard to deal/interact with as a result of that - BPD is just a bitch), you’re not telling me anything I don’t tell myself on the daily. I hate myself for feeling this way about someone I know can’t really help it. But at the same time, just because it isn’t easy on them, does that mean that the people around them have to be sunshine and rainbows about it all the time? Obviously I’d never say any of this to them directly, but if I want solid advice, I have to be fully honest. I’m not some kind of saint, and I don’t think there are many people who wouldn’t end up feeling this way at least sometimes in my shoes (except Darren, but I learned long ago that they have superhuman calm, patience, and compassion - no normal person could handle themselves the way that they do). 

At this point, I honestly don’t know what to do. Even if they do scare me sometimes, Bucky is still a close friend who I love to pieces, and I miss them. I’m scared to make the first move, because like I said above, I’m scared of which version I’m going to get. That being said, I also know that they won’t break the silence any time soon. As you may have figured out by now, Bucky is pretty distant at the best of times - I get anywhere from an hour to maybe a couple days at the most of semi-consistent acknowledgement at any given time, then they go away for another few days to a week or more - wash, rinse, and repeat ad infinitum. Now, however, things are more complicated. See, Bucky and Darren are in the same program, and Darren has forewarned me that they’ll be more distant/less responsive from now on (or at least for the next few months/year or so), because this year (particularly this part of it) is absolute hell on the people in their program. Darren is someone I’ve spoken to literally every day since we met nearly a year ago (it wasn’t always epic dialogues a la Plato every day, of course, but we have had, in one way or another, daily contact). If they’re becoming more distant due to the overwhelming amount on their plate at the moment, what’s that going to mean for Bucky, who’s absent like half the time to begin with? 

For one thing, it certainly muddies the waters - it used to be easy to tell when Bucky was in split/I don’t want to talk mode by how long/consistently they were silent for. Now they’re so busy they likely wouldn’t have time for communication even when they were feeling alright (Darren does still acknowledge me at least once a day (and more when they can manage it), but on their busier/more hectic days, it tends to be just a brief “hey, I’m doing okay” once a night to let me know they’re surviving (because they know I worry about them)). And naturally, having that much on their shoulders is also going to cause some elevated stress levels, which naturally doesn’t do any favors to mental health (for anyone, let alone somebody with a diagnosed disorder). So basically, at this point it’s a big clusterfuck of being busy, splitting, and being stressed (all of which can also kind of feed into each other) that makes it super unclear what Bucky’s reason for silence is, or how acceptable any attempts to contact them would be. I love Bucky, and I miss them, but I have no idea where they’re at with me/in general. I don’t know if they’re still mad at me over that meme or not. I don’t know what their reason for being silent so long is - whether they’re expecting me to always make the initial contact, or they’re splitting and not wanting to talk to anyone (this one I doubt - I was out with Darren a few days ago and noticed Bucky’s name come up on their screen out of the corner of my eye at one point, so presumably they’re still contacting at least some people), or they’ve just forgotten about me entirely and I’ve been lost in the shuffle of everything else. I don’t know when/if I’ll hear from them next if I don’t break the silence. I don’t know how they’ll react if I do break the silence. I don’t know how this affects the last few months that the three of us have of all being in the same city (if I’m trying to steer clear of Bucky, it also limits my ability to see Darren somewhat - can’t really pop in and say hi to one roommate without risking encountering another. Besides, a lot of the things we’ve talked about doing while we can have been discussed/planned as a trio). And I don’t know how to feel about any of it. I’m scared, and I’m tired, and I miss them, and I’m frustrated with myself for the fact that things are this way, and I feel guilty for the fact that Darren has been somewhat of a “middle man” (they were the one to tell Bucky about me not going on the outing, and the why of it). I just don’t know what to do/how to do it. Do I swallow my fear and force myself to make contact? If so, what do I do if Bucky ignores me or gets dry with me again? Do I keep playing the waiting game, and see if they make contact with me? If so, what do I do if they don’t? I feel like the longer I wait, the harder this whole situation gets - the more scared of them I’ll be, the more uncertain about where their head’s at I am, and the less convinced I am that they’d even want to be in touch with me again at all. I’m already too scared to make a move, but I also worry what Bucky thinks/feels about that - what if they think I’m mad at/upset with them, and they’re keeping their distance for the same reason I am? What if they’re just trying to give me space like I’ve done for them so many times, and they just won’t speak to me again until I start it? I have so many questions, and no answers to any of them. So, in situations like that, I suppose it’s time to turn to reddit.

7,"hello everyone. i don't usually post things like these, so forgive me if I'm breaching the format. i'm just desperate.

&amp;#x200B;

this is such an embarrassingly ""internet"" problem i am even ashamed to use my main account for this. i don't have anyone else to talk about this with - those I'm not ashamed to reach out to wouldn't understand because it's a complete non-issue outside of online stuff, and those who would understand are too closely intertwined with for me not to be ashamed to tell them. 

&amp;#x200B;

i love online roleplaying. ever since i started, as a kid of 8 years old, i was hooked. it makes me happy, it gives me something to look forward to. i'm a creative person but i don't have the mind to make stories on my own - roleplay gives me a way to indulge in my creativity in a way that works for me. the problem is, i feel like roleplaying turns me into a toxic person. 

&amp;#x200B;

i've had two friendships - one in primary school, one in middle/high school - end very unhealthy and in both of those roleplay was a major hobby we enjoyed together. but from my end, throughout both, there was this undercurrent of dependence but also.. a some sort of a competition. that the person who cares less wins and the person who cares more loses. i hate begging or anything that feels like it - it makes me feel humiliated. but i'd ask for us to spend time together or roleplay or do OC stuff, because it meant so much to me. it made me so happy it was worth it being the ""loser"" if i got the chance to do it. i'd draw them pictures to incite them to roleplay or give ideas to discuss. and i'd get resentful and moody when they didn't have time for me, then act out by trying to scorn them the same way they scorned me. for example, i'd half-ass our conversations or pretend i was busy so they felt the same way i did.

&amp;#x200B;

this was bad and unhealthy, for both me and them. while those friendships were ended by me for unrelated issues, i absolutely know my own toxic mindsets didn't help.

&amp;#x200B;

after the issue with the HS friend, i took a long break from roleplay with single people. in the meantime i finished high school and got my bachelor's in university. i made and lost friendships, most of them much healthier for me. the rp craving i satisfied by running a tumblr blog and some other stuff - never one-on-one.

&amp;#x200B;

until a year ago. a person from a bigger group of online friends approached me to do things together and it turned out we jived very well. we made many characters and stories together and started rping. things have been going well until recently - this is also when we became even closer. i could easily call him my best friend. the problem? i feel my toxic impulses coming back and i'm terrified. logically i know every single of these thoughts is irrational and unfair. but i still feel the upset and hurt and logic isn't enough to fix it when my emotions hurt so badly.

&amp;#x200B;

this friend asks me for nsfw drawings of our characters - i happily provide because it's fun for me too. but sometimes i feel like i'm not worthy to talk to if i don't bring a drawing. i try to initiate oc conversations - and lately it feels like i am the only one to do that, unless it's something porn-related. sometimes i feel neglected. sometimes i feel used. i begin to want to act in the same way i used to all these years. i begin to be jealous of the time he isn't spending with me, talking OC stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

this is stupid. i know it. logically he is not obliged to talk to me, to always want to talk about OCs. it's fine to want some distance. logically, i'm happy he is making other friends (for a while i was, in his own words, his only social interaction). but my emotions disagree. sometimes i wait all day for him to approach me for OC stuff only for him not to do that and then the entire day is wasted. sometimes i ask him to do things with me but it doesn't work out and I feel humiliated. it's just this game of who cares less again. and i realized it's the same pattern again - and once again it's linked to RP.

&amp;#x200B;

has anyone else had a similar situation? how did you deal with it? i'm scared my only option is to cut the friendship off - but i genuinely care about him as a person and don't want to hurt him (or myself) like this. but i'm scared that if i keep it up i'll hurt him too. what is it about roleplay that brings out the worst in me?",22Sep2019,1

9,It’s the beginning of my junior year of highschool ( third year ) and I decided to join a sport with my friends. One of the girls on the team who is a senior ( fourth year)  has been on the team a year before I was and what we call a returner on the team. I get along pretty well with majority of the returners except this one girl. She just hates me. Usually when I see the other returners around school we speak to each other which I don’t expect them to but they do. But this girl she sees me she rolls her eyes and whispers to her friends. I didn’t care that she didn’t like me at first but it has gotten worst. The team were on the bus together when I was telling the returners about a teacher I had that they also had last year and how me and that teacher didn’t get along. I continued to tell them how he also made a noise when he read my work and as I spoke I saw her mouth to the other girls “she’s lying”. When we’re walking together to another school I was talking and cracking jokes with the other girls and as I was talking she was rolling her eyes and whispering things to the girls and they all looked at me and laughed. This type of atmosphere gives me a lot of anxiety I really don’t know what I did to her.,22Sep2019,2
11,"I (24F) get dependent on certain people in my life. Typically, it's whatever guy I'm seeing/talking to/etc. I am always careful not to act on this dependence. I don't \*act\* needy toward them. But, internally, I deeply crave attention and reassurance. Since I don't act on it, it doesn't affect these relationships. However, it causes me much anxiety if I feel distance, etc.

I recently went through a scare where I thought the person I was seeing was leaving my life. Things are okay now. But, for those few days, I was a wreck. I was so anxious that I could not eat. If I ate, I'd throw up. And I was so depressed that as soon as I'd get home from work, I'd lay in bed crying for the rest of the night. I did not have the energy to focus on anything productive.   
Obviously, that's not healthy behavior. In retrospect, it feels like a whole week's worth of time that was wasted due to my dependency issue.  
But, it was kind of a wake up call to how badly I'm affected by this issue. The thought of not having that person to talk about our days with, confide with, or just share my days with really, truly fucked me up. 

I've had a lot of people leave in my life and it's given me a fear of abandonment. It seems like I handle each loss worse than the one before it. So i'm sure that's contributing to this issue.

But I can't live like this. I need to be able to exist independently. I need to be able to be ok when/if people leave and be able to go forward and live a productive life.

15,"Hey guys, this is kind of a convoluted story but I'll try to keep it on track.

Today I moved into university in a hall of residence to study a BA in War Studies but I really feel like I've made a terrible decision. I managed to keep my composure all the way up until I actually got into the room and then the apprehension, uncertainty and the isolation all crept up on me and I basically just ended up having an emotional breakdown. I know it's only the first day and nerves are bound to be high but I can feel it that this emotion isn't homesickness, I spent 3 hours napping earlier because I felt so sad and hopeless that being asleep was just a better alternative to being awake in my room. For a bit of background, I decided to study a course at university previously at another university doing a course in Animal Management when I was 18 (now 23) but left because the living situation was depressing me to the point of not being able to cope with the pressure of university life. I was optimistic in my application for War Studies as it's a course that much better suited to my interests and skill set and I assumed that being older would serve me in good stead for this attempt. But right now, it's like every emotion I experienced then has returned all at once and the prospect of getting through just the next few days fills me with dread and hopelessness. And that's where the crux of the problem is, I can't drive yet and my mum is my main source of transportation. Understandably, she was not desperately pleased with me and was of the opinion that I was just being hysterical because of an unfamiliar situation. She next Wednesday and comes back the following Wednesday meaning that through my induction week she won't even be in the country and I will be especially aware of how helpless I am. As much as I want to believe this is a passing feeling and induction week will help settle it, it just feels like the emotional scars from my first experience at university have been torn open. I feel totally alone, I have no friends up here as of yet and I can't go home. Again, I appreciate this all sounds very hasty of me but I feel so awful and sorrowful that I honestly don't know how I'm going to make it if this feeling keeps up. On the other hand, if by some miracle my mum does take pity on me and let's me drop out before she goes to Montenegro (highly unlikely as she was talking about spending a month minimum here which feels totally inconceivable right now), there are other issues to contend with, the principle one being what will become of my future and how I'll end up in a career that I actually want to do and not work in retail for the rest of my life. I have ideas about how to go about it that'd preserve my emotional health like distance learning or apprenticeships but I really don't know what to do. I guess I just need somebody wiser than me to make sense of this whole mess.",22Sep2019,1
16,"I'll give some background info about my situation:  
I have been raised a vegetarian, so from day 1 I have never eaten meat or fish (tiny pieces here or there but nothing significant). Recently I moved to Japan as an exchange student and as a result i'm having a hard time finding food to eat especially with my limited Japanese. 

I have decided to bite the bullet and just start eating fish, however, from the three times I ate something containing fish two of those times I was up the following night throwing up until my stomach was empty. 

What I didn't throw up was a rice ball with shrimp in it. What I did throw up was a meal containing squid and a meal containing shrimp. 

how do I change my body in such a way that I can eat fish without throwing up? Are some fish harder on your stomach than others?

Note: I chose to start eating fish  rather than meat because as far as I know it's very healthy where meat is debatable. If you think eating meat will help my stomach adjust then I'm willing to try that too.",22Sep2019,1
17,"I've been talking and seeing this military guy for a couple of weeks, I meet him off of OKC. He was very nice at first, ordering a pizza without meeting me first and taking me to places like the movies or restaurants. I was interested but not close enough to liking him, the whole time we were together we almost always get along. Our conversations sometimes would get in-depth about our values and past, our feelings. He confessed to me I should have more respect for myself, not to use my body. He even got mad at me when I offered to return sex for his generosity, I always felt guilty when he spoiled me. 
He told me more than once he liked me, he told me I didn't need plastic surgery. Cause he liked my face. He felt so genuine and true.
Recently couple days we hanged out which was fine and talked on the phone which was fine too yet two days ago I texted him, in a teasing way about me owning him. Apparently he didn't have the patience for it and got angry or offended by it. He told me he was gonna say bye or leave me, regardless if I was joking or not. I repeatedly told him I was sorry and I do respect him, he didn't forgive me. He just told me to move on and leave him, alone. 

I also have been worried that he was avoiding me, I would ask me when can we meet and he would say ""IDK"" he felt distant and didn't kiss me goodbye when I last saw him. 
Context: he's a guard or a police officer for them, he has been studying for this test that means a lot to him.",22Sep2019,1
18,"So this guy confessed he liked me, and I was like hella happy cuz I really liked him too. So I told him I liked him too and now... Nothing, he's doing nothing and I don't quite understand what's going on. Like, I'm not sure if maybe he's waiting to ask me out? Or maybe his type of crush on me is just casual and he does not wanna take it any further. I just don't know what to do so I tried talking to him and I told him hey just so it's clear you know I like you right? And he basically replied yeah me too and again... Nothing. He does not even text me first, I'm always the one who starts the conversation. What's happening here??

Edit: Okay, well imma add on to here as much as I can, I follow him on Twitter and he post a lot of stuff about his crush and at first I thought it was me but them he posted something about how hes happy that he's texting and talking to his crush when...we haven't talked in a while, text or otherwise and the few times we did chat, I was the one who started it. So I'm questioning if he's even into me so I asked him and he said he is into me but after that he didn't do anything to ask me out nor is he texting me. I wonder if he's just playing around with me or something. He keeps saying stuff like how he wants to wait? But wait for what??",22Sep2019,4

21,"Okay, so before I tell the story here is some background information:
My boyfriend is 22 and lives with his parents. He has an middle-upperclass family. His mom babies him and buys him clothes while his dad cleans the dishes and takes out the trash and does all the housework. His parents typically provide him food unless he gets take-out. My boyfriend went to vocational school and is a mechanic. He only pays for the lease on his truck. His parents pay the insurance. Other than the truck payment he pays nothing else. His only responsibility is his bedroom. And even then his dad will sometimes carpet clean and help him pick up. 
He seems to always be upset over things I find minor. He also lashes out in fights. 

I go to a pre-med program at university full time and work a salary from home job as well as a part-time job. I have a house that I pay on with utilities. My own car. I have a service dog. Another dog and a cat. Well I go to school Monday to Saturday 7am-3pm no school on fridays. I drop the service dog off before work. And i typically work 4pm to whenever. Sometimes 10pm. Other times 12am, some times 6pm. Just depends on the day. 

Well, my boyfriend wanted me to spend time at his house cause he had stayed at my house for a while. I explained to him it would be hard cause I would either have to pick the service dog up from my house after work to go back to his house. Or grab my other dog from his house and go back home. And for me, that is just so much driving that cuts into studying and/or sleep. He and I agreed on a compromise where if I came over, he would pick the service dog up from my house or drop the non service dog off at my house. 
Well, today he got mad and told me I was using him and asking him for too much and it is cutting too much into his time to have to pick the dog up. So I replied with ""so then, I just can't go to your house"". And his response was that it would cause the relationship to be impossible to grow if I didn't go too his house. He litterally gets off work and plays games. But me asking for the dog to be dropped off today was ""taking advantage"" of him. 
We have been together for 2 years. But I am just so tired of these ridiculous fights. I just wish he understood all the stress and crap I have to go through.

The hope is thus: my grad school application gets accepted and I begin as a full-time student come next fall.

31,"I'm 22 and last night I went to my cousins wedding and something interesting happened.

Early on at the reception party, I went over to go talk to my cousin Jack. We talked for a bit, but one of his uncles came over and needed to talk to him. As I was waiting to resume our conversation, a girl came to the table that I have seen before. I can't remember her name because it was an uncommon name, but shes good friends with some of my cousins because they all go to the same church. She drops in at my cousins house sometimes, but I live far away from my cousins and don't go there very often so I have never really talked to her at all. She came over to the table to drop off her purse, but she saw what was going on and then she subtly walked over between me and my cousin to drop off her purse and she sort of awkwardly stood there like she was waiting for me to say hello. I did and we formally introduced ourselves and talked a little bit. Then she asked me if I wanted to go get food with her and I said yes (I wasn't hungry). We talked in line, got our food and I saw from across the room that the table she had put her purse at was full. I then told her that I was going to eat at my parents table and that I would see her around. Throughout the rest of the night I tried to find an opportunity to talk to her again, but she was hanging out with a bunch of other people that I didn't know the entire night. As I was leaving she was talking to my cousin Jack so I said goodbye to Jack and to her and I left.

Is there a way to proceed from here or should I just hope that I run into her again? I thought about contacting Jack or one of my other cousins and ask about her, but I'm not super close with my cousins and I don't want to make things awkward.",22Sep2019,4
32,"The day my son (16M) was born was probably the proudest day of my life. Sadly, it had turned into one of my biggest regrets. Since he was young he loved sports, playing football with his buddies in the back garden. I (63M) thought he'd turn into a pro and become as good as Wayne Rooney and I'd be a proud daddy.

The day I bought him a laptop for his 15th birthday was when things all changed. More specifically, the day he discovered Arch Linux. It was like watching a donkey turn into an brown bear that is severely handicapped (mentally and physically).

Every morning at 5am he'd Naruto run around the neighborhood screaming ""I use Arch btw"" and ""Ubuntu is for beta male cucks"". We live near a retirement home so the old codgers despised that, they have put many reports in to the police. Thankfully due to austerity (&lt;3 Margaret Thatcher) they didn't have the resources to do anything. Also they knew he had severe assburgers.

My wife (26F) loves knitting, so for Christmas she decided to make him a giant GNU/Linux tuxedo penguin called Gentoo. My son loved him and brought it with him everywhere, even to school! People at school would constantly bully him and snatch Gentoo away, dipping the penguin in BBQ sauce in the canteen etc. and calling him a fat Linux nerd. At parents evening, every teacher was concerned as to why my son loved this giant knitted penguin so much, and that he needs to grow up and focus on his grades.

On New Years day, I saw something my eyes wished they hadn't seen. Instead of lighting fireworks in the back garden like I told him to, he was balls deep in this damn knitted penguin. He was murmuring some weird ritual about how pacman is the supreme GNU/Linux package manager. I shouted at him, snatching the penguin off him. “Gentoo doesn’t deserve this” I screamed, taking the penguin with me. He locked his bedroom door and wouldn’t speak to me. That very night I spent ages in the kitchen squeezing his fruity semen out of the knitted penguin into a bowl (my wife (26F) loves making me protein shakes for after my cross-fit lessons). Thankfully I hadn’t yet fed my dog so I let him lick the sticky goodness out of Gentoo’s underside, I reckon if I put Gentoo in the laundry he would fall apart so good job he was hungry.

The next morning my son apologized and said he’s going back to Windows 10 Home Premium 64 bit, even though he doesn’t like Microsoft spying on his questionable internet habits. Tragically that evening I found him hanging from the ceiling. Thank you for listening, I really needed to get this off my chest and vent.",22Sep2019,0
33,"I'm an extremely spoiled 15 year old female. I've had an absolutely perfect life, but the idea of overcoming problems independently is completely unknown to me. I usually just wallow about problems or just push them onto someone else's plate. My entire life revolves around me getting my next hit of validation or attention. I'm obsessed with myself and my problems because I desperately want to feel special. It's almost like I have a fear of being ""normal"". For instance: whenever I pretent to be sad (I don't think I'm ever actually sad, it's just my subconscious mind looking for dopamine), I get pissed off to the point of nausea when someone says ""It's okay, you're not alone"". That's not reassuring to me at all, it makes me feel like I'm normal and average. I want to be special so badly, which is such a fucking pathetic and unattainable fantasy because nobody in the real world gets special treatment. It's like I'm expecting to have privileges that no one else does, and whenever it's revealed to me that this isn't the case, I breakdown and act recklessly in an attempt to get some attention. I'm fucking tired of being sensitive, it makes me feel disgusting. I'm at least an hour late for school everyday, and handing in assignments is unheard of. But somehow I still seem to think I'm amazing? Literally every aspect of my life is dictated by my need for attention. I'm completely obsessed with myself, and I don't know how to stop. I manipulate people all the time so that they'll make me feel just a bit real, and that's currently my only life force. I feel entirely fake, because I am entirely fake. I constantly feel like the world revolves around me, but I consciously hate it. I secretly think everything and everyone are beneath me, and that I deserve better, which is not true because I've had everything served to me on a silver platter coated with sugar.

I know these shows are fiction, but I realize that it's still pretty real. People around me have relationships like this where they are so deeply connected to someone else, but I don't feel like I have that with anyone, nor have I ever had that.

I feel like I've always had a facade. I was able to be passionate and be myself, but I never actually tried to understand others on a deeper and more personal level.

Me and this one girl who I like are both in high school. Recently, I’ve grown to have feelings for her. To be frank, we don’t know each other *that* well. I knew about her last year but this year is the only year where I’ve actually been talking to her and vice versa. So far, we’ve spoken to each other in person once for a like a couple of minutes about two weeks ago and ever since then, we’ve only texted each other. We don’t share any classes and have busy schedules but we do pass by each other during this one specific hour (if I can make it to the class in time). 

So, let’s get to the actual point of the post: 

Last week, as I was waiting outside the door of my next class, she was leaving the class and when she saw me at the door, she smiled at me. Yesterday when I entered my class while she was leaving, she momentarily stopped at the door, looked at me, smiled, and waved to me. I smiled back in both instances. 

Obviously I don’t have wild crazy fantasies of her suddenly wanting to marry me or whatever and she’s probably just being nice and stuff but what do these signs mean? Are they indicative of anything?

It was 2 am when my brother (30 yo) came home. He didn’t look drunk, but looked like he was avoiding me because he just said a few words and didn’t even looked at me. He went to his room and it was silent for a while until I heard him coughing very loudly. And it was followed with some weird sounds like something was coming out of his throat. 
I got a bit worried. He kept coughing and when i was about to go check on him I heard him rushing to the bathroom. Sounded like he vomited. I came to the door and asked whether he was fine and needed my help, but he replied in a very normal voice that he was ok and that no help was needed. 
I got back to my room and I could hear him constantly moving, using bucket to mop the floor, using laundry machine, cleaning bathroom. Who would do laundry at 4 am unless they vomited in the bed? And combined with the horrible coughing sounds that I heard it could have been the same thing like in Breaking Bad when she vomited in her sleep and died. 
I’m reluctant to confront him because he’s a very reserved person. And I haven’t interfered in his cleaning process because I don’t want to make him feel awful about himself and avoid me even more. 
I’m just very anxious and don’t know what to do. And don’t even know whether I should do anything. The worst thing I have in my mind is that he took drugs. Because it didn’t look like he was drunk and he wasn’t feeling sick today either.

58,"Hi, 

This is going to be a bit long because I have some stuff to make clear if I really want the best advice. I’m a high schooler, and I’d be lying if I said I was anything above the bottom of the schools social ladder. In my freshman year, I was super loud and didn’t really care, and it painted a bit of a portrait into the minds of my peers. Following that, I was super quiet and a bit socially awkward my sophomore year. Now I’m starting my junior year, and I’m a bit lost. For starters, I have no guidance. No friends close enough to vent to, and no therapist to discuss my emotions with. I typically spend my time at school with my peers, laughing and talking about whatever happened that day and such. Then when I’m alone, it’s like a 180. I realize how unhappy I am with how my life is going, and feel powerless to change the course at this point. I dwell on how my numerous romantic escapades have either been forced to go away in my head, or crashed and burnt when confessing. My parents aren’t exactly the best to talk to about stuff. I turn to my playlists, and let the music fill my head. Then I repeat it all the next day. Repeat, again and again. Then on Friday, it was different. I’ve been so down in the dumps, and lost. My friend told me about this girl, who listens to a lot of the same music I do, is super nice, and super cute. My type, to summarize it all. It sounded great in my head, but yet I knew it was too good to be true. 

She isn’t what I would call out of my league exactly. She has no way of knowing about my past, and has a pretty nice circle of friends. And again, she is supposedly super nice. I’ve never talked to her or anything, I wanna make that clear. She does have one friend, however, that might be an issue for me. But I could easily find my own way around that. The thing I’m most worried about, is me. I’m still pretty socially awkward, and tend to stumble over my words. I also have trouble expressing what I really think. 
What’s interesting to me, is how this is making me feel. For some reason, this second chance, this fresh slate of a person is scarier for me than  all the other people I’ve ever tried to befriend, whether it be in a friendly way, or a romantic way. Everything seems like it is balancing on my first impression with her. I wanted it to be artificial, maybe accidentally bump into her or something so I’d have an opening  to talk to her, but I realize that all my attempts in the past have been as artificial and low risk as I could make them. I also don’t know about being completely natural, because if I’m natural I’ll probably stumble on my words and look like an idiot, and that would be all. Game over. Being lonely for this long long time, has gotten really old for me. I don’t know what to do, I feel stuck. 

How do I lay groundwork in a relationship like this, with a person I’ve never talked to, in a school where it feels everyone is out to get me? 

How do I express myself from there?",22Sep2019,1
59,"I’ve been friends with this one girl for two years. She’s overall a really nice, supportive person, but sometimes she says terrible things to people without even thing. She told one of my other friends that she had no social life to her face (she apologized later after realizing it had hurt her feelings) and she casually calls people stupid all the time. She doesn’t even realize how hurtful these things can be, especially to a sensitive person like me.

Earlier when I was confiding in all of my friends about this guy I really like, she literally just said out loud “Eew, he makes me wanna gag! You need to get hot guys instead!” And then she started telling me about weird things he used to do in her seventh grade English class, which was literally YEARS ago. I was absolutely crushed, and I spent about twenty minutes crying in the bathroom and feeling extremely insecure about myself, wondering if maybe the guy I like wasn’t good enough and I should find someone else. 

I’m sure she didn’t mean anything by it and it was just another throwaway comment, but it still really got to me. Once again she doesn’t usually think before she talks, but what she said made me feel really bad about myself and mad at her for saying something so terrible about someone she literally hasn’t ever spoken to. Seriously, she hasn’t even stopped to think that the guy might be like, I don’t know, a way different person than he was when he was 12? 

I don’t know what I should do. She’s a great friend (just one with very poor judgment) and I don’t want to lose her. Should I tell her that what she said was hurtful, or should I try to “get hot guys” instead, as she put it?",22Sep2019,1
60,"Recently, I broke up with my boyfriend of two years. I found out he was cheating on me a while ago and we tried to fix things for several months but I was afraid it just wasn’t working. Part of me could never get over that but he tried so hard to fix things. I started talking to a close friend of mine. Someone both he and I knew for over a year and we started dating, but we’re having a lot of problems that I never had with my ex. We’re arguing a lot and I just don’t think we’re going to work out, but I don’t want to hurt him because he’s been screwed over by a lot of girls in the past and losing me might push him to never wanna be with anyone else, especially if I decide to try to get my ex back. I just don’t know what I should do. I miss going on dates with my ex and I just miss being with him in general even though I shouldn’t because of him cheating on me, but he knows how big of a mistake it was and I just want things to go back to normal. Either option is going to hurt someone and I have no clue what’s right for me at this point. I just wish I never broke up with him and started this mess in the first place. Can someone help me?",22Sep2019,1
61,"Typical relationship stuff...but I'm not very experienced so thought I would ask for some advice here.

There's this girl I've been hanging with lately. We get along super well and she's cute and I feel like I can totally be myself around her, which doesn't often happen around girls...

So we watched a movie together yesterday and one thing leading to another, we ended up making out. Nothing more, but since neither of us is particularly experienced, kind of a big deal for us. She ended up asking if this means we are dating and I said, ""do you want it to?"" To which she replied yes, and I said ""sure""...

Fast forward to today, I think I may have rushed things a bit. I like her, she's pretty awesome, and we get along great. But I'm not quite sure I want to commit to anything with her...but it seems as though I already have. Which is giving me crazy anxiety and guilt today. It's not that I don't like her or that there's anything wrong with her, but after we made out, she was just...so happy about it. And honestly speaking, I know she's more pumped about it than I am. I didn't kiss her for no reason -- I do like her and enjoy spending time with her, and I've been entertaining the idea of us dating for a while now. But...Idk I'm hesitant to commit to anything for some reason, and my gut tells me it's because I'm just not as into her as she is into me...

Which comes to the advice part...I'm not quite sure what to do now. She's mentioned the fact that we're ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" a bunch now, and it's honestly scaring me a bit. Like, if I'm not sure of my own feelings about this, I really shouldn't be committing to anything because it'll be leading her on and I don't want to do that, and I already feel guilty...

So what should I do? I feel like I need to talk to her about it and be honest, but I'm not quite sure what to tell her or how to do it. If I just ""break up"" with her, it just looks bad and she'll be like ""why did you kiss me then""...to which I honestly have to say because in the moment I really wanted to. But now I'm kind of scared and the whole boyfriend-girlfriend thing is just a bit much for me right now...",22Sep2019,2

65,"Hi. 
I am supposed to move in 10 days. 
I did not sign the lease. I paid a $400 deposit to hold the apartment &amp; verbally agreed to sign the lease.

66,"I was an asshole to her. In the beginning I would call her names. I would argue all the time with her. My parents are like this and they’re fine two minutes later. I didn’t realize it hurt her so much. I stopped calling her names after she told me. I was still critical of things she did. I’m also very critical of myself. 

I was controlling over somethings. She worked everyday but Sunday. We lived an hour from her work and family so when she wanted to go to her family on Sunday, I would suggest (with a shitty tone) to go on a day where she worked so we didn’t put miles on the car or have to drive another 2 hours when she’d be down there every other day. She had an older car and we had a $10k expense coming up so we had to save and couldn’t have something happen to the car. Still shouldn’t have done that. 

I have anxiety and just worried about her a lot and our future. This made me text her whenever she was scheduled to get out and call her if she was late. Partly because I had anxiety over her driving an hour at night and partly because I just wanted to see her. Worrying about the future made me put a lot of pressure on both of us money wise. 

There were some more issues like codependency for both of us but I’d say 80% of the relationship was really good. I would do anything for her. I was there for her at her worst times and she was for me too. I looked forward to every night with her. We were madly in love and I ruined it. Feels like I’ll never have that bond and I just can’t deal with it. 

I’m in therapy working on myself. She says she’d be open to trying again later. I hope I can work on things and just be better. We were young (20) when we met and moved in quickly after which was a mistake. So many things I wish I did differently",22Sep2019,3
67,"This happened last night. She’s 19 he’s 24 he left at 910 and idk when he came back sometime after 920 pm.  Omg shift ends at 930 but his more like 11. Now did I see it in person? No. I left. And I’m sure it was put into the car to Avoid cameras. 

He knew it was a bad idea and didn’t want to at first and I was actually surprised when he left. And then she stayed. It was for her and her friend that was coming over to her parents house. 

I’m not sure if u should actually say something or just keep it a secret until one of them aggregates me to where I snitch. 

Snitching isn’t cool but Dahm that’s illegal af. The other girl is also a manger but not that day. Everyone over here is underage so I’d have to complain to the owner as it is a privately owned business. 

If you’re wondering if like the manager it’s a no. One time he pretty much said for me to put a gun to my head in the work group chat. I filed a complaint and lost hours because I couldn’t work with him cuz that’s what was best. And it was but You can guess he is still here however it was because they needed him. He only works one day a week now and no one would care if he left he specifically asked for people not to ask for help on his off days like with the things that break that someone might not know. He got a degree and said he was quitting before summer then after summer and look who’s still here. 

I’ve been thinking about it mostly because it’s illegal and I was somewhat part of it. It’s like they tried to keep it low because if anyone is gonna rat it’s gonna be ya boy. For the reasons mentioned. He doesn’t talk to me unless it’s about work because of that whole incident. 

Would anyone be upset? Maybe his favorite coworker and maybe that girl but since everyone else underage I don’t think so. 

Or do I just keep silent and hold on to it. 

Technically I am making something out of essentially nothing. 

I only work on the weekend so it’s like do I bring more stress into my life? But then it’s like see something say something ya know.

68,"I find that most of the time my memory is very poor, or I have to be reminded/cannot recall things without help. I feel like I retain things, but have trouble revisiting them.

I also feel like I am quite slow. I can pick up new things and learn easily enough, but it takes me time to get focused and to work through something. I am wondering if there is any kind of exercise/ meditation I could do to work on this. To be clear, this is not hindering me in life. I recently graduated university and have a job in my field of study that is challenging. My career involves a long series of professional exams so I also spend time studying/ doing problems that keep my mind active. I just take some time to get there/need certain conditions to get my mind working. 

I also feel like sometimes I am on autopilot. My mind is focused fully on whatever is in front of me, so that I don't consider anything beyond that (in a strategic board game, I might focus 100% on playing to the rules of the game and forget to keep an eye on my opponents. I may miss opportunities because I'm not playing aggressively because I'm so focused on my own stuff. One time a friend asked me to get her box of tools for her and pointed in a general direction. I saw a box and a plastic container of tools there. In my mind, she said box, so I went straight for the box and did not have a second thought about whether she had meant the container. I feel like my mind takes what it sees and then shuts off, with no further consideration. 

It may also be worth mentioning that I am quite an anxious person and that I tend to overthink and repeatedly analyze things that are worrying me. I often think about how others are perceiving me and this makes me feel awkward/nervous around others sometimes. When I'm talking to someone, I may be distracted by the impressions others might get that hear our conversation.

69,"I hate my brother. He is one of the most inconsiderate, spoiled people you'd ever meet if you were related to him. He is obese. There's nothing wrong with being overweight a little bit.

71,"Alright, so a little insight into my situation. My name is Theodore, I’m 17 years old and I will be 18 in October 29th of this year (about one month and 8 days from when this post was made). My father left before I was born, and my mom moved out when I was about 10 to live with her new husband. This left me to be stuck with my grandparents. They are extremely abusive, but more so my grandma. She uses me as her personal emotional punching bag and has only just recently stopped physically hurting me because I am now big enough to fight back. On top of just the normal emotional abuse, I am transgender and bisexual, which has led to many arguments with both of my grandparents, but that’s not my biggest concern at the moment.

My breaking point was just last week. I had been extremely stressed and depressed. I was on the verge of extreme anxiety attacks all the time and I was turning to self harm, and I couldn’t figure out why. My grandma admitted she had decreased my anxiety medicine without telling me. She won’t let me organize my own medicine because she believes I will try to OD if I do. Today, she grabbed my wrist and pulled my sleeve up and started screaming at me for not telling her what I had done. When I told her that she was the one who decreased my medicine, she told me not to turn it around on her. 

While you may not agree with me, I think it’s in my best interest to get out of this situation. I feel like it is extremely detrimental on my mental and physical health at this point, but I have a problem. I have nothing. She hasn’t allowed me to get a job. All of my income comes from her. I can’t afford an apartment, food, bills, medicine, college, etc. without her. She knows this, and she definitely uses it against me. Today she threatened me saying I can’t go away to college, and I feel pretty stuck.

If there’s anyone out there who has moved out right when they turned 18, do you have any advice on how to do it? I’m not asking for you to change your mind on my decision, because I’m going to leave one way or another. I just want some advice on how I can survive on my own. Thank you in advance to anyone who gives any advice. I still really want to go to college some day, even if I can’t do it now. I just really need some advice on how I can get a decently stable life before focusing on other things. I genuinely don’t even know where to start.

TLDR; I have a very bad family situation involving emotional and physical abuse, and I have decided to leave at 18, but I need advice on how to survive when I have no money.",22Sep2019,10
72,"Okay so here's the story: My boyfriend and I got a pair of super nice Southern Tier Pumpkin King glasses while we were on vacation at the end of August. PREFACE: I live with 3 other people not including my boyfriend and I. Neither me or my boyfriend have used these glasses since I cleaned them and placed them in the cabinet after vacation. My roommate and her boyfriend have been using these glasses RELIGIOUSLY. Like every-time they drink, which is every weekend, they use MY glasses. Now for the most part I don't mind them using my glassware but heres the catch.... Fast forward to today: I go up to pour a glass of wine and use my glass and there is only one sitting in the sink. The couple comes down and admits to using them but claims that they cleaned one, but the other was dirty in the sink. Well, the glass I ended up using was the one that was dirty in the sink. SO the CLEAN glass is missing. I ask my other roommate and she admits to cleaning up a broken glass yesterday, but doesn't know if it was from her using the drying rack or the couple's cat jumping on the counter. Regardless of who broke it, the individual roommate offered to buy me another glass feeling guilty as she may have been responsible for breaking it. However, I'm not mad at her. I know accidents happen. BUT couldn't this entire thing be avoided if 1.) They didn't use my glasses and 2.) If they put them away after they cleaned them? They refuse to take responsibility for this and it is extremely upsetting to me. My boyfriend and I will never get to share a bottle of wine and relive those memories together now. AM I CRAZY? OR DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND BUY US A NEW GLASS? Their justification is ""Well I didn't break it so I'm not buying you a new one.""

I'm the oldest of three brothers.

81,"Hi all, 

I need some advice. I’ve been working at my current job for about 2 years now. I started working here part time while in college and have continued to do so since I graduated in June 2018. 

While it has its pros and cons, it is, generally, a job I very much enjoy., and I would like nothing more than to continue to work here. The only problem is, there aren’t enough full time positions available, and the part time hours aren’t consistent.  Furthermore, Even when I’m getting 30+ hours a week, I still don’t make very much because it is hourly pay. 

From early on, I expressed my interest in working full time. And when I was about to graduate, I explained that while I would love to stay and work here, it would need to be full time. I was encouraged to hear that more full time positions would open up, and so I decided to tough it out and continue working PT in the hope that id move to FT soon. 

Fast forward to now, and I’m still working part time. Since April of this year, I’ve been told that a position will open up and to continue being patient. In July, I was told that it would happen soon and that I should, again, continue to be patient. But come August, the narrative changed from “it’ll happen soon” to “depends on budget stuff” and now I’m not sure when or if a full time position will open up this year. Needless to say, I was very disappointed to hear this, and I’m sure it showed. 

So this is my predicament: Should I continue to wait it out in the hope that a full time position will open up, or should I just cut my losses and find another job that I likely wouldn’t be as happy at? Like I said, it is a job I very much enjoy and would love to stay at, and apparently the FT package is very good. but, I’m also tired of being so poor lol and it’s tough to see my peers making good money and advancing in their careers, while I’m still where I was in college, and still living pay check to pay check. Should I bring it up again? Would bringing it up again make me a nuisance?

What would you do if you were in my shoes?

84," Tl;dr: I’m 26F who’s mother refuses to give chores too. I have severe anxiety and depression and my family treats me the same as she does. I sit at home all day doing nothing and feel like I have the value of a house plant. What can I say to her gently to give me some house work so I can adult?

&amp;#x200B;

I’m 26F who lives with my single-parent mum. My dad is not in the picture so I cannot turn to him or any of my family for advice; as they treat me like my mum does since I’m the youngest of the family.

I have a spinal deformity which makes it so doing physical activity can be difficult, but so long as I’m not lifting anything heavy or for long periods of time I am fine, I also have severe anxiety and depression which has only manifested in the past 10-or-so years. My anxiety is to the point where I cannot go outside alone and have no real-life friends, so I can only go out with my mum. She has been treating me this way ever since I was born.

She’s fiercely independent, does all the chores of the house and goes to work 5 out of 7 days usually. I’m stuck indoors on my computer or playstation and feel like an utter failure as a human. When I ask her what I can do chore-wise around the house, she shrugs it off and says ‘oh do some dusting’ when the house clearly does not need dusting.

I would like to clarify that she has not taught me how to do any chores; I'm a visual and 'doing' learner. I learned how to wash the dishes properly at school. I don't know how to load the washer, cook, iron or even fold clothes properly. I can dust, vacuum and do basic cleaning stuff like that, but that's it.

The only ‘chore’ I do is feed my dog and give him water twice a day, sometimes medication because its time sensitive.

I’ve spoken to her about this before- how I want to be more independent and have responsibility and act like an adult in the recent past and it greatly upset her and we got into a huge argument which left her crying and me feeling guilty for instigating it.

I can’t cook- and the two times I’ve tried I’ve given myself food poisoning. I’ve tried to vacuum, but the vacuum we have currently is too heavy for me to use and when I asked mum if we could get a small hand-held one so I could vacuum if needed, she laughed it off.

My food is cooked, my clothes are washed, the house is cleaned, I do none of these, I feel useless.

I want to tell her that I feel more like a house ornament or a pet rather than a human being, that she’s not going to be around forever and I’m scared that when she does go, I’ll become homeless because I don’t know how to live on my own. 

I want to learn how to drive because I feel it’ll help with my anxiety and give me some incentive and ability to leave the house, but I have telephonophobia, so can’t make or receive phone calls without having a panic attack. I have asked mum to do the phoning for me, only it’s been on the ‘back burner’ for over two years and I’m starting to feel trapped.

What can I say to her to ease her into telling her that I feel like she values me like a house-plant without those exact words?",22Sep2019,1

At first i thought she was joking then after talking to another sister and her sisters boyfriend i found out she wasnt. Word got around in this little group of people about this and G found out about it and sent me a text apologizing. Now I, (whether it was deserved or not) just told her to fuck off. G said she thought i knew and i responded with ""if i knew why the fuck would i do that"". after some time i got some stuff cleared up. I decided to try and get in contact with her boyfriend and tell him because i feel like a dick and dont want him to have to deal with this. So i talk to S and she doesnt have his info. I ask for his name hoping to do some research and find him. Now this is where I need the advice, S says that she will give me his name tomorrow because she wants to give G a chance to tell him herself. Should i settle for that or should i drag a name out of her and tell him myself? thanks in advance for any advice.",22Sep2019,12

90,"Hello! I'm 24, F -- my friend is 22, M.

We are both college students studying computer science and met in a class over the summer. Now he lives near me and we have another class together. I am a bit introverted and don't often spend time with people but I also don't have a ton of ""irl"" friends, and he's been getting me out of my shell a bit. It's been nice.

SO- LAST NIGHT:

We were playing video games and ended up joking around about the word ""thicc"" and he got the nickname ""thiccums"" from his friends. Later that night when we were both home we were texting about it and he was joking about if he could give me the title of being thick. I joked that I was too skinny (I weigh 105 lbs). He responded by telling me I was still beautiful (which I wasn't saying I wasn't) to which I kind of playfully dismissed cuz I'm bad at taking compliments. He then asked if I didn't believe him. I told him I believed he found me beautiful. Then he went on to ask me what I'd rate myself out of ten. I found it a bit weird but I thought whatever, and said probably a 7.  
He then proceeded to tell me his rating of me (I didn't ask for it) which he agreed was a 7 ""getting closer to 8"", and continued on (all without me saying anything yet) to assure me that it's a ""damned good rating"" because I ""don't have to be a supermodel to be beautiful""... I still hadn't responded yet and he sent me a long text saying he didn't understand why my ""self confidence is shot"" (it's not...?) and that ""looks wise I am a catch"" but that my personality and intellect make me a ""bombshell"". All of this felt really uncomfortable to me. We were just joking around about the word ""thicc"" and then he went into some giant assessment of my appearance and if I am a catch or not, assuring me I must be even though I'm not a supermodel and acting like I don't believe I am (which I've never said or implied). He also has admitted to having feelings for me, in case that is relevant.  


He apologized today but made excuses (he was tired/sick/had a headache) and I just didn't wanna hear it. I felt oddly put down, but like I was supposed to be complimented? Like backhanded compliments or something. ""You're pretty but not supermodel pretty but you're smart so you're a catch"". Like ok thanks I never asked your opinion...  


Anyways I'm really bothered by it all and I don't even want to talk to him. It seems silly to lose a friendship over but it made me super uncomfortable and I feel like I don't even want to see him at class on Monday.

Am I overreacting or is this a fair way to feel? How should I go about handling this? I've already expressed to him everything I felt and he said he was sorry but I'm still hurt and uncomfortable. Any advice is appreciated.  


TLDR: My guy friend randomly, unwantedly ranked my appearance a 7 and assessed my datability in a really uncomfortable way that made me feel objectified. He said he was sorry but I'm still uncomfortable. What do I do?",22Sep2019,3

I'll spare the details but I feel very excited by the prospects of our relationship. 

Anyway, we are attending a show in a week in the same city my parents live in, I suggested that we grab lunch with them as I want everyone to get to know each other. This is my first ""real"" relationship as a self sustaining adult and it would be a big deal for him to meet my mom, dad, and younger brother as I haven't had anyone meet my parents since I was still in high school.

When I bring it up to friends that I'm excited they give me  responses like ""seems rushed don't you think?"" Which I respect but we are both comfortable with the idea of it and I told him if he wants to wait we can.

Do you think 2 months is too soon? I don't have the healthiest relationship with my family so I can't really go to them asking for advice on how to feel about this situation.

What are the ethical considerations here? She's posting nude material for consumption (she is OC creator verified). She mostly leaves out her face on Reddit but her profile links to other sites where you can see her face. In other words, she wants people to see her, but given that she's cosplaying (mostly) and using a unique username, and she doesn't show this at all on her regular, personal social media, I don't think she expects people she knows to see her.

(A) Support her paid content and let her know I do


 (B) Support her paid content anonymously 


(C) Follow free content only and let her know I do


(D) Follow free content but never bring it up to her


(E) Stop following her content and let her know I saw it 


(F) Stop following her content and never bring it up to her

110,"Hello everyone,

The title pretty much explains what I'm going through. I hope this doesn't come across as tooting my own horn, because that's really not my intent. Basically, ever since I was younger (and sometimes still) people always bigged me up about how I am one of the smarter people they know and I'll do great and all that.

About that, I personally never felt that way, I believe everything could be achieved with sufficient amount of effort, and I simply think the reason my peers think of me this way is because I'm extremely competitive and if I can't solve something, I could go at it for an entire day until I figure it out.

All things considered, this made me believe that life would be somewhat easy (financially speaking) and I would find a way to generate a decent income as soon as I started focusing my efforts on it. (this thought was between me graduating highschool and me graduating university pretty much)

Now I'm 26, been working an office job for the past two years, and very unhappy about how things turned out. It feels like the years passed me by while I did absolutely nothing.

At the same time, after spending a year in the industry, I don't feel like I could've changed much through my own efforts either. I got some extra work that I'm absolutely not qualified for just because of connections, and had to pretty much figure it out on the spot (the jobs went well since I feel comfortable with this sort of thing like I explained earlier, but there's no way I would've got these jobs without the connections.) I work as a developer for a decent amount of money in my country, but since I live in a 3rd world country, it's basically peanuts anywhere else.

For the past few months, I've been trying so hard to be able to compete with the salaries of better countries by taking almost every side job possible. I don't mind working the long hours, but as you all know, these types of things aren't stable, which leaves me with an income that I'm not comfortable with. I even resorted to gambling since I had absolutely nothing else to do with my time and I wanted to make money desperately (didn't end well - lost around a month of pay after series of very unlucky streaks)

I feel like I failed and I have absolutely no idea how to turn it around. I'm living a decent lifestyle, I can buy most of the things I want and save some money almost every month, but it just doesn't feel good enough (mostly because of how low my income is in the global economy).

Leaving the country sounds like the most viable idea, but I also feel like it's too big of a risk and there's no guarantee that I'll be living a better lifestyle elsewhere at this point (too late?).

There's so much more I would've liked to talk about and give details, but I didn't want to extend the the post for too long. My DM's are open to anyone who'd like have a chat with me.

I appreciate every bit of advice you could give me.",22Sep2019,8
112,"I am feeling really isolated at the moment and am sick of feeling this way.

I am a 23F and I feel weird even writing this. I never thought I would have this problem!

Just to give a bit of background, n the past I never found it difficult to make friends and had always had a close group throughout childhood and High school. Yet  I have drifted away from/grown apart from many of them and feel like we have all changed too much or moved on.

I've always liked socializing and thought that having friends in my life was a given.  This changed a couple of years ago when I started attending College. While I did not find it hard meeting people, due to the amount of people in my degree and how regularly classes changed; It was very hard to make long lasting friendships with anyone and therefore everyone I met in college became more like acquaintances. I really struggled during this time and felt very lonely. While I made attempts to be social, the friendships always felt very temporary and lacked a connection. There were also moments when I was conscious of coming on too strong. 

I am currently doing a Law masters and feel the same way. While I get along with everyone and we sometimes socialize after lectures etc.. I just don't feel like everyone else is as invested in it , for obvious reasons.

Everyone I meet already has a clique or have long lasting friendships of 5/10 years and don't seem to care about making new close friends, which totally makes sense given our age and that it is a postgraduate course. 

I am really close with my sisters, who are a year older than me and therefore always have people to hang out with and chat to when bored, but I really don't want to depend on them for my main friendships. 

I don't mean to sound arrogant when I say this, but I know I am attractive, kind and loyal etc and have been a good friend in the past and have had no major falling out with anyone. I am currently feeling just really embarrassed about this. I obviously want my friendships to happen organically but am finding it really hard.... I think people can sense if you are desperate for friendship and are not interested as you come across as a bit of a loner. And therefore you are not as appealing friendship-wise. Objectively I think  I would feel the same way if I were in their position. 

I know I have rambled a bit but am just wondering if anyone else has ever felt this way and how they got out of it/moved forward.  I understand that joining clubs/activities would help, but for much of the time it feels geared towards an older age group. Yet I can't exactly randomly approach strangers at bars either. I just want to develop strong friendships naturally but without coming across as strange or desperate if that makes sense? Any advice would be appreciated!

Also don't mean to sound really self pitying but its just been getting me down lately.

Thanks in advance.",22Sep2019,1

My partner makes me so happy, she’s my best friend. We hang out as much as possible, we banter, we play, we have great sex, but in between all of this she can make me angrier than I’ve ever been, and sadder than I knew it was possible to feel.
Before this relationship I was a bubbly, happy go lucky guys. I was known by my friends to just be that guy that was always happy, a relaxed guy that nothing really bothered. But since being in this relationship I feel like I’ve completely changed. When me and my gf fight it’s the only time I feel genuinely unhappy with life, and it doesn’t take much to make her angry.
I’m bad at getting my point across but basically, before I was with my gf I never really felt unhappy, now it’s almost a daily occurrence and I think that’s a problem. I’ve spoken to her about it, but it’s alway “I know I’m a bitch, I’m sorry” but she never changes. I honestly don’t think she can at this point. But I still feel so in love with her..

119,"Damn, if one of my family members sees this post, then that's multiple secrets thrown away.

About a month ago I decided to give myself a stick and poke tattoo (yes, I shouldn't have done it). I'm 14 years old and female. It's a small leaf on the inside of the ring finger of my right hand (the side facing me). I told my least trustworthy friend, knowing that it was a bad idea and would likely turn into the situation it has become.  She told her younger sister who is 13 who told my brother who is 21 at church, and who is the goody goody sibling, and also the biggest taddle tale in the world.

So this happened today. I came home from church and my brother told me he knows. My mum isn't home yet I'm unsure if she knows or not (I really hope she doesn't). My dad came home and he doesn't know (I don't think). My brother told me to tell one of my parents. I'm hoping he gives me at least a week to do so, but unfortunately he might only say one day until he tells them himself. I need time to prepare to explain this bad life choice to my parents.

Basically I have a few things going for me that make the situation (a little bit) better:  
1: Inside fingers tend to fade after a few months   
2: Stick and pokes tend to fade after a few years  
3: This a very lightly done stick and poke, so it hopefully won't last  
4: It is small and hidden, so it's not like anyone I don't tell will notice  
5: I can say I did it a while ago.

So I need advice on a couple things:  
1: How long is this tattoo expected to last? (and how can I make its lifespan shorter)  
2: How should I tell my parents? (When, where, what I should say, etc.)

Also it would be funny, yet terrifying if my family members who use reddit read this, haha. But I don't expect them to come to the advice section of reddit at least.",22Sep2019,1

124,"I knew this guy for only a few months, but we immediately clicked. We talked 24/7, and it got to the point where we had both called each other crying at least once. I considered him my best friend personally, though he clearly didn't like me that much. I was always insecure that I was annoying and clingy, and he always assured me that I wasn't and that he enjoyed talking to me. I remember at one point he told me he wanted to see a smile on my face and he would do whatever it took.  
He went through some tough times about a month ago. His grandfather passed and I tried to give him my support but he never replied to messages. After a bit of giving him space, I sent him a fairly long message asking how he's been. He said that he had been focusing on school and work, and not on his phone very much. I again sent a response but he never replied.   
Eventually, I snapped and sent a very long message, about how I was confused and hurt, especially because I sort of had feelings for him. He literally confessed feelings for me at one point in our friendship, but we agreed to not go forth with it because we didn't want to ruin anything, and since then I've been fucked up over it. He responded, saying he was sorry for leading me on and saying that he wasn't ready for a relationship. I understood, and I really haven't had romantic feelings since. I just miss my friend. My dumbass got drunk several weeks after, and angrily drunk texted him. I don't remember exactly what I said, but I remember saying something along the lines of ""I hope you suck your own dick for fun"". I assume that not long after, he blocked my number. About a week after this, I noticed my number was blocked so I assumed he read the texts and was done with me, though I really have no idea. He had also blocked me on snap chat and unadded me on different things. After a few days, he unadded me from Steam without warning. It was all so fast and confusing. I have almost no way of contacting him, except on Reddit though he'd probably just block me on here too. 

What do I do? What should I be feeling? And why do you think he did this? I think I came off as a little clingy and obsessive since he wouldn't respond and I would still text him every once in a while, but I was worried. He was going through a tough time and not responding to me. I've had to talk several of my friends out of suicidal thoughts or self-harm so naturally I just freaked out a little. I feel horrible, and I just want an explanation. That's all.",22Sep2019,1
125,"When I first came to the US I was about 10. I met this girl who I instantly fell in love with. She had problems and a crush on someone else so I was stuck at the friend zone. Then we stopped talking till I turned 17. The girl was 16 and we started talking again, but deep down I knew I never forgot her. At this time she had recently broken up with her boyfriend and she was gaining weight. So I, the guy who thought she was perfect, decided to stick around. A month afterwards we started to flirt but it never really got to any further since she wasn’t ready for a new relationship. Time went by and I wanted to forget her so bad that I thought I did.

The first week they were about to have sex but something happened and they didn’t. The second time, she shaved for him down there and looked all sexy, they had sex in his car behind a building.... and me being his best friend, he tells the group and I get to hear this. I don’t know what I am feeling, I’m in a relationship with an amazing girl but I can’t help it think that my long time crush just had sex with my best friend.

127,"1. Words hurt people. If you are upset or angry turn off you phone and wait a couple hours. Reference [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c2gu9c/tifu_called_a_girl_a_slut_dug_a_deeper_hole/) as my example

2. DO NOT put shit off. All this does is delay you from doing shit you dont want to do but need to. May as well get it out of the way 

3. Be smart with money. Growing up I never understood the concept of financial literacy (im still getting a grasp on it) and spent a shit ton of money. If you plan to retire at some point in your life and enjoy it. Start fucking saving.

5. Dont try to fit in. I had a rough middle school and rough high school years of my life because i tried to fit in. Everyone is different. Use that to your advantage.

6. If you want someone to be motivated to help you. Line their goals up with yours if possible. That way they'll do their best 

7. College kids go to class. Yo'u ll make friends. Enjoy school more and do well in school. 

8. Network. Just because you have the skills doesnt mean you'll get the job. Its who you know not what you know. Skills can be taught, friendships cant be.",22Sep2019,300
129,"Short version: I'm doing an exchange, I don't know how to make friends here and currently I don't have any friends.  I cut myself again after a year and I can't talk to my parents because it's off their line.  Returning to my country is out of reach because money.



Long version: I (F, recently made 16, Brazilian) I'm doing an exchange in Canada.  The main reason was (besides improving my English) because my father did it when he was 18, and according to him it was one of the best times of his life.  

The problem started at school, because I'm in grade 10, but as I had already learned the subjects. my classes were distributed in grade 11 and mostly in grade 12 so I don't have people that I have more than one class with.  And I don't know how to make friends here, I don't know why but it's extremely difficult for me to maintain a friendship here.  

I tried so hard.  I talked to my host mom, some teachers, and the vice principal about how other exchanges made friends before, but nothing worked.  And a teacher even said, ""But you know everyone here, I always see you saying hi to someone."" Yes, I say hi to everyone I pass in the hall, but it's called having manners.  

Not to mention that one person tried to make friends with me, there were three men who tried to make friends with me, but after they said things like “Here after 16 is allowed”, “The only kind of friendship I want is one that I  I can kiss you ”and things like that I realized is not the kind of“ friendship ”I want.  

My friends from Brazil don't talk to me anymore because obviously, I'm far away and don't have so much in common.  I hate being alone, but every time I'm with someone it seems like I'm bothering them and it never seems like we have anything in common to talk about other than the weather.  

I don't know, I just miss talking to someone, sending out audios singing, silly pictures and stuff like that and I know it sounds too shallow, stupid introvert teen thing but I'm not fine and I can't talk to my  because there is nothing they can do at this point, and going back to Brazil is out of the question because money.  

I've cried a lot, already cut everything I didn't have in a year, already tried what was in my reach and now it seems that I just have to wait to finish.  I stay here until February 2020 btw.

Now he has an apartment on his own and only goes out for class or sporting events to work for his internship.

137,"I am only 13 years old. But I think I have a mental issue. For 13 years of my life I have only eaten whatever I want. For a majority of that time, I was slim and skinny. But 6-8th grade is when things went south. Usually teenagers eat a lot of food and don’t gain anything but I am the complete opposite. It used to be where I can eat a whole costco size pizza and gain nothing, But now I can have a 8oz soda and feel 20 pounds heavier. 

Ever since this has started,  I find myself looking up “how to lose weight” and “how to lose belly fat” and those turned into “why do i feel like i am not enough” and “am i depressed or do i just want attention”

I decided to start eating healthier, and it kinda worked out. My parents both supported me on the idea and my mom said I was a big inspiration. But it really took its toll and I felt like shit for a while. I ate only healthy things and rarely had a cheat day. My friends at school noticed too, and told me there were other ways of dieting.

I didn’t listen to them and kept eating healthy, but I really felt awful and my friends kept (jokingly) pressuring me into eating junk food again. My belly fat was not bad and had shrunken a lot. I felt OK and kind of proud of myself. I decided to treat myself, and order in some burgers. After I ate the burgers I felt like 200 pounds heavier. It hurt to walk, and all I wanted to do was lay down. When I got up finally to go to the bathroom, I lifted my shirt and saw tons of belly fat that was obviously not there before and it was worse than before I started.

I thought to myself “I have been dieting for 4 weeks” why all of a sudden this happens?

This is when I started to feel aggressive, depressed, and even suicidal. I put on a fake smile and fake persona around people at school to show them that I was OK but I knew to myself that I wasn’t,

I thought how every other kid was popular and played sports and was skinny and slim and had a perfect body. It honestly kinda crushed me.

“Why can’t I be like them?” I thought

I tried working out and eating healthier, but I still felt bad and it made me even worse.

Am I doing this right?

Basically, I was involved in hacking game accounts in a game I was playing with a fraudulent video I made, where I was claiming to be the actual game company and led players into giving me their account information. What I would usually do is go on their account information and stole whatever they had on the game. 

Though, a couple of weeks ago, the actual game company sent me a Legal Notice to stop doing what I was doing and to take down the video I made. They contacted me through a Hotmail I provided in my video's description. I have since taken the video down and haven't received any letters from them since.

Nowhere in my video or on the Hotmail did I put any of my personal or real information relating to me. Would I be able to continue doing what I was doing by making a new email // video and starting the whole process again // just continue what I was doing &amp; ignore them or could I actually face some repercussions here?

151,"I'm 18, I work at McDonalds. When I first started working there, I was very shy and sorta had what my coworkers called a ""shell."" I wouldn't really talk to anyone because I didn't know anyone there, and wasn't very comfortable with them. 

But as time went on, I got more comfortable around my coworkers and began talking to people. I would greet them, and it helped me get over my fear of people in a way. I still have my moments, but I'm a lot more social compared to then. 

Anyway, I met this girl at my work, who every time I saw or worked with her, she'd say something like, ""Don't you think it's weird how they pay us so little while they make all the money."" 

But I mean, that's just the way it is for some jobs. Either way, she eventually asked me if I'd be interested in another job opportunity, and I made the mistake of not asking what it was. All she told me was that it helps people, and I liked the idea of it. I also just wanted $$$ at the time so I was willing to take anything, and I ended up agreeing. 

Well we went out to the ""interview"" and they started talking to me about the concept of money, the different types of people who make money, and asking me questions about what kind of person I wanted to be. 

Apparently it's Primerica, a sort of pyramid scheme that sells life insurance. There are all these motivational speeches about breaking free of 9-5 jobs, making your own money, and being your own person. They go to these weekly meetings in some penthouse with people they call ""mentors"" who supposedly make $50k a month. There are this big get togethers every few months where they have speakers talk about all sorts of things, and these events are invite-only. 

The main boss, whatever, in our district is always getting calls together and it makes no sense. He just rambles on and on about how people are always trying to make money, they can't sleep because they're thinking about money, and these people sit for one or two hours a night listening to it all. I gave it a try, but kinda half assed it. When I tried to listen, I felt like I was just waiting for him to get to the point. 

There's constant competition of being a ""district leader"" and in order to start making money, you have to become licensed in insurance, which they get you to pay for when you sign up. It was like $45, and apparently you pay $25 once every other month, or once every three months in order to use their website. I never got to this point, because we lost touch with one another after she quit at McDonalds, and I thought it was sketchy. But now she texted me again today, months later, telling me she's about to get her promotion in the company and still wants me to take this opportunity.

How do I convince myself to work in some shithole, dead-end place making crap money and just do it forever as nothing more than a means of survival?",22Sep2019,1
158,What’s worse toxic friendships or toxic relationships ?,22Sep2019,1
159,"The Beginning: 
So around two years ago, me and this girl dated, I’ll refer to her as anon. So me and anon are relationship had a lot of ups and downs, and in the end we broke up. It lasted around 8 months and it took around 2 months to get over it. We broke up because of the stress involved in the relationship with us both not being at the best mental state.

Present Day:
Currently a couple weeks ago, we started talking again. At first we were friends and it was cool and everything, but than I caught feelings. We both are at better mental states and it felt better. So I admitted how I felt and she said she felt the same. We didn’t think much of it and just went on as “friends”. We were able to hang out on Friday and there was some physical contact. As the days went on I really stopped and thought about the whole situation. If we are going to be friends we can’t be doing all this and saying we love another. And if we do want to than we are in a relationship (dating). So I bring it up and ask anon do you want to date. I explain everything and she says idk. She says she doesn’t really want to date anyone at the moment and isn’t ready. After some thought I say how about we go with this label, we are friends who have feelings for another but aren’t ready for a serious relationship. She agreed but than I had to ask anon another question. I asked when we are ready do you want to date, and she said I’m not sure. I said ok. It broke me in a way. In my head I’m thinking what is the point to all this and of me caring for her and loving her if I’m the end she starts talking to another guy and cuts it all off. So my question is what do I do? What is the next step? And should I be patient?",22Sep2019,1
160,"So today I was at a party, with some friends and my crush. We had a fine time. At one point, a friend said jokingly ""OMG I feel drunk"" to which my crush replied ""No, trust me it feels worse"". I thought she was joking, so I asked how did she knew that, and she said she'd had alcohol before, with some friends. 

Idk why, but that really shocked me. I laughed it off, but in my head I was like ""Wait what? You just turned 15 WTF?!. I can't stop thinking about it. She goes to parties really often, but I never thought she was that kind of person. 

Idk what to do, I feel like if I confess to her and she says yes, I'll have to go out with her and do stuff like that for her to be happy. Please, I need to hear someone's advice.",22Sep2019,1

Anyways, I moved 90 minutes away from my hometown. I had a group of friends I would always invite to my house. When I moved they cut ties with me, I should've figured since they would never invite me to anything and I would have to be the one to invite. I moved for college and its been almost 2 years since i started and I havent made any friends. I posted on here before under another account about not making any friends about 8 months ago and nothing has changed....I have friends online that know in real life but they live on the opposite side of the country. Ive cut myself twice and have thought about suicide plenty of times. I dont want to be in college anymore. It hurts seeing people in friend groups. People look at me funny, they always have. Last week I saw two of my classmates  talking about me. I couldnt hear them but I knew because they were whispering to each other and looking at me occasionally. Im too young to be dealing with this shit. I was bullied in middle school because I had a really high pitched voice, so I stopped talking. I moved another state in 9th grade and was still affected by that bullying so I avoided people. When I hit puberty I started being more social and made a couple of friends. They never liked me, when i look back on it they would always ignore what i said most of the time. I want to die. Im sick of this loneliness.

162,"I have had a bunch of traumas that have molded me into a skiddish person. Obviously one of the traits I have picked up is  low self esteem. My dad was deported when I was six. Which led my brother down a angry path of arrests and an eventual decision to make a life somewhere he didn't have the underworld ties that kept pulling him towards trouble.

When I was five my cousin decided to put his dick in my butt. He stopped when I yelled and he saw that it hurt. He said it was a game. I forgot about that for years.

I moved around a lot and in doing so never had any lasting male role models. I was away from my parents for a while. Don't have a core group of friends. 

I got with a girl when I was 20-21. She turned out to have many psychological issues. I do a bit as well but God damn she had some demons. She was as lonely as me. She was desperate for a child. Ten years later we've had two. Who currently live with me at my mom's house. We're seperated.

I am now trying to get back out there and I am completely lost. I have no clue how to read women. I get all nervous. I'm a bit too aggressive at times, pushing for sex right away whe they seem interested in me. My eyes are projecting something that scares most girls off. Which is something that happens when you  live most of your life in a room watching TV, cuz you're always in a strange place where you don't know anybody.

I've tried tinder and I think I or others have misunderstood what it's for. Alot of girls spend a couple of days messaging with me. Then when I suggest to meet they say ""oh I'm not free until next week"". We message some more. Then they just never want to meet. I do let them know what I want. It doesn't seem to bother them when I get sexual. 

I don't have a nice ride. I would think going to the club by myself would be kinda sad, plus they'd probably run when they see the ride. Other  than that I would say I'm an okay looking guy.

I'm slowly spiraling into a soul crushing sadness because of how alone I feel. I don't know what to do. Thanks for any helpful comments.",22Sep2019,4

170,"I have a lot of health issues and lately I've been feeling too overwhelmed by everything. I want get better but I'm not too sure where to start.

The first issue I had was becoming depressed at 12 and slowly developed a personality disorder, I'm 18 now. I feel like I have the depression mainly under control but the personality disorder is a bit hard to deal with. I'm very sensitive to things and I dont handle stress very well. So I either end up crying or getting angry which exhausts me after. 

The next thing was my sleep, I believe it first became worse because my parent has insomnia and always stayed up till 3 or 4am watching tv loudly. I got distracted by the sound so most times stayed awake until they went to sleep or lowered it. It never really got better and during school I'd sometimes only sleep at 2 or 3am and wake up at 7am or sometimes I'd only get a few hours of sleep. When I'd get home a lot of time I'd try staying awake but end up falling asleep for a long nap. Sometimes I didnt nap and still ended up staying up late. It later changed to me sleeping so much more than 10 hours at times.

Now it's still pretty bad and my cycle is so messed up that I'm almost fully awake during the night and asleep until 1pm-3pm. I told my doctor about this many times, she prescribed me an anti psychotic to help, it did work for a while but then stopped working as good. She told me to stop taking it because it's dangerous (wow) so I stopped and I asked for actual sleeping meds but she wont give them to me saying they are too addictive. 

I stopped eating as much years ago because we just didnt have much food, only very basic meals and no snacks. After a while my appetite became very low and I lost weight. I'm not sure if I'm keeping my weight stable now because I dont own a scale but It should be between 97-101lbs. My eating at this moment is really bad, I have 0 appetite throughout the whole day and I get pain in my stomach almost everytime I eat. I had gotten sick twice which involved vomiting so I'm not sure if I damaged my digestive system in any way. 

Another issue is having sexual problems. I know this isn't just how I am because when I was younger I got urges normally maybe even higher than normal. Over time this declined, I know depression does that and I was on multiple antidepressants which are all known for decreasing libido. The thing is I'm on a medication now that isnt suppose to affect libido and I havent felt any changes. I'm worried the past meds might have permanently decreased it. I can go weeks without feeling natural arousal, only when I force myself I can but a lot of the time I feel as if I'm not fully into it. This isnt a huge issue but at the same time it is because its another natural urge just like wanting to eat and wanting to sleep. The lack of these urges makes me feel less human like I'm a robot or just disconnected from my body. 

I have spoken to doctors and counselors about most of this. I usually get told to just eat more, sleep earlier, and exercise. I tried to force myself to eat which just made eating so unpleasant, now I even feel pain from it so I avoid it.  I tried to sleep earlier but I'll be laying in bed not tired and then my mind starts going and thinking of any random thing. Most times its unpleasant which makes it even harder for me to relax and want to sleep, if that happens I usually will just watch videos to distract myself but that doesnt help much with sleeping. For libido I don't really talk about it and I'm just hoping it fixes itself when I fix the other issues.

Everything is really bad currently, cant force myself to eat without pain, cant sleep early and when I try to wake up early instead I usually feel sick and very very tired. My doctor cant really help since she refuses to give sleeping meds or anxiety meds to calm me. I dont have family support either really and doing it alone is hard because my energy and motivation is so low.

Really long post but if anyone can suggest anything different or tell me what I should try fixing first it would be appreciated. Any tips for any part of this is helpful as well.",22Sep2019,2
171,"So the tittle says it all. My mom just told me and my other sister that she wants to divorce my father. You can't express through words or actions or really anything how fucking guilty i feel! First, for feeling kinda happy deep, deep inside since i probably won't see my excuse of a father that often. But secondly and most importantly, for fucking up my parents marriage of 12 years and making my mom question her love for my dad. All because i and my dad couldn't get over our FUCKING ego's! You see, my dad and i have been fighting for over 2 years. In the first year the fights were frequent but not as bad. But soon i had enough, and after another remark about how i eat too much and that I'm gonna get fat (I'm 135lb and 5'2) i came into my bathroom and took out my pencil sharpener (that sharp thing that cuts your pencil) that i got a day before and practically SLASHED my hand over how hurt and fed up i was. It went like that for a week until my sharpener fell out of my pocket. My friend saw it, long story short she joked how you can cut yourself with it so i said i already did and showed her my single cut on my left hand (i only cut on my right hand). She went pale and, again, long story short, we fought, she wrote a slip to my school therapist, and i went home like nothing happened. But the next day.....oh man. I won't bear you with the details, so i swallowed about 80-100 painkillers and lied there on the floor until my mom found me. The doctors say that if we waited even 15 minutes longer and i wouldn't live till 30 unless of some STRICT dietary restrictions. I spend 14 days in a mental hospital. There i met my first girlfriend (I'm a girl) and fell in love. Since we couldn't reveal who we are (we could barely tell our names) we just exchanged numbers and after all that, we were in a long distance relationship (2 hours away). We went on a couple of dates but the story isn't about her. After six months i broke up with her and that's when shit really hit the fan (wasn't because of her). I thought i would live a happy and AMAZING life, that i would go to college, get married, and see the world! But everything happy has to come to a stop. We started having fights again. But this time, they. Were. BAD. I mean like i hate you and get out of my house kind of fights. He threatened me three times already to send me to a foster family, but since we don't have a green card yet, (it's like a visa but you can't vote, also we're here LEGALLY....waiting) i would probably get send back to Russia. I will spear you the details of how AWFUL IT IS but to put it bluntly, i would've killed myself 15 times already. But i don't really care about him. I care about my mom. And all of our fighting has broken her down so many time... she can't stand it. It hurts her. But i could see already a long time that she feels frosted and unhappy more times than not (my dad doesn't rape my mom, he's just very manipulative and likes to guilt trip). So now, i asked my mom if i was going to fix it, will she still divorce him? She said that she doesn't know. I don't have anyone in my life to talk to so I'm going here. I moved away from my old school about half a year ago and really happy about my new school.

If you read until here, i can't thank you enough! I just need advice... what do i do? Tell my dad that we need to both drop our egos and be a family? ....in my dreams....",22Sep2019,2

175,"Hi, heres the story on how it happened
Btw im 18, Male

I recently had an interview for a job and at the same time was getting a ton of scam calls so I just turned off my ringtone but I wasn’t aware that one of them was for the job.
I told my mom about this and my dad overheard me, he then proceeded to call me stupid and gave me a disappointed look and shake his head left and right in a disappointed way. I told him you’re stupid for calling your own son stupid, then he looked at me surprised, immediately got up and punch me a couple times in the arm. I pushed his arm away and raised my voice and said “what was that for?!” and he said “shut up” and kept hitting me i pushed him away and he still kept coming towards me i punched him in the chest and he gave me another surprised look for like 2 seconds and he ran at me and tried to put me in a choke hold, I fell on the floor and then he pinned me and tried to take off my glasses.
My mom came in and broke it up and then when she broke it up he started to scream “ TAKE HIS GLASSES OFF”  (he clearly had intentions to punch me in my face but since my glasses cost like 300$ he didn’t want to break them) I ran to my room and started to cry, a few seconds later my mom talked to him and I heard him scream “That son of a bitch doesn’t respect me” 

How can I respect my dad when he’s done terrible things such as cheat on my mom. He told me he even got married with my mom because he got pregnant with me. He had my brother on accident (still love my brother very much). And is currently trying to cheat on my mom again.

My dad has always been hitting me, the most serious he had done b4 this was fracture my finger (it started turning purple), it was when i was 12 or 13. My mom told him to take me to the hospital. I had to lie to the doctors and told them it was a basketball that hit my finger (I can’t recall why he hit me that time).

So i’m really desperate to know. Was it MY fault or was it HIS, and what should I do if it was my/his fault.

Hey guys, I’m a guy in my late teens and I’ve just hit rock bottom. Been smoking weed for quite a while now, started off as something I’d wanted to try, then I told myself it’s something I’d do every here and there with friends - then eventually I told myself I’d do it just this year and that I’d quit next year and just focus on my studies. 
I’ve been close to getting caught smoking recently, but never actually been caught completely - until yesterday. 
Long story short, I come home and see 5grams of high quality bud that I just bought the day before on the table, I was shocked. My parents see all drugs in the same light as heroin (I know it’s stupid but now isn’t the time to educate them about cannabis). They’ve got little to no trust in me now and I’ve let them down immensely and that hurts me more than anything. It’s like I’ve been living a lie to them all this time and yesterday was the day in which the truth came out. It hurts, it really does - more so the fact that I told myself this would be the last bag I’d smoke for quite a while, whatever that meant anyway. 

Now I can’t even leave my room, I used weed as an escape from reality and now it’s gone. I have to face my problems rather than run away even though saying goodbye to weed is like saying goodbye to a loved one. 
My parents have been going through a lot lately, and this ‘discovery’ doesn’t help anyone. 
I’m so addicted to escapism that this morning a part of me even momentarily checked the garbage in hopes of finding the bag. A part of me wants to self improve but another part wants to relax and exhale all of my issues.

195,"Well I need like 100% true brutally honest advice. I'm going to college at an amazing school and i really want to stay however, i was living with my grandma. She just kicked me out today because she thought I was lying about my friend doing my hair and me needing to spend the night so it can get finished. I'm super conflicted because I was going to be homeless but the girl (F) said that she was going to talk to an RA so I can stay in her dorm over night. Then me and F will go apply for emergency campus housing. 
The thing is though, I dont know if I should stay. I love the school but I feel like I'm being suffocated. I have to be home by 10 but I'm in clubs and cant control the busses or lyft/uber. My best friend offered for me to come back and me and her (H) can get an apartment. 
Im so conflicted because the school will help me for my career of being an actress but im sick of feeling stuck because I cant afford to live on campus and they kick you out between semesters anyway; and also I dont want to live with my grandma because we just had a huge argument over a miscommunication. 
But if I go back with H I can still go to the school but it just doesnt feel as involved and like I wont be able to make it. I have until either 2 weeks or the end of the semester to make a decision. Im just stuck and feel sick.
What can I do?",22Sep2019,2
196,"Some backstory: I am a 22 year old who's never gone on a date before. This isn't because of my personality or who I am (hopefully, not the only reason at least), but rather has to do with my religious upbringing. In our church, you aren't allowed to court anyone outside of the church, and only court if you have a job, car and place to live.

I have decided to leave my church but my roommate is a Christian, and I quite understandably am looking forward to jumping into the dating world. However, I can't bring them back to my apartment or let my family or friends know about it, or else I might find myself without a place to live, and I can't do that again. I am working on going to college so I can get a high paying job to live on my own.

202,"I’ve always cared a lot about what people think of me. 


Just recently I was at my best friends 17th birthday party, a week prior a guy who is known as a bit of a ‘hoe’ or player posted saying that he wants a girlfriend. I had jokingly said to her “haha I’m gonna set you up with him” but I didn’t mean it at all... And she definitely knows that. I even said that I was joking but she proceeded to tell her boyfriend, and a day or two after she told me he hates me because of it.. I’m not sure why she couldn’t just tell him I’m joking herself.. but while they were on FaceTime I was about to say “hey @@@ just so you know I was joking. I respect you guys’ relationship and wouldnt seriously do something like that” so fast forward to her birthday party I notice him and her are very distant which was unusual for them considering the party but they tend to fight a lot so I wasn’t very surprised. Anyways, since she’s my best friend I was with her almost the entire party, it was also mainly her family and people I did not know so of course I stayed with her. But I noticed how they were acting so I asked her “why aren’t you guys talking? Is everything okay?” And she told me (not word for word but summed up as) “he’s mad at me because you’re here and he doesn’t like you because of what you said. I think he wants you to leave” so I asked if I should and she basically told me that she would prefer if I left so that he wouldn’t be mad at her and they could have sex.... so I ordered myself an Uber home directly after and left. 

Maybe I am just over dramatic and it wasn’t that serious, but that really hurt my feelings.. and I was honestly on the verge of tears on my way home. About 10 minutes after I got home she texted me “I’m sorry :((“ and I didn’t reply till an hour or so later because I don’t like texting when I’m emotional. I told her it was fine. But it isn’t.. she puts him way before me but I’m always there when she needs me!

213,"I have a boyfriend whom i love with my entire heart and would do anything for, but more than that i have a deeply ingrained fear of alcohol and drugs. there are various reasons, the main one probably being because my dad is an alcoholic, but it’s something i deal with and it’s crippling in certain situations.

mostly i get by just fine living in a tiny world in my head where alcohol and drugs don’t exist, as in my day to day life i never have to deal with it. but when something triggers me i crash hard. i’m okay, i guess, with the fact that i have this fear. i have an addictive personality for one so it’s good sense for me to stay away from it anyways. also i know i don’t need either to be fulfilled in life. the only problems are when drugs and alcohol cross with my friends/family/life and i’m forced to deal with it. one way that does is with my boyfriend, and it really shows the extent of my problem

he doesn’t smoke or drink anymore. he used to, recreationally, but when we began our relationship and he learned about my fear (fear is a weird word for it but we’re going with it) he stopped for my sake. he says he’s fine with it, and i believe him, and we made boundaries where for my comfort if he ever found himself in a situation (party/get together/etc.) where drugs or alcohol were present that he would tell me immediately and assure me that he wouldn’t participate. i thought that would ease my anxiety completely but it hasn’t. the thought and image of him drinking/smoking weed is burned into my mind from when he did it before. i cannot get over the fact that he did and thinking about it sends me into life-shattering panic attacks every time. i feel like i want to rip my skin off and it’s so concerning my sister witnessed it and almost called the police thinking i was having a seizure.

now it’s seeped into our relationship anyways. a part of me will always resent him for it. i can conceptualize that it’s irrational, but it’s a part of me and i can’t find a way to differentiate him then and him now, and move on. i don’t know what to do, it’s debilitating.

217,"hey y’all, i’m new to reddit so sorry for any formatting issues. i do not know where else to turn. 

this has been the hardest year of my life. it is all of my effort to make it though each day. it hurts to breathe. it hurts to exist. 
i know i sound so dramatic and it feels stupid to be writing this but i feel so lost. every ounce of certainty i had about my life is gone. 

i’m an 18yo girl in my first year at college. about a two months ago my girlfriend (19) of two years broke up with me after a shitty argument. we’ll call the girlfriend miley. i offended her and i guess hurt her so bad she couldn’t pretend to be okay with it. i am so deeply in love with her and genuinely want her to be my wife regardless of what happens between here and then. she’s told me she still loves me too and is open to getting back together at some point. she’s painfully straight forward and honest, so i know she’s not saying that just to spare my feelings. we’ve both been in serious, long-term relationships before, so i’m not just infatuated with her. i know i sound like a delusional teenager but even in moments of just clear, rational thought i know my love for her transcends just romance/lust/infatuation. she is my best friend and favorite person, and i admire her so much. she’s had a brutally difficult life, and i have nothing but respect and love for her. 

but i am heartbroken. about four hours ago, she told me she has feelings for another girl who was her coworker, we’ll call her sarah. i am so hurt that she has feelings for someone else so soon. i don’t think our relationship ended because of sarah because they haven’t worked together for that long, but i guess it’s a possibility. i’m honestly afraid to ask. i don’t think miley planned on falling for someone else or having a rebound, but the fact is that after two years of a generally happy, healthy, and supportive relationship she’s moved on so fast. i don’t understand how. i am so fucking hurt. 

i know a lot of people would suggest i cut off contact but i don’t want to lose miley from my life. she is my best friend and i’m not angry with her, just so hurt. i know i messed up but i didn’t think our break up would turn out like this. i don’t have a problem with casual hookups or anything, but the fact that she is emotionally interested in someone else is heart wrenching. sarah and miley aren’t actually dating or anything, but they established there are mutual feelings between them. miley said she is unsure if she actually wants to get into a relationship with sarah, but the idea alone sucks. 

additionally, i’m going to college outside my hometown (although a short drive away), and i feel so alone. after a month here i haven’t made any new friends besides my roommates. my roommates are awesome and i love hanging out with them, but they’re both in a sorority and have made other friends through it. i have friends from high school who commute here, but on their off days i am so alone. i don’t really feel comfortable talking to any of my friends about my situation with miley because they always say something to the effect of “she sucks, you deserve better, she’s not worth it, etc.” 

while i know they’re trying to be supportive, it just pisses me off. i don’t want them to trash her because like i said, i respect her above all else and she isn’t a bad person. so i’m alone with all of this chaos with no real advice. i’m not religious, but i keep reciting the serenity prayer over and over. i need serenity and courage and wisdom and i don’t know how to find any of these things. 

i spend all my time going to class, studying, and drinking. i spend time with my commuter friends MWF, but the other days of the week it’s just me and my roommates when they’re not busy with sorority stuff. i literally study for hours and then drink all night. i’m making As so it’s not affecting my grades, but i just want to be drunk all the time. 

i am lucky to have a wonderful family but we’ve had a shit year too. my sister (15) struggles with severe mental health issues and has attempted suicide several times this year, i lost count. my dad had an emergency triple bypass surgery this summer. it was entirely unexpected and he was quite literally on the brink of death. my mom has been holding everything together and she leans on me for support. 

i don’t mean to complain. i know lots of people have it a lot worse. but i was lucky and privileged enough to have a near perfect life for awhile after years of intense mental health problems followed by a long-term emotionally abusive relationship with a different ex. i had it all, and now my stability is gone. any and all advice is welcome and desperately needed.",22Sep2019,2

It wasnt one of those omg shes so hot look at her butt or whatever moments. It wasnt like that i mean ya shes really pretty but honestly if someone else saw her i feel like theyd say was cute or whatever and not really think bout it.

But from my prospective she swept me off my feet. Im not sure ive felt this before. Its crazy lol..

So my dream girl walks up to me and asks hey what you looking for? 

I had a game in mind but for the life of me i couldnt remember wth it was. It took me a second to gather my jaw off the floor and i tell her im not sure yet and if she had any suggestions. She starts going off about a game she plays that has a great co op option.

But as soon as she mentains about the co op feature and how great it was i like oh boy here comes the friendzone! The classic find a way to bring up her boyfriend in first 5 minutes of meeting me!

Nope! She lets me know without me asking that she co ops with her mom lol that was a huge sign of relief

I end up buying the game she was telling me about. It was actually made by the same creaters one of my favorite games ever. We went back and forth about that too. She was so cute and her personality didn’t disappoint. Seeing her and talking to her felt something special i tell you.. i had butterflies in my belly the whole time lol

I leave the store, go home, and now im here..

i dont know how to proceed here. My last long term gf started in high school and i dated a few girls i met at parties since then but nothing crazy. 

I dont want to screw it up if i have any sort of chance at all. I think shes probably out of my league if going by just looks if that was a big deal to her but im hoping thats not a deal breaker. In this kind of situation what are the steps to a point where you go on a date? Im already freaking out going over my conversation with her.

227,"Six weeks ago, my dad was the victim of a crime (he was hit by a car on purpose then the people got out and beat + robbed him) and he has been in the ICU since. We expected him to get better sooner but unfortunately his rib injuries developed into ARDS and then kidney failure. He is slowly recovering from that and becoming more stable, but it looks like the initial head injury + ICU delirium may leave him severely disabled for at least a year, if not permanently. I read to him and talk with him every day but when he opens his eyes it doesn't seem like he sees anything at all.

I am my dad's only living relative. He and my mom divorced soon after I was born, and his second wife divorced him a couple of years ago. He was living alone and still working as he has no savings post-divorce. We are now getting him enrolled in social security disability, but it will take time and at the moment he has no financial resources. My mom is covering his house payment for me. She is also helping with all of the paperwork.

I'm currently in grad school getting my MBA in a one-year program. I've taken a few weeks off to come home and figure out what to do, but need to go back to campus soon if I want to graduate. I would like to graduate on time (this December) so I can get some income to make my dad's bills--my savings are currently all inaccessible because my soon-to-be-ex-husband is suing me in the country we used to live in (LONG other story). So I don't want to defer graduation because I need money.

I was planning on continuing to live abroad--there aren't great options for my career and degree in the US, or at least not in my home state. I also have a new partner who I want to be with, but he is not a US citizen and would not be able to get a US work visa (in the short term). So we were both recruiting for jobs in our chosen industry in Europe. I was really excited about the life we were planning.

My dad's doctors are starting to talk about ICU discharge and sub-acute care, and hinting that there may not be any availability in rehab centers anywhere near my hometown. So I have no idea where he might go. I am terrified of the future for him.

I think I've decided to go back to school and graduate ASAP rather than defer, but I'm not sure of a strategy beyond that. Jobs recruiting is happening now for the types of jobs with pay that would let me cover all of my dad's bills, but they aren't going to be near him geographically. And if this hadn't happened, I wouldn't want to move home. But the thought of him staying alone in a disabled home somewhere with no one visiting him because I'm off living abroad... sends me into hysterical crying fits. I don't know what to do.

It usually is just temporary like 2-3 days (or even at the end of the day or some parts in between). I’m actually curious as to whether everybody else has regular moments where you just get sad and depressed. 

It’s like I’m just going through life, and I’m like fuck I don’t have a gf, fuck I don’t go out to parties with my friends every weekend, fuck I live at home, fuck I don’t know what I want to do with my life, etc etc. At this point in my life I don’t even really care about too many things, and I feel like something feels wrong but I can’t tell what.

I don’t know how to stop comparing myself to everybody, and I think bc my parents and family always hyper criticize me, that I think everybody else does the same. That’s another thing too, like what if my baseline for happiness is just really low bc of how I grew up, and for whatever reason it seems like everybody else is having a good time except me. I just want to not think about anything, and smoking weed has helped me cope, but it’s starting to not work as well anymore, and I don’t really want to do any other drugs.

I try so hard and sometimes it feels like it’s going nowhere, and I’m still some depressed fuck who doesn’t have basic life experiences and shit. Like what if I’m messed up in so many ways, and I just don’t know it. I was thinking of dabbling into psychedelics for this exact reason.",22Sep2019,2
229,"hello everyone. 

so, I've been living abroad for almost half a year now. I send money to my family every month and talk to them several times a day because they miss me. 

problem is, the vacation time is coming. I get two weeks off this October. next vacation is only gonna happen next year.

my parents are 100% sure I'm coming to visit. I need to do lots of shit back in my home country (extend insurance, go to bunch of doctors for serious medical issues, dentist, etc. etc.) as well.

problem is, the moment I think about going back, I'm starting to have a fullblown breakdown. I *really* don't want to go there. ever. it got me into a really bad place, and I'm not even sure I'd still been alive if I stayed there. I'm not mentally stable as it is right now, and I'm afraid if I go there, it could be the last straw.

I can easily come up with an excuse why I cannot go. but I also feel tremendously guilty, because if I don't go, my parents will be heartbroken. they're old and they really want to see me. I don't know if they can deal with me being away for another year.

 I've been putting off buying tickets for two weeks now, and they're almost 100$ more expensive than they were. I'm kinda broke, so the longer I wait, the more financial strain it's gonna put on me.

I really don't know what to do. I have to go, but it will probably destroy me. and if I don't go, I'm not sure if I ever get to see my family again. not that I want that, to be honest, but guilt and fear are overwhelming. what can I do?",22Sep2019,2
230,"To avoid getting too long winded : in high school, I had planned to go a very traditional route. I had great grades and got into my first choice school. 


Once in college, I started to realize that was not what I wanted. I did not think I would truly be happy with a job I got from getting a degree. Plus, the cost would ensure I was in debt my entire life.


Now I’ve been working a string of retail and warehouse jobs, but they are not fulfilling and I don’t want to do this forever. I will also say I found a surprising amount of happiness as a stripper. I worry that my life will end up disappointing if I try to keep stripping.


Now, work is harder to come by. Every job that I feel could help improve my station requires years of experience (mostly office/administrative jobs.) That means I can’t even get my foot in the door. For now I am employed at a temp agency, so work can sometimes be spread out and it isn’t sustainable in the long run. 


Ideally I would want to work with my writing or art, but I know that that is probably not viable. 


I guess what I am asking is if there are things somebody in my position, who must work to pay rent, can do to find a job that is sustainable and can help me not be a waitress for the rest of my life. My mother did that and it’s not what I want for myself.",22Sep2019,1

She conveniently had her location on the snapmap so I found out she lives in my own neighborhood.


 I have barely started talking to her on snapchat but we've had some fun small talk at work frequently. She frequently glances at me during work which is a good sign.

240,"I’m a high school senior, and I was looking forward to my last year being drama and stress free, however I guess my friends had different ideas. I have two friends, let’s call them m&amp;m, who I’ve always been pretty close with. I also have a friend named Max, who’s also a close friend of mine even though he’s been pushing my buttons lately.

Even though Max has been annoying recently I didn’t think it was a big enough deal for me to exclude him from group hang outs, but m&amp;m are completely vicious to him. My friends and I always hang out in big groups, so it’s almost impossible to not invite Max, and instead of just confronting Max, m&amp;m will be complete assholes the whole time we’re all hanging out. By assholes I mean whispering in corners, texting each-other when they’re two feet away about Max, and straight up ignoring him. Even though they claim they’re just annoyed at Max, it doesn’t matter because it affects the energy of the whole group. It’s honestly getting pretty exhausting to be around them. It’s also interesting how Max didn’t even outright do anything, being slightly annoying doesn’t mean you deserve to get treated like shit by your own friends. 

I know this seems like one thing but the way I see it, if its so easy for them to turn against Max for no reason and warning, who says they won’t do it to me?

The only reason why I’m hesitating to cut them off is that with senior year comes stuff like homecoming, Halloween parties, and prom. If I cut them off I don’t know if I’ll have friends to do this stuff with. So should I just swallow my pride and deal with this toxic friend group? Or take the risk and leave?

Worth noting- m&amp;m did the same exact thing to Max last year and tried getting him kicked out of our group for homecoming for NO reason. It caused our group so much drama and it’s going down the same path.

TL; DR: my friend group is extremely toxic, but I don’t know how to cut them off without missing out ”memorable” high school events.",22Sep2019,1
241,"I pretty much only made this account just to post this, i'm not gonna reveal names but I am gonna be detailed as fuck that way if the dumbass ever reads this I reached out to him somehow.

Basically it's all in the title, but for the best advice I should break it down from the start and since it's a lot i'm gonna try to make it as straight-forward as possible.

My mom and her (My brother's fiance) had a decline in their relationship about a couple months back. It started off with little things and the Fiance never being one to confront and rather bottle everything sort of let it fester and never really confronted my mom about any of her problems and will opt to avoid her in a way of giving her silent treatment. My mother isn't a cruel woman, just not a sensitive one. She usually can't tell if her blunt/rudeness has hurt anyone and if you're not blunt with her she'll just move on. My brother's Fiance however is the opposite and is very sensitive and an emotionally driven person, but not a confrontational one. It was a recipe for disaster since the beginning.

Well it all eventually boiled over one day when the fiance called my mother a flurry of insults (Bitch, skank, etc) and accusing her of many things. (Ex: Blamed my mother for the reason my own mental health is at a decline which i'm still annoyed at like come on it was a group effort brought to you by the WHOLE family and outside factors). Therefore as a result my mother told my brother he can still live with us but he has to lead a separate life with his fiance cause my mother was understandably heartbroken that he still wanted to be with her but didn't want to lose her son. She basically compromised and understood that she can't tell him to leave her but told him she wanted nothing to do with her ever again. And since at the time he agreed his Fiance took it too far my mother suggested he take a break from her, which he complied (Although his Fiance was blowing up his phone the whole time). It all seemed calm for a bit.  


Well I went on a vacation and during that time my brother had apparently ""moved out"" as in took a backpack full of his belongings that he could carry and went to live with his Fiance. He only left a note for my mother to find. This all happened, I'd estimate, about a month and a half ago.  


He doesn't answer any calls or texts from my mother. But also from my other brother or even from me-someone who was arguably the nicest person towards him during this situation. I'm also pretty sure he blocked me from XBox which is pretty fucking low and annoying I just wanted to play Borderlands with the asshole not convince him to move back.

Honestly the funniest part of this situation is that his girlfriend literally lives a house away from us. We're neighbors. I can knock on their door at anytime and unless I make a threat the cops won't arrest me. 

I personally think what he did was a bitch ass and pussy move on his part, at least the way he left by leaving a note rather than owning up to the situation and never even offering ME an explanation. However I respect his decision to leave, I just don't understand why he'd block both me and my other brother when the problem was with our mother.

I'm not sure what do. Do I knock on the door? I've thought of that scenario so many times but I don't know what I would say. Like I said I just want to play some fuckin games with him like we used to but for some reason he even cut ME out. There's alot more stuff that happened between my mom and his Fiance but this post would be too long and like I said i'm not even part of the problem yet for some reason still am not allowed to talk to him? My mother supports me just walking over and she even says that he's still welcome to come back.  


TL;DR My brother's fiance forced him to cut off contact with whole family cause she hates my mom. I just want to play Borderlands with him. His Fiance is also our neighbor so I could literally walk over to her house and knock on the door but idk if I should. This fuckin sucks.",22Sep2019,2

I'm still in a wheelchair. I told her that I wasn't comfortable having people over and drinking while I was in that state. She got shitty with me, but stopped having people over that neither one of us knew. Fast forward a few years and she moves her significant other (20f) in without any warning. By this point, I am out of a wheelchair and can pretty much fend for myself without her. I try to explain how inappropriate that it was but if she was willing to pay rent, I didn't really care. Things were smooth at first, but then the SO started giving my sister amphetamines (adderall). My sis turns into an abusive and shitty person on these things. Our relationship deteriorates. It all came to a head one night when my sis and the SO got absolutely obliterated on the adderall and alcohol. I ended up having to call the EMS and police because they were both out of their minds (trashing the house.  Even broke my damn xbox). The SO gets kicked out after that and they broke up but remained friends. Now to present day. My sis still hasn't moved out and that SO that is now her ""best friend"" has her isolated and continues to feed her these amphetamines. She (SO) has my sister convinced that my father and I are ""gaslighting"" her. I absolutely do no want to cut her out of my life.

250,"      Alright so this will probably be a long one. So I(21) started working with this girl(18) about 8 months ago or so. After a couple months in we started becoming really good friends. We talked everyday and texted each other all day and night. She had a boyfriend for a year prior to me even meeting her. Was broken up for a month that I knew her, but got back together with him. Even though she was with this dude, we still talked at work all day and messaged each other at night for months. We slowed down the talking but still messaged each other frequently a day. Of course I have liked this girl for a long time but have never said anything because I wasn’t gonna put myself in between their relationship. 

      So fast forward to about two weeks ago when we were messaging each other. She was saying something along the lines that no one really cares about her and only about two people do(her bf and he childhood BFF).I was confused because we know a whole lot about each other and I have always been there for her. I told her for the first time how I actually felt about her. Wrote something along the lines of “have you really not known that I’ve really liked you for a long time? Of course I care about you, always have. Have just never said anything because u got a man.” She replied saying she didn’t know and thanked me for caring and that was about it. The following week we had talked a good amount more than we had usually been recently. 

     There was nothing awkward at all really. Then within the last week it all of a sudden got awkward. Like she was going out of her way to avoid me it seemed like. She didn’t seem like she wanted to talk to me at work, which she usually starts the conversations. Even when she has bad moods, we usually still dm each other memes and shit. I tried dming her and she left me on read a couple times and never replied to anything. I was confused too because she still talked to the people she normally does at work and seemed somewhat. Then when we were talking it just felt a bit awkward. So now the only thought I have in my head is that she just purely hates me. Today at work, it was mentioned that she broke up with her bf. Now I don’t know what to think. Scared to find out she hates me tomorrow and I feel like I really need to ask her wtf is up. Anyone have any input on what they think happened and what I should do.

253,"Just a disclaimer: I don't know what he has. He has not been diagnosed with anything but my father in law and two of my sister in laws have been diagnosed with Aspergers and he does act similar. There is something that is off about his behavior as you will read below.

My brother in law (35) finally graduated college and is staying with us (me 29M and my wife 29F) while he ""finds a better job and gets his own place."" He is not paying rent because his only job is part time at a movie theater (the same job he's had for the past 8+ years). He told us he does not make enough money to pay us rent and pay off his student loans. Remembering how this was when we first graduated, we came to an agreement that he could stay rent-free under the condition that he look for a better job and paid off his student loans.

It has only been 4 months since his graduation and we're already seeing him take advantage of our agreement and he is driving us absolutely crazy. First he was caught watching TV at 4 AM in the living room (which is right next to our room) with the volume up higher than it should be at 4 AM (approximately 30% on a sound system). My wife yelled at him and he lost his temper and I had to pull him off her because he was about to throw her across the room.

After that incident we all had a chat after a nights rest and agreed that after 10:00 PM we were out of each other's hair. He did not like this, but we over ruled him. He has his own TV in his room that he can stay up and watch. We are not being very harsh with him, we just want some undisturbed sleep and personal space. At first things were fine, but over the past 2 months, almost every day there's been Amazon Packages for him on the porch and he purchased a new TV. When we ask if he can help out with groceries or utilities he says he doesn't have enough money but then the next day there's another package for him in the mail.

Additionally he's been waiting until the last minute to do his laundry which is also next to our room. He waits until 9:30 or so to start his first load of Laundry so he's coming back downstairs around 10:30, 11:00 PM to switch the load over to the dryer and he is not trying to be quiet about it. He essentially stomps his feet wherever he walks, rips open doors and slams them shut- this is typical for him but when you're trying to go to sleep, it is especially frustrating.

Overall he's a nice person, but it does feel like he may be doing all these things on purpose to see how far he can bend the rules. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to invoke his anger but I feel like I need to put my foot down because wether it's on purpose or not he's breaking the agreement. Any ideas?",22Sep2019,1

While on those dates my brother would abuse me sexually. I didn't end up telling my parents about this until I turned 18, and moved out. My mother refuses to admit what he did, and call's it ""childhood exploration"" (mind you, he was a teen when he did this). My father believed me and no longer communicates with my brother.

Recently my aunt (on my moms' side) has announced a large family reunion. Now, we have a large, LARGE Jewish family which means many kids. While I moved to a different state and my brother has stayed in our home state, and I had heard that he was planning on attending (the aunt who is hosting lives a mile away from me). Like I stated above there will definitely be children attending and my main concern. What if he tries again? No one besides my mother, father, and obviously my brother know about this.

I am considering letting my aunties and uncles know. Not out of spite or any type of revenge, but rather concern. I asked my best friends for advice and they only said: ""That's a dickish move, don't ruin their get together because you're angry about what happened. It's in the past"".

260,"So some context: I was with my ex and then we had some conflict that was both our faults. I left him and shut him out. He was regularly reaching out to me. He then met another girl on the rebound and got her pregnant, they had been dating a month or so.  (it kind of relates to my relationship with him, or atleast where his thought process was with that, on top of her intentionally trying to get pregnant). Any who he would still reach out to be here and the tell me he misses me, I’m the one he wishes he was with. My feelings never left for him but at the time as I said we both didn’t handle things the best way we should’ve. I was afraid of commitment and he had his own issues. He ended up passing away about 3 months after telling me “Where ever you are tonight i wish you the best for everything and i still will always love you” (07/2012).  And his mom sent me some stuff of his that he would’ve wanted me to have, one of those things was a letter he wrote me shortly before just letting out all his feelings for me, telling me he just really cares about and wanted to be in my life in some form or another, if not together he wanted to atleast be friends and just finished up with him saying he’s there for me and and he loves me. 

When he passed away and up till now it’s just fucked me up but I’m working on it and making peace with it. It’s just hard thinking about someone who I was in love with and who I knew loved me being dead. No second chances. I’ll never hear his voice. Anyways, his mom liked me a lot and we’re friends on Facebook, she really doesn’t like my ex’s baby’s mama because she is refusing to let his mom see the baby even after all these years. 


Okay so now with the context aside, I had a close cousin pass away the same year actually and recently my aunt got me a necklace to put a little bit of his ashes in. It really affected me and I loved it. It made me wish I had something like for my ex because he really meant something to. I’m not 100% if his mom kept his ashes, I think she did, if she did I wanted to reach out to here and see if I can send a necklace for her to fill. I had a ring he gave me one time, it was his engagement ring to me and it kills me that I lost it, I used to wear it on a chain. So this would mean a lot to me.

262,"Me and my boyfriend got drunk one day after going out with coworkers and ended up having to go to a good friend that works with both of us. I ended up cuddling with the friend and we connected and one thing led to another.. I let him finger me. I stopped it soon after he started because I felt guilty and he apologized profusely but we both felt good and terrible at the same time?? I told my boyfriend the next morning and he seems okay with it? I feel terrible for hurting him and I know he's just trying to forget about it but I can't.. 

I keep thinking about the way our friend made me feel, so safe and first for once. My boyfriend does both but I also feel like I have to milk it out of him sometimes.

274,"Well this is my first post on Reddit, I just need some advice on a situation. 

For a bit of context my dog, who comes from an terrible home before living with us, was left alone today outside in our backyard. He's usually well behaved, never really wants to bother anyone but admittedly jumped over the fence to go towards the front yard and wait for us to open the front door for him. However he hasn't done that in months since we made a habit of letting him inside for a few hours a day. 

He's a pretty big dog and to top that off a mix of Boxer and Pitbull. So to anyone he may seem to look like a pretty intimidating dog, but he's honestly a huge softie! He's never attacked anyone and even once protected a frog. 

However today we had to go to a family party, it turns out it was to announce my cousin's pregnancy, and when we came home there was a note on our front door. 

The note was from our new neighbors and they said that my dog jumped over the fence to attack their dog. They then threaten to call animal control if he does it again. 

Now I don't want to provide the note since she signed it, but it still left me with many questions. My dog was still in our backyard when we came back. I checked after reading the note. So did she managed to push him over? And not only that I know for a fact my dog isn't violent, he's not attacked or barked towards another dog unless he felt threaten. 

I don't know if I should confront her and get things sorted out, or if I should just handle things without letting her know. But if I do the second option, I won't know the actual story of what happened since she said he jumped, yet when I checked he was still in our yard. 

Sorry if it's long, I'm just worried about my dog since I love him very much. He helps me cope with my crappy life and he's a good boy. I just don't want a misunderstanding with my new neighbor cause a big problem.",22Sep2019,0

277,"So last weekend, I got a new twitter follower. Cool, he only had 18 followers, location set to a small country in Africa, so I followed back without thinking much of it. Then immediately he direct messages me. Here's a paraphrased snippet of the conversation:

&gt;Hey [my name] how are you

&gt;Good! How are you?

&gt;Not good I am worried and sad my siblings are starving and hungry

So I scroll through his profile a bit before replying. A few pictures of him standing on a beach by water. A few retweets of the Bill Pulte guy who's always giving away money on twitter. Then one tweet a few days ago of a delapidated house, crushed by a tree it looks like, and the tweet says something like ""praying for better days soon"". I did a reverse image search on a few of the pictures just as an initial litmus test but nothing came up.

And yeah, it could have still been a scam. But I decided to send him some money, because no one should starve, least of all children. I sent him ~$85 through a remittance service where it gave him a cash pickup location in his town

Well it definitely wasn't a scam. He was very grateful and sent me photos the next day of his siblings preparing food together and thanked me a ton. We've video called a few times and I've learned a bit more about his situation, he used to make a little bit of money by cutting down trees and selling them for firewood but now the government has banned it there. His family is essentially living on the street right now and he stays up in the middle of the night and sleeps during the day so he can watch over and protect them while they sleep in case ""something bad happened"" (unsure what he meant by that but it sounds scary)

Now, I understand that I can't solve the systemic problems that cause people to be in situations like this, and that there are millions of people in the same situation, but something about directly communicating with someone in such a vastly different situation than I'm in struck a chord with me and I felt an obligation to help.

I just started a great job and moved to a great city so I'm feeling extremely fortunate and lucky these days, and if I can afford to help this guy and his family at least survive I feel like I have a moral obligation to do that.

I haven't told any of my friends about this because I guess I still don't really know how I feel about it, and I don't want to come across like I just did it ""for the gram"" or take all the goodness out of a small act of decency by bragging about it

The only person I've told was my girlfriend and at first she was kinda like oh okay cool and aww that's good of you, but today, he called me and said that he just saw his mom and she said they don't have any more money left for food so I sent him a bit more.

Then me and my gf ended up talking about it a bit more (she was there when he called) and she feels pretty uncomfortable about the whole thing, and asked me not to mention her when I talk to him. And she feels like I'm being very naive and I shouldn't help someone else when i myself am not completely financially stable and I could lose my job at any time.

I did tell him I can't promise anything but that I hope to be able to continue to help a little bit, and that I hope they find another source of income sometime soon.

I still feel like I should help him and his family get by even if it costs me a couple hundred bucks a month. I'm not hugely wealthy by any means but I'm lucky enough to have been born into great opportunities and why do I deserve the money any more than he and his family who are starving?

I see it as a small price to pay to keep myself grounded. Kind of an investment in perspective. And hopefully once I'm earning more I can also start giving to a charity or some organizations that are solving the systemic problems too.

I don't know. I guess I'm posting this because I can't sleep if I don't get this out of my head and into words.

I've had so many thoughts bouncing around my head about this. Should I keep helping this person I barely know and his family? What if they never get back on their feet? How much is too much to spend on this? Am I being naive and stupid? Is there a better way for me to help? Is it wrong of me to help this person instead of people in need in my own city and country?

I just can't stop thinking about this situation and I don't know how my friends would respond if I talked to them about it, and the convo with my gf made me feel like maybe I made a bad choice by doing this, so I'm coming to get some anonymous honest feedback from y'all

Hey people of Reddit

I  am 22 years old and have been labouring for the past 4 years for work, I  have recently lost my job as the limited company I was working for  closed without being told of this in advanced; my boss owes me £870 for  2weeks work still and has blocked all contact from me.  
I live on my  own in a flat and  im worrying a lot about my bills, I will be going to  agency companies on Monday to find a quick job)  
Agency work isn't good pay but whilst I find another labouring job around my area it will have to suffice.

I  don't have family apart from my grandma which is in care so I have no  other means of living arrangements, I have qualifcations but after doing  4 years of labouring for bricklayers its difficult to find a fitting  job for my qualifcations that will take me without me having experience  in that field.

I would love to go  back to college but 2-3 years of learning without any pay would be  impossible? I have thought of doing part time work after college/ night  shifts but I also don't think this could be possible after a few months -  I need something stable so I can keep making money so I have a place to  live.

It constantly goes through  my mind every single day and night of what I want to do for work in life  or what qualifcations I would like to achieve, I love working with my  hands and have applied for apprenticeships these past months but the  salary isn't good on those either.

I  don't want to sound like I should expect a high salary when im learning  or gaining a qualification but I need to make it so I have a roof over  my head for myself

I'm honestly  struggling and worrying about this and I don't want to labour for the  rest of my life I want to use my brain and feel important, anything is  better than nothing at this point in time but im finding it difficult  whilst I come to the  realization that im in a hole of physical  demanding jobs as its all I can find for a job to fit my bills.

Recently moved into a house and one of the occupants always turns off the wifi before she goes to bed. I asked her to not do that anymore because I still use the wifi. She then turns around and says that she'd rather the house not burn down.

When I asked could she ask me first next time she said no, and that it was late (12am) and she was up early and that she pays for the wifi (untrue as the cost is split). 

She also went on to give out that I hogged the tv that she bought all of last week (It is in the living room and she never mentioned it was hers or that she wanted to use it).

She further went on to complain about me having my girlfriend over reminding me that I'm paying a single occupant lease (she has also had her boyfriend/a boy over). 

Lastly, she accused me of having a 'party'. Whay actually happened was my girlfriend, my sister and her friend all went out togetger and came back to my house afterwards (about 3am). We were extremely cautious and quite as we knew it was late, and went to my room to whisper about the nights events. Following this, myself and my sister went out for a smoke while my sisters friend left to go home. My sister slept on the couch and I went to bed.

We truly are the same person in many ways. We grew up together and we are who we are because of our influence on each other. He is now realizing so many things I appreciated before that he did t appreciate when we were together. 

He has told me many times how much he misses me and gives me extended hugs and texts me and says he hopes that we can hangout again soon. 

So he has a gf and never mentions her and never says anything positive about her and says he is giving her a shot but doesn’t think they will last but wants to truly see if it’ll workout.  We never dated anyone else before we dated so we made lots of mistakes together and dating others have personally taught me about myself. He is a very passive person so I don’t see him initiating leaving her. He said he wanted to help her be a better person while dating her but didn’t think they truly were compatible like we were (I agree, I’ve never been with someone who I was so completely compatible with).

295,"For some background, I’ve been going to church with her my whole life. I’ve never really believed in any of it at all, which is ironic and maybe even a little sad. 

I’ve done everything she’s forced me to do without much protest. I went to Sunday school when I was younger and got confirmed, which is a two year “program.” I was an altar server for 7 years and I even lectored (basically read the Bible aloud at the beginning of mass, I agreed to do it because I wanted to improve my public speaking skills and I quit after just a few months).

I feel like that information is relevant because now I’m just sick of it. I hate going to church. It’s a waste of time in my eyes. It’s not making me a better person. It’s pointless. I’ve figured that since I’ve done everything my mom’s told me to do when it comes to being active in the church, I’ve at least “earned” the freedom to choose if I want to continue or quit going, right? 

Unfortunately, my mom and I don’t exactly see eye to eye. When I try to get out of going to church, she takes away my belongings that are important to me (laptop and phone, which I both paid for entirely). She becomes extremely angry with me and refuses to listen to my reasoning as to why I don’t want to go with her and she just tells me that I “have to” as if going to church is a life or death situation. 

The real kicker here is that I just got a new job that schedules me to work Saturday nights until 10pm  and Sunday mornings starting at 10am. Instead of finally giving me some leeway, my mom now forces me to go to 8am mass with her on Sunday mornings before I start my shift. 

I’m sorry that this has turned into more of a rant rather than a simple post asking for advice.

Since there have been no updates on Videodeck since 2016 I don't have high hopes that it'll be fixed, so I've started to look around.

298,"I work as an EMT at my local ambulance company.  I enjoy my work and it's fulfilling but,  it doesn't pay the bills (not even really close, unless you work a huge amount of overtime). 

I picked up an extra job as a pizza delivery driver making a LOT more money to help boost my income. 

I've been very honest with both jobs about my availability. My pizza delivery job has been great! They always agree to any schedule I give them.

 However, my EMT job is not really being accomadating to any other schedules. My boss has repeatedly told me if I needed money to work overtime but, I've seen that burn out other employees quickly and would rather avoid it. 

What should I say/ do at my EMT job to get them to work with me? Any advice for navigating both jobs?

I'd appreciate the help! Thank you!",22Sep2019,1
300,"I 20M think I’m in love with my best friend 23F. To me, she’s the greatest person I know. I’ve developed a crush and of course I brought that up with her. She reacted very positively at first, and told me she just wasn’t quite ready to be in a relationship after what had happened to her previously-which is her business-

Anyway, we stayed in touch over the summer, texting and calling quite a bit, tried to make plans to see each other but unfortunately it fell through. So then we came back to college for this new year and picked up basically where we left off. I waited awhile and eventually brought up the subject of us taking the relationship we have to the next level and she told me she didn’t know. Which kinda got to me. So ever since I talked to her about that I’ve been having trouble sleeping, and have been a little bit more depressed. I feel like I almost have to hide the fact that I love her and pretend that it was just a passing crush. Every night generally ends with me shedding a tear or two or a thousand before I get my 3.5 hours of sleep. 

And yet she still wants to spend time with me, and this past week or so she’s been “clingy” -not sure if that’s the best word- but she’s been texting me and asking me to come see her and spend time with her, more than she used to. 

So now comes my predicament. Do I continue to pursue a romantic relationship with her, or should I back down and try to slowly forget about the way I feel?",22Sep2019,3

304,"Hello there,

I had a bad past with a lot of psychological problems, together with a dad that didn't want me to go to college, so i started working early on, and now i'm 26, soon to be 27 without a good degree, and i'm definitely not pursuing my passion at all. 

I started working in boring and mundane jobs like McDonald's, retail, and in the meantime i took Psychotherapy, ending up totally transformed, creating a huge passion for Psychology together with Psychiatry.I started reading a ton of self-help material, and also a lot of books on Psychology.

Right now i'm a totally different person, and my passion for Psychology and Psychiatry is still growing bigger everyday. This together with my history and personality is making it very obvious i need to pursue a career in it. The only problem is i'm almost 27 without a degree, and i already feel like it's too late.

Doing the most basic Psychologist job in my country would require a bachelors degree in Psychology ( 3 years ). That wouldn't allow me to a huge part of the jobs that i want to do, so i need a masters degree in Psychology ( 6 years), together with extra therapy certificates ( 2 years ~) to become a licensed Psychologist/Psychotherapist. 

All of this would be possible ( but very hard), the only problem is that deep down i think i want to be a psychiatrist LOL, and that would require me to go to med school... I don't even wanna say how long this would take me, but i feel like it's not possible and that i'm fucked.

306,"So I'll start off by saying I'm not even sure if this is the correct place to be writing this but it's worth a shot.

For a little background, my ex-partner and I had our daughter in 2014 when we were both 19, we were young but we managed and we had our own little happy family. Last year my parents had a nasty separation which concluded with me no longer having a relationship with my mother and my father spending a couple of months in jail. This really affected my daughter as she was extremely close with both of my parents, the following 12 months have honestly been an absolute nightmare and I really need some advice.

After having such a traumatic time, my mental health suffered and my daughters father and I separated amicably, things were great and we were co-parenting really well, we were all starting to get back on track when my daughter started to act strange. She would shy away at bath time, request that nobody comes into the room when getting changed etc, I noticed these signs but put it down to her kind of exploring the boundaries with her body/privacy. My ex-partner would have our daughter at the weekends and she would sleep over at her cousins (dads brother and children). One day she came back from her dads and was extremely quiet and somber. She told me that she had a secret with her cousin. I gently pressed her on it and found out that my daughter was forced to participate in oral sex acts and touching with her older cousin who is 10. She told me all she wanted to do was go to sleep but her cousin made her do it and it made her very sad. Ever since my daughter was born I have always taught her about consent and that nobody is to touch her if she doesn't want them to, she knows all the correct terminology for her body parts and is quite clued up.

Hearing them words come out of my four year olds mouth was absolutely heartbreaking, I felt every muscle in my body freeze and I felt violently ill. Straight away I contacted social services and a local children's charity for some advice and help. After that phone call, I rang her father and told him he needed to come over because something had happened, he was at work so couldn't leave and I ended up telling him over the phone. Straight away he jumped into denial mode, started blaming our daughter, called her a liar. I was so, so shocked as this wasn't the man I'd just spent 10 years of my life with. I begged him to come over and hear his daughter but he wouldn't and chose to take his niece's side. That was the last we heard of him.

Now, over the last couple of months since I found out, my daughters behavior has changed, she's become a different version of herself. She gets very frustrated and angry, she doesn't sleep as well as she used to either. I have also caught her touching herself and mimicking a sex act with her doll. When all of this first happened, social services came round and did a check, all they said was that I know where they are if I need them but I seem capable to deal with it myself. 

My daughters father hasn't contacted us since the day it all came to light, I have sent text messages, phone calls, messages on Facebook, begging him to come to his senses and see his daughter. I am absolutely heartbroken that he could treat our daughter this way, she has struggled so much over the last year with losing family members, her dad and now this and all I want to do is fix it for her. I also feel so guilty because I think to myself, if I didn't break up with her dad, then she wouldn't have stayed over at his house where this happened to her.

I'm writing all of this on here because I am desperate for some advice. I plan to take her back to the doctors this week. I also apologize if this is all very rambly and confusing, it's difficult for me to type out.

Thank you for reading.",22Sep2019,19

308,"He’s dated her for two years. We occasionally keep In touch. Lately he has been more interested in talking to me and texting me. We hung out for like seven hours the other day just talking and walking around town. We talked about how our lives have been and our dreams for our separate lives. He said he would like to go on vacation with me to his family cottage that we used to go to years ago. I asked why he’d want me and he said he’d want to go there with someone else who truly appreciates nature. 

We truly are the same person in many ways. We grew up together and we are who we are because of our influence on each other. He is now realizing so many things I appreciated before that he did t appreciate when we were together. 

He has told me many times how much he misses me and gives me extended hugs and texts me and says he hopes that we can hangout again soon. 

So he has a gf and never mentions her and never says anything positive about her and says he is giving her a shot but doesn’t think they will last but wants to truly see if it’ll workout.  We never dated anyone else before we dated so we made lots of mistakes together and dating others have personally taught me about myself. He is a very passive person so I don’t see him initiating leaving her. He said he wanted to help her be a better person while dating her but didn’t think they truly were compatible like we were (I agree, I’ve never been with someone who I was so completely compatible with). 

He’s also dealt with personal and family health issues and has been struggling in his life lately.

310,"My car was parked in a tight space and I was too focused on not scratching the sides of my dads car and ended up hitting my sisters car by accident, it was my fault. I only scratched the paint, no long-term damage. Lots of people I know who had some experience with cars says that the damage is easy to repair and all you need to do is sand the areas, and then  paint the area. I thought this was a good idea and I may do it with my car as its good life skills. I was going to practice with broken car pieces or even have someone professional give me a lesson, saving me hundreds of dollars. My sister refused and wants me to pay for a tedious entire car paint just for this one mark. She said that the paint ""Would've faded in the sun"" and that it would stick out. The car is Mazda 2 2015 and is a new car, no way the sun impacted the paint to the point where it sticks out. Even if I can't do it, I offered for me to hire someone professional to do it instead but still refused. I will be in debt paying for such a tedious process for such a stupid mark and will be recorded in my insurance as I only make $170 NZD a week. I told it to those who offered and said to do it without her noticing. Even if I screw up, I can just pay for the whole spray paint that my sister wants me to do anyways, so might as well do it if I succeed, it will be awesome, and if I fail, no difference will be made.

313,"I realize that this may be a weird story, but I'm posting it here in hopes that anyone might have had a similar experience and found ways to cope with it.

So in May 2017 I had a very intense breakup to an equally intense relationship. Though it was definitely the most meaningful relationship I've had I believe that I've mostly managed to get over her, and have had multiple short-term partners since, but for reasons I don't really need to get into the day of the breakup was a very painful and traumatic experience that still keeps haunting me.

The thing is, literally minutes after the whole ordeal happened I got into a scuffle with some two guys who rudely tried to push me away while exiting the bus, and it ended with them breaking my nose. It healed well and there are no really visible cosmetic deformations except for a minor septum deviation that makes it a bit harder to breathe through one nostril. Nothing too bad in itself, except that literally every single time I take a breath and feel the aforementioned minor difficulty I get flashes of memories from that day running through my brain. This doesn't happen only when I'm mentally focused on some particular task, so it makes it really difficult to do anything requiring deeper concentration or simply just relaxing. Meditating doesn't work because, well, how can I relax by focusing on my breathing when it's exactly the breathing that conjures deeply unpleasant memories? I was considering rhinoplasty but literally everyone I talked to, doctors included, advised me against, since where I live there's apparently a fairly high chance of such surgeries getting botched unless I come via personal recommendation.

So basically I've been stuck mentally reliving one of the worst days of my life in a constant loop for over two years, unable to let the intrusive thoughts go without a solid distraction, which combined with my already present depression and anxiety is just making my life even more miserable, and has led me to the brink of suicide at a few points. Rhinoplasty is out of the picture, and the therapist I talked to identifies the fundamental problem with the ultimate lack of closure from that relationship, which is something I think is impossible to get, especially by now.

314,"I'm terrified of next year.

Here's  my situation. On January 1st this year I moved to a city which is a  4-hour car ride away from my childhood home. I moved together with my  boyfriend at the time. I don't have any friends or relatives less than a  4 hour drive away.

But my  boyfriend and I broke up, and he's running low on money, so he said will  move out as soon as possible, which is April 1st next year. And I'm  terrified, because I can see the whole life I built up here just  crumbling around me.

Our apartment  is expensive, 500€ for each person. It's a real catch too, we were very  lucky to get it, it's modern and beautiful and not far away from my  job, and I love it with all my heart and it has become my home, and I  don't want to leave it.

Here are my options.

1. I  could live alone. I actually earn enough money to spend an extra 500€  each month. But after that and food and necessities, I won't have much  money left over for anything else. And that would really fucking suck.  Especially since I want to keep putting money in my savings account,  because I maybe want to go college in a few years (which is almost free  in my country, but I don't want to work at the same time then, so I need  to save up for that). I feel like this is my best option, but it would  still suck, and I won't really be happy.
2. I  could quit my job and move back to my childhood home. But I don't want  to do this. I don't want to start all over. I don't want to quit my job,  it's as perfect as can be. And I don't want to be seen as a failure.  And I was so happy back then to get away from my parents' place.
3. I  could try to find a cheap place somewhere here that I could move into.  But this seems almost impossible. Even with the budget of 2 people we  almost didn't find any available apartments which are less than an hour  away from my workplace. This city is expensive and not very available,  unfortunately.
4. I  could get a roommate. But this seems almost impossible as well. First  of all, I have social anxiety, and having a stranger in ""my"" home would  probably give me anxiety every single day, I wouldn't feel comfortable, I  wouldn't be able to relax after work, which is really important to me,  because at work I am sometimes so anxious that I cry at my desk or on  the toilet... Second of all, the apartment was built for couples: There  is only one bedroom with a double bed. There is a big couch, and  technically I could sell the bed and buy two single beds, but still, I  don't think I would find a roommate who is willing to pay 500€ a month  to not even have their own bedroom. (I would offer to sleep on the  couch, but that's not as easy as you might think, because I go to sleep  earlier than most other people, and the couch is in the main room of the  apartment (which is living room and dining room and kitchen in one). So  I doubt that would work.

So,  as you can see, all of these options suck, and I have no idea what to  do. It just feels like the life that I'm so proud of building for myself  the last 1-2 years is exploding in a few months, and I'm so not ready  to deal with it.

I don't have anybody that I feel comfortable with talking about this.

316,"Hey guys,

Basically went to a work party and had a lot to drink as did everyone else.

Left with a group of colleagues who I don't know as well and with one who I do to go to another bar, when on the way I witnessed a random guy being verbally abusive to his girlfriend.

Basically I ended up intervening in the situation and ended up shouting at the guy to ""be nice to her"" in a fairly aggressive way.

I'm not sure if the others really picked up on what happened but after I apologised to the group (to which one of the girls said ""it's ok"" and told my friend that the reason I was acting that way was cause the guy was saying some really mean shit to his partner (he was asking what triggered me).

I don't remember exactly what happened after but a few mins later I turned around and the group of other colleagues had left and it was just me and my friend, we ended up getting some food. I apologised to my friend after and I think said something about worrying about freaking the group out and he was like ""nah it was really masculine"" (whatever that means).

What does everyone think? I'm worried that I've given myself a reputation of being aggressive when drinking and freaked my colleagues out.

I have to go to work tomorrow. Really not looking forward to it. It's unlikely anyone will say anything to be due to the culture of my workplace (most people are just really polite to each other).",22Sep2019,2
317,"Hey all. 

I apologize ahead of time for bad formatting as I am on mobile. This is also going to be a long post, so there will be a tldr at the bottom.

To set the stage here: My sister and my cousin were dating brothers from a family that is notorious for thriving on drama and being druggies, my sisters boyfriend has dreams of being the drug kingpin of the small town he is from and laughed about 2 people overdosing on bad stuff he sold them. My cousin and her family have always been the favorite family and got special treatment from my grandparents, the cousin dating the brother ran away from the family due to drugs, but tried coming back once she got pregnant and had essentially been disowned by the family but was slowly being taken back in.

My grandparents and I had been super close, my parents utilized semi abusive tactics to get us kids to do what they wanted so I was always going to my grandparents for an escape. I would call them twice a week and I would visit them once a week for the whole day. They were super important to me, and I was always going out of my way to help them with whatever they needed.


The main event:
So as you all can probably guess, my family was not a big fan of my sisters boyfriend due to his drug history, and lack of desire to get a job and help my sister financially. They had been together for 6 years, and one year my grandparents decided he was not allowed at Thanksgiving, my sister in turn felt like she was also not welcome, when my mother told my grandmother this and that our family would not be attending if my sister didn't feel welcome(in October) there was no reaction. 

Thanksgiving rolls around, my grandmother had not called or invited us or anything, this is the first time in 25 years that we were not having Thanksgiving there. My sister calls me up and is crying, she said that my grandmother had called my cousin and personally invited her and her boyfriend to Thanksgiving yet my sister had not received any such calls. I was upset that my sister was hurt, and that we essentially were not invited so I posted a status on Facebook about how disappointed I was, I did not mention any names or anything, but my uncle who is not the dad of the drug cousin was pissed that we were not there and read my grandparents my post...my grandparents became angry and dropped all communication with my parents, wouldn't answer their calls or if they did they gave them one word answers. I come home for my birthday and my mom is sad and distraught over my grandparents not talking to them, so she convinces my sister and I to go over and apologize because my dad was super depressed that his parents basically abandoned him.

Our apology turns into a screaming match because my grandparents try to lie to our faces about certain events happening; my grandfather told me someone came to his shop and brought up my facebook post to him, this was not accurate as my facebook feed is hidden from people who aren't friends with me on there.  

We leave and my grandfather is still angry with us, he refuses to come to our Christmas party and continues to ignore my parents for a total of 6 months. My grandparents have not called me or anything during this time frame, I had called them once and my grandmother told me that it would be a secret that I called because my grandfather was still angry. 

I was essentially disowned by two of the closest people to me, and tossed aside like I was nothing because I was upset that my sisters feelings were hurt. 

A year later and my family is pretending that nothing happened, everything is hunky dory, and I'm not too keen on pretending like nothing happened. During the time frame of my grandparents not talking to my family, they neglected to celebrate my dad's birthday which had been a family tradition for ever since I can remember. 

I have called them twice since the Thanksgoving incident, and each time they were just talking about the grandchild who they think is the only one who has succeeded in life. 

The Thanksgiving event happened in 2016. I have not gone over there for a Thanksgiving since, I have really only attended family gatherings at my parents house aside from two cookouts where I went and felt awkward, have not called my grandparents since the last time I called them, stopped texting them, and stopped calling on their birthdays. I cut ties with them.

Two days ago I get a call from my mom, my grandfather has cancer for a 3rd time and it's looking like he won't be able to beat this one, and cannot be a recipient of chemo because of his health history. My mom wants me to reconcile and let things go, but I saw them for the selfish and manipulative people they are and realized that I had only loved them for the fake front they put up.

Tldr; Grandparents disowned me and my family for a while because I was upset that they hurt my sisters feelings, I had to apologize and it fixed nothing. Haven't really interacted with my grandparents for about 3 years because they showed me how terrible they are as people, and now my grandfather might die.",22Sep2019,1
318,"Okay before I rant, I got up at 4:30 and it’s 6:02 right now, so sorry if I spell something wrong or if my thought doesn’t make any sense at all. Okay rant time
****if you don’t want to read the rant, please read the bottom part where I give a short summary of stuff. Thanks****



I’m a 14(M) in 8th grade. I’ve had very low self esteem and low confidence since middle school started. But, soon I met a girl. I developed a crush on her, and was shocked to develop she did too. Eventually, we started dating. February will be a two year anniversary.(PSA to her- she’s goes on reddit a lot- nothing I mention here will be your fault, you actually helped a lot. Thank you💜.) This is where everything came crashing down. We started dating late 6th grade, and come 7th grade we were still together. Still being shocked, I started thinking of this entire thing. “Why would someone so perfect be dating someone like me??” This was a thought I had very often. I would always have shit like that pop into my head every once and a whike. Me being the idiot I am, I decided not to tell anyone I was having thoughts like that, and just bad thoughts in general. One day, we moved tables at lunch and sat with a group of people. These people really distracted me from those thoughts. I’m for ever grateful for them always being funny and kind. Thank you lunch group❤️. But there was one girl who was very dramatic. We’ll call here DG- dramatic girl. DG was okay. She wasn’t bad, or good. It wasn’t because she was different, it was just because she was not really who she acted as. I became very good friends with this person- and we’d FaceTime every once and a while when we just needed someone to talk to. DG would FaceTime me a lot, and I kinda get bored of it after a while. But I kept staying on FT with her for hours a night. I really didn’t enjoy it. I should’ve cut ties of with her when I first started noticing, “hey I hate this. Like a lot.” But I didn’t. One night, she told me about her friend who was cutting herself. Hearing this, I immediately tested up. Being on FaceTime, DG saw and asked what was wrong. I told her everything and it was amazing to let it all out. I told her I used to cut. I was cutting for a while before I told two of my other friebds, who I am also very happy to have met. They talked me out of doing it. Back to DG- she was shocked. I told her not to tell anyone- and she promised she wouldn’t. Monday, I get on my bus. DG’s friend she told me about was on my bus, sat across from me. I got a text from her a second after she sat down- “you cut too?” Immediately I texted back, “no. Who told you that? What do you mean too?” She immediately knew I was lying. “DG told me about the FaceTime call you had on Saturday.” I was horrified. Did DG tell my girlfriend?? Who else did she tell?? Who did her friend tell? Who are they going to tell?? Me and DG’s friend talked for a little while about our experience, and I almost cried. But i went through the day, ignoring DG. The second I got home, I texted her and we got into an argument. Long story short, i blocked her. This happened three times after I unblocked her. Not with the cutting, just stupid shit I would say at 1 am as a joke to try and keep myself entertained, she would use against me. I can now happily say I have cut that person out of my life, and will no longer speak to them. 

Now, I’m just starting 8th grade. I’m really nervous, and I want to keep thing I have with this girl going. Because I really think it can be something. But, this all ties into my rant. My low self esteem and confidence has made me really awkward. Which connects to my gf, because I just get really awkward around her especially. It’s not her- it’s me. I know , everyone says that, but I mean it. She’s this perfect prrson- and then there’s me. How can I be more confident and less awkward? Thank you for taking the time to read this.",22Sep2019,2

322,"I was an asshole to her. In the beginning I would call her names. I would argue all the time with her. My parents are like this and they’re fine two minutes later. I didn’t realize it hurt her so much. I stopped calling her names after she told me. I was still critical of things she did. I’m also very critical of myself. 

I was controlling over somethings. She worked everyday but Sunday. We lived an hour from her work and family so when she wanted to go to her family on Sunday, I would suggest (with a shitty tone) to go on a day where she worked so we didn’t put miles on the car or have to drive another 2 hours when she’d be down there every other day. She had an older car and we had a $10k expense coming up so we had to save and couldn’t have something happen to the car. Still shouldn’t have done that. 

I have anxiety and just worried about her a lot and our future. This made me text her whenever she was scheduled to get out and call her if she was late. Partly because I had anxiety over her driving an hour at night and partly because I just wanted to see her. Worrying about the future made me put a lot of pressure on both of us money wise. 

There were some more issues like codependency for both of us but I’d say 80% of the relationship was really good. I would do anything for her. I was there for her at her worst times and she was for me too. I looked forward to every night with her. We were madly in love and I ruined it. Feels like I’ll never have that bond and I just can’t deal with it. 

I’m in therapy working on myself. She says she’d be open to trying again later. I hope I can work on things and just be better. We were young (20) when we met and moved in quickly after which was a mistake. So many things I wish I did differently. In a really dark place at the moment, and I just feel horrible for how I treated her. I didn’t know I was being emotionally abusive at the time",22Sep2019,1

324,"He’s a complete loser and left her a month ago. Says the baby might be mine and just won’t talk to her anymore. He has No money, he’s an older guy but a waste of life. The chances the baby is mine are pretty slim going by how she explained it. 

They met in high school 15 years ago and had a baby which he didn’t acknowledge or talk to or send anything to his struggling child or the kids mother ever. Not a cent. For over 16 years.

He stabbed his brother to death, and was charged with 2nd degree murder but somehow he was only in jail for 5 years. 

He has a band with 400 followers in 8 years.... it’s bad to say the least.... he legitimately thinks hes going to be famous and tells peoole that he’s about to get signed... he demands payment for his shit music and gets mad when people want a show for free. 

But here’s the kicker, he has multiple children with different women that all have shit lives because of him. He demands payment for his shit music to play for 10s of people but he hasn’t sent any of his kids anything. Not a penny.

My ex says she locked her soul up 16 years ago after she got pregnant and he wasn’t around. Then when they met again recently she said she felt so good with him. Even though he’s such a loser and she knows it. He’s ugly. On drink and drug. She’s so embarrassed and hurt. He didn’t know her and I were still fucking. She was on birth control and took Plan B.

Her and I didn’t meet until 7 years ago and he was the butt of the jokes. She said she hated him and he was a sperm donor. Told me she Wished she got an abortion, when the kid was in the next room over, and like 12 years old... it was so brutal. 

I still love and will always love my ex, she’s not too happy with me though. I talked a bunch of shit to him(obviously) and she’s blaming me for him leaving. I talked shit to him over 4 months ago, no more contact and he left her 1 month ago. Doesn’t make sense. Her and I are the only ones who don’t think I’m the dad. It would just be such a crazy conception if the baby was mine, even though I wish she was :( 

I would never let my ex be alone for this even if it’s not my daughter. Even if my ex doesn’t love me. I made her make a baby registry tonight because she doesn’t have much and not many friends. I’ve offered to help more already. I want to help her because I love her and want her and baby to be comfortable.

So he’s gone and nowhere in sight... her and I have talked over 30 hours since Friday afternoon eastern, she knows I want to help her.... and she said get a DNA test and if it’s mine then I can come help her physically as she wants the baby’s father in her life and I’m so down 

But a prenatal paternity DNA test is over $1,600 CAD though. The Baby registry is at $1k already. I just see it as a huge waste to pay $1,600 to know what her and I already figure. And pay $1,600 to give him a reason to go back to her, because she’s so stupid and will let him. She needs mental help. Pay $1,600 to break my heart all over again. If I wait and I’m the dad I’ll miss out on everything I want to be there for or if the prenatal tests says I’m not the father then i paid $1,600 to never be able to talk to her again. When I could just pay $1k for a bunch of items and then wait to see after birth DNA test. 

She’s cool and a good mom, but she uses emotions to make decisions and choices without thinking of consequences because of her mental problems. Her life is in the dumps and another kid is going to kill her, especially alone. She’s had a tough hand dealt to her since she was a little girl. Both her parents and whole upbringing was so terrible. I always wanted help her since I met her. She says the universe hates her and she’s cursed... 

He claims he left her because I may be the father. Real love doesn’t leave though for something like this. I want her to be happy with or without me, and I want the baby to be taken care of and loved by a mom and a dad it’s whole life.

So wtf do I do reddit, I’m so confused and I’m not thinking clearly... look at all this spam above me! I just wanted to ask for advice...Sorry

328,"Hello Reddit! Obvious throwaway since my husband knows my main. First time in this sub. 

Little backstory on us. We’ve been married for almost 3 years. Our 3rd anniversary is coming up. We met on an online MMO and always have a blast together. We are not materialistic people at all. I don’t like jewelry ect and he doesn’t care for gifts either. We just like spending time together. Obviously we’re going to be doing that on our anniversary but what else is there to do but go out to dinner and have sexy time, you know? 

I figured since our first love confessions was over game chat and such, it’d be fun to exchange something similar like gamestyle love letters to each other or whatever. Something cute and different to do. I’m just not sure if that’d be a weird thing now since we just talk directly when we’re gaming and don’t type at all. I don’t want to come off as a school teacher giving homework or something lol (We also don’t play that MMO anymore. Just recently quit. Didn’t want to pay another month of it if anyone is curious.)

329,"I (17M) am taking care of my 5-year-old niece while she's staying with us for the weekend, and it's 12:45am at the time I post this. Right at midnight, I woke up to her crying and coughing up hard, so I turned on the light and she said she didn't feel good, and threw up on her hand. She hasn't shown any signs of being sick all day, and in fact, she's been pretty active all weekend, from last night's concert/block party to when we went to the neighborhood park at about 5:30 this afternoon, to when she was watching YouTube music videos on my PlayStation and dancing earlier tonight until 10:00pm.

To treat this, I wanted to give her a can of Canada Dry, but I didn't have any so what I did was give here a Honey Lemon Halls (which admittedly was kinda sticky from being in my backpack for a few weeks) to calm her throat down so she's not coughing so hard and causes her to puke again, and a coffee cup filled with filtered spring water from our cooler, put the trash can by the couch where she's sleeping, and turn on the TV to SpongeBob to keep her awake while she finishes the Halls. Now that that's done, I've put her back to sleep on the couch with the trash can and cup of water nearby.

Is there anything else I should try to help treat/cure her sickness, so she's back into tip-top shape? She had shave ice (aka a snow cone), a few granola energy bars, a musubi (sushi with just spam), and a hot pocket last night, and today she had saimin (shrimp-flavor ramen), CapriSun, and rice with barbecue steak, Portuguese sausage &amp; canned corn for dinner.

340,"Hello Reddit, 

My husband and I are having a rough time and so I’m thinking some objective advice from internet strangers will help me gain perspective. TIA this is a long one, TL;DR at end. 

Some context: I (36/f) have been married to my husband (37/m) for 6.5 years. I am currently 7 months pregnant with our first child. The majority of our relationship has been great, but there have been some issues that have hurt me greatly in the past mainly involving his drunken irresponsible behavior with other women and the ensuing humiliation I’ve endured. He’s never actually cheated, per se, but behaves inappropriately when drinking especially. He is a very social person while I prefer privacy and solitude and he goes out most evenings without me. We belong to a social club in a large city, and I know most of the people he’s hanging out with when he’s out and consider them friends so it usually does not stress me out that he’s out so much. 

However, and here’s my issue today, the evening before last he went out while I was out of town for work and some upsetting things went down. Here is the breakdown of the evening: 

7pm, I’m working in my hotel room preparing a big pitch for a client early the next morning. I get a text from a woman whom I’d been helping network and make connections for her business over the last month. I’d also introduced her to some folks in our (my husband and myself) social circle. She asks me if I am out that evening, I tell her no I am out of town for work and have an early morning. 

8pm, she texts me again and asks if I would mind if she went and hung out at the social club where my husband and I belong, and where he was at the time with a plethora of other folks, and I said not at all. I really believed that. She’d been very responsible and well-behaved thus far and as far as I knew didn’t even drink so I wasn’t worried about it and even thought her initiative was a good thing. 

10pm, I’m winding down for bed and call my husband who is an hour ahead so it’s 11pm his time and he’s usually home by then. He’s still out, and I can hear a woman laughing in the background amongst crowd chatter. He tells me my “friend” came out and is having a great time. Then I hear some rustling and she gets on the phone and loudly and obnoxiously tells me what a great man I have and how she and her friends wish they could find a man like that and I am so lucky. She’d clearly been drinking. That’s when the first “punched in the stomach” feeling came and my senses were on alert for impending humiliating stories I’d be hearing from others. He gets back on the phone and I can tell he’d been drinking too and I tell him I’m uncomfortable and would prefer he go home. He assures me he will leave shortly after wrapping up a conversation with a client. 

11pm, I’m experiencing intense anxiety because I know he hasn’t left since I would have seen on our Ring app his arrival home. I call again, he answers and I hear loud crowd chatter and again her loud laughing and carrying on. He tells me jovially that a couple of our friends stopped by and he was sorry and trying to get away. We have a standing rule to never be out drinking after midnight as that seems to be the hour nothing good ever happens after, also as a condition of keeping my sanity and staying with him after other painful things had happened due to his drinking. He assures me he’s leaving right then. 

12:30am I am losing my mind and can’t sleep, still no husband on Ring camera. I also was exhausted from not having slept well the night before since at this stage in pregnancy it’s a real challenge to get comfortable. I call again. No answer. I keep calling and with every unanswered ring I feel intense resent and anger at him making me feel like the crazy wife. He finally answers and it’s much quieter in the background, by this point it’s 2am his time. He tells me he’s in his Uber. While that assuaged much of my anxiety, I was still pissed and not very pleasant as he attempted to drunkly regale me with the evening. We hang up. I see the Ring camera alert, I try to get some sleep but it takes a good hour or so before I finally drift off. 

3:30am My phone is ringing and it’s the woman “friend” from earlier. It was 4:30am at home and I’m thinking ugh she’s drunk and bars have closed and she’s trying to chat or something. I’m annoyed because I told her I had an early morning and I’d only just finally gotten to sleep. I ignore it. She calls again. This time, I feel the “punched in the stomach” feeling and am anxious, so I pick up and she’s trashed. She very matter of factly told me “girl your man has my house key and now I can’t get in my house, you need to get a hold of him” I’m stunned, like wtf? I hang up and call my husband, livid. After a couple of calls with no answer he picks up groggy and I am so pissed. I ask him why the hell this chick is calling me about her house key that he apparently has, he takes several seconds to answer and says “babe it’s no big deal she just asked me to hold her house key, and I gave it back to her before I left” and I’m like “why would you be holding her house key? Who asks someone to do that?? Did she have a purse?” He answers yes, and now I’m even more like wtf. “Was it with her car keys so she wouldn’t drive?” He says no, that she ubered. I can also hear incessant buzzing from other calls coming in on his phone. He tells me it’s her...so he gave her his number too? 🤮 he begins to stonewall and tell me I need to get some sleep. I angrily tell him how effed up it looks that a woman is calling me in the middle of the night about her house key that he accepted from her, and that he chose a horrible night for drunk shenanigans considering I had a huge pitch to a client the following morning and hadn’t slept. He stonewalls again and tells me how cute our dog is that is snuggled up next to him. 🤯🤯🤯 I realize it’s futile and hang up. 

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night, bombed the presentation, and sobbed in my hotel room after purchasing an additional night since I was in no shape to drive and desperately needed sleep. I wrote everything down to sort my thoughts, of which this post is the lion’s share with some editing for a lot of cursing. I finally just pass out from exhaustion. I wake up in the afternoon with a splitting headache and several text messages from the woman that were basically along the lines of “teehee omg I was so drunk last night I can’t hang lolol” and about how men were trying to get in her pants. 🤮🤮🤮 not even an apology. I was disgusted. 

There were also messages from my husband that were an apology. And several missed calls. I’d turned my ringer off. I felt like crap and just wanted to get home, perhaps pack my things and stay at my parents where I felt my feelings were safe. I wanted to sort it out, I didn’t want to talk to my husband or the woman yet since my emotions were still raw and I generally don’t argue well and get flustered if I try while in that state. I spent the 2 hr drive home thinking. I knew the woman needed to be cut out completely, she had shown her ass and I needed to check that boundary. I’m still working on how to deliver that one without devolving into straight-up attacking her and name calling which would make me look very bad. 

Then, there’s my husband. After I came home he was very apologetic and honestly it has been comforting, but here I am lying awake again all night feeling like a damned fool. He may be apologizing, but it doesn’t seem contrite to me, especially since this is not the first, second, third, or even 4 dozenth time something like this has happened over the course of our relationship. It’s analogous to telling a child to stop jumping on the bed, which they do but then start jumping on the couch and say “you didn’t say the couch!” It’s as if he doesn’t understand the spirit of why what he does is wrong, and I don’t trust that he’ll ever learn. We have a child on the way and I am terrified. 

I don’t know what to do. Am I crazy? Am I blowing this out of proportion? 

TL;DR: pregnant wife out of town for early morning client pitch, flirty husband goes out and gets drunk with wife’s associate who proceeds to call the wife drunk at 4:30 in the morning demanding she have her husband give her her house key back. Husband plays dumb and dismisses. Wife doesn’t sleep from anxiety and bombs the presentation for the client. Associate sends several “lol I was so drunk” text messages the next day without an apology. Husband also messages and calls and is apologetic. Wife is scared to trust husband and is scared for the future of marriage and family.",22Sep2019,1

348,"To give a quick rundown, I live in a tiny Japanese apartment in northern Japan. My living room has a kitchen sink on one wall that has my refrigerator and stove next to it. 

For the past couple months, I’ll randomly gets wafts of what can only be described as either garbage mixed with cigarettes or rotten vomit. At first, I thought it was the sewer gas leaking through my kitchen sink, but it’s not that as I’ve been making sure that there’s enough water in the trap. I’ve also been keeping the drain clean from rotten food. There’s no rotten food or anything underneath any of the appliances or in the fridge. 

It seems like it comes from under the sink, because if I open the drawers under the sink, I’ll get another waft of it, but other than some pots, pans, and cleaning supplies, it’s spotless. No food or spilled chemicals under there. The pipes are also tightened as much as possible.

I’m thoroughly confused, because it almost seems like my house just “farts” this smell randomly. It happens maybe three times a week, and only lasts 30-45 minutes each time. If anyone could give any insight, I’d be super grateful. I’m constantly burning candles and have had my window open the past month or so to try and keep the smell out. Thanks in advance.",22Sep2019,1
350,"When my sister's baby-teeth came in immediately it was clear she had an abnormality. She had two teeth that were ""conjoined"" and had to have surgery to separate them when she was younger. When her adult teeth came in, they came in ""off"" as well. She has one tooth in her upper gumline (under her lip) and two years ago had a tooth in the front pulled because it was preventing another tooth from coming in (?). At that time the dentist cracked a nearby tooth, and it was never fixed. Now the resulting damage means that tooth has got to go too, so she'll have two teeth missing in the front.  
   
    
My sister's teeth have always upset her, but having two teeth missing in the front seems to be devastating her now. She asked me if I could buy her some masks to cover her mouth, and while I agreed, it's not realistic to think she can always wear those.

351,"For example, I like to run in the evenings so essentially everyday at 9 p.m. I will go for a run. Whenever anyone asks me to do something at this time I don't know how to respond.  Typically if something occurs that late in the evening I will almost assuredly not want to run afterwards because it would be too late. I also won't want to run beforehand because when I run I like to immediately shower afterwards, but I also always shower before bed and I don't like to shower twice a day. 

So as it stands I'm either going to break my schedule or decline the invitation to whatever it is. How can I better accommodate adding new things into my schedule?",22Sep2019,1
352,"Hi, yesterday, me and my boyfriend broke up. We had been dating for over 2.5 years and wow, it hurt. 

It was mutual, because he is dealing with some really tough mental health issues (self-harm and depression.)  I figured it would be best if we took a break so he can work on himself, but we agreed on a break up (because there is no way to know if we will gt back together). 

We agreed to still be friends and talk, and in the moment, I was fine with that, but now I am realizing how much it hurts. It pains me to talk to him and not be with him. It really hurts. I want to still be friends but I think deep down I want to be more than friends. 

I also am a senior in high school, and our after high-school plans aligned very closely. Now that we aren't together, I don't know what to do. I don't know what colleges to apply for or even what major I want to have. I am so lost. Any advice about any of this will really help me. Thanks reddit.",22Sep2019,1
353,"Throwaway, might not respond fast enough.

Hi, so my best friend randomly texted me 20 minutes ago saying he was halfway to my house, and was hoping I would come outside and join him. When I asked why, he wanted to suicide and me to join in too.

Some backstory: me and him normally use depression and suicide as a semi-joke (we knew it was serious, but not serious enough to carry it out), almost like r/2meirl4meirl if the situation was a subreddit. However, I knew he has tried attempting it, but this was a few months back and I thought he was fine by now, and telling me he loved his life currently. 

Now, I was somehow able to convince him to either come to my place and stay with me and I would be able to talk to him or somehow go home safely. 

How can I prevent him to doing any sort of harm to himself, others? I really do not want to see him or anyone else harmed from something preventable, and something I could’ve helped him with.

I also do not want to send him to places like therapy and counselling sessions because then it feels like I’ve just thrown him away just for others to fix him up, where I can be the one to help him instead. I’ve gone through counselling in school before, and it really does feel like that. 

What can I do? How can I help him? (Bear in mind we’re teenagers) 

Thank you for all the help I can get.",22Sep2019,1
354,"Thanks for taking the time to click on this, I come to you humbly anonymous seeking guidance from your experience.  
This is my life story, I'm not quite sure why I wrote it all here. I guess I just needed someone to know.

Let me tell you a little about myself, just enough to give context on my story and upbringing but not enough about my career to expose who I am. This really is just a peak inside my mind. So, stranger. If you take the time to read, thank you. I haven't been able to tell anyone about me for a very long time.

My whole life I wanted to be an actor but I grew up with ADHD, meaning I was all over the place, bouncing off of walls and smiling through everything negative in my life because my brain couldn't pay attention on one thing for longer than a day. I loved watching film, every day I would watch something new with my Father. The second one. Yes, I have two dads and no they're not gay. My mother left my biological father at a young age for my step father who would raise me. He was a good man, but with strange methods. His idea of punishment wasn't just a wooden spoon. His discipline was mental. If I misbehaved he would force me to sit at my desk and write him three pages of creative writing, a story, an elaborated thought, an idea. If it didn't entice him to read more after the first three pages he'd make me start again. He was never impressed. Shit, I was 11. The fuck did I know about writing? Regardless, he'd make me sit there for whole days. I remember sometimes missing meals because I fought his methods. I'd get frustrated, putting so much time into one story only for him to scrunch it up and tell me to start over. Eventually I realized if i actually applied myself and quit fucking around he'd let me go back to whatever I was doing. So I did exactly that until he finally approved of what I had wrote and let me get back to what I was doing. I got so good at it that no matter how bad the crime was, I'd immediately be let go because my stories became so compelling. Well, I guess they must've been. Damn, I wish I could see those stories now. Anyway, life went on like this for some time, my upbringing is as you could've imagined. Things seemed great, I was doing well in school, finding hobbies and even got into a Play. I remember performing in this play called The Three Bears. You know, that old goldilocks chestnut. I was the little bear. I remember rehearsing all my lines so I could ace the performance and when the day finally came something came over me on that stage. The spotlight must've been the brightest thing I had ever seen in my entire life. I looked out at the silhouette of the crowd, my mother and father sitting in the audience and then it happened. Something came over me, something took control of my soul, my very being. I'll never forget the feeling, it was like I knew exactly what I needed to do in that exact moment. I'd never been more sure of anything in my life. For once, my crazy, crazy mind had settled and I experienced extreme clarity. Controlled chaos. I took over the whole play, ditched all my lines and made up my own. Went into the audience, re-invented the whole play then and there. There I was, this little kid and I had taken over this big play. I mean, if you think about it I guess I kinda ruined it. Oh well, I didn't know any better and the people applauded enjoying the show all the same. That's not the point, the point is I had finally found it, my purpose. My destiny. I knew what I had to do. I was going to be in film, I wanted to be an actor. Things were great, life was unfolding really well and everything seemed amazing. Meanwhile, something dark grew within my mother that had been dawning for years. My whole life she must've had something deep within, a demon she had never faced. Maybe something triggered it. Who knows. Regardless, she started drinking pretty heavily and made some very poor decisions. My step father started to beat her, sometimes out of self defence and other times as a result of the overall toxic environment the household became. Oh well, eventually she left my step father, moved us far away and tried to start fresh with two kids. Me and my sister. She loved to do mosaic art. I remember that vividly about her. Maybe she found interest in making broken glass beautiful because she was trying to put her broken self back together. Funny, that just popped into my mind. She kept drinking, ruining relationships with people close to our family and her, strings of bad relationships with undeserving men. By the time it was my first day of high school she had alienated us from every family member we knew. I couldn't even call relatives because they were scared of our house phone dialing. They didn't want to hear another death threat from my drunken mother. Sounds pretty bad but I didn't really care. I was a kid, a kid with ADHD. Nothing bothered me. I was having the time of my life, I could play video games late at night because I was far from the discipline of my step father. I could sleep in, not go to school. Life seemed grand! It wasn't. My grades started slipping alongside my attendance. I remember this substitute teacher trying so hard to get through to me telling me that if my grades slipped and I lost my way I'd become something I'm not. It's like he saw something in me but knew I could potentially go down a really dark path. But, I met a girl! She was beautiful, very fair skinned with gorgeous long hair and a beautiful smile. She was really smart. Funny, despite her fair skin she was the most iridescent thing I had ever seen. I lost my virginity to her at the age of 17. This wasn't new to her, she had a few partners before me. Needless to say within months I was head over heels for this woman. I didn't really understand why, I didn't know what it meant. All I knew is that I had been craving affection for years. Not just getting affection, giving affection. I wanted to love and be loved, like us all of course. Haha, I remember writing this four page poem thing for her on a secret tumblr that I never showed anyone just to vent how much I appreciated her. Cringe. Anyway, we dated for a year or so. Which as I'm sure you know. For a kid that's a long ass time. She ended up breaking up with me because I was too clingy. My mother was getting worse and I needed someone a little too much. I was heartbroken. For the first time ever I felt real pain. I still remember it, it was a very dark time. We look down on young love and tell kids they don't know anything about love and although we may be right, there's no pain quite like heartbreak. It was all around this time that I was heading into a new school for my final years of high school about to graduate. A huge transitional period in my life. Things with my mother got so bad neighbours in the street would avoid walking past our house if they could. The fits, the affairs with husbands, the outbursts, the police visiting our house checking to see if we had enough fruit in the fruit bowl. The ABSURD amount of cats. Things began to get physical. She started to hit me when I wouldn't get off of the computer, I began having to barricade myself in my room when she was drinking because I knew she'd get crazy on me. She was a big woman, I was a little skinny 17 year old that wouldn't dare hit my own mother back. My room was at the end of the hallway and for the most part I had the door open. One day I remember her running up the hallway to get me after she had woken up from being passed out on the couch. I slammed the door but not fast enough, it had accidentally caught her finger and she exclaimed at me for ""intentionally"" breaking her finger. As she drove to the hospital with my sister I remember grabbing two trash bags, getting everything I owned and leaving. For good. That moment right there I had disconnected from my mother. I couldn't recognize her anymore. Having an alcohlic for a parent is hard. It's like watching them turn into a zombie. I have faint memories the beautiful woman she was but that was all gone. It was a hot summer day and I was slugging through the train stations with everything I owned in two dirty garbage bags. I called a friend at the time and asked if I could crash at his place until I figured something out. He had no problem with it. Ha, I remember walking on the way to his house. I got off of the train into the elevator at the train station and seeing that substitute teacher on the elevator on the way down. He glanced at the trash bags and then looked at me, tears in my eyes and asked me how I'm doing. I shrugged and just held up the trash bags. He chuckled and left the elevator. I continued onto my friends house and when I got there I was so ashamed of taking his place for the time I was. I was embarrassed. I could tell he felt terrible. I'd been telling him to watch Fight Club for the longest time because I wanted to culture his ass into some decent film. He never watched it, he would never listen. But on that day we sat on the couch and watched Fight Club. Finally. Dude didn't even like it, despicable. Anyway, I made a call to a relative asking what I should do. She was relieved that I had finally gotten away and said they'd sort something out with me. She set me up with my grandmother. I had never had a relationship with my grandmother. She was almost deaf and you could never have a conversation with her. She'd spend her days staring out her window on a chair. Almost as if she was clueless as to where she was. She had a very hard life and I assume the medication she was on just made her into a ghost of a person. It's really unfortunate I don't even have one memory of her not being like that. I don't even remember having one articulate conversation with her my entire life. Regardless I was grateful that she took me in but bare in mind. I was a lost child. I was about to turn 18 and I had no idea what I was doing in my life. I was doing drugs all the time and was just trying to hold onto any fun I could have in my youth. Tried to forget about how hilariously fucked up my life was. I left school to persue a trade. I studied for it but didn't finish. My grandmother eventually kicked me out because I wouldn't clean up after myself and would never help around the house. I don't really remember any of that phase. I was so fucked up all the time. I then found a caravan and lived in that for a while. There was no shower, no appliances or anything like that. I remember when I finally landed a job as an electrical apprentice how much I hated it. I wanted to act. I had no car, well, shit. I had no home. So my boss would have to pick me up in his ute at 5am, sometimes 4am every morning to get to the job site by 7, we'd work until 5 then I would eventually be dropped off back home at 9pm due to the distance we'd have to travel. I remember going home to prepare my lunch for the next day but having no shower. Showering in the same sink I washed my dishes. It was disgusting, but it was the only way I could live. It was especially heartbreaking because my family KNEW what I was going through, they're the ones that dropped me off at this pathetic caravan in their brand new Mercedes Benz. That's right. Mercedes Benz. My family, the one's that had received death threats from my mother were so insanely rich and they didn't take me in. I would go to their home on Christmas seeing their private dock and big pretty mansion on the hill just breathing in the fresh air whilst I still could before I went back to the horrible reality of my life. Anyway. I kept chugging on, barely sleeping, barely performing at work until I got fired. I was on government assistance, no where to live, trying to find any jobs I could. I bought some hair gel with what money I made working in electrical and made myself look all pretty to go for some job interviews. I landed a few gigs, got fired from all of them. Was a mechanic, worked in retail, worked my way up retail until I was a manager, made a bit of decent coin for the first time but was finally fired from that too. Moving around different places, doing different drugs, trying to see friends and be around people that loved me. We were never drug addicts, we were addicted to a good time. We partied a lot. Guess when you've got nothing you've got nothing to lose. Time went on like this, in the void. The reason this part isn't as detailed is because, well, I don't remember most of it. I was so fucked up. I ended up getting into selling drugs. Figured I could get them for free and make way more money than I was, so, what the heck. Turns out I was pretty good at it and started making some pretty incredible money. I would sell weed, MDMA. I remember not liking the idea of giving people a potentially harmful drug so I would have these careful instruction booklets I'd make to give to every person I sold to. I think I was 19 at this point. Careful directing them through how to take safe dose, take their serotonin into account. Their health. I'd never sell to the same person twice in a week as I'd be worried they'd be taking too much or whatever. I was trying to find any shred of morality in such a dark place. There were so many times where I nearly got caught. It almost feels like there's been a guardian angel through all of this. I should've been killed or in jail so many times. Not just with drugs but sleeping at train stations, being out late and in dark parts of the city. I remember one time I went into a bathroom at this club to sell someone a bag of this stuff, it going well but then opening the bathroom door to two police officers and K9 trained to sniff out drugs. Both hands clenched, a bag of 20 years jail time in one hand and sweat in the other. Arms by my side, the fist full of drugs at eye level with the K9. I calmly walk past them into another part of the club where I could stash the rest of my narcotics hidden away from the eyes of the law until they left. Or another time when I was stranded out at that caravan I told you about with this car I had just gotten, no busses near or any means of public transport forced to drive unlicensed to a retail job I had somehow landed eventually getting caught by police. I remember the man that pulled me over. He saw in my eye that I wasn't bad, I wasn't trying to break any laws, I wasn't trying to rebel or give him a hard time. I was just lost. He was as lenient as he could be but I still had to go to court for it. It's a huge offence, rightfully so, I shouldn't have been on the road. I was so nervous for the court hearing coming up the next day. I had arranged a ride but, of course, last minute they didn't show up and didn't pick up their phone forcing me to drive to court to face sentencing for driving unlicensed. I parked my car at the train station, considered putting the keys above the tyre but I knew the area and I also knew that the car was absolutely all I had. Shit, I didn't even have money for a taxi, ubers weren't really big back then either so I couldn't put that into minus on my paypal or anything. So, I figured that I'd walk in to the security guards, put my keys on the tray whilst I walked through the metal detectors. Go to the bathroom, put the keys in my pants, go into court, take whatever punishment I deserved and get home as soon as possible. The security guards had no idea why I was there. They wouldn't think anything of the keys. So I do exactly that, went into the court room. waited until my name is called. Approached the stand. Received my punishment. Began to walk out. But, as I begin to walk out, I hear the jingle of my keys falling through my underwear down to my ankle, barely gripping onto my sock. The rustle was loud, I had a split second to think. If I froze, they'd know, if I kept walking, the whole court would continue to hear the rustle of my keys inside my trousers as I was leaving a hearing for a driving offence. I should've just put them in my pocket and said they were house keys, I thought to myself. Why would they care, why would they even search my pocket!? I had no idea, I had never been to court before. So I continue walking. Each step felt longer than the last. I was practically riding my future on whether my sock could hold onto the keys two steps longer, much like my future was riding on the ability of that beautiful dogs nose. But, thankfully, I made it out of there and got back safe.  I remember going to deals in a suit and tie, my work uniform for the suit store job I landed on that driving offence. I would go there presentable with this little professional instruction booklet saying I was representing a man higher up than me. Everything was completely anonymous. They feared me. I began making bigger deals on behalf of a phantom. A man that didn't exist. Some shadowed authority figure that you wouldn't want to disappoint. Things got out of hand. I started making more money than I knew what to do with. My best friend pulled me aside and reminded me something I'll never forget. My dream. He sat me down over a big joint and said. ""Brother, you've gotten really, really deep into what you're doing. Now, I don't have a problem with it, I'll be with you until the end. But you need to do some thinking, you need to remember where you're at and why you're here. You do realize, if you get caught with narcotics you can't travel overseas to chase those dreams of being an actor in LA, right? Make a decision."" Right then and there, I changed my life. I quit the game. Deleted the app that connected me with that side of the world. Lived below my means and abided the law. Focused on the bigger picture. I won't say what I did or how I got into the industry because then you might know who I am. But what I will say is that I dedicated every single minute of every single day to self improvement. I was in an absolute shit hole but that shit hole was better than any other hole I had been in before. I grinded every day, I found my niche and within five years of applying myself to my craft and myself. Meditating, excising, focusing, expanding, watching every self help video you can think of. I finally, finally got my break. I remember sitting there in my bathroom when a little ding on my phone said this celebrity I follow on Twitter followed me back. I freaked out. I then got a DM a few minutes later asking if I'd meet with him. I did. He gave me the opportunity to showcase my talent to the world and within months I had blown up. I was, what seemed like an overnight success. The world knew my name, I began getting recognized in public and having the opportunity to help various charities around the world with my influence and applying any and all good I could back into the world. I gave it all back, I never felt like anyone owed me shit and that I deserved this any more than the other guy. But above all, I finally was living out my dream. I was applying years of acting experience from impersonating that Drug Overlord Phantom that didn't exist to protect myself to the face I was trying to hold in front of those police officers outside the bathroom. I even met a girl, a woman that lit a fire in me as I did her. She brought out the best in me and I brought out the best in her. We were happily in love, putting ourselves into our craft but most importantly, into each other. Kek. Had to do it. Even the rich family that wouldn't take me in heard of my success, googled my name, saw my net worth and RUSHED back into my life. Calling me all the time, inviting me out, all that. There was nothing but love and positivist from the world. But, like all things. What must goes up, must come down. A year past and our relationship began to sour. She didn't believe that I'd stay with her. She had been mistreated in the past, she thought I'd abandon her like that previous insecure asshole did. This led to her being suspicious. Assuming that I was going to cheat on her. Thought that a 45 minute nap meant I was sleeping with someone else when she wasn't around. I wasn't. I've been more honest with you, reader, than I have with anyone else in my entire life and if there's ever a time to confess sin it'd be here. I never mistreated her. I love women. After seeing what happened to my mother I could never. I tried explaining this to her, I had many interventions with her trying to express how putting me in a box made me feel and how I couldn't suffocate like this any longer. We needed to fix us. She didn't listen. Said she did, but didn't. So I left her, confirming what she suspected all along. The fear of me leaving is what actually drove me away. Ain't that a bitch. It hurt me to break up with her. As you've seen in the past I don't deal with breakups well. I had to do it, though. My friends made me do it. They could see how bad the relationship was making me, how miserable I was. I guess after the talk my best friend gave me in the past I learned  to trust his word. She went crazy, turning everyone in the industry against me. Everyone I thought were friends now saw me as some scumbag. My ex had become a zombie, like my mother. She couldn't handle the concept of her wrong being just that, her wrong. So instead she put a puzzle together with pieces that never existed to protect her ego. This was a HUGE hit on me. I was watching her on my computer one evening when some song came on my headphones in the middle of the afternoon that just set years of pain and hurt I'd been boxing up. Billie Eilish &amp; Khalid - Lovely (8D Audio) I just collapsed. I hit the floor harder than I ever remembered. All that hurt came rushing back, I have never come closer to suicide before. Nearly did it, the only reason I didn't was because of the friends and lives I had touched over the years that I would hurt by doing it. I think that's the thought that broke me. The reality that the only thing keeping me from killing myself was OTHER people. Regardless, I mustered the courage to call a real friend that saved my life over the phone that day. I tried to carry on. Here I was, making what I used to make in a year in a month, all my dreams actually come to life but yet i had never been more low. It felt like I had built this entire dream up in my mind then after this break up the entire thing flipped on me. I couldn't tell what was real, I was a mess. Eventually, time healed that wound. I kept on keeping on. Formed numerous positive habits, meditated every day, exercised almost every day for months. Spent time with myself. Truly, with myself. I've always thought people go into relationships with empty cups. Shaking their cups demanding their significant other to fill it. Demanding attention, demanding love, demanding their acceptance. You could say I was trying to fill my own cup with self love. A year went on like this. I finally healed but learned one painful truth. I just wasn't the same person. The person that blew up. The person that had made all his dreams come true. I'm finding it hard to connect with him again. I don't have that hunger anymore. I don't care for the big dream as much as I used to. I've been so out of rhythm for so long since that shit happened I don't know how to get back. My career is failing at an ALARMING rate. I'm broke. As soon as my mental health inclined, my work declined. How can I fight the war if I don't know where the battlefield is? I don't know what to do. I've lost the passion. I'm going in circles. Months of NoFap. Months of Fap. Months of sobriety, months of drinking. I just have no idea what to do or what to apply myself to. Not a day goes by where I don't feel gratitude for everything I have. Shit, even having a life on EARTH. There's a man that comes into my gym every single day and lifts more than me, works harder than me. In a wheelchair. I feel gratitude for even being given two working legs. But what good is all this if I have no direction, where do I start? I am more lost than ever. God, this is starting to feel a little pathetic. I'm writing my whole life on a message board. Maybe I just wanted someone to listen. I've never really told anyone my story. Thank you so much for listening to me rant about my life. I appreciate you. No, really. You're a beautiful soul. If I can do it, you can too. There is no difference between you and I. I am not better than anyone. That woman you look up to, that man you look up to, that artist you listen to on repeat wondering how they did it. They're no different from you. You can absolutely anything you put your mind to and I believe in you.

356,"I've been told I haven PTSD. I've also researched that micro-dosing might help. 

Should I have a 'baby-sitter' when I try this? 

The source is 'allegedly' very reputable and I was also warned if I have too many nightmares in my normal sleep to not take this. 
However, when I have good sleep I dream of traveling, adventures, etc. Very nice dreams. 

It's only when I'm troubled do I dream of being confined, blood, fighting, and so on. 
Thankfully, that only happens a few times per month. But it's enough to keep me from venturing out too far or too long.

359,"I'm turning 25 soon and am having like a mini breakdown. I need someone who was in a similar situation to please give any advice they can on how I can grow the fuck up and get it the fuck together:

Graduated from okay-state-college 2 yrs ago with a degree I had no interest in and haven't used. Student loans and credit card debt looks crazy. 

Working same job since 21 that I hate, can barely make bills, and is slowly becoming toxic/catty workplace. Keep applying through Indeed but seems to be a dead end. 

Didn't get into a grad program I really wanted.

Apartment of last 2 yrs is in sketchy area and landlord just raised rent

Check engine light is on and I can't pass emissions in time for registration. Car is old and shitty and the repair is gonna be at least $2000 that I don't have. 

I've been single for a year and isolating myself from the few friends that I do have and social media (I know people say leave social media and I have but I secretly desire social media clout. Idk why but I do. Or at least to post that I have a life and do things with friends that I love, and those posts get lots of likes) 

Currently in process of getting therapy because I also have an unhealthy relationship with weed and alcohol since graduating. 

I know I need to cook more at home and eat out less. Stop smoking so much weed. Stop drinking when I feel anxiety spike up. Get a better paying job. Get a better car. I do weights, yoga, and cardio. I try and put 10% of my direct deposit straight to savings. I'm on antidepressants now. I try to express gratitude. But more needs to be done.

362,"As heading implies my luck is running out,I have posted on here before and have gotten some helpful comments and advice that'll cheer me up and clear my head up a bit so let me tell you guys my story so you know the full extent. 

So I am 18 year old 6ft 170pounds with brown hair that goes down to my mouth and brown eyes  (this is just so you guys have a description if you wanted?) 

STORY STARTS: So basically I wasn't dealt the best set of parents(divorced), my mom is manipulative, a lier, and only cares about money, and my dad is just as bad but in his own ways. Back in May when I turned 18 my mom didn't want me living with her no more because since I was 18 she was getting no child support money for me. So I had no where else to go, I wasn't talking to my dad at the time because the last time I had talked to him he disowned me, but I just had to swallow my pride and text his number and he ended up letting me go back with him. So I'm living with my dad for June and July but come August he starts getting on me about not having a job more than was already. I've been applying for jobs since I turned 18 but no luck. So around Aug 20 my dad came into my room while I was playing the ps4 and he started talking to me saying that I need to go because I'm not paying him no money and it escalated extremely quickly from an argument to my own father grabbing a knife and threat in to stab me while choking me with the other hand, he started throwing me around or whatever until the cops came after my 19 yr old brother called them, but unfortunately the cops didn't take him because there was no proof. So after all that happens I had nowhere to go again so my gf at the time let me stay with her. I ended up staying with her until the start of this month. One of my gf's friends ended up finding me a place to stay. 

So thats where I'm at right now.. I'm living here in the backyard of these peoples house, they had a room disconnected from the house in there back so they let me stay there for 200 this month. I was actually really getting along with them like they are nice people but of course my stupid self had to ruin it. Me and my gf mutually agreed to just be friends since about the 12th. The people that allowed me to live here have a daughter my age (I think you know where this is going), we decided to go swimming together one night ended up making out in the pool (at around like 2am) we then get out each take showers and head to our own rooms, but she ended up texting me and told me to come and sneak in through her window and of course I did it. I ended up falling asleep in her room till about 7am then I woke up and snuck back to my room. Well it turned out that one of the little kids seen us and snitched so they got hecka mad at bother of us, but obviously since thats there daughter they went way harder for me which is understandable. Her older brother(22 I think) basically the boss of the house talked to me for like 2 hours about it how he wanted to beat my ass and all this other shit but he ended up just letting it slide but now he isn't really nice or koo to me like he was before the thing with his sister. He told me not to be with her by ourselves ever and to stop talking to her, I don't wanna get kicked out so I'm trying to do what he told me but it's kinda hard when I see his sister a good amount of times a day, like whenever we end up alone ( in the kitchen or something) shell seduce me into her lol. Now 2 days ago there was hecka teens my age at the house hanging out (they are all in a banda together so they practice at this house) and it was like 1am and they were boxing right outside of my room in the back so I decided to go chill with them, the sister was there though but I wasn't sitting next to her and there was 7 other people with us, the dad of the house came out to the back and I guess all of them weren't supposed to be up so they all got in trouble. Now an hour later the brother comes to my room to talk to me, and he's just telling me like why are you with her and some more stuff (even though he said as long as there's people around we can be in the same area) but basically he said it's the last straw next time anything with my name bad happens they are kicking me out(fyi: the brother isn't a complete dick to me he's actually pretty koo to me besides the whole sister thing) . So now I'm even scared to come outside of my room and only come out now to use the restroom and eat. So that's were I'm at right now it's the 22nd of September and I don't know where I'm going to be in a week from now. The month is about too end so I have to pay rent again (idk if they will let me stay past this month without paying rent, they did let me stay for 2 weeks while I had no money for free though) but I literally have 20$ to my name and idk what to do now. I am desperately searching for a job and I just don't know anymore, I'm sad, confused, stressed, tired, lost and I go to sleep every night hoping I won't wake up. I'm looking for anything reassurance, advice, help, and for anyone who read this far it means a lot to me that you would take the time to read that much.",22Sep2019,1
363,"First of all, I apologize for the coming rant.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background: I am on state parole for a violent offense that was drug related. It was not classified as a drug offense, but was tangentially related to that world. I have been home now for almost 2 years. In that time I have been an ideal parolee. I work a professional job, am continuing to pursue my education, have paid off all fines and restitution, am up to date on my supervision fees, and am civically involved (voluntarily, not due to an court stipulations). 

&amp;#x200B;

It is my civic involvement that seems to be problematic now. The borough I live in (have only been here since my release) has a contentious and volatile political climate. We were in national news fairly recently due to allegations of racism aimed at our police force and populace by our POC mayor. This stemmed from what was perceived as an excessive police presence in our borough's sole primarily minority neighborhood.   It now essentially boils down to a rift between our mayor and the borough council and police force which has gotten quite ugly. Really though, the politics do not concern me in the least. I got involved on a borough committee solely dedicated to environmental concerns. I have no political aspirations. I merely want to be involved in helping to shape a more sustainable green future for our community. After a meeting announcing the success of a particular project I led, I was sat down by borough council and asked about my criminal record. They proceeded to warn me that local politics can be a very ugly place and that my record could be weaponized against me. It was odd, but I thought little of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards, I began regularly speaking with the mayor regarding environmental issues and possible initiatives. We would meet casually, and I found him to be a sympathetic and knowledgeable ear.  We have become friends and do spend some time together socially. He pointed out to me that borough council was concerned that I would run for a seat in the forthcoming elections. I explained that I have zero concern for the politics and that I merely want to push the initiatives in which I am passionate about. He told me that such a motivation may be misunderstood as a desire to run for office, and warned me about how ugly local politics can be. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a week ago, a member of council walked into a coffee shop where the mayor and I were meeting. It was slightly awkward but friendly. Now, today I was volunteering to set up an event in town. A member of borough council asked to have a word with me. Once we were out of ear shot, she told me that there were ""allegations that the mayor is using drugs"" and that ""due to my background it would sure be a shame if I were to get caught up in anything like that."" (For the record I highly doubt the man is engaged in any drug usage or criminal activity)

&amp;#x200B;

I am somewhat dumbfounded here. The tone and wording seems somewhat threatening, and have put me ill at ease. I am worried that there could be a set-up or something of the like, as this seems to be retaliatory due to my perceived alliance with someone that council views as a political enemy.  It would be all to easy to have me incarcerated due solely to allegations, as I am a parolee and possess very few rights until the term of my parole has expired. I have no political aspirations and feel to an extent as if I am in over my head here.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I am a parolee who is civically involved. It seems that I unwittingly made political enemies, and I am now worried about potential consequences.",22Sep2019,1
364,"I'm 23. I will have my degree in Accounting or Finance in Fall 2020-Spring 2021. I live with my family in a place I hate. I hate this place because there are no good paying jobs and everyone that lives here is old and dying. I can't even find people like me. I really do not fit in here.

I spent a year out of school prior to this. And the difference in my happiness is night and day. I really hate school. I don't know what I want to major in and I'm very depressed. When I was out of school I was really happy. Now that I'm back I'm very sad and alone, isolated.... the difference in my behavior and how I feel is incredible. I feel physically ill during the semester and I feel physically incredible when I'm not in school.

I want to be happy again. My plan is to move from a really depressing small town in Florida to Tampa, FL,. 

I used to live in Tampa and I love everything about it. Everytime I go there I instantly feel healthier and happier. The kicker is this. To live there I would need $3,000.00/month (includes taxes) to make it alone.

I would need to work two jobs. My current situation is living with my family, working full time, and studying full time. My grandparents are always fighting. Seeing my mother reminds me of my childhood. I grew up in a very abusive household that included a lot of beating and yelling. I was beaten pretty badly growing up. I was always yelled at. My dad always threatened to shoot me or would ask me to shoot him. 

 Well, now I listen to my grandparents fight before bed, when I wake up, and intermittently during the day. The negativity in this house really eats at my soul and it honestly makes me feel like I'm back to being a scared kid again. They have no idea what their behavior does to me mentally.  

I guess my big thing is that I'm terrified. I'm so scared to leave and do this. If I stay another year I feel like I might actually kill myself. That's another year of being unable to focus... unable to study... unable to make friends because of where I live. I feel everything. It's insane. I hate being an emotional person because everything around me gets right into the core of who I am. It's like there is no barrier between me and the world despite no one knowing who I really am besides the facade I put on. 

I don't really know what to do. I'm terrified of everything. I'm scared that I'll be trapped working 80 hours a week just to get out of this if I move. I'm scared I'll regret leaving college. If I can stay another year here I'll have my degree which should make it so I can move with one job but... I am 23 and I don't want to spend another year here. I'm missing out on networking, making friends, and general peace.

Another issue is that I'm very driven by things I have a passion for. I've spent so much time on a degree I absolutely do not believe in that I feel broken. But the things I believe in are incredibly high risk. I dont know what to do. I can't afford the time or money for a psychologist. I'm trapped. I feel stuck and I don't want this to be my life anymore. I want out. I dont know what to do",22Sep2019,2
365,"Hey all, part of my arm is about 75% numb and it feels like a nerve is being pinched in my wrist. It's been happening for about a week now so very early and it sounds like Carpel Tunnel. I'm wondering if I need to go to the doctors right now or if this is a pretty minor thing that might resolve itself if I take a break. 

I do game everyday so that might be the reasoning, and I wouldn't mind taking it slow if I could reverse this feeling on my arm without surgery.. it's honestly kind of scary and I'm freaking out about it.

366,"There's a guy at my school (one year above mine) whom I've never actually spoken to. I consider myself to be quite the observer when it comes to people and specifically love interests, if I dare go as far as calling them that. After a little while now, I've found myself starting to crush on this fella, despite our lack of interactions. How can I tell if I actually like him if we've never talked before? Are distant observations enough to get the gist of a person? And, on another note, how can I possibly approach him? We currently have zero mutual friends nor any means to communicate. I'm not incredibly confident with crushes since my last one, which left a very sour taste in my mouth. Similarly to this 'crush', I liked him based off of assumptions and I ended up being very mistaken about the person he was. However, I think I was a bit naive back then and have grown from the experience. This guy and I have only vaguely made eye contact on numerous occasions, but it feels different from other people - maybe I'm still being naive. What would you do in this situation? If you were this guy, how would like me to approach you?",22Sep2019,1
367,"1: I have a huge problem with overthinking thing to the point where the smallest little problem can be blown out of proportion. I've always had a problem with this and I have no idea how to stop doing it, or if I can stop doing it. Because of me overthinking things I've gotten into accord or even bad situations with people, especially people that I'm just getting to know. 

2: I also have situation that's kind of related to the first one. So I've had this really good friend for about a year now, and I've had a thing for this person for almost the entire time. And they know this, they've known it sense I first started having feelings for them. But recently we've been getting closer and closer. To the point where we both have feeling for each other but we hadn't done anything about it. I then asked them if they wanted to be a couple, and there immediate answer was that they wanted to say yes, but they had to work a few things out first. Later they told me that they had gotten the things that they needed to get worked out done, and relatively easy. So I reiterated the question, and they said that they did have an answer but I had to agree to stay friends if anything between us didn't work out, which of course I did agree to. But then before giving me an answer they started overthinking things between us and started to have second thoughts on if they actually liked me and if they wanted to be a couple, if they only had feelings for me because I showed them affection, or because I was tied to emotions from the past, or because they're lonely and want someone. And this freaked me out, and them but we kind of got things worked out but not fully. The advice for this one is, is there anything I can do to one, stop freaking out and two, help rearure them. Or just any advice for this situation would be helpful, because this is my first time going through anything like this and I'd just like some advice.",22Sep2019,1
368,"I'm living with my parents, and unfortunately they aren't the best at keeping their place clean.

Since about a month ago, I've noticed bedbugs. 
They are NO WHERE NEAR a bed, full grown, and usually not full of anything.

The first one was in the bathroom, hanging off the counter (it's made of particle board). 
The second one was in the office, on the desk.
The third one was on my parents bed, but my Mother caught and killed it.

Thus morning, I noticed one on the wall in my parents room. When I smashed him, he was full of blood.

I'm not sure how to proceed.

I don't know where they are coming from, but I have a feeling it's the apartment building as a whole? (Parents also had to deal with a roach infestation recently thanks to nasty neighbors).

We live in Georgia, so our rights are kinda screwed as tenants.

370,"He’s dated her for two years. We occasionally keep In touch. Lately he has been more interested in talking to me and texting me. We hung out for like seven hours the other day just talking and walking around town. We talked about how our lives have been and our dreams for our separate lives. He said he would like to go on vacation with me to his family cottage that we used to go to years ago. I asked why he’d want me and he said he’d want to go there with someone else who truly appreciates nature. 

We truly are the same person in many ways. We grew up together and we are who we are because of our influence on each other. He is now realizing so many things I appreciated before that he did t appreciate when we were together. 

He has told me many times how much he misses me and gives me extended hugs and texts me and says he hopes that we can hangout again soon. 

So he has a gf and never mentions her and never says anything positive about her and says he is giving her a shot but doesn’t think they will last but wants to truly see if it’ll workout.  We never dated anyone else before we dated so we made lots of mistakes together and dating others have personally taught me about myself. He is a very passive person so I don’t see him initiating leaving her. He said he wanted to help her be a better person while dating her but didn’t think they truly were compatible like we were (I agree, I’ve never been with someone who I was so completely compatible with). 

He’s also dealt with personal and family health issues and has been struggling in his life lately. 

Our history: 
We both agreed we needed to mature and learn who we were as individuals because we were so dependent on each other when growing up that we didn’t get the entire find yourself days of adolescence. 

We had issues that took time and space to figure out and basicallybeing in other relationships has made each other appreciate what we had and that it was special. I was only ever with him so I always wondered what if other relationships are better and we are fucked up? I didn’t know what I actually wanted in someone and it was easy for me to convince myself my partner sucked when I was upset because I truly didn’t know what a partner sucking meant. I can see his point of view now because I have dated so many people and learned what I really want. My ex was always just there and we took each other for granted.

What should I think of this?

TLDR: ex and I are old friends. We’re catching up and he is maybe initiating something more than just friends? We broke up two years ago and realized we wanted to see what was out there and mature and become individuals so we could truly see if we were right for each other. We didn’t want to get together right after our breakup and make the same mistakes again",22Sep2019,0

373,(My first reddit post I’m pretty new) Hi I’m currently an 18M who recently just joined the army. I’ve met some really good mates here and I recently only just turned 18 so the boys decide to take me clubbing. I go out clubbing for where I meet a girl and I go back to hers and have a one night stand with her. I get her Snapchat and continue talking to her and I start to grow feelings for her. The only problem is we live three hours apart and because I’m currently in training I can’t drive and can’t go see her unless she drives to a place I can get a bus which is 4 hours from her and an hour from me ( the place I met her because she went out for her 19th ) so we keep talking and eventually exchange I love yous and we look at meeting up. Although she works as a bartender and works pretty much every night so she has to get work off. She says it’s difficult to get work off and the weeks without seeing her turn to months. We still keep in touch every day until recently she drops a bomb on me saying “I don’t think there can be an us anymore”. Now this breaks my heart when I hear it because this was the first girl I actually really had strong feelings for. She had said the other day that she was craving sex again and said she would wait. So I ask her is that why and she tells me over multiple snaps basically “ I have commitment issues and I really tried to make it work over these months and commit to you because I care for you. But I just can’t do it I still love you but I want to be able to have sex when I want to”. And because I really like this chick and still want some sort of relationship with her I ask to be friends with benefits which she says she can do. She says she will look at seeing me again and another three weeks pass. I still keep talking to her with it hurting me every day. I know I should just stop texting her but it is easier said then done. I tried doing it for a day and I became really depressed and shitty and I couldn’t do it so I went back to texting her.

I (M21) am currently studying abroad in Japan and have been hanging out with this girl I really like for the last three weeks. We go out to karaoke bars every week and sing for anywhere from 4-8 hours. During that time, she has touched my face, felt my biceps, complimented my eyes and voice, played footsie, taught me how guys ask for sex in her language, and seems really happy to hang out with me– all things I thought to be flirtatious.

All that being said, she has a boyfriend. I honestly doubted his existence because of how she had been acting with me up until now, but tonight I actually met him. We went to her friend's (M) house and then he showed up. BF was a nice guy, but what struck me as odd was that she acted the same way with me, the friend, and her BF. She wasn't as flirty as she is with me during karaoke, but she still was a little.

The fact that she didn't act differently around her BF, and neither did he, struck me as odd. I thought they either have a great relationship and don't worry about cheating or anything, or they barely have one at all and they are mostly friends. At the end of the night, I went to give her a hug but she didn't hug me back. Her BF and the other friend were there, but looking the other direction, plus she explicitly told me today that I could hug her if I wanted to, but this still was probably a fuck-up on my part.

I went home feeling really upset about today, thinking she's probably not into me the way I am into her. I'm not expecting any mind readers, but I'd really appreciate some advice as to what to do in my situation. Thank you!",22Sep2019,2

386,"I am 19 years old and my brother is turning 17 in some weeks. His teacher is 25. I will try to make this as short as possible but I need to be detailed.

 Last year my parents got him a private music tutor to help him with the auditions at the end of his high school year , he wants to get in a kinda presitious music school. My brother has been recording his practises since forever to review them in an videocamera  Last month I happened to find it and watched it. They seemed too close in some of his practises. In one of them, my brother was doing good and then hugging him and sitting on his lap and being affectionate.

 I asked him what this is and my gut feelings were right, he said to me they love each other and all that jazz. I know he is not lying because he's never been good at it. He begged me not to tell our parents. I know they do not get physical until my brother grows up more which kind of puts me at ease but at weekdays  my brother is sleeping over to his place. My poor dad thinks my brother is having a gf and turns a blind eye to it. 

I still find it weird , that a person of this age would be interested in someone as young as my brother. That being said, my brother is kinda naive and trusting and surely not mature . That makes me worry even more.

 I want to tell my parents but I am afraid of their reaction. My brother will never trust me again, he will hate me . My dad will probably freak out both about the teacher and the fact my brother is gay. They will give him a hard time. 

But thinking my brother may be in danger drives me crazy.  No matter what, this seems weird to me and I can't be sure that guy won't manipulate him and hurt him in any way. Being the only one who knows about it, I feel a huge burden

I'm on SSI because I can't function around people.  The voices tell me that I'm just lazy and need to pull myself up by the bootstraps.  They even bring race into it and say that me being black, I should do it for my ancestors and try to be like a stereotypical Asian or Jewish person.  The black voices ignore it and don't care about the discrimination because people don't believe that I've ever been subjected to racism, because I don't wear it on my sleeve.

Anyway, I'm afraid to work, not because I'm supposedly lazy, but because I have to isolate myself for my own mental health and happiness.  I have been told by my therapist that it's okay to be a recluse.  But when I tell people, even the hotline, they give me their two cents and say it's not ""healthy.""  Well, there are monks living in caves for years who are very healthy.  And besides, it's a symptom.

I don't want to be in a toxic/catty/backstabbing/petty or overly social work environment.  I don't want to back into the workforce, only to crash AND lose my disability money because they say I'm apparently able to work.

I get $437 a month.  $300 goes towards bills, but only for the next six months, which point I'll have the whole $437.  $137 goes towards alcohol and cigarettes, but I recently quit drinking and am planning to quit smoking, so that will be saved.  $20 will go towards entertainment as in self-help books (I'm a human being, I need some sort of quality of life), $50 will go towards groceries for the house, $50 will pay off a credit card (to up $300), and the rest will be saved.  If I play my cards right, I can actually go to Europe and stay with my boyfriend for a month because he has a house there.  Also, there's a potential to get $694 a month in disability if I prove that I pay rent by showing them I'm on the lease.

I also do freelance writing.  I get $200 a book and do about one book a month.

I want an honest opinion: should I get a job?  Is this enough money?  I also have student loans.  I could enroll in a program to help me wipe them out.  On the other hand, I have a job coach who could potentially help me get a permanent work from home job making maybe $12 an hour and even that will be more than the SSI.

393,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I've always been the person that didn't like kids, always said that I'd probably never be a mom. But lately I've been thinking about having a baby non-stop.

I had a dream about a month ago that I had a daughter. She was around four and I just LOVED her. I loved her more than anything. It seemed so real! When I woke up and realised that I didn't have that beautiful little girl in real life, I just laid in bed and sobbed. Now I can't stop thinking about it.

There are many problems with this. My bf isn't sure if he wants kids, we're not married yet, we're not financially stable enough. I would like for my mental health to be better before having a child. I'm also terrified of being a horrible parent. What if I damage my future child mentally? What if my future child starts hating me? What about teenagers?! My family also has a history of substance abuse. What if my child becomes a drug addict?!

But I can NOT stop thinking about it. I want to be married and have a baby. I'm not even sure if it's a real desire. Am I trying to replace an empty spot in my life with a baby?

I'm afraid of talking to my bf about it. I know he won't be upset but I don't want to scare him. Don't worry. I won't pressure him into anything. I have intimacy issues and he never pressured me to do anything.

What should I do? Any ideas why I'm feeling like this?",22Sep2019,1
394,"Basically I'm 18, in Australia, finishing up with high school and wondering what to be doing with my life next year. I see all my friends planning on going to uni and, while I get the feeling a lot of them are going just because its ""common sense"" and a lot of them haven't thought it through, I still feel as if I might be left behind in life.

If I don't go, I'll be continuing to study Japanese at home, attempt to learn how to code, work, read books, gym, meditate and all that stuff.

If I do go, I'll probably be studying computer science or networking, and try to fit in most of the things above.

The thing is, however, I don't have an innate passion for cs or networking. I find networking somewhat interesting and bearable at the very least, but don't feel like I'm passionate for it. Cs is just to learn coding because I feel it's a very valuable skill especially for entrepreneurial desires, but, I don't really know if I'll like studying it at university, or the jobs associated with it.

What I have a passion for is running a business. (If that's a passion?) I have a good idea for language learning books that I could put to good use, but apart from that, nothing really interests me. Just the idea of having something passionate of mine that I'm trying to bring up that could potentially bring millions or billions of dollars of wealth and value for society (and me) makes me feel really fulfilled. I heard that having a job in sales could help with this, so, If I take a gap year, I'll probably take up a sales job, along with my other security job.

**TL;DR** peer pressure, will be productive if not going, no real passion other than wanting to be an entrepreneur.",22Sep2019,3

My friend has been recently attacked by a person from the same school district as us. I wish I could put in screenshots, but I can't...

This unknown person(UP) has been wanting attention from my friend, asking her to ""f*cking follow"" them on Instagram. From what my friend told me, her sister decided to make a fan account for their dog. She thought it would be funny to go to people who follow their dog account and act like she hating that account.

She did just that and UP got triggered and go apesh*t on my friend's sister. UP then goes to my friend and gets angry about how she was cussing at them. I know my friend and she would never do that to someone she doesn't know.

Today, I get a notification from UP asking my permission to use my reaction on a prank show. Walk the Prank to be exact. UP sent this message to my art account so just to be sure, I acted professional and calmly rejected her offer and explaining the reason behind it.

I told my friend to block and report UP. I decided not to do that because I wanted to see how far this unknown person can go. I will block UP soon, but I just want to see what you people have to say.

402,"Hey so this is kind of tough for me to ask, and I can’t even tell you why. I don’t know. But thanks for taking the time out to read my absolutely random thoughts and rambles!
So anyway! Here goes!
I was supposed to be travelling to the UK for Christmas and New Years with a friend of mine. But it’s slowly becoming clear to me that he’s the most incompetent person I’ve ever known. I planned the whole trip out to the because he either had no input or was too lazy to look up anything. But I didn’t mind because I was excited to go. 
But now, we need to apply for our Visa’s and he’s been lollygagging and because of him I’ve been waiting on applying for mine for 2 weeks now and it’s finally started to get on my nerves and I’m very close to just dropping the plan. 
Now, our flight tickets are booked and I really want to just go on my own but the problem then becomes that I’ve never really traveled overseas alone and I’m also really introverted for the most part with extroverted tendencies. So being an introvert, I’m a little anxious to be on my own, especially around that festive period and ugh I don’t know what to do.....

405,"So, I’ve been working at an amazing small business for about a year and a half now with the best team ever. My job is fun and I feel like it was meant to be that I started working here! My hours are 9-5 Tuesday-Friday, which is another great perk. I’m making $15/hr which will probably increase to $18/hr at the beginning of the year after I graduate (3 more months!!!)

 As much as I adore my job, I also have some big financial goals like maxing out my IRA that I just started, and having $1,000,000 in my account when I retire (maybe more.) I want to be successful and be able to afford things when I want them, go on vacations, etc. I feel like it will be hard to achieve those only making around $22,000 a year. I don’t plan to stay here FOREVER, but was planning on staying for at least another year and a half while my partner is finishing med school. 

The answer might seem obvious to you readers, but I just can’t imagine leaving the group of women I work with. I am extremely close will all of them and I don’t think my boss (who I love and look up to) would see it coming at all. Has anyone gone through this and can anyone offer me advice?",22Sep2019,1

I dont want to talk about how she is since i feel like itll make this too long; pretty much she belittles me and makes me feel shitty in the most non direct ways.
Well, i had a ""deep"" talk with one of them and turns out she feels the same way. Now, before she wouldnt even hang out with us, we just sort of got stuck with her. Now when i want to hang out with people that do make me happy, i feel so obligated to invite her and she just brings my mood down. 

How do I just 'drop' her?

There’s not much I can do to help, but I wanted to get her some nice clothes (per her request). I didn’t want to get something too expensive and cause her to attract unwanted attention but I wanted to get her some durable shoes, a weatherproof jacket, some socks, a watch, and maybe a medium sized backpack to carry her belongings in.

First it start when I started comparing myself with the new girl my ex boyfriend’s brother was dating( I was physically more pretty, but I still thought in my head that she’s better) I got over this comparison when I broke up with my boyfriend

Second: my sister in-law. My gosh this was bad. She had a nice round botty and I can’t help but be filled with jealousy. We were close but the jealousy stole my happiness, I soon got over it after a few years

Third: my other sister-in-law. Drop dead gorgeous girl. Stole the attention when she walks into a room. She is soo beautiful and soft spoken. I was so jealous, but I never show it. I am usually very nice and supportive of them regardless of my inner jealousy. 

Lastly: my girlfriend. We met a year ago and became very close. She is so tall over 6ft and she has a big ol butt. Even though I care so much for her, I am so jealous of her butt. It is so big that every time we go out together she gets all the attention. I have a nice round butt, but when I’m with her I suddenly feel shapeless. He butt is a huge and sexy that I feel invisible when we are together. 

I realize that my jealousy is stealing my happiness and making act in weird ways. How do I stop this comparisons? It’s like I’d be jealous of someone now, then I meet someone else, I get the other jealousy and start a whole new one. 

The biggest of this is with my friend with the big butt, I feel like now big butt are all that matters and if you don’t have you’re not really attractive. Anyone else in my situation? I need help? I want to be happy but I can’t because I am a jealous person",22Sep2019,2
410,"Hi everyone, Hope all of you are well. I find myself in a predicament; See, as a kid I found my passion for film making and video editing, however, throughout high school I changed my views and believed that after high school, what mattered the most was money. And so I started looking into computer science, my first semester of college I realized that was not for me. Then in the same mindset of money, I decided to go with a business administration career, and the next semester I understood it was not for me. Then I found the study of psychology very Interesting, and switched to a psychology major, I am halfway through getting my bachelors but have noticed that this is not what I want to do. Lately I’ve been watching a lot of YouTube and the way people edit their videos to make them appealing and am considering becoming a content creator on this platform, however I would like to educate myself on this instead of continuing my psychology major. I am 22 years old, and have never felt so exited about starting a new project and educating myself in something because I feel like I was not educating myself nor doing what I loved most. I’d like your opinion on this as I fear that I am too old to be switching a career path.

414,"A little background first:
40yr old M, divorced and remarried, I have two kids (13yr old girl and 9yr old boy) which I share evenly visits with my ex.
I have a fairly decent job in a good company, it pays the bills and has a good family/work balance. I’m just not very enthused by it and, as of today, don’t really see a bright future in it.
As a rule of thumb I always put my resume out there even if I’m not actively looking.
Well, about three months ago this company reached out to me and offered me what I consider a dream job:
A very challenging and rewarding position where I would instantly double my salary.
The problem is that it involves a lot of traveling. I would probably end up seeing my kids four or five days a month and my wife maybe 10 to 15 days a month (plus vacations).
It’s sounds really rough on one hand but on the other I could probably pay off all our debt and send the kids to college within 5 years.

I think they brought one of their friends we met last night into the the flat before they left this morning and it is very likely it was him.

Obviously the thing I should be doing is announcing to them that it has been taken but I’m socially awkward as fuck and there’s no way I can assert myself like that.

I’m almost certain it was the friend they invited over, but I have no evidence it was him so I can’t accuse him of anything, he’s also like 7ft and muscly whereas I’m 5’11 and underweight so it’s not like I can threaten him to give it over. 

I don’t want to ruin my relationship with my flat mates, they are really good people and I have to live with them for a year minimum, so part of me feels like i should just let it go but now I feel like I can’t trust anyone.",22Sep2019,1

417,"Throughout my life, my mom and I never got along. She was overbearing over me and who I had relationships with and I never liked that. She never gave me the space I needed and this resulted in me becoming depressed at a young age and not being able to trust her. When my parents split when I was 16, she shut herself out from the world because she was so in love with my dad and she didn’t want to let him go. I felt horrible for her so I tried becoming close to my mom because I love her and I didn’t want to see her like that. 

Fast forward to present day. I’m 20 I have my own life, I’m trying to move out. My mom doesn’t like that. She wants me to stay at home until I’m 22 so she can collect “child support” from my dad, whenever we have disagreements she goes back and tells my entire family and I get phone calls from family telling me to respect my mom. I’m trying to have a healthy lifestyle and my mom tries to make me eat unhealthy foods that’ll mess me up (both sides my family have diabetes and high cholesterol issues and I’m not trying to get sick) whenever she doesn’t get her way with anything in general (doesn’t have to do with me) she’ll throw a fit about it. She’s obsessed over my dads girlfriend and her family to the point where she stalks their social media everyday under a fake account (he cheated on my mom with her) she also has her phone background set to my dads girlfriend with the word “whore” on it. 

A big thing we’ve been fighting about lately is this guy (we’ll call him X.) We’ve known each other for 2 years and I really love and care about X. My mom clearly hates him and will start trouble any chance she gets. Me and X went to go to stay in the city for the weekend and my mom found out and she wasn’t happy. The morning I was leaving, she said I wasn’t allowed to go unless she meets him (she met him twice before that) the problem was we had to catch the train and had no time to talk. So I go outside to get picked up and I’m on the phone with him warning him about my mom, my mom comes out and snatched my phone from me and she went off on him. When he pulled up to get me, she still kept going off on him on how I was going to get killed and how he’s disrespectful. He told her if you think it’s a problem to call the cops on him and get him arrested. After that we left and I had nonstop calls from my family saying that I shouldn’t have let X disrespect my mom. I told them the story and they didn’t hear the part on where my mom started the fight. There had been many instances after that. When I got off my depression medication a couple months ago because I felt more depressed on the meds, she threw a fit and said it was X’s fault because he made me stop taking my meds. She bluntly said if I ever had kids with X she’d be pissed. She recently said I brought shame to both sides of my family because of my relationship with X. Yesterday she held the front door shut so I wouldn’t be able to go out with him. We were arguing back and forth and when I got the chance to leave I opened the front door and she slammed the door shut on my thumb. After that I just left with him and I was so upset. When I came home after she just started to antagonize me. 

I don’t know if it’s just me being a shitty daughter but i want to have a good relationship with my mom because I do love and care about her but it’s so hard to considering the way she acts. Am I wrong?

TL;DR- my mom and I don’t get along and I want to get along with her without her acting up on me.",22Sep2019,1
418," I honestly do not know who to turn to and I feel so lost. It all started when I was seven years old I was often left with a family member while both my parents were at work and this person would molest me everyday that I was left in their care. This abuse went on for over three years and I suffered in silence because I was too afraid to say anything. During this time I was super depressed and developed crippling anxiety that made me scared to even leave my own house. I would cry all the time to myself at night so no one would know how hurt I was. For years I had to be around this person and pretend that everything was all right every single family function, birthday party, and holiday I had to face this person and it felt like I was reliving the abuse all over again. I finally had enough and eleven years later I finally gained the courage to tell my parents what had happened and their reactions were not as supportive as I would have liked. I told them that I wanted to press charges against my abuser but they said that it would be a bad idea to since the police probably won’t do anything since it happened so long ago and I did not have any evidence. I then stated that I wanted to at least warn other family members about the abuser so they do not leave their children with them but again my parents were against it stating that it would only create “family drama”. I really want to do something I would feel so guilty if this family member abused anyone else just because I did not report them but I am scared that my parents are right or that no one will believe me.

-Constantly asking my dad to buy her things, and I mean constantly

-Throwing unbelievable screaming tantrums when she doesn’t get exactly what she wants

-Extremely defiant. Only doing what she wants when she wants it, and most of the time that means only doing things that benefit her

-Yelling and fighting and getting defensive whenever someone even tries to bring it up

-She eats like garbage, and whenever you try to encourage her to take better care of her body she says to mind your own business and gets very defensive

-Spends seemingly 100% of her days either with her friend or on her phone. I’m not exaggerating.

-Constantly wants to borrow stuff from me (phone chargers etc) which she often loses, and screams and fights when she doesn’t get it and calls our parents (and they comply with her because this has been going on for years and no one wants to deal with her anymore)

-Whenever I, on occasion, need something from her (a phone charger/block for a single night), she profusely refuses.

-Refuses to take her medication and gets defensive when you ask if she does or tell her to

-Gets mad over things like my shaking my leg, talking with my dog, my dog licking me, and other menial stuff like that to the point where I have to sit motionless so she won’t yell at me (which is what her medication is supposed to be for)

-Completely unapologetic about any of this behavior

426,"For context, I met a girl in another country while on work and we really hit things off. After leaving, we talked on the phone constantly and just really enjoyed each other's company. A few weeks ago, she wanted to take a break a day after she invited me to come live with her, as I had made plans to get a job there.  I gave her space and didn't contact her for 4 days, when she eventually called and asked if we could slow things down which I said yes. During this time I was confident, funny, and overall playful. I've been in relationships before and I've never been the jealous type... until now.

Here's where I start fucking things up.  She tells me she wanted to be friends for now and see other people, which I agreed and actually stated before I even left her country that we can't be exclusive an ocean away.  We continue to talk occasionally and eventually after feeling that she just wanted to be friends, based on how she was acting, told her that if she never wanted to be anything more than friends then we should part ways. I told her to think it over and contact me. She texted me later that day. We continued to talk a bit here and there.

Here's where I definitely fucked up. She went on vacation, I gave her a lot of space and only texted her when she contacted me. She told me she had gone to a country A then country B, but later she said she had stayed in country A. Being drunk and stupid I asked her why she lied about going to country B if she had stayed in country A. That it seemed stupid to have to lie about something so silly. Apparently she went back to country A after B, because she had a good time and she and her friend wanted to do a few more things.  Needless to say I apologized for being a crazy ass and explained that I was acting like an idiot because I was jealous and missed her (god I'm an idiot). This was last week.

I messaged her a couple days after apologizing, asking if she had a time this week to talk and her response was:

""Sorry, I have plans for this weekend so I am not able to talk.  I was not comfortable with things happened last a few days.  You are busy and I think it’s better if we focus on our own stuff and take some rest for a while.""

My response was:
""That's actually perfect for me. Glad you're feeling the same."" 
-Which was true, I feel like I'm too attached and acted stalkerish, jealous, needy and insecure - which has never been me. It has honestly made me feel like shit.

My question is, what should I do now? I'm scheduled to visit her in 2-3 weeks, but I want to respect her space. It sucks because I've fallen harder for this girl in 2 months than any relationship I've been in and don't want things to end. I want to go back to just having fun and hanging out and not push my feelings on her or try and force her into a relationship. 

Do I contact her?
Let her contact me?
Or just move on?

-For reference as well, I've done nothing but read and watch videos on dating and relationships. Particularly Corey Wayne How to be a 3% man. I know there's no easy fixes and I am working on myself everyday.

427,"So this is going to be a long one, and i'm sorry for that. Also, I really only use this account for nsfw things and manga so. 

Background on me. I'm military (reserves), in school full time and working full time to make ends meet as well. I'm known in my circle for being the guy who can handle things and always give out solid advice. And therefore all of my friends go to me with their problems.

Recently, my fiance and me broke up. It was not a bad break up, it was just due to lots of different technicalities and our overall compatability being in a relationship right now. The only thing is, we signed our lease together before we broke up. So now I sleep in the same room as the woman who is currently the reason for my broken heart. And it's killing me. 

I've always been a loner, because I've basically always been alone. Emotionally and financially. Ussually I'm really good at handling stressful situations, and stockpiling them in my head. I've been fighting off depression tooth and nail for as long as I can remember, and for most of my life I have been winning. But lately, it all just feels like way too much. 

Work has been getting worse, and no other job will pay me as much without a degree, which I do not have yet. So I feel stuck. I can not talk to my family, because all they will do is tell me to pray about it. Which, if you are regligious you should hear this, is horrible advice. Trying to telepathically speak to some entity that does not respond is not helpful to most people. And we don't want to hear it. 

I don't really have many friends I would feel comfortable consoling, and the ones I do have live incredibly buys lives and I would not feel comfortable placing my burdens on them. Nor will they be able to balance them probably. And the only outlet that I have had is my ex, which. . . no.

So about her. She's the most amazing person, kind heart, warm smile and always gives hugs. As real as they come. She also has clincally diagnosed depression and anxiety, so I have never really been able to come to her about my issues with her because she will end up depressed. So I shouldered that myself too. But, i'm such a strong guy, she has never had any issue comign to me about myself. Which I have also stocked, without a single complaint. 

Since we have broken up she has been hanging out with friends very often. Which is great, I am an introvert and I was always urging her to get out more. But she didn't when we were together. She has been hanging out especially with this dude who is foreign and comes from a rich family. Just more or less doing shit that I can't take her to do because I can't pay for everything yk. Adulting is rough sometimes. And i've been getting incredibly jealous, which is not fair at all to her, honestly.

Well, yesterday at work they were treating me like shit as usual and I almost had a mental breakdown. The only reason that I didn't is because of some nice african man who just kept talking to me and wouldn't shut up. Thank you nice african man. When I got home, I had to tell her what was on my mind because I had to tell somebody. I needed to release.

And today, she told me that she is worried about this becoming a controlling relationship. ""Not because you're controlling, but because of what you say."" So I have to continue to suffer in silence. I can't go back home, I can't get orders to go active duty, I can't migrate anywhere else. I have no one to talk to that I feel comfortable with and can handle the shit. I feel stuck and utterly lost. I just want out fr. 

I've been looking at police officer jobs, (I'm military it's common) because it's something that I have always wanted to do. But, even that will take time, and if I do get picked up it will be a while before I can move out to join the academy etc. I honestly just needed someone to rant to, and if you stayed. Thanks so much.

TLDR: Life sucks and I live with my ex.",22Sep2019,0
428,"I'm looking for something more than the typical advice to just get on with life, or the idea that I should be making the most of life now - I'm aware of that, I'd love to, but I can't move past the past!

I fucked my life up, I didn't actively make bad choices but my choices at the time were limited. It's not much better now, I need support but that support just doesn't exist, so as hard as I try I just can't seem to get anywhere improving life. I end up sitting depressed without friends or anything constructive to do, I need to be able to correct this but try as I might I just can't and meanwhile I struggle with the thought of 'what's the point?'. 

It's hard to keep going when I consider how messed up life is; that I've gone ten years without work, I've thus missed out on so much including the big stuff like finding love and having kids but also little things like enjoying my twenties. At 36 I feel like life is over, I keep getting reminded I'm 'old' now and it feels like it's too late for anything, but there has to be more than just wallowing in depression...I have to find a way to move forward.

Every time I even consider trying to do anything I just get this overwhelming anxiety/depression. 

FYI - I can't take antidepressants, also I've tried therapy but didn't help and I have no access to therapy again for a year. I'm on my own with this.",22Sep2019,1
429,"Estimation of anything is not my thing and ever since the beginning I've always given an over estimation of the time it takes to complete something. If it can be done by the end of the day, I would say it can deliver it by tomorrow for example. What I think is that if I ever mess up or just can't figure out the solution, at least I have some extra time to get my shit together and deliver it the next day. Plus, if I did get it done by that day but it was expected to be done by tomorrow, it would seem to give a good impression, no?

On the other hand, what I think about ""under"" estimating or giving the exact time on the dot is just stressful. Plus if you mess up, you'd need to drop that expectation you promised and tell that you need more time, which I think doesn't look good.

Well, currently I'm working with another group for another project now and this manager doesn't seem to buy it. He would always ask why would it take so long to complete or bargain out for a shorter duration. I'll be honest, I have a tendency to stretch the time a little because I don't like the be rushed and worry as the time ticks. So which would leave a better impression?",22Sep2019,2
430,"and have been looking at Tiffany rings, about £1,500 is the price of the one I’m looking at, but everyone who asks me about us not being engaged basically says “well mine cost [*insert amount under £200*]…” as thought I’m being ridiculous looking at Tiffany rings.

We aren’t flush with cash or anything, but both of us have always been under the impression (through films and TV shows) that an expensive ring is really important.

If I had the choice, I’d love to be able to get her a Tiffany ring (which I’ve saved up the money  for), but people make me feel like I’m being ridiculous because our wealth doesn’t equate to such a nice ring.

431,"My life has been going unusually well for the last couple of weeks. However, I keep having these weird thoughts. Things like “stop listening to these certain songs or everything will go wrong”. I’ve been avoiding certain things I get a bad feeling from (nothing major, mainly music) for a while now, and sometimes I think “well I’ve been doing it for a while now, that’s why everything is going well”.  Also for some reason, my Duolingo streak is also associated to this. I’m scared that if I break the streak, everything will go wrong, as I started it right when things started to be good.

433,"She used to be talkative, very open, overly expressive, and quirky before senior year. I remember in freshman year she was quiet and shy.

But this year as a senior I was watching her closely. She is clueless and sort of losing that personality she had? When people ask how she is she asks them why they are asking that. I once invited her to sit with me but she asked why and had a blank expression. I told her why and she said “Oh. Really? Cool!” She had the biggest smile on her face. And she sat with me, but became quiet and just started reading stuff on the human brain on her laptop without talking to me. She seemed to lack social skills, was rude to me a couple of times but I think unintentionally, and I noticed clearly irritated by sounds that I hear, but don’t actually startle me.

Then one day when I was with a friend and passing by the girl, she was hyperventilating and was looking down.

I went to the bathroom to find her and managed to convince her to come out of the stall and I asked if she wanted to talk, if she was hurt, if someone said something, if something happened, etc

She said “No” and barely made eye contact. I told her she could join my lunch table and she just nodded and said she was fine. I asked if I could hug her or touch her and she said quickly “No.”

Fast forward a few minutes and I see her passing by my table and I try to invite her but she goes outside instead and eats alone while on her laptop with her headphones on.

When senior year started, we had a liturgy first day of school. Usually this girl would talk to every single person she could find and try to involve herself in their conversations. But this year she had a human body book and was reading it (keep in mind we never were assigned this book specifically and when I asked, she said it was just for fun) and tried avoiding anyone. Before liturgy started, people were clapping and I was sitting next to her. I asked her why she was so quiet and she said she just was. Then after maybe the third time of clapping, she leaned forward, cupped her ears, and literally started crying. I don’t know if the sound was loud to her, but I was going to comfort her. But the teacher pulled her out of the gym to calm down.

This girl is just one of a kind. She doesn’t make eye contact as much now (glances away an abnormal amount when talking to me), always talks about trivia facts or maybe a single subject like microorganisms, has an oddly good memory, clearly lacks social skills and doesn’t understand when I am joking sometimes (which has led to miscommunication), and is quiet this year. I don’t know what happened, but I think she is becoming a completely different person besides her obsessions with science. Her social skills are gone, her facial expressions are usually blank unless we talk about science or theories, she barely gives eye contact, and clearly had two nervous breakdowns, one I speculate from the sound of clapping.

I was considering asking her if she is autistic, but that probably would scare her away.",22Sep2019,1

443,"My older brother has been a tough one for years. Often depressed, often mad at others and often arguing over stupid things with parents. But I know he wanted to be different. In my family I have 3 brothers, one of which is my twin, two others are older. The one I’m talking about is one of the older ones. He was, as I’ve heard a very happy kid. But when me and my twin were born he and his older brother were sort of fighting over our attention. As he was in this tough moment of being a teenager, while that was happening, he felt like lacking attention as well. Therefore now he is very moody almost all the time and sometimes, though not as often as he used to he is picking on my twin brother which really pisses me off. The thing is he is getting better, and for quite a long time I believed he finally changed. He didn’t. He is in a tough position that he knows his relationship with his girlfriend isn’t working, and is getting himself to tell her that, but knows she is very sensitive and has a bad family story behind her. Because of that I suppose he started getting moody again. He started calling out my twin on dumb effing things and called him a fatfuck behind his back at one moment like he used to couple of years ago, when my twin was still fat and this was his sensitive spot. This set me off, so I was angry at him. But after the dinner a few minutes ago I’ve heard my dad shouting at someone. Of course it was towards my older brother. I’ve heard some words such as disappointment and „whatever comes out of your mouth, you always hurt people”.

Now I’m here writing to you cause I don’t know what to do. Keep in mind, we usually are a loving family, we are just going through a tought time. Both dad and older brother are fantastic people, but now they are foing wrong and I see they are at the breaking point so I don’t want to hurt them, but I also don’t want to me or my twin to be treated like punching bags (we aren’t actually beaten, just as for I don’t want anyone to treat us wrong, because of having a bad day).

And afterwards, I was looking at my boyfriend in the dream- I wanted to tell him SO badly, but I couldn't. I felt like I couldn't breathe, and it felt like my heart was breaking. I woke up in a panic, and still am.

I had a male friend I was close friends with. Nothing more than friends- he had/is a fiancé, he was/is utterly in love with her. My boyfriend started to tell me that he thought it was weird, my being friends with another guy like that- and every time we argued over anything, he'd bring up the friend, saying that I must have feelings for him and how he didn't trust our friendship. So I stopped being friends with him, I haven't talked to him in almost a year. 

My boyfriend still bring him up- and did a few days ago during a heated argument. 

I've never had feelings for this friend, we both love different people, there was never anything going on there. But since then, I've had dreams of cheating with him, and now other people. 

I don't know why, part of me feels like it's because of the way he scares me with how he talks to me when it comes to me being around other guys. But I am scared. I love my boyfriend more than anything, and it really scares me that my dreams involve this.

451,"So let's get started. I am a 15 year old boy who lives in France. I have been living with my parents for almost a year and I love my mother for what she's done but I can't say the same about my Father. He's a drunkard, as  I said earlier. 

He works 6-7 hours a day in the morning and after coming home, all he does is sleep. Neither he cooks lunch/dinner nor helps in household works. But before he comes home, he always drinks a bottle of Vodka. Even in the weekends, the first thing that he does after waking up is go to the nearby shop and drink one or more than  bottle of Vodka. I am fed up of him. I have got a big brother(19 yrs) and a small one(3yrs). I pity my small brother because I think he might get a bad future because of this fuckin drunkard father who doesn't know his responsibilities. 

Whereas,  my mother, she works 7 days a week. She's a hard worker. I and my brother always tell her to divorce this ""so called drunkard"" but she won't. She thinks that she may not be able to handle all 3 of us (Brothers) by herself but staying with him won't do any good to her either. They dispute every day and night. I and my big brother get mentally tortured because of their fights. 

Neither he nor I can focus on my studies. I try to concentrate but sometimes I lose hope and think that my future will be spoiled because of this ""Irresponsible Father"". I've got a habit of smelling his shitty mouth to know whether he has drank or not. I've just lost hope. I don't think that he might be able to change. 

I really wish that he dies for his own good and ours. I want my mom to live a happy life, not with a fuckin asshole drunkard like him. I really want us to live happily, not with a drunkard like him. I myself think that he might become happy if they divorce.

457,"Hello Reddit, I'm a new user and posting on my phone so sorry for the format.
I've also been drinking a bit so sorry if this written a bit sloppily. 

Some context.

I F(25) moved back to my home town to be closer to my parents and sister about 6 months ago. The 6 years before I lived on the other side of the country to go to uni.

During this time I had little contact with my family and went through some unfortunate things that left me with a bit of an anger problem. I was never really close to my sister because of the 4 year age difference, but since I moved back home I've been meeting with her once a week just to hang out and we've become very close and discovered we could have a relationship that benefitted both of us greatly.

My sister is a fragile girl. She has no self esteem, fell from one bad boyfriend into the arms of another and so on. She used to go to house parties of people she barely knew filled with strangers and use drugs with them (usually extacy or lsd). 

While I was visiting my parents about 2 years ago she was also there, seemed really bothered and emotional and wanted to talk to me privately. It turns out that she had been raped at a party a year earlier, when she was 18. It took her a year to work up the courage to tell me and I was very happy she did, but I had no idea how to help her or support her. I was mostly so enraged because the police basically laughed her away when she tried to press charges a few months after it happened.

She never wanted to talk about it again and just pretended it didnt happen. All I knew was the guy's first name and the month and year it happened. I tried to find him using her Facebook friends of friends but no luck. Probably for the best because I had some very elaborate plans to murder him if I did find him.

Now I'm writing this because yesterday my sister sat me and my parents down for a serious talk. She started crying and told us how unhappy she was and that she started therapy because aside from ""enter abusive boyfriend a-z"" she was raped 3 years ago (this is all stuff she told me and we talked about, I absolutely supported her doing therapy. My parents didnt know)

But she was raped again at a club on holiday a year after that.

My father (61) completely shut down. He's an autistic physicist with no friends and no social skills, and his family is his life. I could see his soul break in his face but he said and did nothing.

My mom (64) is a doctor for severly mentally disabled people. She's from a poor farming family with 8 kids, and her reaction to any hardship is ""you didnt die, be sad for a moment and get over it"". So she had no idea how to react and started off well meant but so wrong. 

""well you are very kind and naive and sometimes people..."" 

I saw my sister's eyes go wide (she told me some of the more violent details) so I said ""Sometimes people are just monsters."" 

Mom then uttered ""did you go to the police?""

Sister told them how they turned her away because she waited too long and couldn't prove anything.

And my dad blew up at my mom ""of course they would react like that you know this!"". My mom in turn ""dont get mad at me!""

Sister still in tears so I put my arm between them and said how this was just a horrible situation. Then I hugged her for a long time. My mom tried to as well but she was struggling.

My sister ended up being the one to give my dad a few pats on the back while he couldn't really look at her.

It wasnt discussed at all after that. Parents did say they were proud of her for going to therapy and then changed the subject to lighten the mood.

Afterwards she told me she didnt want to tell our parents, that she didnt know how it would benefit her. I said I was proud of her for telling them and me, because it wasnt a painful thing she had to keep secret anymore. I also told her that this was in no way a negative thing about her, but a terrible thing that happened to her. It made her smile and made me cry.

Please help me reddit, I'm sorry for the long post but I dont know what to do or how to help her. She knows she can talk to me about anything and she does, we've spend a lot of time together this past year and I love her so much.

I dont want to bring up the subject because she does not want to talk about it, but I'm sitting here with this intense rage and feeling of powerlessness and I need some advice.",22Sep2019,1
458,"I know for a fact that they didn't see each other. He works part time and the rest of the time is always with me... So I get that he want to talk to other people and not only to me. In August he (34m) contacted this woman (32f) with a fake facebook, because the other one was connected to the PC and didn't want me to see his texts for privacy (??????) after more than 15 years that they weren't talking because life. I discovered about the fake account created in June only one week ago... 

 























This became a problem when, one night three weeks ago, I got up at 2AM and discovered him talking to her on the phone with a low sexy and flirty voice (even if they were talking about casual crap). This never happened before. After this episode she started to act clingy, asking why he didn't reply her fast, why he didn't reply her when he was online (things like ""I saw you were online, why didn't you write me/reply me?? Why don't you call me? I miss you. What does our relationship mean?"") and would call him at dead hours and send multiple texts everywhere possible if he didn't reply. 















He told me all this, I didn't ask him. I asked him ""Why don't you answer to the phone? You can talk even if I'm here. I can do something else"". To which he said ""No, I don't feel comfortable talking on the phone with somebody if someone else's present"". I can understand this, yet when someone from his family or work is on the phone there's no problem for him to talk when I'm present. 


















He already told her to stop, because she was disturbing us, and she didn't stop. I (26f) asked him to please stop talking to that person because it hurt me (I am very insecure, even if I ... Not to be mean... am more beautiful and intelligent than this woman). Not to be mean, but I am fit while she is obese. He is really handsome, think about Chris Hemsworth with black hair and eyes. Again, it's not to be mean, just to give some details. 
He says that I am the only one fully understanding him, that he trusts me and that I'm the only one with whom he can be 100% himself. He also says I'm mature, funny, etc... 










I would never, neither in my wildest dreams, act like her towards another man... Not to mention a man that has a fiancé or a wife. 





















He promised me that he ""would stop and block her, because it bothered him a lot how she escalated so much for nothing since they were talking normally"", but he kept secretly talking to that person. 
And it bothers me that he baltantly lies to me.



















We ended up fighting, because I discovered that he lied and he didn't want to let me see the texts beetwen them to make me less jealous and stay in peace and would tell me it wasn't true that they were still chatting and delete the chat (even if I saw it with my own eyes). I can see the fact that he wants his privacy, yet wouldn't you show your girlfriend some texts seen the situation?
























Again, he didn't talk to this person in more than 15 years. What's the big deal? When I chat with someone I don't have problems if he watches. I hided the screen sometimes jokingly doing something else on the phone, because that's what he does when I'm near him and he chats. And when I told him that he always hides his chat screen he told me "" You do it too!"", even if it was clear that when I did it I was joking. 























When I told him that I would contact her personally if she keeps calling at those hours or acting like this, to ask her why does a married woman with children do this, he asked me to don't try to contact her because it would be a lack of respect towards him and would be pathetic. He told me that she accused him of deceiving her when he wrote her that she was exaggerating and wanting too much attention. Again, I agree a bit with him, but I still feel like he is  hiding something, some notions he didn't tell me... 






















Yesterday I told him ""Anyway, I talked to her."" (It was a lie) We were cooking and he stormed out the room. He was in the bedroom, hitting the bed with the fists and shouting ""I can't live like this anymore! I can't do anything! I can't have friends!"" and swearing and cussing. 















It's not true that he can't have friends! He doesn't want male friends (he has some but he doesn't talk with them if not once or twice a year), he only wants female friends. He says that he doesn't have what to talk about with males, while with females he can be more open. I think this is just BS, and that he wants to be surrounded and feeling needed by women. It's not a problem if he has female friends. It's a problem if they begin to act like this one with him! It's a lack of respect for me. I asked him if he wanted to break-up or a pause, and he said no and that he wanted and loved only me.
















So, should I contact her?",22Sep2019,1
459,"My name is seen as unusual - I don't think it is at all, it certainly wasn't my intention to give myself an unusual name - it's also not helped by the fact I use an unusual spelling (I came up with this name when I was still just a teenager, and my English wasn't great so I didn't realize the 'rules'). 

I met my boyfriends friend last week, she asked about my name and I struggled to answer so my boyfriend told her I chose it...it really bothered me. I guess I need to come up with a better response to stop it happening again.

When I tell people my name they often say 'Oh, that's unusual, where does it come from/why did your parents chose that name?' - I don't know how best to deal with these questions as I don't want to tell people I came up with the name myself, as people can view chosen names as not your 'real name' or they ask my given name.",22Sep2019,1

466,"So a two weeks ago I was home alone with nothing to do and was incredibly bored, and I heard my doorbell ring. I went to check and it was people from a Christian church (they never said which one in specific). Now I'm agnostic and would normally just politely turn anyone from the Church away, but this time, because I was so bored, I decided fuck it, it's something to do for 5 minutes. So I talk with them for a little bit, not mentioning my own religious views the entire time, and when they're about to leave they ask if they can come back with more scriptures in the future. I'm trying to be polite and didn't want to say anything like, no I was just using you for entertainment, so I say sure, not expecting them to ever actually come back, and go back to doing nothing.

Fast-forward one week to last weekend and they showed up again, and at this point I felt like I was in to deep to tell them to go away, so I just told them that i'm a full time student, which is true, and had a lot of homework to do that day, which was a lie, and they left. Fast-forward another week to today and they showed up again and once again I told them that I had a lot of homework to do, which was true this time, and instead of immediately leaving like they did last time they still insisted on sharing a scripture and gave me a pamphlet, which I immediately throw in the recycling when I got inside.

I know this is all my fault, and the simple answer is just telling them not to come back, but I can't figure out how to do that in a polite way, and without revealing the whole unused them for entertainment thing. This may seem like the dumbest thing ever, but feel like I've opened Pandora's Box and I have no idea how to close it. Help?",22Sep2019,3

478,"This girl is not the world’s best texter, she is much better in person and over the phone. We connected really well over the summer, but by the time we started to become more “playful”( idk know how else to categorize playful touching) we both went back to different school.

Two weeks after we are back in school, I get a snap from her saying her bf broke up with her, at this point I didn’t know she had one. From that point onward we talked more, then eventually began FaceTiming. However, I started to get the feeling that maybe she was just using me to not be lonely. Although she kinda calls me by a nickname(just a silly variation of my name) and does seem interested in hanging out, I just keep getting mixed feels from her. I even got a late night “crying” text from her.

She recently wasn’t feeling great and I told her we would talk later. I confirmed later on that we would. So after a long excruciating day of hiking I stayed up and waited for her to call me. 

She didn’t call me and I waited all night to hear from her, I just told myself to relax and didn’t ask her what was up. The next morning I got a “ *nickname* are you still up” “ sorry I ended up going out last night and forgot to text you.” 

How should I respond to this? I don’t want to be cold or anything, but I kinda want to let her know that I waited for her and she ghosted me. I don’t want this kind of thing to become common, and I am just a tool for her to use when she wants. Again I am getting mixed vibes from her, and I keep throwing hints in there like “ when are we hanging out” “ I really want to hang with you” and so on.

479,"Hi. I need to figure out if I’m being exhausting or not. I have a lot of anxiety issues and I hate not knowing what’s going to happen, it drives me crazy.

So my husband and I have been together for five years (married for one) and his mom has had several rental properties up for renting throughout the years. When I first moved here (when we first dating) to escape my abusive household, we lived in a bedroom in his grandmother’s, as we were both unable to afford a real place. We then moved into a very small, old single wide, said it was temporary but lived there for three years. It was a struggle. Once I graduated and my husband got a full time job, we moved into one of his mom’s rental properties. A year later she said she was selling the house we’re in but we could move into another property — his childhood home. I was excited because she said it was bigger and that I’d love it. 

Fast forward and 85% of my house is packed. We go to look at the new place and it’s absolute crap. Holes in the doors, floors and walls. Water damage everywhere. Trash all over the property. It wreaks of dog and it is nothing what I expected. It’s a double wide, which I have no issue with, but I was under the impression that it was an actual house. His mom tells me she had no idea it looked like that, which strikes me as a red flag. She then says she’ll hire a contractor and fix the floors, and that once we put paint on the walls and get the floors done, I’ll love it. she says I can pick out what I want and she won’t sell our house until this new one is 100% liveable. 

My husband instantly gets excited about a project. He says it’ll only take two months and he’ll help his mom. This bothers me because he’s overworked already as he works two jobs and traditionally the landlord should take care of all this... not to mention that his family did not help us repair the single wide we lived in, but when his sister moved in there, they completely renovated it.

disappointed, I tell him we should look into our options and start looking at places in the city (40 minutes away and where we both work — moving here would cut our commute drastically). He accepts but says he’s worried about the crime rate (even though we got robbed here a few months ago in this small town that’s considered safe). He also has some emotional attachment to this house since he grew up there, and I understand that. He seems excited about living there. 

We table the discussion for a week so my husband and I can enjoy our anniversary. We came back in town yesterday, and the story completely changes. His mom and dad say they don’t have time and a lot of money for this, and they’re not hiring a contractor, so we’re all going to have to do work on it. She says she’ll buy all the cheap vinyl as floors but I worry this won’t last long. This concerns me especially because I know my husband is going to do most of the work. This discussion doesn’t really turn into a discussion, as they just keep saying it’ll be fine, but I don’t get a chance to ask any questions or express my concerns. They tell us it’ll probably take two to three months. How long can I live out of boxes? 

Later that evening, I tell my husband I’m tired of relying on his family for a place to live. I love them and they’re great but they’ve been unreliable in the past. We make enough money to get a nicer place in a nice neighborhood by our jobs. He says he won’t let me live in a shithole and I need to have faith, but I’m concerned I won’t like it even if it’s fixed. I also have concerns about the fact they’re not hiring someone to do the major work. 

For me, I’ve gone along with everything they’ve said and relied on them for a home since I first moved. Now that we’re stable and have a high monthly income together, I’m ready to be independent and move on from having his mom as our landlord. Most of my life I’ve gone along with whatever everyone else said and did and I never got a choice. We moved constantly, and I never felt in control. I want to be independent and choose, but I feel like this will create a rift between my husband and I. 

We are probably going to live wherever we end up for the next three to five years and that’s a long time to live somewhere you dislike. We want to move to a different state. 

The rent is cheap, the land is large and I don’t have to pay a pet deposit or anything — something that’s a challenge with three cats if I moved elsewhere. I know we could save a lot of money if we lived here, and with that saved up wecan buy a house later on. 

I’m grateful that I have a place to live in the meantime, but this situation is exhausting me. I sort of wish I could just trust and go along with what my husband and his family say, but I’m trying to be realistic. I’m also trying to be supportive and positive, but I don’t want my husband to be overworked and stressed because his family doesn’t have time to do all this. I’m worried we’ll make all these repairs and it’ll fall apart later. I’m worried I’ll resent my husband if I move there and he’ll resent me if we move to the city. 

We’ve agreed to see how the place looks with redone floors and walls and doors, but I’m still anxious about everything. Maybe I’m being exhausting, but I just have a very bad gut feeling about this and I feel like no one is listening. My husband is trying to be supportive and helpful about things and he knows I’m stressed out. I’m so scared this will break us apart. 

I want to have faith in him, but I’m just a realistic person, and I’m nervous about how this will end. He just wants us to be happy and save up for our next house out of state and I know he wants the best for us too, but it feels like we’re not seeing eye to eye. 

I feel like we’re being taken advantage of and this will be a bad situation overall. She says she’ll replace the floors and we’ll all “take a day” to paint the house but I feel this is absolutely not my problem as she’s the landlord. 

I’m not sure what to do and I want some advice. 

Thanks.",22Sep2019,5
481,"Hi all, so I've been looking to move recently. I've found a few affordable places to rent in a few separate cities, but the problem is that they're all out-of-state. I'm currently in California and looking to move to Oregon or Washington. Many of the job interviews I've got call backs for needed me in to interview within the week which I couldn't do (since I had a job). I'm now on my last week of work which brings me to the question...

I could drive up and interview, hopefully land a job, and then move or I could move and then interview while moving in. I can see the good and bad traits of both, which is why I'm asking. If I move now, I do have money to support rent/living costs for a few months but I'd risk living without an incoming fund for a little bit. If I wait, I'll either miss out on possible job interviews (because of my location) or I'll have to drive 14-ish hours for one.

One of the smartest options would be to probably find an apartment or two to tour and get a interview(s), and then check the place out and interview over the same few days. I see no problem with that besides the gas funds and hotel fees I'd spend in doing that which I could be using towards my actual rent, you know? I could spare it but it's more of if I should. 

So what do you guys think? Have you moved before landing a job or got a job and then moved? What do you suggest I do, as a 22 year old that's taking my first step in ""adulting""?",22Sep2019,1
483,"I'm 21 years old and female, and I have never had a significant other. I've never kissed anyone, or even held hands with someone I like. I have had multiple crushes, but I've never acted on them. Part of that is because I'm bisexual, so about half the crushes I've had I can't act on (I live in the deep south, and I have to be careful about who I tell about my sexuality), or the people I'm crushing on have significant others of their own. 

There is a guy in one of my college classes who I started talking to while waiting for a test last week, and I've said hello to him again a few more times, but I'm not sure how to get it past the ""basically strangers that know each other by sight"" stage. I think he's cute, but again I only spoke to him that one time, and I have no clue what he's really like. Is it okay to give him a note saying ""I think you're cute, do you want to get coffee some time with me"" and my number? 

I know that it gets a lot harder after college to find someone, and I'd like to at least try dating before I hit Graduate school and I don't have any free time anymore, but I don't want to date just for the sake of dating-- I'd like to actually find someone I'm compatible with and will be happy with but I have no clue how to go about it. 

I'm an introvert and I don't drink, so I don't go to bars. There is a LGBT+ group on campus, but I feel weird about hanging around their events just to try to find someone-- it feels like I'd just be using them.

485,"I have a decent job, and I have an issue with spending money I don't have. So, money is coming in, but it's going out just as fast due to credit card bills, college loans, etc. My job requires a lot of travel, so I'm gone quite often. I'll travel up to 4x per month for at least 4-5 days at a time. I'll leave Sunday and return either Thursday evening or Friday. I don't require a lot of space or necessities. I'm a very simple person.

I had a light bulb turn on when I was traveling recently. Even though the job is decent, I had been living paycheck to paycheck for a minute due to my excessive spending with no financial goals. I told myself I had to do something about the spending, so I formulated a little plan to pay down debt. I also kept hearing many say that most people cannot afford a surprise expense. Like if I had tire issues, I was worried I wouldn't be able to afford the work.

I looked at cost savings potential across the board and the biggest expense was my 1 bedroom apartment that cost a pretty penny. As luck had it, it turned out that a colleague/""friend"" just bought a place and offered me a place to stay for about 40% cheaper than where I was at. I was in a pretty nice apartment complex with all of the amenities one would need. I was happy to forfeit the amenities to save money because as I mentioned earlier, I am traveling quite often.

I ended up moving into the house a couple of months ago. A little background on the ""friend"" I live with which is where you're going to see I need some advice. I think he a generally a good person, but he deals with shady people. He is a dealer, and there is no telling exactly what he deals. He said he gave it up, but there was very clearly a scale and let's just say some hard drugs on the kitchen countertop on Friday night. I don't know if it matters what he deals, but some of the stuff is a little harder than your basic stuff if that gives you an idea.

He's several years younger than me, he's a big guy, loud, messy. He's a sales guy, I'm a services guy. We work at the same company and I actually got him the job there. Long story short, the place almost seems like a higher end trap house. The rugs are slightly stained, music instruments everywhere, aforementioned roommate with shady dealings, always messy sink, just feels dirty. The lawn is shitty compared to the neighbors, plus plenty more details. 

He also wasn't forthcoming with the fact that his brother would be moved in by the time I moved in. Then he said it would be temporary. His brother is not as loud and outgoing as him, but he's messy and I don't think it crosses his mind what it means to be a good roommate and how to respect one another. I was under the impression that there would be 2 people living here, not 3.

For example, last night he stayed up all night, had his light on, and you could hear him playing games all through the night. He gets fast food all the time, not that I should worry what he etas, but he keeps a garbage in the hallway and throws his shit out in there. He's just a messy gamer who is a nice fella. I think he means well like his brother, but it may not be obvious, plus he's super shy and isn't big on sharing his feelings. My thoughts are that he has an insanely good deal with his brother to stay here for cheap.

I'm kind of stuck at this location for now due to the previously mentioned issues. I have a lot of internal issues with my colleague/landlord buddy, and his brother. The night before I found the stuff on the counter, he had several people over that night and they didn't stop making loud noises (musical instruments with loud bass) until like 6AM. I'm find with acoustic stuff, but when the floor is banging with bass, come the fuck on. Luckily last night was quiet because big guy was crashed out from Friday night, but then his brother ""saved the night"" by waking me up several times.

I'm almost 100% positive I pay the most money across all 3 tenants. I know what my roommate's monthly mortgage is, and I pay like 60-65% of it. I know his brother pays rent. Landlord dude probably pays a couple of hundred dollars for the rest of the expenses and that's about it right now. I get that is the benefit of being a homeowner. You can charge your roommates whatever and almost pay for your mortgage with that, but the other side of the coin is you have to be respectful of those that help you pay your mortgage.

Okay, so for the advice part. Since he seems to deal in shady business, I'm worried about him inviting the wrong people here and them taking advantage of him. Shit, the back of my mind is worried anybody can just come in my room and steal whatever. We do not have any kind of contract written up. My TV and couch is in the living room. What is the best way to handle this? Should I take inventory of all of my possessions? How should I approach the roommate on this topic?

What about the noise and us understanding respect? I don't think I'm any kind of burden on the roommates, but they have proven to be a burden in the 2 short months I've been here. How do I bring up some of my issues? Do you think it would be a good idea to request that we get a contract spun up? None of this is contractually binding which was one of the benefits of living here. No deposit, cheap rent, but now I have all these issues.

They are the kind of people who don't worry about taking out the garbage, having clean clothes and being organized. I get it, we value different things, but I just feel like where I've met them in the middle, I'm getting dicked around because he knows I don't have a place to go for the moment.

Any and all advice is appreciated!

486,"i work at a bar &amp; grill and a man yesterday was super drunk and grabbed me and whispered that he’s liked me since he came in and he literally was holding me and his friends were kinda around and laughing and then he kissed me cheek while still holding me and then took his number out and he’s like ‘give me ur number now’ and i read the situation and was really scared cause his buddy was right infront of us whole he was holding me so i put my number in and he texted it and was like let me check if it’s u. and he said give me ur phone and i took it out and he finally let go of me and i said my manager needs me.

487,"Okay so this is going to take a lot of explaining to do. I guess I'll give a little background information into myself. I am a M and 18 years old. I have a lot of mental health issues and possibly addictions issues. The most concerning of all is my depression that has lead to suicidal idealizations. I grew up with lower middle class money within my family. I do not really know a lot about myself other than I truly just want to be happy. I went to a private high school that I probably didn't deserve to be in paying very little in tuition. I was lonely basically for the entirety of my life all the way up till the latter half of my senior year.

 I met this girl who was my world, I would be around here 24/7 all day and we had the best 6 months of my life together. I felt like I could marry her in all honesty which might just be naive youth speaking. She was my first lay and first real love to this day. I never felt a connection with my family or my extended family. I had friends who I liked but it never really felt the same way. I would have given my life for her. We knew in the beginning that this was probably going to hurt us when the last six months of high school was up and we both had to choose a college to go to.

 I was BLESSED with a full ride (everything including my f\^cking textbooks) to a school just around 1000 miles away from where we lived. After long consideration I took this opportunity either due to the courage to follow an opportunity that would ultimately be good for my knowledge or due to the fear of taking out college loans.  Since moving to my new location I've felt so alone and shameful that I took the easy (financially speaking) and safe route out. I've thought about moving back to my home town to live with this girl but this sounds completely ridiculous in the sense of reason and logic.  Shes the only thing that has ever made me truly happy and I don't know how to do things without her. If I were to move back in this situation I'm well aware I will probably never get a college degree but my first course of action would be to sign up for something that is a guaranteed job in two years. (my first thought is being a fire fighter / EMT) So many questions run through out my mind when I consider this. What if we were to break up (which we had a very short lived break when I left but are now doing a shaky long distance situation. What if I look back and regret not staying with this 200 thousand dollar opportunity. Another thing that has driven me to consider this is that I have ZERO idea what I intend on majoring in, what fields interest me and I'm not sure if I even enjoy school at all. I am well aware I am good at school and I would argue I am the thinking type but the gratification that comes out of something that is manual labor intrigues me too. So reddit in my situation what would you all do? I am aware that this might come off as puppy love or me thinking that since this is my first person I wont be able to find another one which might be entirely correct. I'm open to all of your thoughts so please tell me if you think I'm ridiculous or not.

I’m pissed off because I’ve slept through my whole weekend and I have no idea why or how to change that, I want to be able to have a normal life on my weekends to meet and do things I want to do.

490,"So I have been living in this brand new apartment since August 1. I’ve met my neighbor and get along with him well. I met his dog as well who is a 6 month old pitbull/bulldog mix who is white with black speckles all over, real cutie. 

I have noticed that the guy is constantly out partying or ya going out with friends while his other friend literally live at his apartment to “watch” the dog and partying there. The room is always loud and chaotic with drunk and high people (not against alcohol or drugs). My point with this note is that the dog is always in a crazy, loud, and negative environment which had resulted in her being very timid and wary of people.

She doesn’t have an outlet for her energy as she’s kept cooped up inside the apartment. So when I babysit her, she runs wild in my apartment and barks like she’s rabid, running into walls and doors and furniture and nothing stops her. She becomes a bit violent too, snapping at people and has bitten me several times, once breaking the skin. 

She’s a loveable dog, don’t get me wrong, but she’s like crying for help because her fucking owner is barely loving her.

Every person I talk to about this and show the dog to has agreed with me heavily and one even went so far as to buy a 20 lbs bag of dog food because the owner had not fed her in 3 days. Nor given her water because every day I saw that the water bowl was bone dry in 94* degrees Fahrenheit of heat. The dogs fur was hot like a frying pan and she was heaving. 

And Lord knows what the hell hes thinking by keeping is apartment like [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/PDv1PXZ). She literally just stares at me while I’m out here with this depressed face. It kills me. And when I leave she barks for nearly an hour like “Take me with you!”.

This dog apparently was a top bred dog with a famous pedigree which puts her at $10,000. Yet she is living in a luxury apartment in filth. 

I’m wondering if I should just say fuck it and report his ass to the landlord or animal rights. 

Thing is, having a pet is like having a child. They are you top priority in most situations. Their livelihood is more important than yours. My kitten is the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning to when I close my eyes at night. If he’s not happy, I’m not happy. He’s basically my son. He costed $65 but he’s priceless to me. I could never just leave him in filth- his own filth, and degrade him like that.

Sorry for the lengthy post. Here’s a TLDR

TL;DR: Living in an apartment and share a balcony with a guy who is neglect to feed and pick up after his dog. The dog lives is filth all day. I want to know if I should report him to someone. [Here’s](https://imgur.com/gallery/PDv1PXZ) the conditions and the dog. Her name is Storm.",22Sep2019,1

492,"I'm currently in town visiting my parents. Each time I visit, I notice that my mom's food/""toxins"" paranoia gets worse. I think it's interfering with her life.

My mom started out with a few strange food paranoias. It happened really gradually. A few years ago she stopped eating fruits/vegetables that were imported from abroad because they ""have more pesticides."" Okay, fine. Whatever. Doesn't impact our lives.

Then she started only eating certain types of produce if they were organic after reading something on the internet. She absolutely refuses to eat even 1 strawberry if it's not organic because she's convinced it will give her cancer. 


She also started eating all kinds of weird things. Her breakfast every morning was a pretty gross mix of different seeds, nuts, spices, etc all boiled together. She said it was going to prevent cancer because she researched it. 

Then last year she got a kidney stone. It runs in her family and is a normal thing to get at her age (65). She freaked out and started eliminating dozens more foods from her diet completely. 


Then she read online about glyphosates and eliminated more foods.


It's genuinely impossible to cook for her. Every other ingredient is ""toxic"" or ""full of pesticides""

She also freaks out and lectures us about ""the dirty dozen"" or ""glyphosates"" or ""organic foods"" or ""Roundup"" or whatever else because she's convinced we will get cancer and she has some sort of secret knowledge.


But it didn't stop there. She has all kinds of paranoid rituals that aren't mentally healthy. 


When she uses the microwave, she has rules. Everyone must stand at least 6 feet away from the microwave. After it's done cooking, she counts to 15 before opening the door so the ""radiation doesn't get out""

She won't go through the scanner at the airport and instead insists on a pat down. She also refuses to get an x-ray at the dentist. A few months ago the doctor felt a growth on her spine and thought that was suspicious (could have been nothing, but it might have been tumors.) My mom didn't tell us for months because she didn't want to get the x-ray. We finally found out and made her get it. She freaked out. Then the doctor wanted to do an MRI as well, and she freaked out more and even called the poor secretary and yelled at her for ""needlessly exposing her to radiation"". Then my mom found out MRIs don't even use radiation. She was happy again. 

Last night she absolutely freaked out when a fly got inside. She was in the kitchen with a fly swatter for an hour and refused to go to bed because ""the fly is flying slowly so it must be sick and diseased. I can't leave it down here! It will poop on everything!"" she was in a genuine panic. There wasn't even any food out. 


She refuses to use laundry detergent, even if it's unscented. Instead she uses some sort of plastic ball with metal balls inside to ""beat the dirt out of the clothes instead of using chemicals""




Today I was cooking lunch and realized she didn't have any non-stick skillets. I had to make stir fry in a stainless steel pan which was a huge pain. I mentioned to my mom ""mom, how about I buy you a non-stick skillet?"" and she said ""No! That's chemicals!"" and I said ""mom, it's harmless, you don't eat the tefflon"" and she said ""look it up! it's toxic!""


She won't clean the countertop with anything other than water. No bleach, no cleaning sprays. She says they are chemicals and she doesn't want to breath it in.

She won't let me use an air freshener. Again, chemicals. ""look it up online"" she says



I can go on and on. Everything is ""chemicals"" and ""toxic"" and she lives her life so hyper focused on every little thing. She reads these crazy conspiracy websites written by random house wives and 100% believes them, even if I show her an actual scientific study showing it's nonsense. 


It's even more ridiculous because my mom knows nothing whatsoever about science or biology. She worked as a middle school Spanish teacher before retiring. Last night we were playing a trivia game, and she got an answer wrong because she thought that dogs are not mammals. She said ""they aren't mammals! They are canines.""

She has absolutely no understanding whatsoever of what she reads. But she's becoming more and more paranoid about ridiculous things. This paranoia impacts every part of her life. 


It's even more ridiculous because she's not that healthy. She never exercises (except maybe a 20 minute walk a few times a week). She sits and watches like 8 hours of TV every day, and then with the rest of her time she sits and crochets. She lives in a house that's fully carpeted that is vacuumed like maybe once every 5 years, etc. 



My dad agrees that it's not healthy for her to be so paranoid and scared of everything. 


Is this a harmless quirk? Or should we encourage her to go to therapy?",22Sep2019,1
493,"Ok so this is going to sound really dumb, and is probably going to give quite a few people a good laugh because I myself have laughed at stories like this before, but..

So I was playing a ranked match of a particular game and there was a player performing poorly. Having not said anything to him, that player complains, bitches and moan whilst still performing poorly. Some of us decide to point out he's the reason we're losing the game and that he's bad. He takes it super personally for some reason.

Next match, I get him in the same lobby and he says outright that he's throwing the game because of me. I call him weak minded and he starts asking me to fight irl. 

Idk if this is what doxxed me, but normally I don't care and just play along with them and incite them to come and fight me. He calls out a place and I say that I can't be bothered cause I'm from this other place. 

He then calls out a nationality and starts making racist jokes. I'm not of that nationality, but I could pass off as one quite easily. I also don't think it's a random guess since the guess was specific enough.

495,"Tomorrow my dad, my mum, my sister, my husband and myself are going to a meeting with social services. It’s a networking meeting where the primary focus will be how to help my sister’s two children, a boy age 8, Bradley, and a girl age 5, Maya. My biggest concern here is Bradley. He is a traumatized kid whose behavior has become extremely aggressive &amp; defiant and only seems to be getting worse. We are looking to go into this meeting with constructive ideas for how we as a family can get these kids the help they need and to help my sister before she loses custody of them.

So, here is a breakdown of the situation.

We think Bradley became traumatized mainly because of his father, Brian. Brian is a racist, angry, drug addict. He had been in recovery along with my sister, Susan, for several years but relapsed 2 years ago leading to my sister leaving him for the good of the kids. However, Brian is very manipulative, often losing his temper at Bradley to the point Maya gets afraid and cries. Brian is not legally allowed to be alone with the kids due to his drug use, but my sister has a form of Asperger’s syndrome and has trouble saying no. He takes her money and must always know where she is and what she’s doing all the time. He also will just go over to her apartment when he wants and then get angry at Susan &amp; the kids for the smallest things. We have talked to Susan about spending less time with him but it’s nearly impossible and now she’s lying about seeing him because she knows what we think about that and how it could affect her having custody. 

We know there are other factors than just Brian. The area they lived in was very poor with a lot of low income and refugee households. Violence is a regular occurrence in the area and my sister was even attacked there once by a man for telling off his child who nearly ran over Maya on a motorbike in a playground. Bradley has been subject to a lot of bullying and has already had to change school because of it. He may have to do so again because it is happening at his new school too.

Bradley is not simply a victim though. He has developed into a violent, mouthy brat with no boundaries. We know he is bringing the bullying on himself and is exhibiting bullying behaviors too. We think that it’s more that he seems to copy learned behavior that he’s picked up from his dad and other bullies as he certainly isn’t a ringleader and can be quite reserved until he gets riled up. He hasn’t had specific one to one therapy, but he has been to group therapy meetings with a group of other children who have parents living with drug addiction and/or mental health issues to help him with his feelings. He likes the group, but we haven’t noticed any improvement in his behavior.

Nobody sets boundaries with him except me and my husband. My sister lets him get his way all the time and never punishes or provides consequences for his behavior because it’s easier and when he doesn’t get his way, he gets super aggressive and calls his mum a fucking whore and stupid idiot and so on. He will also refer to me and my husband like this when angry or trying to provoke us for fun. A big problem with Bradley and my sister’s relationship is not only that she gives in to him too much but also that she treats him more like a friend than her son and doesn’t prevent him from overhearing things from the lives of her friends who still have relationships with other drug addicts. For example, he knows the difference between being arrested &amp; being apprehended and how many days the police can keep you on certain charges. These are things I barely know anything about and certainly something he shouldn’t know at his age. 

A major issue we face, that caused a huge argument between me and Bradley 2 weeks ago, is hygiene. Because of my sister’s Asperger’s she lacks quite severely in hygiene and it has begun to affect her kids. Bradley often refuses to shower which makes him smell quite bad. They’re always dirty and so my mum and I basically always make sure they bathe or shower when we see them. He doesn’t understand why he must shower or even why he must use soap. I think this is part of the reason he also gets bullied at school as well. Bradley refused to shower after an evening sports class and ended up with me carrying him, kicking, screaming and swearing at me, my sister and Maya out into the street and into my car.

His behavior is totally unacceptable and I’m at my wits end. He is especially mean to my husband because they don’t speak the same language and he hasn’t quite figured out that my husband knows enough of our language to understand what Bradley is saying to him. All the children in our family roughhouse quite hard and need to be reminded to keep it in check but Bradley can switch to deliberately trying to inflict as much damage as possible in an instant and will get a good laugh out of drawing blood. He is a violent kid who thinks kicking and punching is fun. I’ve caught him many times being violent towards his cousin, who is 6 years old. It makes me worry about what he could be doing to his little sister, but she is still a mostly happy girl who so far is just scared of her dad when he’s angry. 

We have tried to take more interest in the kids’ lives and be there for them, buying them clothes so they don't only get 2nd hand stuff. We take them to hobbies to try and engage them with groups outside of school and have constructive outlets for their anger. We try to be consistent when they are with us. We don't get angry with them, but we are clear about what behavior isn’t acceptable such as the swearing and violence, and we ensure our home is well maintained so that they understand that it isn't normal not to clean or wash.

We are very hesitant about buying new toys for Bradley as we have seen him destroy gifts the same day, he receives them. Our other nephews have received a new laptop and a kitten from us this year alone and have had to be told to keep the fact we bought them a secret so that no one in Susan’s side of the family become jealous and act out. 

We don't want to just give up on him either, especially because of how his behavior influences his sister but we are struggling to reach him, we are struggling to support my sister whose own issues also need work but we want to walk into this meeting with productive ideas on how to effectively help them.

Any advice on this situation is greatly appreciated. Also, thank you for reading this wall of text!

500,"So basically I went to a wedding for two of my good friends, and was so excited to have a weekend off and enjoy seeing some friends since it was a no kids wedding, and it had been a while since all of us had gotten together.

Back story on the girl, I was introduced to her by the bride, they both were in the same grad program together and we broke up about a year and a half ago.

Here’s what’s so difficult for me, we didn’t date long at all, but for some reason as soon as we met there was a connection, everything just clicked, at least from my perspective. We were/are very similar, have similar interests and even our professional careers had some overlap in what we did.

Basically, she broke up with me, and I did not take it very well when it happened. This had only happened to me once before, and I struggled to understand why, and honestly the day/week it happened I was just more in shock. I just really felt like we could have had a future, but regardless it wasn’t meant to be. I still was very depressed and beat myself up about this. I’m from the Midwest and work for a brewery so a lot of drinking/cannabis use.

Fast forward to this weekend, the wedding is at a summer camp, we are all staying in cabins etc. and I’m staying in the same cabin she is. She got in late Friday so I really didn’t interact with her until Saturday morning. Basically it was a little awkward at first, but I said I’d push through be an adult and enjoy this weekend with my friends and celebrate this marriage. 

Everything is fine and we are pleasant with one another, but eventually we get to the ceremony/reception and I start to just feel weird, mostly the combo of booze and being single at a wedding where most of the other people aren’t. They start to play a very coupley song and everyone is grabbing their partners, as the dj is encouraging it, and she grabs me. I wanted to dance with her the whole night, and I finally was. We smile at each other, look into each other’s eyes, say how nice each other look, she tells me she likes the way I smell, and it was so easy. We catch up and I ask her what she’s thinking for work etc. she’s moving to CO, we live in the Midwest, to pursue her career which made me happy and sad, as I held this person who I cared about. My chest hurt, but I didn’t want the song to end, it did, and the rest of the night all I wanted to do was hold her and dance with her. I never did the rest of the night, and it felt like more of a closure thing for her and for me it brought me back my thoughts of how did you screw this up, what is wrong with you, she is so great and you feel this way after not seeing her for so long. I was spending more time outside than inside because it was hard for me to even be in the room watching her, seeing her smile and just wanting her to smile with me, wanting her to come dance with me again. We didn’t date for long at all, which is why this is so weird for me, I feel like a psycho, and crazy to be feeling these things. I haven’t seen her for a year and a half, and it felt like I was waiting the whole time for that dance. I’ve dated other people and enjoyed my time, but it was never like how it is with her. We really only dated a few months, so I just feel absolutely crazy.

Also the next day it was just me and her in the cabin, I walk in as she is changing her shirt, and so I start to turn around and walk out, and she goes you’re fine, and then proceeds to change her pants in front of me.  Which we are very open people and so this wasn’t that weird it just felt like a gut punch.

Anyways, am I crazy to be feeling this way, what should I do? I have no social media, and deleted all her contact info a while back because I wanted to just be done with it all, so I have no way to contact her. I’m on the car ride home and I can’t stop thinking about this...",22Sep2019,1

We smile at each other, look into each other’s eyes, say how nice each other look, she tells me she likes the way I smell, and it was so easy. We catch up and I ask her what she’s thinking for work etc. she’s moving to CO, we live in the Midwest, to pursue her career which made me happy and sad, as I held this person who I cared about. My chest hurt, but I didn’t want the song to end, it did, and the rest of the night all I wanted to do was hold her and dance with her. I never did the rest of the night, and it felt like more of a closure thing for her and for me it brought me back my thoughts of how did you screw this up, what is wrong with you, she is so great and you feel this way after not seeing her for so long. I was spending more time outside than inside because it was hard for me to even be in the room watching her, seeing her smile and just wanting her to smile with me, wanting her to come dance with me again. We didn’t date for long at all, which is why this is so weird for me, I feel like a psycho, and crazy to be feeling these things. I haven’t seen her for a year and a half, and it felt like I was waiting the whole time for that dance. I’ve dated other people and enjoyed my time, but it was never like how it is with her. We really only dated a few months, so I just feel absolutely crazy.

Also the next day it was just me and her in the cabin, I walk in as she is changing her shirt, and so I start to turn around and walk out, and she goes you’re fine, and then proceeds to change her pants in front of me.  Which we are very open people and so this wasn’t that weird it just felt like a gut punch.

Anyways, am I crazy to be feeling this way, what should I do? I have no social media, and deleted all her contact info a while back because I wanted to just be done with it all, so I have no way to contact her. I’m on the car ride home and I can’t stop thinking about this...",22Sep2019,1
508,"8 months ago I moved countries to take a gap year, 16 000km from my home. After five months I decided I loved it so much I wanted to stay for my studies and after the summer I began to organise how to stay. In the last month though I’ve become really unmotivated and scared of staying, despite still thinking that it’s what I want. I don’t see myself going home but every time I think about my family I think about what I’m missing. My nephew is 4 and I’ve lived with him since his birth, and my niece was just born this year and I haven’t seen her, and won’t see her until she’s 7 months old. 

I also just feel really disconnected from my friends here at the moment, and don’t really want to see them even though while I’m missing my family so much I should be seeing my friends. 

Basically I feel really lost and not at all like myself. I think my self confidence has taken a knock too but I don’t know why. I don’t really know what to do or how to handle it. I spend a lot of time by myself at the moment and need some impartial and unemotional advice not from me.",22Sep2019,1

510,"So for as long as i can remember i am an extremely curious person. Sometimes to the point of it emotionally effecting me. Not a crazy amount but still. For example i pretty much look everyone up and down, guy, girl, old, young, just to like observe my surroundings. Im always curious about how things works, what people are thinking, sometimes even curious what they look like under the clothes and its just like. Why. Cant i just NOT think about this. Its also a thing with hypotheticals whether it be science related, law related, legal or EXTREMELY illegal/fucked up.

511,"Hi. 

My husband’s brother lives with us. At 21, he’s doing well for himself. We’ve never not gotten along. However, he is incredibly sensitive. So, approaching him with relatively small issues here and there is like trying to navigate a mine field without him getting offended. 

He’s obtained a girlfriend. We were psyched for him! We then found out more- she’s barely eighteen with no license and no job, with hardly a place to call home. 

My husband and I talked and agreed she can stay with us free of charge until she can get back on her feet, as long as she helps with chores. 

She’s done nothing but watch TV all day, everyday. She eats our food. She doesn’t clean, and our power bill has tripled somehow? To top it all off, she still has that teenage angst.

So, we’ve decided that if she couldn’t pay rent by the beginning of October, she needed to go. She left around September eighth for barely a week and came back AGAIN. She’s been here ever since. 

It’s even more annoying because now our roommate can’t afford rent because he’s been covering her lazy ass, so we have to cover his. 

How do you approach a very sensitive person about retaining girlfriend time to just weekends? We’re okay if she’s over, we just don’t want her living with us 3.5 weeks out of the month unless she provides in some way. 

We need help! We don’t want to lose him as a roommate but we dislike seeing him with somebody who’s okay with draining his resources and ours. 

Thanks.",22Sep2019,1

Recently, my best friend and I kind of had a revelation. We both admitted that we loved each other romantically.

519,"I've always suspected something bad has happened to my girlfriend when she was younger. I've brought it up (nicely, never pressing the point, never being aggressive about it) and she kind of deflects without really answering. 

So I've stopped bringing it up. But then my sister mentioned it to me yesterday. My girlfriend was crying (pregnant, hormonal) while I was at work and my sister asked her what was wrong. She told her she was just feeling hormonal/emotional. My sister went to give her a hug and she said she just went stiff. It made me remember when I first met her she was kind of the same way. She's not like that with me anymore, but it made me think back to when she was and I was suspecting something happened to her. 

My girlfriend has trouble showing affection, and I think it has something to do with this. 

So yesterday I texted her (I was at work when all the crying was happening or I'd have tried comforting her myself) and said ""I won't bring this up again. But I want you to know if anything bad happened to you when you were younger that it's not your fault. I want you to know if you ever want to talk about anything I'll listen and will not judge, or say anything at all if you don't want me to. I'll always be here for you, I love you. You don't have to acknowledge this text. I just want you to know this"". 

And she didn't acknowledge it, which is fine. I'm not going to bring it up again. I just want to know if there's anything I can do with my actions to make her know she can tell me anything. I am very loving to her. I always tell her how much I love and appreciate her.",22Sep2019,39

523,"I’m (51F) a single mother of two daughters 14 and 16 and our downstairs neighbours smoke weed directly below my oldest’s window. 

We live in the UK and so our apartment building is built to insulate heat, thick glazed windows and thick walls so in the summer it can get very hot and stuffy so we like to have our windows open all day. 

The people who live below us on the ground floor have a patio area where they can put a little seating area or anything they want but they use it now to smoke weed. We’ve been living in the same place for 6/7 years but they’ve only started smoking around 4 years ago so I think it’s their kids who may be doing it but I can’t be sure. My daughters find it annoying and unpleasant as the smell makes them feel ill, but they just close their windows and put on fans in their room. 

The problem is I don’t believe in doing any illegal substances and I have strongly discouraged my daughters from smoking which I doubt they would. Last year my oldest caught a lung infection durning her exams and couldn’t sleep in her room. I didn’t want to make trouble with the family below us, as I wouldn’t want to put my family in danger so I put a bed in the living room which is on the other side of the apartment.  It was disruptive and frustrating so once my daughter improved I told her to let me know when they were smoking again. She did and I called the police who came and hour but said they couldn’t search the house and since they couldn’t smell anything they couldn’t do anything about it, they also said that around 3 people had already reported the smell in the last month. I feel terrible that my children have to go through this.

I’m pretty annoyed they are doing something illegal constantly and I don’t want to have to raise my children to compromise on this. This area doesn’t even allow smoking in or around buildings so I don’t understand why they would smoke weed. 

Now I’m not sure what to do, I could:

1. Call the building association, tell them what’s happening. My only problem with this is they could force her out, a lot of people in this building rent and I’m almost certain they do but I can’t be sure. Also she has very young children and I wouldn’t want them to be thrown out like that.
2. Call the police when it happens again. I wouldn’t want to waste the polices time, and it’s unlikely they can find anything or search without an order from the magistrates court.
3. Speak to them myself. I’m pretty reluctant to do this as I pass their patio on my way to work everyday, and I wouldn’t want any trouble with them and frankly they scare me.
4. Anything else? I’m not sure what else to do as moving not really an option right now.
 
TLDR; my neighbours are smoking weed, I personally don’t want them too as I don’t believe they should as it makes me and my kids uncomfortable.",22Sep2019,1

I didn't do anything to myself, but those felt like years of emptiness, But instead of hurting myself I put my headphones on and listened to music ( TES Oblivion OST - For those who are wondering )  And it helped calm me down.

Eventually we met up again, I told her about how I felt, And she just laughed. I was a little taken aback by it, Maybe she thought I was joking.. I don't know. But it hurt like an arrow to the shoulder.

Well...obviously people can be quite good at hiding problems and there is medication and shit. But she told me she had schizophrenia as if someone would say ""Oh yeah we have homework today."" She says she gave them names (the ""voices in her head""). When something semi stressful happens (as stressful as it can get for the average high schooler), she's like ""Oh my voices are gonna be screaming at me so badly now."" She says she has insomnia (which actually is slightly believable based on the hours she send me texts at) and she has had some shit happen in her past (bullying, etc.). And she's one of those stereotypical ""Don't mess with me I'll fuck you up"" and emo-ish extrovert. But the way she tells me things like it's nothing ""You know, I see some hallucinations sometimes."" When she told me this I actually slightly related (when I get really bad anxiety, I sometimes see things out of the corner of my eyes that don't exist) to her and said so. She kinda shot me down a bit like ""Oh yeah but MINE are etc., etc."" Sometimes she occasionally says something that's like r/imnotlikeothergirls but it's not what you think. (Ex: She was standing a certain way that I guess most girls didn't stand in and it was considered boy-ish and she was like ""I didn't even realize I'm standing like this, most girls don't stand like this."" And this slightly annoyed me and I responded with ""Nah, I see girls stand like that, you're not alone."" She seemed surprised...maybe annoyed...and was like ""Oh...cool."") She doesn't seem paranoid at all, but maybe it's easy to hide? I don't have schizophrenia I wouldn't know. Im sorry if this is stupid I just have trust issues when it comes to believing people saying they have mental issues because of past experiences. I know it sounds fucked up and some people that I know could actually have mental illnesses and I wouldn't believe them. But the amount of people who've lied to me...

I started to rely on them for emotional support but slowly started realizing the emotional toll it was taking on the people around me. I became further paranoid with people's intent. I've also noticed I've been losing sleep, ruminating on things that happened during the day trying to make sense of what has happened. What I've noticed, however, is that my mind will ""invent"" things that happened, things I noticed during the day, conversations I've had with people during the night. I will then have an ""aha"" moment as though I finally figured out that person's true intent. They're almost always negative and very powerful i.e. ""That person never loved me"" or ""They think I'm stupid"" or ""They're using me."" I have these fake experiences that seem ultra real that have been validating my deepest insecurities, so much so that I have to reason with myself that they didn't actually happen.

Does anybody have any experience with this? Are these early onset symptoms of something deeper? I'm a little scared, as these situations are cooperating with actual emotionally taxing experiences that I'm having. What's going on?",22Sep2019,1
548,"Hello everyone. I'm a Canadian high school senior, that is in need of a bit of advice. 

Just to give some backstory, in Canada, SAT &amp; ACT tests, do not really exist. The only thing that matters for post secondary education is your average, or GPA. My average, currently, is around 90ish, and my 11th year was around the same as well. Many of the classes taken in Grade 11, as well as Grade 12, have been more science and math focused. I know that university is much much harder that high school, so its not like your average really matters all too much once you are accepted into a program.

The dilemma i am currently facing, is that I don't find my self enjoying, or even see myself continuing to do sciences, or mathematics. However, the parental factor, wants me to continue down this path. Furthermore, the only real interests I have are programs and degrees that would need Grad School to continue in the field of. These interest are in, Anthropology, Archeology, and History. 

So I am simply asking for some advice, on what I should do, considering that we begin to apply for Universities later in October.",22Sep2019,1
549,"I don't know what the hell do I do now.

I'll try to make this as short as I can. 
I'm 25 years old and I want to fucking die right now. Little backstory: I'm pretty introvert, can't stand being told what to do (jobs, school..), my father died of cancer when I was 19 and 2 years later I got cancer also, which I overcame, started with gym, got into powerlifting and met my ex girlfriend. 

We broke up sometime ago, due to a few strange reasons. She has some wierd neurological condition called ""visual snow"", and it was hell. I woke up many times at like 3 AM, only to see her sitting on the bed, grabbing her head, because it was hurting so much, and it fucking broke me everytime. I couldn't do anything to help. So, she basically broke up with me, because she was feeling sorry for me to have to live with that. She felt like she didn't do enough for our realationship because of her condition and felt like I deserve better. 

I'm devastated right now. I've been wanting to get into forex/crypto trading, but I guess, my problem is that I want everything instantly and don't even know how to start. I've always gotten pretty good at everything I did/learned, but I haven't got into anything life changing that I would make money off. Motivation? I don't even remember how that feels anymore. 

I've always wanted to travel the world and write a book, and it's just sad that I turned into this depressive guy who probably won't do anything ever. 

I don't see any reason why I should even try. Nothing nice ever happened to me, and if it did, it went away pretty quick, leaving me even more broken. 

I really hope that someone who could help me reads this and hopefully writes something that will help me wake the fuck up.",22Sep2019,6
550,"I’ve been thinking a little bit regarding this subject.

I’ve heard that some companies wants you to take the MBTI test (Personality test) 

I want to say this on beforehand - I get the concept of it and I understand why they want you to take it. 

The problem comes now. 
This is just hypothetical, but how big is your chance to get hired if you’re not any of the Extraverted types?

We live in the western society, which favors extraverts. Besides that, it’s more attractive and demanding to be extraverted than introverted.

What do you guys think? Let’s say a person is a ISTJ, INTJ etc. Do you think some employers could look at the results and pick a ENFP over them?  Or do you think that they emplyoyer would think “ He/she is Introverted, we can’t use quiet and reserved people”?",22Sep2019,2
551,"Hi everyone, 

So keeping it simple, I have worked in a custom residential architecture firm for a year and have worked on all phases of a project in New Jersey. Currently, I am at a small firm in lower Manhattan that's slow ATM and when I started a part of my contract said I'll have a salary review after 3 Months. Because I asked for more than they offered. 

So anyways post-graduation I wanted to make the move to work New York City, try my hand at a medium of architecture that wasn't just residential. And this firm I'm at has been full of a lot of false promises. Such as getting an actual computer for me. Dual monitors. Still no coffee maker. And we're working in an unfinished office space. An office renovation is also something they say we'll ""eventually get to"" 

You might be thinking why would I take this job. Well I was so eger to get out of Jersey right away I took an interview with a firm in a we-work space and accepted. I was told I'd be joining a larger team and was expecting a more established firm but truthfully was a lie from my current employer.  The quality of work being very high end but seems that there cheap with employees. 

Also I'm always there on time. My hours as part of my deal are from 9 to 6 and my co workers get in around 10 sometimes later and don't stay late often. I have a drive to always keep busy, stay curious, and from the beginning I feel that I've asked ""what do you need me to do?"" Way to many times. 

So it's been the three months and I know we are slow at the moment. Do I ask about the review meeting and voice all my concerns? I have two ways I've been looking at my situation. I could go in have the meeting and if they say no to a raise then I'm to start looking for a new job. 

The other would be to stick it out because it's only been 3 Months and start taking it easy because no one seems to care. I'm not concerned about finding a new job with only 3 Month on my resume because I have the experience from Jersey and I can say that the truth is that they're dead slow with work. Any advice?",22Sep2019,1
552,"Me and this girl used to be close friends, and even lived together for all of last year. At the end of the day she was a loyal friend who I know would do a lot for me, but there were so many toxic traits about her that I couldn’t keep ignoring and I eventually finally moved out, thus ending the friendship (on very bad terms). I couldn’t stand seeing the way she treated other people and the way she became incredibly defensive when confronted with anything. Even something as simple as being texted and asked to do her dishes would send her into a defensive meltdown. She has a pattern of relationships and friendships that never last, and I know no one has ever probably told her exactly how toxic she is. When I first met her she told me all about her past friendships and how badly she was wronged and I’ve come to realize that they all ended because of her, and not the other way around. 

It’s been a few months and now she is texting and asking where it all went wrong and saying how she thought we were so close and how she would never do something like this to me. I honestly want to tell her that I got tired of hearing her complain about everyone, tired of how she always had something bad to say, tired of her being fake to everyone she met, tired of her never being able to admit when she was wrong. 

In her defense, I can understand why she is so toxic. She’s in college and completely financially independent, her mom has terminal cancer, and she is basically on her own for paying for everything. She is forced to work every day and always stressed out, and because of this, when confronted with anything her response is always along the lines of, “Unlike you I am a working adult with bigger things to worry about than people being overly sensitive.” I made the mistake once of telling her about an incident that hurt my feelings and I was met with one of the most aggressive and angry texts I had ever received from her. After that I literally never opened up to her again. 

Is it even worth it to explain these things to her? I’m so tempted and she has a reputation of being incredibly fake and rude but I feel like if I even try then I’ll just be met with the same defensiveness and it’ll go straight through her head. At the same time, though, she’s asking why this all happened and I want her to know. I’d say it gently as possible of course and maybe I’d be doing her a favor since no one has ever told her why they can’t stand to be her friend for very long.",22Sep2019,1

I'm in a 4-year private university in Mississippi, majoring in Biology, and minoring in chemistry, though I might double major. I'm getting good grades and such, and have consistently been on the president's list for having a 4.0 GPA. My plan is to go to med school and become a doctor. However, I'm really not prepared to put in the time and money, and get off on a late start in life. I saw this program at a nearby college, and was wondering if it would be worth it and get started with my life?

556,"We met in july in a camp and from the first day, we found out that we had really similar tastes. Really really similar. It felt different, I have similar interests with other people too but this felt, real? I don't know how to word these feelings, I really don't.

We don't even live in the same country. He is (non-arguable) more attractive than me. I always new that nothing, definitely nothing was going to happen. But a part of me who believes in incredible luck and coincidence stories, was still hoping and dreaming.

So the camp ended and we all went to our separate ways. A couple of days later, we started to talk which was very surprising because no one really keeps in touch for that long after these camps. We kept in touch for like a month and a half?

He stopped. I didn't continue, I didn't want to be the only one talking.

He sent me something we usually talk about. We talked about it with a few sentences and he told me something about his girlfriend. He didn't have a girlfriend 2 months ago. Or 1. But the thing is, it was a useless information that he gave under a very unrelated topic.

I'm not sure if he did it in a ""I have a girlfriend, go away"" way, I don't know.

I feel really stupid because even though I'm not the one who dreams about spending the future with someone I don't incredibly know (and someone from another country, we live incredibly far) but even though it's really embarrassing for me, I dreamed of having a future with him.

I don't know how to feel and how to get over this meaningless crush(?) and dreams of future?

557,"Around the winter of 2018, I was feeling very complacent in my life. I was a sophomore in college, 20 years old, and generally confused about where I was heading. I enjoyed school. I had friends and a wonderful boyfriend, and I was also a 20 minute drive from my family home. But something felt oddly flat, like I was missing something. Honestly, I was just bored. 

So I took a chance and applied to just one school that was about 700 miles from my home. It was a really good school, actually it's one of the best in the country. I thought, no way I'd get in here, but I was really considering transferring and trying something new. Lo-and-behold, I actually got in. It was a moment that was supposed to be exciting, but I was sort of terrified. They gave me almost a full ride. I had to go. 

 The same spring I decided to leave, my mom lost her job and we had to relocate 2 hours away from my hometown and college for her new gig, which was an overall positive thing. After that summer, I packed up my things, said the hardest goodbye to my boyfriend (we broke up), friends, and family, and left. 

I'd like to say that going to this amazing university was the best decision I've ever made. But I'd be lying. This past year, my junior year, was the hardest year of my life. I miscalculated the difficulty of transferring schools so far away from home, halfway through college. I really struggled to make friends, which was odd because I'm a pretty outgoing person. I found my best friend, but I just haven't been able to form strong connections with others at this school.

In all honesty, it's just this constant feeling of being out of place. The people around me are so different from back home. The program is very competitive. I feel like the bottom of the pack, and everyone has found their place in the sea of things and I'm just lost. I'm a senior now, and I so wish I had this big circle of friends and had things all figured out by now.

It's not only my relationships that are struggling. I also changed my major last year, so I wasn't able to get an internship in the career I want. I'm so behind everyone and I'm graduating in the spring but I don't think I'll get a job out of college because my experience isn't great. All these students go to like Hong Kong to run a small business over the summer and I just worked a ton to pay what I owe for school. 

And somewhere in this I've become so lonely. I try to meet guys but I haven't had much luck. I go to the bar and I don't get approached. As for classes, nowadays mine are small and my major is mostly female. The men here just don't have the interest in me that they do back home. It's disheartening because I consider myself a pretty attractive girl, with good morals and a lot going for me. 

I'm just feeling lost. I don't know why things aren't working out because I've been trying so hard. I feel like this great new adventure was a mistake. It also doesn't help I'm always comparing myself to others, my friends back home who have such fun in college, and other people around me who I feel less than. 

I'm so deflated. Any advice would help.",22Sep2019,1

Well for the past few months I’ve been starting to realize that I probably still am not mentally or emotionally ready to be in a relationship but I love this guy more than anything.

My youngest brother, D, came over to our apartment for the first time yesterday and he and the brother that lives with me talked on and on about how full the fridge was and how clean it was. I cried myself to sleep because my youngest brother lives in a literal shit hole. My parents house (I no longer speak to either of them) is absolutely filthy, infested with fleas, covered in piss and dog/cat shit and the smells is unbearable. My brother smelt like straight piss when he got into my car. I can see how sad he is, the look on his face when I said we were having pizza last night was almost too much.

563,"For background. I am a 21 year old male. I am very, very introverted. I moved out of state in 2017 and I have yet to make any friends in my new location. The only people I know here are my father and step mother. 

I work in a job friend where everyone is in older than me, I’m stuck in a room with the same few people, most of which I dislike, so I don’t have a lot of opportunities to meet similar people my age. I haven’t met anyone at college that interests me at all. 

After like the first year here, I started talking to this girl at work I really like (and was the same age for once). It was going well, I think at least. Texted every day throughout the day. We hung out once and it was fun. I kept trying to make plans to hang out again, but schedules never lined up. When we’d finally make plans, the day of she would cancel, due to various reasons. One time she had to go to the ER. Another time she slept in way past when we were supposed to go out. I had let her know that I liked her, and felt it was easier to just straight up tell her. She has mentioned before that tries to bury any feelings she has for anyone so she’s been single for a while. Every man she’s in her life has mentally/physically harmed her.

Now, she has similar depression/anxiety issues to me. Probably much worse than me. She has a lot on her plate, and she was getting overwhelmed. Got a new job (same building, different floor from me now), lots of changes in her life. She stops texting me as much, we have plans to hangout one weekend at 4:00 PM. Keep in mind we both work early morning shifts so we would both be awake at 4:00 PM. The entire day passes, not a word. I message her asking if she’s okay, nothing the next day. The day after that, she sends me a long message saying she’s having a tough time and that she copes with things by being alone and pushing people away and that’s fine I do that too. She hasn’t talked to anyone in days she says, her mom has to break into her apartment just to make sure she was still alive.  She says I’ve been a great person to her, that I’m far more kind and patient than she could ever ask for and apologized for putting me through this. I say it’s okay, take some time away from everyone, social media, all that stuff. I say it’s okay, I’ll be here if you need me. This was like, three months ago. After like two weeks, I shoot her a text asking how she’s been, no reply. I check her Facebook, she’s been liking and sharing things all day every day. However, it looks like she hid the posts from me because they’re not on my news feed, I only see her posts if I click into her profile. I reach out again, she answers saying she’s been doing therapy and stuff like that, I say I’m glad to hear from her and ask her how she’s doing, this is the last I’ve heard from her. This was the end of July. I reach out a few weeks after that, no answer. I have no clue if she’s even reading my messages because her read receipts are off. 

She’s still posting on social media. I know she said she acts like she’s fine online, but really she’s hurting inside, so idk if she’s fine or putting up a front online. What do I do? It seemed like everything was going well, she said lots of nice things and seemed very genuine. Should I just not bother anymore?",22Sep2019,1
565,"So ive been with my boyfriend for two years. I will be the first to admit its been a rocky relationship with a lot of fights but never breaking up or anything. Recently I discovered I have Borderline Personality Disorder and ive been able to react more normally to things now that I know whats going on in my brain, but im still not 100% normal, nor do i think I ever will be. I suffer badly from depression, anxiety, and BPD. I began self harming very young at 11 years old (ive been clean for two years now), I wont get into details but a lot of my life has been very very dark with little to no friends. 

With that being said, the situation im in is kind of complicated. For starters my boyfriends friend group consists of 5 guys, and 2 of them have girlfriends. One girlfriend has been around for a year and the other is very new, less than a month. My boyfriend and I have noticed that they are treated much differently than I am. For example, his friends talk to them more, joke with them more, just ingeneral seem to enjoy their company more than me. I have never felt wanted in this group of friends. I will admit, I am shy and do not talk as much, there have been times I have had panic attacks at parties and had to go to the bathroom to calm myself down, and I tend to have self depricating sense of humor (but so do the guys). Im especially hurt because in less than a month one of the girlfriends is already closer to them than Ive ever been able to get and its making me wonder what is wrong with me? 

Flash forward to last night, im at my boyfriends place and I had planned to leave that afternoon but all his friends were coming over to party, including the girlfriends. I asked if I could stay for that and my boyfriend seemed uneasy. Im super hurt and confused by this, I thought he wanted me to be close with his friends but hes not giving the chance. I ask him whats up and he says hes not able to enjoy being around his friends with me as much because of my anxiety. That hes always worried about how we are getting along and if im feeling panicky. I tell him that im trying to get better but the only way I can prove to him that im getting better is if he lets me try. He confesses to me that it may be too late for his friends to like me, that he asked one friend how he felt and his friend said I give off a negative vibe, that they cant tell if my self depricating jokes are serious or not, that my boyfriend and I fight too much. I admit I can be a negative person but I try really hard to be positive when im around his friends. I bake them cupcakes and brownies and whatever, I bought his one friend balloons and a banner for his bday party and we had a little party at his apartment with some drinks (I dont drink but everyone else had a lot of fun). I try to show interest in what theyre talking about. But there are some times where I will have a panic attack, and go to the bathroom. I try to hide it as best I can but I guess it brings the whole vibe down. My boyfriend seems mad at me but he knows I cannot help it and he is also mad at his friends for being too judgemental. I ended up going home early after my boyfriend cried and had his own panic attack and comforting him.

So now, I am in this situation. His friends do not like me the same as the other girlfriends, my boyfriend gets anxious to bring me around his friends because I have an anxiety disorder. I just feel so defeated. I tried so hard to be on good terms with them and I really enjoy their company and them as people. My boyfriend says he may have made this worse by joking that he is in a bad relationship on days we were fighting. That stung, a lot. I want to make it clear that im never mean to anyone. I am just quiet and insecure and panic sometimes. Im beating myself up because I will never be normal, never like the other girlfriends, people can never seem to just like me for me. 

They do not know I have BPD, Im considering telling them but my boyfriend says it will seem desperate like im trying to get them to be my friend. I just wish they could be a little more compassioniate towards me and see that im trying my best. Another side of me is sick of trying and just wants to never hang out with them again but thats the splitting part of BPD. Please can anyone give me advice on what to do here? Its stressing my boyfriend to death and me as well. He asks me how is he supposed to tell his girlfriend she cant come hang out with everyone else crying to me about it. I offered to just break up so he can be with a normal girl and be happy but he says he loves me and wants to be with me. What do I do? Should I try to tell his friends why I panic and that im sorry? Should I do something else? TIA.

TL;DR: My boyfriends friends dont like me because I have mental health issues and sometimes have panic attacks when we all get together and it brings the vibe down. I need advice on what to do now because it feels like everything is ruined and I hate myself.",22Sep2019,2

569,"I started off lending her money as we would go out to eat or if she needed more gas just as long as she said she would pay me back. She did pay me back from time to time but not enough to keep up. Then there was a time when her dog got ran over and she couldn’t pay the bills at the vet. So me feeling bad for her I did, $550. And I was only 16 at the time. I mean what was I supposed to do just let her dog die? But then she said she would pay me back of course. Well now I’m 18 and she owes me $800. I had a talk with her and now I don’t loan her anything anymore. I feel like it’s been a year since she’s payed me anything but every time I ask if she can pay me back yet she says she has a lot of stuff to pay off. And her being 3 years older than me and me being 18 living with my parents, idk a whole lot about loans or insurance or anything like that. But then there was one time we were hanging out and I don’t know if she realized it but she slipped out that she dropped $160 on hair products. My boyfriend just tells me now every time she wants to hang out to ignore her unless she offers to pay back which I’ve been doing. She asked me today why I’ve been ignoring her and if she’s done something wrong and I’m not sure how to respond. Like I’ve been feeling really guilty not hanging out with her but I just want my money back. I have yet to talk to her about dropping $160 on hair products but it seems like if I ever need something explain she’s very aggressively defensive about it and I hate the feeling of being the bad guy.

571,"There is a group of 6-8 16-19 year olds that hang out beside our house, more at the back/back garden. There is a separating wall that means they cant physically get in without climbing the wall, however there is a hill that allows them to see straight into the garden, doesn't give us any privacy. The house is in an estate and all the kids live within the estate somewhere. 

Well over the weekend the police had to be called 3 times on 3 separate nights to move them along. They are usually drinking or doing drugs etc. But the main issue is that they are extremely loud. I could be in my bedroom, door closed. Windows closed and still hear the crystal clear conversation about how much they get in benefits etc. And then the usual massive mess that is left behind after loitering.

So one of the days during the weekend, a younger girl, part of the group, said to my Mother ""I will spit in your face"", now I love my Mammy and the fact that she is currently going through a lot emotionally and was heading to work where she cares for others, you could say I was a little annoyed. 

This issue has been going on for months if not years. I have never had any contact with them, they usually leave as soon as I ask them, however I cant be home all the time. I dont want to have to get physical at any point, but when she threatens my Mam, it gets to you.

We never fight, he’s very loving, and he is extremely open and vulnerable with me which I really admire. However, last night we were having sex and he couldn’t finish for some reason (I think because of stress?). He got so angry at one point he punched the wall REALLY hard 5 times and left a dent. I also noticed another hole in his wall before and never got an answer as to how it got there. He said he’s just really stressed about his job and he apologized for his aggression. I’m torn, I want to be there for him when he’s stressed (and not make this about me) but last night scared the fuck out of me. It reminded me of an abusive person in my life and caused me to panic.

573,"Hi everyone, first time posting here and on mobile so please excuse formatting.

As the title of this post says, I’m having a bit of a hard time trusting my sister in law. We are friends since 2013 and we’ve had our fair share of ups and downs. Mostly because she shares a lot of things I talk to her about with other people, my brother and other family members.

Most recently, I started a new job where she has been working for a couple of years and I found out from a coworker that she had been badmouthing me before I even started working there. She’d been telling people that I wasn’t a nice person and not easy to be around, therefore making me unknowingly defend myself against a rumour she started. It really hurt my feelings when I found out about this.

She’s often mean spirited, braggy and competitive, trying to one up me in various things. I try not to engage in all of this and I haven’t talked to her about my feelings because she’ll get mad or laugh it off, as she doesn’t take confrontation or serious topics very well.

I’m trying my best to just roll with the punches bc she has two kids with my brother and a third one on the way. I’m crazy about them and they’re family, so I can’t just distance myself from her bad energy. But I’m getting really tired of thinking I can tell her something and it being thrown back in my face by someone she told.

Sorry for the long post, I really hope y’all get through it lol. I’m just too optimistic and trusting and I just don’t know what to do.",22Sep2019,1
574,"So, as the title says basically i'm in my late 20's and struggling to make any real progressive moves forward towards 'adulthood' the past couple years... I can't work out whether it's normal or not? Or if i've got something going on mentally that I need to get sorted? I feel like my life has been stuck in a repetitive loop for the majority of my 20's.

I still live at home with my parents and work a full-time job. I have been saving a bunch over the past few years out of habit and to use for some end goal to help me get by in the future, which is fine and I don't spend much money as I don't get much enjoyment out of 'stuff'. I don't own a car but I can drive (although not driven for a while). I have lived away from home for university too. I'm also in a long-term relationship.

I do struggle with making decisions and going through with them, and being such an indecisive person is impacting me negatively from 'moving forward' with my life it seems... it's like there's some kind of mental block stopping me from taking any bigger steps in life (moving out, driving, getting a better job). My lifestyle feels very safe but mundane, i'm not a big risk-taker but I do idealise/dream a lot in my head about doing 'big' things (travelling &amp; moving away being big ones). Most of my days consist of going to work, coming home, cooking then just playing a few games alone/watching Netflix then falling to sleep. Recently i've been feeling pretty blank/glum and having a weird physical sensation of being drained, and a 'spaced out' feeling in my head? I feel like i'm not experiencing life to its fullest and just letting time pass me by.

Being more introverted and shy with strangers, I also feel i've not experienced much growing up from my teens to now (never partied much, hardly dated, don't know many people) and as i'm getting older it's bothering me. Also, the only regular hobbies I really have are listening to music, going to gigs on occasion, playing a few games/board games casually &amp; watching Netflix. I'm not a very passionate person, and struggle to stick with things once I pick them up. I have a close group of friends I see most weekends but we don't get out much. I have toyed with the idea of getting out there alone to local hobby groups but feel vulnerable about doing this. In terms of a career, i've never really known what I wanted to do and a specific career/field doesn't resonate with me (ended up in tech as I don't mind it). So I feel very aimless in general...

I was wondering if anyone has any advice about this, or has/is experiencing something similar? I'm sick of feeling paralysed &amp; that i'll be living the same life on repeat into my 30's. Am I depressed? Has anyone gotten past this and is now much happier because of it; how did you work out what you wanted from your life?",22Sep2019,1

Hi Guys,

What I intend to do is work online with Canadian people as freelancer and/or volunteer.

I know that this kind of experience will not help me with the procedures. What I am looking for is something to put on my Resume to show employers that I know how to work with Canadians.

My goal is to limit the time I'll be looking for a job and get higher paying jobs faster.

Do you think this is a sound approach? Do you have any advice to improve my employment prospects?

578,"So I'm a high school freshman, but this goes back to middle school. I have above average intelligence, always have, and around 7th grade or so I was moved to advanced classes because I always did exceptionally well in earlier years, even in areas with other kids struggled. I passed 7th grade math no problem (and in 7th grade we covered 8th grade level math, I was a year ahead).

However, once I was in 8th grade I was taking Algebra. At the start of the year we covered 1A concepts, then 1B From I'd say January to April, and at the tail end of my 8th grade year we touched on a few Algebra 2 concepts. Because high school is kind of shoved down your throat as an 8th grader, we had some people from different high schools coming to talk to us. The guest speakers at the high school I ended up going to said that if you were in an algebra lass in 8th grade that you could take Algebra 2 and geometry early on in high school. He also said ""that it was for people who eat, breathe, and sleep math""

At this point I was actually struggling with Algebra in middle school. I ended up passing the class with a B+ so it's not like I failed or anything, but I passed 2 tests by cheating and I didn't know how to actually do the problems. I went to the high school the guest speaker came from, and now I'm taking Algebra 1 again as a freshman.

Did I make the right choice? I relied off of cheating at the end of the year in 8th grade and didn't understand some stuff, and the ""breathe eat and sleep math"" comment kind of overwhelmed me. And I would've taken calculus as a Junior or Senior at that rate, and I'd just prefer not to have a harder math class just because I'm smart. But on the other hand everything is so easy in math class now. I'm really bored hearing about stuff I already know and time goes by sooooo sloooooooooowwwly. I've never done homework in that class since I can do all of it and more with the class time I have. My parents are also confused as to why I'm taking Algebra 1 again and why I'm not in advanced classes anymore. Did I make the right choice stepping down in math just so I could learn the subject again and I didn't like being an advanced student, essentially throwing away my potential?",22Sep2019,1

I’m looking at starting a self study degree next year in Law or Business management, but again I don’t really have a passion for either. I’m terrified of getting a mortgage to buy my first property as I’ll be saddled with debt, restricting me from making changes if it turns out I’m unhappy in my new job.

581,"    Hi r/Advice. Firstly, I'll give a quick apology in advance because I rarely post on reddit in the first place. Secondly, a bit of backstory to give you an idea of what i'm working with in this dilemma.

    I'm a 17 year old trans man in my senior year of high school, and I'm in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend of 2 years (this will make sense later). 

    Considering I have always been an extremely family-oriented person, I would like to go to college for nursing, ultimately to specialize in Labor and Delivery. On top of this, I would like to medically/legally transition from female to male in the form of top surgery (reconstruction of the chest to have a male appearance), legally changing my name, and hormones. However, I would like to put off this process of transitioning in order to have a child naturally. This is the main part that is hard to frame because my boyfriend (also 17, but in his junior year of high school) likely will not be moving to the area i live until he's out of high school.

 My grandmother (my primary guardian)  has pointed out that I would probably look like a freak of nature, working in a hospital as a pregnant person presenting myself as male with a male name. I guess my main issue is that I dont know how to time all of this in order to lead my life as normally as possible.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks ♥️",22Sep2019,1

586,"I know a person who often gets random, expensive gifts that he doesn't want from people (it's a long story that I'm being purposefully unclear about and I know it sound sketchy, but it comes down to this sort of a cultural thing, where refusing the gift would be rude) so he accepts them and then gives them away. A couple years ago, he apparently received a pair of really nice watches, which he gave to me and my brother. I recently decided that I should get mine appraised and insured, just in case. Two different jewelers took one look at it and told me it was a fake.

I know that accusing someone of giving you a fake would be rude. I know that sounding like I'm mad that he gave me a fake would be ungrateful (I'm not mad, by the way). If I were telling him that he spent a lot of money on a fake, I think it would be okay, so that he'd know and be able to try to get the money back. But this was a gift that he got from someone else, so I'm sort of torn. He didn't spend money on it, so why bother him with it, right? But on the other hand, should he know that the person who gave him this gift, which he believed to be real, actually gave him a knock-off?

Then I stopped trying to keep my friendship with her, and then we just slowly drifted apart.

That this situation has really impacted on me a lot, I was close to getting home schooled.

   The second is a guy whos from my math class. He's really funny and often teases me (not mean teasing) by calling me by my nickname, that I only let family and close friends use. I don't mind if it doesn't work out with him, because it's kinda minor.

   The third I like the most, but I'm worried that if it doesn't work out with him he won't talk to me or hang out as much. He's funny and nice, we have all the same interests like hating Trump and climate change, we watch the same YT and play the same games. A problem with dancing is he is wheelchair bound (which I now realise I bassicly ignore his wheelchair) and probably won't habe fun at a dance.

Me and this girl have met like 4-5 times together with other people. (She joined our choir a while back) I didn't really think that much about her, until last night. We where on a party, both where sober. We where standing together with some other people, and had a really nice  ""group talk"" for a really long time. I felt that we had a really good connection. I felt safe. I felt like the better me. I felt like she really cared for what I had to say, and so did I. I just felt happy. She also gave me her WhatsApp.

So after a while people started to leave. Soon it was only me her, and a few more there. We all collectively decided that it was time to go, and we both left the building. When we got out I realized that I had forgot my phone. So I went back to get it. She had waited for me. We realized that we where going the same way, so we walked together. We kept talking with the same good connection, feeling of safety, and happiness, until our paths split. We gave etch other a good hug (Maybe 3-4sec) and said goodbye.

Based on the previous, what would you say about our situation?  
Personally, I'm like ""Interested"" but not ""In love"". Since we just got to know etch other a bit more, an it's not the ""we've been best friends for manny years, but I think I love her"" situation.  
I feel like this is the point where your able to kind of steer the relationship.

I am 21, in college, finishing my bachelor's. Throughout my life, my dad has always been distant from me. He never lived with us (me and my mom), and would only come to visit about once a week. This left me with my mom 24/7 pretty much. Now, as a kid this was fine. I was spoiled  because I was an only child, and my mom managed every little thing in my life.

However, fast forward to now. As stated earlier, I am 21, and about to finish college. I have never held a job, and I am completely dependent on my mom. I have to call her every night, or she will go berserk on me. If I drink too much, she will go berserk on me. Basically, if I do or say anything she doesn't like, she will go berserk on me. She wants to basically manage everything in my life as if I was still in grammar school.

Now, I understand that it's incredibly difficult to let go of a child, but at this point, I feel suffocated by my lack of freedom. Any time I have mentioned to her that maybe she has too strong of a hold on my life, she has exploded. After college I want to move with my friends and room together in a house for a year while I take a gap year, but I have no idea how to break the news because I know how badly she's going to react.

It’s grass that grows up between the concrete, so it isn’t even a matter of him killing the grass because it’s not supposed to be there anyway. But basically nowhere close to where they would be stepping...and I never let him poop there, only pee. Anyway, this jackass says “could you not let your dog do business next to our property?” And I said “ok well where would you have him do it? Next to someone else’s property? Because that’s my only choice really.” And he didn’t have much to say after that. 

I just don’t understand what the big deal is. That isn’t even on your driveway, why are you making such a problem out of it? It just seems so ridiculously petty to me. Am I the only one?",22Sep2019,0

i had several panic attacks this night and i barely slept. i haven't gotten out of bed to eat or go to the bathroom and it's already 4pm. i'm not motivated to do anything today. it feels like nothing has a purpose anymore. i can't do anything and nothing seems to make me happy. it was the first time it felt physically impossible for me to leave my bed. everytime i tried i would just start bawling. i don't know what's happening to me. i want to feel like i have a purpose again but it feels like i'm all by myself.",22Sep2019,1
606,"25f here. So lately i've been really struggling to deal with my mom's negativity. We've always had a close relationship, but recently every time we get together we get upset with each other. I've realized that she has become somebody that mostly complains, makes a lot of cynical interjections, and rolls her eyes. She's also overdramatic and takes everything the wrong way. Today in conversation she asked what was happening next weekend and I simply responded ""I'm not aware of anything going on, maybe you saw something I didn't"". I didn't have an attitude when I said it, we were just talking normally, but her response to that was ""ugh, Jesus, sorry....SORRY"". A few other instances happened while we were spending time together and I decided to address it calmly and as gently as I could. I said to her something along the lines of ""Mom, I like spending time with you but lately it seems like our relationship is changing because you've been really negative lately and it's difficult to deal with"". Her response was ""Ok, I guess i'm the bad guy. I guess I should just kill myself"". This kind of thing is SO frustrating because she can't just talk about it rationally- she either gets overdramatic or overly defensive. I try to accept accountability if i've done something, but she never does. I don't want to cut her off or stop spending time with her, especially because her health has been deteriorating lately, but I don't know how to address this with her in a way she will be receptive to.

I should note that most everything she complains about has nothing to do with me. It's usually about other family, her own personal issues, etc. Also i've already suggested counseling and she absolutely refuses.",22Sep2019,1

611,"Cross post from r/relationships but thought this would be a good platform too. Obligatory typing from mobile, apologies for any typos or formatting errors. If possible I would love some immediate advice.

Some background, I (28F) have one older sister, Lucretia (32, F) and three cousins, Arnold (Late 30’s, M) Harry (Late 30’s, M), and Darlene (Late 30’s, F). Harry and Darlene are siblings.

Growing up our families were not very close and we rarely saw each other. There was some falling out between an aunt and the rest of the family also so by the end we only saw each other at our grandfather’s funeral. There is no bad blood between the cousins except between Arnold and Harry but they did grow up hanging up together.

Recently since the death of the above aunt the cousins have all made a more concerted effort to see each other and not repeat the mistakes of our parents. I love all my cousins and would like for this new effort to see each other to keep continuing.

Arnold and Harry have recently had some arguments regarding life things. Harry is older than Arnold and was giving Arnold life advice (should move out of parents home, find a career path you actually love, have more meaningful relationships with friends and significant others). The last argument they had was about how Arnold needed to cultivate better relationships. Without going too much into it, Arnold expressed to Harry that he hated women because they would not give him a chance and that what he was looking for in a woman was just boobs and butts. I know nothing about Arnold’s relationship history personally. Arnold did not want the life advice and this became a point of contention.

This brings us to today where we were planning to have dinner in a few hours for Arnold’s birthday. Harry reminded all of us multiple time’s to not be late. This is specially because historically Arnold is always late by 30-40 minutes at every gathering. He says he operates on “island time” which he explains means that you can just show up at any time and people should be chill about it. He says that as this is not a job obligation it is fine. We have told him before that it is not respectful and wasting other people’s time if they have to wait for him to show up.

After Harry reminded us in our group chat multiple time’s Arnold took offence and wrote a long text saying that Harry is just upset about how his life is not as good as his own. It was an entire paragraph telling Harry to go back to school and how Arnold went to such a good school and now is very happy with his life. I would like to point out that Harry has a good life, a good job, his own place, and lots of friends who love him while Arnold still lives with his parents and has been in school for ten years working on finishing university while doing security jobs for a decade. He just started a new job doing housing appraisal recently. I am not saying that one is better than the other but Harry is more independent and has a larger social circle.

We were supposed to have dinner in two hours but now Harry has dropped out because of this message but me, my sister, and Darlene will still be attending.

My question today is if I should mention anything. Should I stay silent? Should I reprimand Arnold? I feel this was a blow out of left field and took us all by surprise. How do I tactfully bring up the subject and not offend anyone? Arnold is very resistant to change or advice but I think this behaviour is not ok.

TLDR; two cousins are fighting and we are supposed to have dinner together soon. Would like some advice on how to broach the subject about the argument. Should I even say anything?",22Sep2019,1
612,"My father Mike took care of my disabled brother until 2.5 years ago. I did not know him well; I knew his parenting policies (loving, trusting), little of his political ideals (legalize weed, less taxes), and that he thinks that non-organized religion is great, but not entirely important. I knew that he grew up in a major west coast city (liberal state) where his dad was a cop, and that his first encounter with someone being racist to his black friend at age 10 made him angry and helpless. I moved out at 18, we talked often, but I didn't necessarily come to *know* him any better. 

Present day:

A year and some months after my brother died, I moved closer to my father. As I started spending time with him, I realized belatedly that he was struggling with the void of not having my brother to worry about anymore. My sister (33), was horrified when I told her that all he does is sit around and recount my brother dying, talk about the meaning of life, or talk about memories of him. We'd go for dinner or do some random activities, but it didn't really seem to be helping. I talked to my husband and sister and we agreed that our best approach was having me spend time) helping him around his property, and try to engage him in life again.

Imagine my horror as he has come back into the world over the last half a year and he is as racist as that man in the story he told me about when he was 10. 

* 6 months ago: 

""Em, you're a hardworking little Mexican."" ""Dad, I'm not Mexican, Mexicans aren't only good for manual labor, and not all Mexicans are hard workers. You're intelligent, you know that's obtuse, huh?"" ""Hmmph."" 

* Yesterday:

""You're a hard worker, just like a negro."" (Internally I blanch and had much of the same conversation as before. I am making a concerted effort to show no emotion because I know this will make him defensive - when I just talk with logic, without shaming him, he seems to listen better.) I'm not making a difference, though.

&amp;#x200B;

* Native Americans didn't make good slaves because they died, black people are stronger stock. 
* Slavery wasn't that bad, salves weren't treated badly.
* Hitler might not have been responsible for the concentration camps.
* Gas chambers were probably only used to cremate people who died from the labor. (My husband is Jewish so I think I got him in an awkward corner where his beliefs had to line up with reality and he couldn't do that because he loves my husband, so this whole Hitler thing I think I have handled.)
* Other ethnicities than whites are trying to...I forget exactly what he said, but something along the lines of ""bring white men down and burn them at the stake?"". (figuratively about the burning)
* Black people have lower IQs. 
* The media is trying to take down the president.
* The FBI tried to stage a coup on the president.
* ""They"" have indoctrinated the schools and turned kids into socialists. 
* ""Dad, that's racist - that makes you look dumb when you're not."" ""That's just what people say to get society to shut someone up when they don't like the other stuff they're saying."" ""Dad, I don't like you talking like that. You can't say that to people."" ""I don't say it to people. I say it to you.""
* When he says something racist about ""black people in general"" I ask him about his friend, Paul, whoever, or whoever, who is black, and he says there are black people, and there are n\*\*\*\*\*s. The unfortunate thing is that they both have the same skin color and you hear more about the n\*\*\*\*\*s doing stupid stuff than the black people. And there are w\*\*\*\*\*s, too, but not as many. 
* His girlfriend, a Peruvian woman who had to go through the legal process of coming here and becoming a citizen really seems to egg this on. Hates illegal immigrants, loves the president...I believe the rest of his brothers and sisters are the same way.
* Generally it all seems to tie back to religion, which is weird, but I think he has put a lot of faith in god since my bro.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to my husband's buddies about it and they pointed me to a conspiracy theory (white genocide conspiracy?) that touts all of this nonsense, and backs it up with ""proof"". Unverified sources. My father is not college educated, and does not understand research methods, or how to be an intelligent consumer of research. So to him, it's all the same. 

Husband thinks he's impressionable. He reads something, and if I get to him when it's fresh and talk to him about it, he lets it go. He does keep it to himself and me for the most part. He doesn't talk to my sister about it. But I am looking at fostering children in a few years, and I am not interested in exposing them to this stupidity. If we decide to have kids later, I wouldn't trust them to be around my father alone because I don't want him to brainwash them. But ultimatums are not the solution, here. ""You don't get to see me or your grandchildren if you keep this up."" What kind of help is that?

Ultimately. I'm incredibly uncomfortable. Why does he talk to me about this? I sit here on the weekend with acid in my throat thinking about who he is turning into and I'm just not sure what do to. Whats the next step down the rabbit hole?How do I talk to him? Is this because my bro died and this is what he's chosen to latch on to? How can I raise his level of empathy so that he can understand that people of all ethnicities and backgrounds are as important as his own self? 

Do I never let my kids hang out with him unsupervised?

Will this go away when our president loses the election, or has to step down after the second term?

Is this normal? Is it because he isn't intelligent? Why is it so important that Hitler might not have been wrong? Why is it important for him to ensure the survival of the white brand, so to speak, instead of just letting the world evolve as it is going to evolve? 

Am I maybe too empathetic to really get this? Too young? I see people as people. I'm applying to grad school for neuropsychology...I don't know how to make emotion and empathy as important to him. Valid evidence is priority #1 for me. I just see things as they are, but I don't know how to argue my case. 

Do I just ignore it and hope he gets some unspoken message? Does that work?",22Sep2019,1

A little background: I made friends a few years ago with one of my husband's many cousins because we moved to the area where she lives. She was nice and helped me get to appointments when I had my baby. We chatted online a lot. Her husband gets free baby supplies from his work so periodically he would drop them off for us. 

Onto the issue:

She offered some children's books from her childhood. I said we'd look through them and see what we wanted. There was a small box of books we didn't want. I asked her what she wanted me to do with the books. I said I could donate them or mail them to her since I can't drive to her house right now. She said she wanted them back and that her husband would pick them up next time he dropped off supplies. It's been months and I still have these books. Our apartment is small so I can't store them forever. 

I messaged her last week asking about the books and supplies. 

Here's our conversation:

Me: Is it still available to get some diapers for baby? Either way I'd like to get those books to you. Maybe I can mail them if it's easiest for you. :)

Her: I just got home and will talk to him tomorrow. 
As for the books, I've already suggested to you that I don't want you to mail the books to me. It would costly and unnecessary if husband brings you stuff anyways. 

(Her messages are usually friendly and littered with emoticons so this abrupt message was surprising)

Me: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you by offering again to mail them. The storage area in our new apartment isn't as nice as our last one and I didn't want to worry about anything happening to them. And I wasn't sure if the diapers were still available so I figured mailing would be easiest for you guys. I wouldn't want you to go out your way anymore than you already have. :)

She left me on read and I don't know what to do.  I've noticed her getting distant lately but just assumed she was busy or going through stuff. For example, I'd ask if she wanted to meet for lunch or get together and and she'd say ""maybe some other time.' But she posts on Facebook constantly and is always going out with friends. I assume she doesn't like me anymore for some reason and that's fine, just what do I do with these books!??

TL;DR cousin in law gave me some books, I don't want them and she doesn't want me to donate them but she's not making it easy to get them back to her.",22Sep2019,1

A is generally quite rude and has said some really disgusting things to me like randomly asking me what my favourite sex position is and badgering me when I don’t respond with crude messages when I’m uncomfortable with it. A has no filter and my parents are quite strict so I’d be scared of what A would say in front of them.

They broke up maybe a few weeks before school had started and a few days after that the guy had told me he liked me and I thought it was selfish of him to like another girl while or after he had just broken up with his girlfriend. I’ve always seen him as annoying anyways but I rejected him because 1) his ex is my friend. 2) he’s somewhat annoying to talk to. School had started and I have one class with him but for a week I’ve noticed how he was trying to avoid me by sitting somewhere far away from me or in the halls he’d walk the other direction. I guess it made sense because I told him we probably shouldn’t talk for a while but that doesn’t mean he should entirely try to avoid me. Last weekend I called him and tried to clear things up and this is when I found out his ex told him things that I’ve said about him but it was only because I was trying to get her off my back (he told her that he told me he liked me). She was asking a lot of questions and I knew I didn’t like him but I needed to REALLY let her know. So basically he was avoiding me because of what she had told him. Now this entire week we still haven’t spoken at all, made eye contact here and there but...eh. We were actually somewhat good friends and I’d hate to see it be ruined because of this. My issue is that I know I find him annoying and I’m sure I do not like him but I’m starting to think about him.

It's taken me much, much longer to get these 30 day hours and 3/15 night hours I need. My mother can't, more like won't drive with me because she gets ""worried"".

I've drove everything from a jeep (stick) to jacked up diesel trucks.  However, my mom still won't drive with me. To give you an idea of what it's like when she does: 

Me: \*driving down the road like I would with anyone else\*

Mom: \*clutching the side of the car\* Screaming at me to slow down or stay in my lane (even though I'm going 20mph under the limit to appease her.

Mom: \*voice progressively getting louder and more panicky\* No your not stop back talking and do as I say!

Me: \*Now extremely annoyed because I'm in the middle of my lane going too slow kinda screaming back\* Stop! Your distracting me and Ive done everything you've said to do! Please just stop and let me drive!

Mom: Pull over now! I'm not going to be treated like this!

I genuinely hate the job. I have a bachelors in psychology and I’ve worked with kids for most of my “career” I say that cause this is technically my first real job (I’ve got a couple internships on my resume though) but I think it’s mainly because I provide therapy/services at the client’s home and while I thought it would be fine it’s really not! The family is super nice and it’s a good neighborhood so it’s not like I’m being put in uncomfortable situations or anything it’s just more of the fact that it just has my anxiety through the roof and I literally dreaded going by the second day.

632,"My mom is a widow. It’s been a few years since my dad died and she’s very lonely. She’s in her later 40s, and she feels ready to explore dating again. 

She has a crush on a guy at her church who has been a widower for many years. Because they only see each other at church she’s not sure if or how she should go about approaching him. 

She says they chit chat pretty much every Sunday because they both help out in the same area of the church. She has no idea if he has any feelings for her and she’s afraid of making any moves for fear that he may not feel the same way. This past Sunday she was talking to him about a certain type of coffee she likes at Starbucks and he said he might try it some time. Her and her friend then left for a Starbucks run and she bought him that type of coffee and brought it back to him as a gift. He hadn’t asked for it or anything. In my mom’s mind this was her “making a move” and she’s hoping that maybe he’ll reciprocate somehow at some point. 

I’m so afraid of her getting her feelings hurt. I really hope that he feels the same way. I’d love if he asked her out, but it would kill me if my mom went ahead and worked up the courage to ask him out and he says no. 

What advice can I give her? I have no idea what to tell her and she’s of course very out of practice with this. She’s afraid of being inappropriate at church but that’s the only time they see each other.",22Sep2019,1

634,"Hi, I am very anxious around people in general but my main concern is this guy in my class. I was so nervous around him because I found him attractive and was worried about how I looked constantly and if I was standing or sitting weirdly. I've never spoken to him. I have social anxiety, agoraphobia, low self esteem, low confidence and I am very quiet and introverted. I've been going to therapy.
 
I did so bad in my studies last year, it was awful, my grades were so so bad and I'd just think of him even though I tried so much not to like even in lectures, he usually sits at the back but still I'd be worried that he can see me. So I'm constantly feeling self conscious, nervous and anxious around him.

I am a senior in high school right now and school started a few weeks ago. I realized that I really have to think about my future and I don’t want to work a shitty job and make bad money.

But throughout high school, a lot of personal, negative things happened in my life and I really wasn’t motivated to work hard at all. My mother loves me but unfortunately she isn’t really involved with my school life at all (she doesn’t even ask me if I’ve done my homework) and I think that really contributes to my lack of motivation.

At the moment I have a GPA of around 2.5 and I know good colleges won’t want me. Even if I got all A+s this year, it probably wouldn’t change my GPA too much.

Gosh, I am such a deep depression. I've had this post drafted in my notes for about two months, but if I am being honest I am very pessimistic about everything right now... my constant thought whenever I went to post this was, ""what can they tell me that I haven't heard before?"" 

Well... anyway. Here I am. 

Long story short, I got hired at a corporation at a very young age (15) as an intern. I worked my way up to being full time, and now at 24, I am basically in the same position, making the same amount of money, and working 7 days a week. I absolutely love my job. I love being there, I love the people, but I feel like I am being used. I started at $10/hour and haven't gotten a raise in six years. I also work seven days a week, 35-39 hours per week and I am still on part-time status. No PTO, Sick Time, etc. 

All of my supervisors say that I am a ""utility player"". I took my job to hear when I was young, so I researched how to use certain equipment that I would necessarily be taught on -- all because I really love my job. Today, I know more than some of my supervisors (my boss literally told me that). 

I have had a total of seven meetings with my supervisor about becoming a full-time employee and it's always the same response: ""It's not in the budget"", ""It's a tough quarter"", etc. 

I have been looking non-stop for another position in my degree field -- but I still have a semester to go in school (I regret only taking 4 classes to make time for this job). 

I don't know what to do. I am still being treated like a kid. I have been there since I was 15, so it's not as simple as walking in and saying ""I quit"". This is like my second home. 

I have a meeting with my supervisor on Monday, so if anyone could give me any advice... I would very much appreciate it.",22Sep2019,1

She can do everything amazingly and has so many hobbies she excels in. For a long time, I was absolutely jealous of her since she had the life I always wanted, but now I look at her in such a different way.

I started getting feelings with her when she got her first boyfriend. Jokingly I asked one day if we’d have a threesome, and we all laughed it off, but I couldn’t stop thinking about what it would be like with her. I was in a bad manipulative relationship at the time so I thought of it as me going after someone else because I wasn’t being loved by my boyfriend. Once him and I broke up, I started crushing on her hard.

She broke up with her boyfriend, and wasn’t feeling all that great either. All that time I wanted to do something for her and be there, but then she met this guy in her therapy group. He was 18, sold drugs, went to rehab and jail, but she was all over him. It felt so painful for her to talk to him cause I knew their relationship would end terribly and it did. She was hurt and so was it. 

I confessed to liking her twice. It never went anywhere and she said now wasn’t a good time in her life. I finally pushed her aside and got a boyfriend myself who I’m still with. I genuinely love this guy and he treats me so well, and he understands parts of my life no one else does. Apparently when I got my boyfriend, she confessed to another friend that she had feelings for me. I wasn’t interested in her at the moment since I just got in a relationship. My friend got another boyfriend too who is always their for her. We’re both happy but I can’t stop thinking about her.

I know now wouldn’t be a good time to confess my feelings to her since were in relationships. I’m not planning on dumping my boyfriend either. I more feel like I needed to vent about this because I don’t know where I should stand. I love my friend, and I want what’s best for her so bad, but sometimes when we’re alone hanging out, I just wanna lean in and kiss her. There’s always this tension when we hang out too. She always calls me cute, grabs my thighs, talks about sexual stuff around me. It’s giving me mixed signals and really fucking with me.

Everything was ok for about a week but it seems his ex wife couldn’t handle him moving on and then she started attacking him with abusive emails and saying bad things about him to his kids. This was a huge strain on him and he wasn’t really coping. He told his ex wife repeatedly how her behaviour was affecting him but nothing changed, I guess she was so angry she didn’t care about the damage she was doing. 

After a few months of abuse (we tried all kinds of ways to try and get through to her but nothing worked) it started to affect me too, I started to feel anxious about what she would do next, angry that she was continually hurting him and his kids, and frustrated there was nothing I could do.

Anyway fast forward to now, they’ve just started mediation. I had hoped that they could quickly come to a solution but she isn’t allowing this to happen and refuses to take any responsibility for what she’s been doing.

His mother usually spanks him lightly and after he does it again and again.

S and his mother barely speak our language and even though she always apologizes for her son, my brother has a lot of bruises and bitemarks all over his body. 

I tried telling him to shove S away from him, when he does that, but C doesn't like hurting others and we raised him to speak properly instead of hitting and screaming, plus when he gets bitten he usually just cries and cant do much more.

My boyfriends mother knows now about the second phone her husbands been hiding for months, &amp; that he’s been sleeping with the neighbor next door .

Yesterday while we were out and we were talking about our relationship, she said that sometimes I can be a burden on her because she feels like I don’t trust her and that I can be jealous, insecure and over protective. (Which I guess looking back on myself is true) I’d say E and I have a strong relationship and I think my insecurity etc just stems down to the fact that I’ve had a shit dating experience.

685,"Hi, I’m a female college student and I’ve always been really anxious when dancing at parties/events like school dances and weddings.

I get so nervous when I go to parties to the point where sometimes I have to go to the bathroom and cry. 

Are there any videos someone can link me or advice you can write out?

693,"Background: A few weeks ago, my boyfriend relapsed on uppers. It was a very scary situation and terrified the living shit out of me. I've never had drug issues but he has, he's been clean for awhile prior so I'll be honest, I didn't see it coming. When it did, I made the decision to stay and work through it. 


It's only been a month but a few days ago he ODed on heroin. Thankfully he's okay and alive but I left the house. He admitted to using since he initially relapsed. He's been able to get it for free and always had decent excuses as to why he was off for these few weeks. 


I'm staying at a hotel right now and he's with his old sponsor. We signed a lease together at a new apartment starting in a few weeks but I just don't feel comfortable going through with it together right now.
 

Here's where I'm really struggling. My idea is that we live separately for right now for a few months until I feel comfortable he's on the right track. He's not happy about it but he's willing to do it if it means we can make this work. I don't want to break up but I want to separate our bank accounts and not be under the same roof. 


Is this smart? Is there anything else I should do? 
I love him to death and I can see he's distraught over this. But I don't think I can trust being in the same house. I just need to know I'm not making a mistake by basically abandoning him in this situation. I've heard you're not supposed to be in a relationship in early recovery, I've heard you shouldn't leave one but I have no idea what I should do. 


I'm determined to make the relationship work if he's willing to put the work into his recovery so advice like ""break up"" won't really be helpful to me.",22Sep2019,2

A few years ago my Dad adopted a ferret, and not to long after that, another one. My Dad’s job has him in another state and traveling a lot, so he can no longer take care of the ferrets. We can take care of the ferrets, but I’m very concerned for them personally. I’m a student and my Mom is a teacher so we don’t have the time, and my brothers seem to forget to take care of them. They’ve gotten skinnier since my Dad moved and today I went downstairs to find them desperate for water and out of food. Like in the title I want to get them a better home. If it helps we live in the Central Arkansas area, and both are 2-4 years old.

TL;DR- We can’t properly take care of them anymore and they deserve better.",22Sep2019,1
698,"This is going to be a long story so thanks in advance for anyone who reads it all the way through.. 

My dad has struggled with drug addiction for years. Like 15 years to be exact. Basically everyone in our entire family has given up on him except for me. Even his own parents won’t help him out anymore because he has just taken advantage of them too many times. Everyone is sick of enabling him. 

Last year, his wife (my step mom) decided she couldn’t take it anymore so she finally took their 3 teenaged kids and left him. He had nowhere else to go, so my husband and I offered to let him stay with us. At the time we were renting a tiny 2 bedroom apartment. My husband and I were in the main room and our 1 year old was in the other room. So we allowed my dad to stay in our living room so he didn’t have to be out on the streets. 

The problem was, he was still actively using heroin. When we agreed to let him move in with us, we made him agree that he would get clean because we could not have drugs around our child. Well, after he moved in he didn’t clean up. He kept using. We caught him shooting up multiple times. We found out that My husband and I were expecting our 2nd child and that is when we decided to draw the line. We told him if we caught him again he was done and had to move out. We couldn’t have someone using heroin in our home around our child and unborn child. So he cleaned up. He was clean for a few months and started doing really well. 

We ended up buying a house and told him he could come with us if he stayed clean. We pay all of his bills, we got him a cell phone, we feed him, we buy him clothes, we do everything for him. My husband and I both work full time. When he originally moved in with us, my husband and I were working opposite shifts so we never needed a sitter. Recently though , we have had some changes in our schedules so my dad has been helping to watch our kids while we work.

Side note: my husband works for a company that my uncle is the plant manager of. He has worked there for 3 years. I recently was hired on at the same company. My uncle is really big about not giving jobs to family if he feels they will screw him over by quitting really early on or walking out or anything like that... but he trusted me enough to hire me. 

Every few months my dad would have little slip ups and we kept kind of letting them go or pretending not to notice because we didn’t want to deal with the confrontation. Like we could tell he was high one day, but then he wouldn’t have any other slip ups for a month or so .. so we kind of just ignored it. 

After Father’s Day of this year, my dad ended up getting really sick. I mean he would get chills , fevers, shake uncontrollability, throw up. Couldn’t sleep. Etc..
He was sick like this for 2 months but he refused to go to the doctor. I finally convinced him to go get checked at an urgent care and they couldn’t see anything wrong with him, so they sent him home. He ended up going to 3 urgent cares and getting no help. 
Finally one day, he called me while I was working and told me something was really wrong. So I came home (this was at my previous job, not my new job). And I took him to the ER. We ended up finding out that he had an infection that all started with some bad teeth that he has. The infection turned his blood septic, traveled to his heart and started attacking it. We also found out he has blood clots in his lungs, along with a lot of other problems. He ended up staying in the hospital for over a month. 

Now he is back home and the hospital told him he needs to get his teeth pulled or the infection will come back and it will kill him. So my husband and I paid for him to get his teeth pulled. We paid for him to get dentures (he hasn’t gotten them yet, they are being made)

Well after getting his teeth pulled he was put on pain meds. He was worried that the pain meds are not strong enough because his tolerance is so high. 
Well last night, he asked to borrow my car to go get some numbing medicine for his teeth. I allowed him to and he was gone for maybe 20 minutes. When he came back , he was empty handed (no numbing medicine). But he was acting really out of it. His eyes were rolling all over the place (like they do when he is high). We confronted him about it and he said he was just playing around and he’s fine. He ended up going to bed shortly after. (This was around 11pm)

Fast forward : at 2 am I heard clapping and pounding outside of my bedroom door. My husband went to see what was going on. My dad was out there clapping and yelling “here kitty kitty”. Problem with that is, we don’t own a fucking cat. My husband tried to talk to my dad to see what was going on, but my dad was making no sense. He was just talking gibberish. He kept us up all night with this.

Today he is acting completely normal again. Basically at this point I am at my breaking point with him. I’m tired of enabling him. I think he’s using again. I don’t want him watching my kids anymore if he is using. But if he doesn’t watch them, there’s no way I can work. I can’t afford day care. And if I don’t work, we can’t afford our mortgage on my husbands income alone. 

I am willing to sell my house and rent somewhere cheaper so that we don’t have such a huge mortgage, and then I could just stay home with my kids and my husband could work. But I am afraid to upset my uncle who gave me the job. I don’t want to let him down. But if I don’t move, I don’t think anything will change. 

We’ve also considered moving to another state (where my grandma lives) and starting over. Because we know my dad doesn’t want to move out of state, so we doubt he’d come with us...and a fresh start would be nice..

Can somebody please give me some advice ?",22Sep2019,2

When I was 13, my dad got me a 1979 Fiat. Now I'm 21. Together we restored the car and it has been with us ever since. I did not have a driver's license until last year and it stood parked at home for a long time, being used mostly on the weekends or when my dad needed it to go to work because it was raining (he's got a motorcycle, as the family car stays with my mother).

Because it wasn't used so often, after a few years I decided to sell it, and this adds to the fact that for the past 5 years i've been in college far from home and I'm graduating in December and need a newer car (honestly, I'm in love with a certain Ford Escort), etc. At the moment, it's there parked and I haven't brought it to college with me just because there's the risk of it just breaking down or having a more serious problem (it's a fun car, it's in good shape, but it's of a certain age and then you start doubting its reliability).

In all this time, I've tried online classifieds, Facebook, word of mouth, anything you could think of, and I can't sell it. I really like it, it's a nice car, but I don't know what to do to get the attention of someone who wants to buy it (I know that the old cars market is complicated).

705,"I offer no cost housing for a short time (3 months max) in Seattle WA.  Housing is expensive here and its hard to find a good fit.  If folks are experiencing violence, they likely will stay if the choice is a local shelter or ""working it out"" with an abusive partner.  A lot of the folks who stay with me are housing unstable (broke and working, or looking for a job) or just need a f\*ng break from the struggle of keeping housing in this city.  I can't house anyone who needs significant support (its more like a co-housing situation than any kind of rehab or social service housing) because I'm pretty much doing it alone.  


Most folks are great BUT a lot of them are in trauma, and folks in trauma can just be energetically difficult.  I do my best to enumerate good housing boundaries because giving folks rules makes them more comfortable.  I try to make it clear that I'm not a therapist or their social worker (although I have some folks who do that professionally that I can refer people to). I also try to be clear that they have to contribute to house cleaning (like the bathroom/kitchen) because if no one else does it, I have to do it.  Sometimes I'm living with 5-6 other folks who are all in various types of trauma/recovery.   


I'm looking for brainstormy ideas. What do you think I can do to set expectations in a way that would help folks exist in a new environment?  What can I offer thats not a huge burden on me (I can pay for the house and utilities, but not anything else)?  If it were you, needing to stay in some random persons house for 3 months, what would you want/need to exit that place on more stable footing?  What could you be told that helps you realize that the person housing you isn't a punching bag, maid, or ""a crappy concierge in the worlds shittiest Air BnB""?   


Just for level setting: Most folks are never grateful and I don't expect them to be.  I often don't hear from them after they leave here - some are resentful (its just a psychological thing, about ""taking charity"").  Some folks utterly trash their space and have no qualms about treating the space poorly. Folks in trauma often aren't (and can't really be) focused on the world around them.

He was my first “boyfriend”, a kid who lived in the neighborhood but we were 8 and so boyfriend just meant holding hands and such. He seemed unstable even back then. When MySpace was still a thing he found me and hit me up and then on Facebook. Then I started to notice him posting crazier and crazier stuff, a lot of it about me. He made a ton of YouTube videos with movie clips like the Butterfly Effect and Forrest Gump saying they were about us. I then found a site where he called my husband at the time “villainous” and wrote fanfic about us being in love. I was really scared and reached out to a sealing hotline and they basically told me there’s not much I can do unless he comes to my homes.

Thing is, I'm moving into a new place with a roommate who's super allergic to cats. Ideally, I could just bring the short furred Siamese because she's naturally small and doesn't shed as much, but that still doesn't help with the allergies. I'd also feel cruel for stealing my cat from her comfort zone (she loves the house and is comfy around familiar people and my other cat) and just locking her in one room without her consent. Idk, it is for the best on the long run, but I feel very entitled to do so. 

Also I'm lost because I feel like my decision to take my cats is selfish in every possible way for the following reasons:

1) it is driven by insane emotional attachment to my cats

2) I will be using them for my own emotional support 

3) I won't live with myself knowing anything's happened to them and will therefore generally be less stressed knowing they're safe with me

4) I don't want anything used against me that would stop me from moving out and would force me to come back home

5) my roommate is super allergic

6) my cats are very comfortable in the big house they're currently staying at and are very happy. I feel like I'm very entitled to take them from a place they wouldn't want to leave

7) my brother and mom love the cats also 

8) separating both cats sounds awful

But then a huge part of me knows that it's much safer if they stay with me because my dad could go full psychopath mode on them. He could throw them out or give them away, or even abuse them. Are there other solutions? I have a friend who said she could adopt only one of them, but she has 2 other cats. And letting them stay at hers would be awful because my cat would be very depressed. She'd be away from home entirely with new people completely. It will be a very stressful environment, especially since I brought her over to that friend before and she was very upset. Back then at least, she had her brother with her, so she felt safer around him and more at ease. But separating the two and forcing her into a new environment would be very veRY cruel. 

I'm just very lost and I'm running out of options. I have no idea what to do. A part of me just wants to leave them back home and hope for the best, but I know if anything happens, or they threaten me with them, i canr come running back. What should I do?

I started with the company almost a year ago and quickly exceeded the expectations as expressed by many coworkers and anyone I've ever worked with there. So naturally, they gave me more responsibilities. I am paid well for my job description. 

My manager got pregnant at the beginning of the summer and started to show up maybe 1-2 times a week for an hour or two, saying she was fatigued and couldn't stay. I began taking over her responsibilities to make sure it got done. 

4 weeks ago, my manager had to go on short term disability with no notice. I stepped up formerly without question into the roll while still maintaining my own responsibilities for my job. Meaning I am doing 2 full time jobs. There was never a question of bringing anyone in to give me a hand because everything was under control. 

I received a call from HR two weeks ago asking how my duties have changed since the manager left. I explained it hasn't really because she wasn't present enough to do her duties prior to that. I was also asked what my wage expectation was. I said I'm happy to have a job, so make me a fair offer and we should be good to go.

My boss (regional manager) told me that they could not adjust my wage due to my manager expecting to return and they would need to lower my pay rate again when she came back, so instead, they were looking into ""cash injections"". I have been patiently waiting this entire time. This past Tuesday, he told me this isn't possible to do cash injections because I am contract, not salaried, instead, he offered me a contract amendment with 10% of my wages additional hourly added to my wages until my manager returns. Which works out to be $2.40. 

I approached my boss with a job description I wrote and told him that there is not a clear definition between where my job ends and the manager's begins. I'm afraid of what happens to me when she returns. He didn't have a lot of answers. I asked if we could negotiate my wage and he said there isn't room for that. 

I do not feel like they have made me a fair offer. I am really really not good at standing up for myself and I'd appreciate any advice for how to have the next conversation with my boss to express that I am worth more to then than their offer which is frankly insulting for doing 2 full time jobs.

I liked her a lot and thought she was very nice, but our relationship fizzled and she was one of the only girls that broke up with me first. She told me the reason she had to break up with me is because her parents made her for her grades. Typical fib to get out of a relationship, right?

I asked her about two days later if she needed another ride and she was highly reluctant over text, saying it was a no-go with her parents. Now I’m thinking, “well shit, there goes my second chance with her” another typical fib to get out of hitching rides with a guy she has zero interest in, right? Well, as of last night I was playing destiny 2 with my friends, and one of them tells me he rides the bus with her. He tells me that she wants to ride with me but her parents are extremely strict, and she even has to turn her phone in at 7:30 in the evening every day (that’s how you breed a psychopath). This kind of made me slap my forehead, in the sense that she was 100% truthful in everything she told me. The problem is that I don’t know how to work around her strict parents to see and talk to her, as I believe we are both interested in each other at this point. Oh, I also neglected to mention that I got in a fight with a kid when I took her to homecoming in seventh grade, and that may have something to do with her parents against me. Other  then that, I’m a pretty good kid with consistent grades and no criminal background of any sort, so I can’t imagine those parents holding a grudge on me since the seventh grade. Any advice on how I can get through to this girl?",22Sep2019,1

720,"Basically I liked a girl for about a year. Everyone knew, including her, knew that I liked her. She moved to college about a month ago and I started talking more to her best friend (we also were good friends before but like never talked outside of school and when we hung out w crush). Last night she invited me over and she was tired and we were laying on the couch when she stood up. She almost passed out and I caught her. We stared at eachother and then she puffed out her lips. I was like “you sure” and then she nodded and we kissed. We kissed a second time and then sat on the couch for a bit incredibly awkwardly. I got up and she followed me to the other room. We then made out. Shortly after that I left and we texted for a bit. She said she liked it but didn’t know where she wanted to go with it.

721,"I sing in an indie band that I have been with for a couple of years. I wrote over half of the music for it (we released an album just for fun when I was in college) and I used to play guitar as well but I have since switched to just vocals. We recently got a new lead guitarist and bass player, and I taught them how to play our songs, but they never practice them. It's like they don't even think about our music until our weekly practice. The other guitarist who was in the band originally also never practices, but he at least knows the songs well enough at this point to manage. Same with our drummer, but the problem is that I am the only one who actively tries to improve. The other members are constantly making the same mistakes from one week to the next. 

I love playing shows and they all want to play a show soon, but frankly, I'd be embarrassed to perform with them. Just last week, the lead guitarist completely forgot how to play one of the songs, and I can't have that shit happening on stage. When I played guitar in the band, I got them to the point where they were muscle memory. Even when my band is playing the songs correctly, they still sound off to me.

So I don't know what to do from here. I could plead with them to pracitce more so we can finally play a show. I could just break up the band and write new music. Or I could kick out the new members. One major problem to consider is that it is very hard to find other musicians.

It's hard to find a place for my car around my house because I live in a busy street. A couple days ago I found a place I could park my car and go have lunch but a guy came and told me to move my car away from there. He stood in the parking place preventing me from parking there while threatening me by saying things like ""if you park here I'll show you."" He kept saying it was his place to park his car because it's in front of his shop even if it's on the state road and nobody can claim such things.

He said many things and I refused to move my car until he started calling his friends, budging my car's mirror and making bigger threats. I was gonna go out of my car and start a big fight even if I would get beaten up.

But instead I just said screw it and moved away. I came home after parking in a street a little further away from my house and punched doors until I broke one of them. Now everytime I remember this I feel like I'm gonna explode.

How do I cope with this? I've never hit people even though I got punched many times in the past and I don't wanna start now. Now that I feel like a completely useless person, these old incidents began rising in my head and now I feel a horrible rage building up.

739,"Hello! Thanks for reading. I want to start off this post by giving some background info . Me bf and I have been together for about 3 years and we have had the most amazing relationship . It’s been different ever since we started , from the beginning we both knew it was something special and we just clicked and got along like we’ve known each other our whole lives . We’re really good at communicating and we talk about our future and getting married and being together forever . He was also a virgin before he met me and saved himself for someone special (he doesn’t believe in being with someone you don’t love and sex to him is special ). 

So in high school I dated someone who turned into a drug addict and was extremely manipulative and abusive (i was to young to know any better and he always lied about what he was doing ). The relationship scarred me off of love for a long time . Since then I’ve developed OCD and PTSD. Sometimes I get into catastrophic thinking where I obsess about the what if of something happening 

So sometimes I look at his phone (wrong I know ).  About 1 year ago probably more I briefly saw a conversation that went back a few months with his female friend Anna that he’s known since grade school talking about her thinking about breaking up with her bf and she discussing not wanting to rush into anything with anyone else. this is the same month one of his friends was interested in her and asked if she was in a relationship and he tried to set them up since things weren’t going well in her relationship . The iPhone conversation only went back a few months maybe  (so he must of deleted it at some point ) . around the time when they were talking about her and her problems with her bf . I remember her sending  bunch of long texts about the issues she was having but i didn’t actually read them because I felt so quilty I was reading them . I never brought it up but always worried that something happened between them or someone admitted feelings and that’s why she broke up with her boyfriend or she was talking about them getting together etc and that’s why they were deleted. I tried to tell myself I was being ridiculous and pushed back those thoughts . Especially because my bf had told me they had been having problems and she was talking to him about it , and he was trying to set her up with someone . Past forward a year and a half I glanced at their conversations casually , he has never been secretive with his phone or suspicious . 

A year or two later he deleted a conversation with her again and I noticed a few months later. I decided to talk to him about feeling jealous and worrying about being second best because she is  so beautiful and they’ve known each other for their whole lives . They don’t hangout outside of school but they’ll drive to the bus stop together to take the bus since they live on the same street or sometimes take a class together. We talked things through , and a few weeks later I noticed he had deleted a few conversations from his phone, including hers.  and I got really nervous and started thinking catastrophically. It turned into a fight that was months long talking about trust and who we are as people . Turns out I eventually found out he told her I was in the hospital when I asked him not too and he deleted the first conversation to avoid fighting . He wasn’t fully honest with me about the details of a few things so I lost trust in him a bit .he said he deleted the convo after we resolved it because he wanted a “fresh start” apparently whenever her name would come up I would get angry and jealous and I was talking it out on him , he offered to block her but obviously I said no. He’s conflict avoidant , and he tells me all the time I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to him. He had a hard life at home growing up and he finally found “his person” and someone to share life with so I think he’s really scared to loose what we have and that’s why he deletes things . He has an iPhone so his messages back up to his computer , in the heat of everything I asked to see them, the messages hasnt been backing up to his computer for about a year since he did a software upgrade  it would no longer recognize his Apple ID. He ended up spending hours on The phone with Apple to repair it and even tried downloading softwares to get messages back from his phone to help me get over this. 

He’s tried to be really understanding for months talking about my fears and specifically what I’m worried about. They tried dating years ago and ended up kissing once and deciding it wasn’t for them. He talked about how she’s like his sister and there just not compatible. And we have a spark he’s never had with anyone else and he would never do anything to jeopardize this . And you don’t cheat on someone you love and there friendship is very platonic. He also got offended I questioned anything happened between them and told me it seems like I don’t know who he is.  

Long story short he told her I thought something happened between them (long story) and she was shocked and talked about how she loved him and me and us together and she just wants us to be happy and nothing has ever happened between them and she doesn’t want me thinking anything happened when it didn’t and offered to talk to me and messaged me saying that they have been friends for a long time but only have ever been friends and he loves me so much and she would never ever do that to me or anyone. 

I feel so awful for being so jealous and thinking like this . I know this is another episode where I obsess about something really bad happening  . But I’m scared to let go and for shit to hit the fan . I’ve started therapy and medication . I feel like I’ve already done a lot of damage that hasn’t made me the best partner. If I had to base my feelings on his actions with me I would never ever question our happiness. He is so so good to me and is always kind loving and understanding , he’s never acted distant or weird or anything . It’s just the deleted texts that make me worried of worst case scenario . 

Tl;dr am I crazy ? Is this weird or am I being nuts",22Sep2019,1

Since then she’s been hanging around other guys as well and now I don’t feel so special anymore. I really should’ve made a move and asked her out. 

I just don’t know why I couldn’t. I’ve never ever dated anyone because my parents were so strict in high school so I don’t have much experience talking to girls and flirting. I really felt this would’ve been my chance at that and I fucked it up.

# What is going well for me right now: 

* I went to a large party state school and the tuition is basically free for me because of scholarships so I will be graduating debt free 
* I am going to get a decent paying job after college working as a software engineer so I have a solid career ahead of me 
* I have a very tight knit small friend group of 4-5 guys who have been my close friends since high school. 
* I eat extremely healthy, I don't drink alcohol, I don't watch pornography, I don't have any social media besides occasionally going on Reddit and YouTube, I train martial arts, and I lift weights. 
* I also meditate 10-15 mins daily so my mental health is in great condition and I have very high confidence/self worth. 
* A lot of my free time is spent working on my hobbies of coding, martial arts, and lifting. The rest of my free time is spent playing video games where I have met a ton of cool online friends. 
* I listen to a lot of awesome podcasts and I'm always trying to continuously educate myself and hear different perspectives on different topics in society. 
* I know who I am, I know what I like, and I know what my goals and purpose in life is. I'm very comfortable being alone and I'm an old soul for sure. I'm 100% an old man trapped in a 20 year olds body.

# Some other details and what has been going bad : 

* On the weekends all my small group of friends do is smoke a shit ton of weed and play a bunch of video games. 
* I haven't gone out in like 3 years which I'm okay with as I'm an old soul. I turn 21 in a few months but currently I can't go out to bars since i'm not 21. I hate the club because I don't drink. 
* I'm not opposed to hooking up with a girl but many times I'd prefer to have a serious relationship rather than just a one night stand. I'm also usually not in the position to have a lot of one night stands because I don't go out nor do I have tinder. 
* A lot of the times on the weekend I get a massive fear of missing out. Most Fridays and Saturdays I spend playing video games inside or working on my hobbies/career. 
* There are times where I definitely feel like a loser. I haven't gotten laid in a year and a half. And its not really that I lack confidence or I'm ugly.
* I feel like when people talk about college they talk about the hot girls they banged and all the fun stuff they did and how much they miss it. I don't feel like this at all I spend most of my time working on improving myself and then playing video games. 
* College has just be ""meh"" for me. I'm more looking forward to moving to a big city and working a cool tech job and moving on to the next chapter of my life.

# Where I'm struggling the most and where I need advice: 

**Overall I feel like the 2 biggest things I'm struggling with i**s 

1.  Fitting in to the social scene here because I don't drink and I don't really ever go out so I feel like I can't relate to anyone here.
2.  I also feel like a loser since I haven't had sex with a girl in a year and a half since my last relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

# What I have thought about doing: 

*  volunteering -&gt; I'm not sure if there are places that have volunteering on Friday nights? But I know there's definitely some that do stuff on Saturdays. I think this would be a good way to maybe meet some new people and just get me out of my apartment. 
* joining a club -&gt; There are a ton of student orgs on campus. I think I may need to try going to some other student orgs. I went to a gaming club meetup and I felt so awkward. Everyone there was super socially awkward and I felt completely out of place.",22Sep2019,1
753,"I tried to get the point across in the subject, but basically:

Lets say you start to date with someone, and you like them and want to keep dating.  However, initially you guys aren't exclusive and they end up going exclusive with some one else.  However, turns out that they don't work out.

How do you all handle this?  Are you willing to try dating them again?  Or do you avoid doing so because you might feel like you're the ""second"" choice?

I don't like the idea of being a ""second"" choice, but at the same time I understand when you first start dating people that eventually you have to pick who to go exclusive with, and its based on, at best, an educated guess..right?",22Sep2019,2

759,"Growing up, I only ever had a few friends I saw regularly and, looking back on it, it wasn’t a good social circle. I got teased mercilessly for having different tastes than the others and I was commonly neglected. I hung out with them anyway because they were really the only friends I had. My brother was part of the group too and he got along great with them, but he also took part in the teasing. I don’t resent any of them and I understand that we were all just kids, but it still hurts to think about.

The friends I made later that didn’t give me crap were better, but one way or another, they all left for other schools or just drifted away in general with no real explanation. I always tried to connect with people in other places, but each one either amounted to nothing or fell apart.

My church’s youth group: The only friend I had left for college and the pastor I felt comfortable with had to move away.
A local theater group: They didn’t acknowledged my existence unless I was receiving instructions.
Duel enrolling at a college: It’s a Freshmen class so everyone already knows each other, and I’m also the only male attending, so nobody is super eager to talk to me.
A different youth group: I got left behind at the host-house during a weekend activity when we were supposed to leave and I was only noticed to be absent when someone came back to get something they needed for the day.

It’s not like I didn’t try to put myself out there. I genuinely tried to be outgoing and social with others, but this stuff continues to happen and I don’t know why. I’ve given everyone involved the benefit of the doubt and I understand that there are two sides to everything, but it really hurt to deal with all of this by myself for so long.

Right now, I have three friends I frequently talk to, but I don’t feel close to any of them. I’ve tried to connect with one of them multiple times, and I do everything people say goes into being a good friend. I make sure to listen, empathize, support, offer help and everything in between, but my issues are always made light of and our relationship never goes anywhere. I’ve done all I can without pushing things, but I can’t make that connection. He says I’m an amazing friend to him, but his reasons for believing that feel so insignificant to me. It boils down to him being comfortable talking about unconventional interests with me, like video game or movie related things. He says I’m a big help to him for listening to him rant about trivial things that bother him, but I feel like I’m not really doing anything to actually help him, which is what I believe a good friend should do. I wonder if we’re just looking for different things in friends.

I know that he’s been suffering with some heavy stuff for a long time now, and I understand why he’s reluctant to open up to me, but it’s like that with everyone else, even if there’s no emotional trauma on their end. Things have always been treated so lightly with everyone I’ve ever opened up to, like nothing’s wrong and everything will be okay, and it makes me feel isolated from the people around me. More than anything, I want to connect with a friend that I know won’t abandon me, will make an effort to help, will stick up for me when I need it and will allow me to help them and let me into their lives.

I see so many people talk about how close they are with people and I want to feel that way too. At the same time, I see fictional characters in a friendship that has everything I want from one. The best example I can think of for a general audience is Woody and Buzz from Toy Story. The way they’re so different from each other but still express their concern, loyalty and love for each other despite their differences is what I want in a friendship, but I start to wonder if friendships like that even exist. They say life’s not like the movies, and I guess I started to apply that to what I wanted in really close friendships. I don’t know if I’m setting my expectations too high, or if I’m just unlucky, or if I’m flat out incapable of connecting with others. I’m also scared of hurting others with expectations if that turn out to be false.

I just want to be part of a relationship that feels organic and genuine instead of ones that fee trivial and artificial.

Right now, I don’t have any opportunities to put myself out there due to my situation, but even if I did, with what I know and what I’ve experienced, I don’t know if I’d be able to make any genuine connections. So, when I’m finally able to push myself forward, what should I know going into it? Should I lower my expectations, or should I keep doing what I’m doing and hope for the best?",22Sep2019,1

764,"So my best friend of 4 years invited me to a sleepover the other night. I decided to go because why not! It was around 11 pm when she brought up the idea of drinking. She wanted to drink with me so I just went with it, thinking nothing of it. She was quite drunk while I was absolutely fucked.  

I gave her a warning before we starting drinking that I get extremely horny while drunk. She laughed it off and joked saying ""then so finger yourself"". So at that point I was wasted and making sexual jokes at her and she was embarrassed but looked interested. 

Somehow she asked me if I've ever had a crush on her and I told her I use to, she said she also had one on me in the past.  I don't remember the events that led up to it but I remember asking her if she wants to get fucked and her nodding. I remember asking her if she was absolutely sure, since I don't want to pressure her or anything. She just sorta wrapped her legs around mine and nodded again. She told me she was to embarrassed to say it out loud, so one thing led to another and I fucked her. 

We stopped halfway through since both of us took to long and we weren't horny anymore. I told her not to regret this and she laughed and gave me a rating of 4/5.  I kept calm and told her that I'm probably not going to remember any of this in the morning. She responded with ""You better not or I'll kill you"". We went to bed and woke up around 9 am. She was extremely embarrassed but didn't seem regretful. I left a couple minutes after waking up since I had places to be. 

She doesn't think I remember at all. Should I bring it up to her? I think she might still have a crush on me. In that case should I ask her out? I have no idea what to do here",22Sep2019,1
765,"My MIL and I are almost always at odds with each other. She is a talker, dreamer, talker, procrastinator/planner with no real plans to do anything, confrontational person. I am a discussing, reality, let's turn plans into actions, talks numbers and ideas, non-confrontational type of a person. Whenever we get upset with one another my SO steps in and tries to smooth things over or at least talk to us about it. He typically tells me that we have the same complaints about each other. We both think the other person is being rude or that we think the other person is a know it all or talks down to one another and we both say that we don't realize we're doing it. HOWEVER, I can't actually talk to her about anything because she is the type that talks over you and won't listen to anything you have to say. You are instantly wrong and she is only arguing to be mean and not really talk things out. We actually got into a really really bad argument around a month ago. This time I'm hiding in my room here because I don't want another blow up. Aside from just trying not to talk to her at all I have no idea what to do.

The thing I find the most odd about it is he usually talks to me first and then goes and talks to her on other sides of the house. Or, we at least, are behind closed doors. I feel like the chances of her saying the same thing I do very suspicious. That could just be my fusteration talking though.

767,"This is going to be a long one so I apologize in advance and thank you in advance if you read the whole thing. So sophomore year of high school (two years ago) I met this boy and I immediately knew I wanted him to be in my life for a super long time. I approached him and worked my way into his life and he eventually grew to like me. We had a fight and stopped being friends. But a few weeks later we went to a party together and rekindled our friendship. We were stronger than ever and got really close. Since I was young and dumb I caught feelings for him. I told him and he just didn’t feel the same. Or at least that’s what he said. For those who believe in astrology, he was an Aquarius so he was born to be uncomfortable with feelings. Anyways. Everyone could tell (including me) that he liked me. He just would say otherwise. I could tell by the way he looked at me. The way he talked to me. The way he would always try and get close to me. But since his words would contradict his actions I was left confused and constantly hurt. I’m generally a very emotional person and he was the complete opposite. He would only show his soft sweet side every once in a while but I knew deep down he cared for me. As time went on I became more and more jealous of other girls in his life and I became more depressed knowing he didn’t like me. I became overwhelmed and just so happened to be at my lowest point due to other problems. As the days went on I got more toxic and began to blame my mental status on him. I wouldn’t say that directly but I would say something like “if you don’t respond there’s no promising I won’t do *insert something involving death and destruction to myself*” and placed all of my mental problems on his shoulders to carry. Of course he would then respond freaking out and saying how he cared about me. And I knew at the time that that was a terrible thing to do and I knew it would come back to bite me. But I guess I was so desperate for his attention I would do anything it took to get it. I grew up with a very flighty dad who eventually left when I was 14. This hurt me a lot and to this day causes me to feel less than. Anyways as time went on I got worse and worse as far as blaming my best friend for my problems. He started to push me away because of it which caused me to go on a rampage of paragraphs of apologizing but finding ways to manipulate him into staying for the sake of keeping me alive. He eventually got a girlfriend which put the cherry on top of my manic episode and just caused me to wreak havoc. I nearly broke my fist punching walls (this is all so cringe to type but I have to learn from this) I screamed until my voice gave out I was dazing in and out of consciousness and was on the verge of suicide. There I was sitting on the edge of my bed bawling barely able to get a firm grip on reality. I was getting ready to accept my fate but I remembered my mom. I remembered my family. My dog came into the room and looked at me and I broke down crying even harder. How could I leave my family? Why would I do this all because someone didn’t like me the way I liked them. As you could tell, I’m still alive and I’m very happy to be. I’m ashamed to look back at my actions but I am working on becoming a better person. Back to that boy. We eventually lost touch. Months went by. I missed him and felt bad for all that I had put him through. I invited him to another party and he surprisingly said yes. This was about a year ago. We went to the party but left early to just drive around. We drove around for hours just talking and laughing and it felt amazingly nice. It was time to drop him off so I pulled up to his house and parked. He looked at me and said “do you want a hug?” Which we all know what that really means. HE wanted a hug. He said not in the car tho because that’d be awkward. And I said “I’m not getting out of the car just for a hug” ugh. He said okay and he left. He walked inside. And I drove off. Crying. To this day I wonder what would have happened if I got out. Knowing him he was probably going to kiss me but I manipulated it because I was scared of getting hurt again. But the joke was on me I got hurt anyways. The morning after I checked my Snapchat just to see that he un-added me. I haven’t heard from him since. I really want to get in contact with him and apologize for everything I’ve put him through but like I said, he’s uncomfortable with emotions. And quite frankly. So am I. I like to say I’m over him. And I like to say I’m a better person than I was. But if he were to come back into my life I have a feeling I would fall back into that toxic mindset. This post was all over the place and I’m not even quite sure of what I’m asking. I guess what I’m asking is how to make amends with the people I’ve hurt. Or how do I make amends with myself because I feel guilty each and every day for my toxic actions and how I hurt my best friend. It hurts me even more knowing I never even gave him a genuine apology. And I might never be able to. 


TL;DR
I pushed away my best friend due to my toxic actions and was never able to fully apologize. How do I go about forgiving myself and should I try to get in contact with them to apologize or just let them be since I already put them through so much?",22Sep2019,1

I got the idea she liked me so I tested the waters and sent her a text asking a work related question. She replied to my texts in like 10 minutes or less. Good sign. I start going off into chit-chat and after a few texts she ghosts me. Bad sign. I just found out from someone else I work with that she's married. Fuck me. Bummer but I'm already over it.

I didn't say anything inappropriate, I said ""Hey, you're smart. Do you know xyz work shit?"". That's the only thing I said that could be construed as me hitting on her. Besides that I was respectful.

781,"I work in the automotive industry, focusing on vehicle valves. It is very good pay and benefits for the area. The shifts are long, but I do enjoy it. A lot of potential to move up or to different departments for different experiences without a college certificate. Not for every department, but you get the idea.  They will mostly train you on everything you show interest in. 

My supervisor 40M is very lenient with you using your phone on the clock. We are not supposed to even have them on us per company policy. We primarily work weekend shift and most of the office (payroll, HR, Plant Manager) are never present. 

STORY: a part in one of the machines was very loose and no one could figure out what the issues was for a week. 

I was working one of those days that week and after lunch my parts were not to standard about 700 pcs. 
Our limits for mess ups stop at 500 pcs. 

That was a week ago. 
Today, I was checking my email, the weather, etc. Which has now become part of my moring routine once I get things going at startup. Well my supervisor walked up and said because (I was one of the four who ran bad products last week) I was on my phone, I would get written up tomorrow. I am very confused now. I was told it was ok to use my phone, just not in front of the main office people. 

Should I tell them in our meeting with HR tomorrow when we go over my write up, how I was confused?

I was told one thing and then another. 
I'm not sure how much trouble he would get into. 
 Might even put my supervisor on a tighter leash (he's pretty lenient) which might effect ""phone time"" for the entire weekend department 100+ people and I would feel guilty.


 It would be playing the victim on my part, but the write up effects me for a year and I will no longer be able to get a pay raise until it expires a year from tomorrow.
 If I do say something it I'm not sure if it would reverse the write up for me at all and I would still be in the same situation, possibly worse. 

It doesn't feel justified. I did run bad products, unintentionally.

784,"Yo,

I’m a sports writer for a mid-size newspaper. I’m 24 and sports writing is all I’ve done as far as my professional career.

While I liked it at first, I’ve since realized that most of the accessible jobs out there are primarily covering high school sports, which I absolutely abhor. I knew it would be part of the equation starting out but I’ve since realized that (a) the fucking pay in this industry is worse than I thought it would be (b) an old saying a mentor once told me is brutally true: you’ll work all hours of the day and get paid for 40. While I was once committed to this mode of thought, the passion I had as a high schooler and college student has quickly faded as I grow older into a cynical adult. Long story short, it’s just not what I thought it would be in the long run. I really liked it at first but now it’s becomes a stale nuisance.

My current boss, who was a mentor at the beginning of my career, has turned out to be an overbearing, untrustworthy cunt. While there are some good things about my job, the cons outweigh the pros and I’m beginning to think about the future.

While I have some prestigious accomplishments that prepared myself well for my field, I literally only have experience in sports writing, but am a proven and capable writer. 

With that said, does anyone have any advice? Obviously I don’t expect someone to solve all of my problems, but I’m just trying to see if maybe there are options I hadn’t considered.

788,"My roommate who I've been friends with some time is always finding a way to criticize the things I do and the ways I behave to the point where he will try to control my habits and ways by meddling and taking action.

A good example of this is my food habits.  Anytime I cook or prepare food in any way, he is there to criticize.  He threw out bacon that I had sealed and stored in the freezer for a month because it was ""probably bad."" Meat sealed in a freezer takes quite a lot longer to ""go bad"" than a month, and even if he didn't understand that, I would still expect him to ask me before throwing out something I paid for.  Yesterday I accidentally left ham out that I bought earlier in the day.  He noticed I left it out immediately and didn't put it in the refrigerator for me, nor did he tell me that I left it out, but instead waited for me to notice a few hours later and, of course, criticized me for leaving ham out and threw it out without my permission.  I cook hotdogs for myself using a wonderful technique that I found online that makes the hotdogs plump on the inside and crispy on the outside.  It's delicious. But he tells me that ""that's not the way to cook hotdogs"" and never misses a beat to criticize me over it.  

Those are a few specific examples.  Now imagine me getting constantly criticized by him over everything I do all throughout the day, every single day, for things he has no involvement in. The ways I take out the trash, the ways I do homework/study, the ways I clean, the ways I get ready for the day.   It has really started to get to me.

None of these things affect or involve him in any way, but he will criticize me for anyways.  He always seems to find infinite flaws of mine to constantly attack, and ways to bring me down. 

I live in an apartment with him and two others.  I have no issues with the other two.  I also work as a sort of RA for the building and I'm unable to move out of the room that I currently reside, not that I believe that is the necessary course of action. 

Anyways, I could really use some advice on how to handle my friendship with him and my living relationship with him",22Sep2019,1

791,"I’ve moved into a new house for the time being and hoping my best friend can move out of her place by the end of this year. I thought it’d be a good place with good housemate because the previous tenant stated the housemate is respectful and nice. But turns out he’s a complete nightmare and I’m over it. He’s draining to deal with and I can’t move anywhere else because I’m in the process of my last year of studying and exams are in November and this is the only shared house that allows me a flexible lease. 

He acts very entitled, doesn’t clean up and just overall has a crap attitude. He has been away for work recently but now he’s coming back to do local work which means I will have to see him every damn day. He has been nothing but a pain.  The bedroom is small, I get one bar phone signal in there, and I don’t know why, but as soon as I walk into the lounge room it’s full bars. The house smells weird and I can’t get rid of the smell. It’s a shared house meaning the lounge room is also for each tenant to share, but the housemate hogs it all up. There’s cigarettes everywhere and empty beer bottles. I hate it. I’ve spoken to him about it but all he says is, “Yeah, I’ll clean up.” But he never does.",22Sep2019,3

795,"i just came back home from a friends house, i hurt my foot because i fell down the stairs so i put something away in the kitchen and went up to my room. before i went to my room i told my dad that i was gonna lay down and he said he was gonna go to a gas station and get a soda from the soda fountain and asked me what i wanted. i told him that i wanted this soda that’s a red energy drink, it’s my favorite and i get it all the time. when he comes back and gives it to me, he watches me take a sip and then says “does it taste okay?”. i was really confused and didn’t understand, but i noticed that the soda was a little thick and the flavor was strong. i joked to myself that it tasted like cough syrup and i figured that they mixed the soda wrong at the fountain or something, and i told him it was fine. i took a nap, and then went downstairs for some food, but on the counter of the kitchen i noticed a large bottle of red cherry flavored cough syrup. it wasn’t there before when i was downstairs, and the bottle was nearly empty. 

im pretty sure he put cough syrup in my soda. i don’t know why he would, i don’t even know what effect excessive cough syrup has on your body. i’m just really freaked out right now. i really need advice on what to do and how to handle the situation, maybe clues on why he would do that.",22Sep2019,0

798,"I'm currently a F17. 

 I never had this desire of getting to know my biological father until this year. I never asked what he looked liked, what he did, OR his name. I've only collected pieces of information along the way but nothing at all detailed. I currently live in a great family with my mother, my two half-sisters ,and my step-father (who I've been calling dad, not step-dad like others do.) I consider my step-dad my real dad because he's been with me since I was born. We have a good relationship. 

All I know about my bio-dad: 

* He's done cocaine for several years, looks like he had an addiction. 
* He's diabetic. (I'm tested and I'm not.)
* His mother died, had an addiction.
* I know his nationality for sure. 

Note that no one in else in my family are drug addicts, alcoholics, etc. My mom told me this about him because she wanted to warn me that I might have an addiction disorder or something like that (when I brought up that one of my friends did crack). 

Now I consider good soul and my friends and family know I would never touch any type of drug or alcohol. 

What I don't know about bio-dad: 

* If he's alive
* His name or age
*  if he knows who I am or my name
*  if his other family members are alive
* etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I need advice on: 

1. I would like to ask my mom more questions, but in a correct way that won't mess things up. I don't want to bring up awkward tension or memories or make anyone feel uncomfortable.  I don't know why but I feel that the subject matter is just taboo. Every time it comes up I feel this uncomfortable atmosphere that just stops me from asking questions. When the subject comes up I refrain from asking. 
2. Also I would like to know if I'm unhealthy at all due to the fact that my bio-dad had all these issues. I feel like I'm not since I partake in sports, not overweight but I used to think I was (my mom says I might have body dysphoria and everyone says I'm skinny/normal) but that's all I have on my mental and physical health?? It would be disappointing to hear that I have unhealthy consequences that a crack addict has... if I've never done anything like that before in my life. Maybe I'll age faster or get a tumor? I'm not so sure.",22Sep2019,1

My brother(11M) has always have been very jealous about it and wanted one. A couple of months ago, I had saved up some money so I could buy a new monitor and GPU(which is pretty expensive) and decided to build my brother a pc, my grandpa paid for the rest. He loves it, but he screams and yells. He is not really nice to me very often but I usually just let it slide. Today I told if he could be a little quieter and he just went it off telling me that he hates and I’m dead to him. Of course I didn’t like that very much so I told him if he said he hated me again I would take back all of the stuff I gave him, like the chair I got for my birthday and the GPU/monitor I gave him. He said he didn’t care and he didn’t love me anyways. What should I do?",22Sep2019,1

805,"Throwaway account... This has been bugging me for awhile, and the answers might be obvious if I can't see them please be kind to me, I'm nervous about even asking for help with this. Also I am 24F. 

Okay, so my problem is I was talking with some girl friends and the topic of men and sex came up because of course it did. And they were talking about making out and slow sex, and I kind of laughed and said something along the lines of ""yeah right, no one actually does that, it's only in movies"" etc. They all laughed with me until they realized I was serious, then they got a little concerned.

So... Yeah. I guess I don't know how to have slow sex and take it seriously. It goes deeper than that I suppose because I've literally never thought it was a thing people actually do... My only experience with sex is from being raped in the past and now sex to me is usually hard, rough, painful... But I like it that way I'm pretty sure. IDK I guess I just feel stupid? One guy I was with recently, I guess maybe he wanted slower, more ""making love"" type sex because he was sending signals, but I didn't realize that until hindsight. My experience is to just turn around and take it... I don't like kissing, I don't like facing my partner... Am I just completely doing it wrong? 

I'm feeling extremely useless and upset over this I'm sorry if it's dumb to even ask about it idk. I feel so uncomfortable imagining a slow, making out kind of sex.",22Sep2019,1
806,"So I belong to a training group. There was an event over the weekend that we all attended that was a few hours away from our gym, so some of them decided to get a motel. I was invited and although originally I was going to go home, it was 12am when the event ended and was down-pouring outside so I decided to stay with them - I figured it could be fun, although I was a little nervous because I'd be sharing a room with four guys and I would be the only girl. (Not gonna lie I felt pretty cool at the same time). I have known one of the guys for years now prior to either of us joining this gym, but we have hooked up a few times so I was a little nervous about that also, yet I figured with other people in the room, nothing like that would happen. The night was going amazing, we were having so much fun talking, drinking, and playing drinking games. We were all super drunk and tired, but then....once all of us got in our beds, my friend and I hooked up and everyone was apparently still awake and heard us. The sex was totally consensual and enjoyable, but I can't help but feel so embarrassed and also rude that I had sex with him with others right next to us, and awake. I know being ""too drunk"" isn't an excuse, but I wouldn't have done it *there* if I was sober. They all heard us, I remember one of them saying something and chuckling, but we still kept going and we eventually fell asleep. No one said anything about it to me the next morning, though I drove separately from them so I'm just wondering what I am going to walk into when we go to train next. My friend is actually friends with the others, whereas I am newer to the gym so I'm not on that level with them. We are all 21-25 years old. How would you feel if you were in the other's situation? I have never been in this type of situation before so I have a lot of anxiety about it.",22Sep2019,1

I've done alternative therapies (acupuncture, TMS, etc), been dropped by psychiatrists for being too much (I'm med compliant but I've taken nearly every medication under the sun without much help), and I've ended up with the only person in town willing to see me. I drive an hour to to their office wait sometimes upwards of 3hrs+ to be seen only to be told I can change medications if I have time to quit my job and adjust to them even though I've tried every medication out there so instead I'm written the same medication and walked out the door. I'm dependent on benzos and can't sleep without them. I've been in and out of mental hospitals since I was 20 and I absolutely cannot take time off of work to adjust my medications again so I'm really at a loss of what to do. I want to kill myself almost every, hate my life, have crippling anxiety and fear of any change but I CANNOT be in the mental hospital again and all I really do is work and sleep. I know I should exercise and I know I should eat healthy but I live alone and can only hold myself accountable to go to work and pretend to be happy

It's just a cycle at this point and I don't know what to do. My brother and my friends tell me that I'm spoiled because I have gotten this help and haven't been able to change which is true. The only thing that really keeps me going is my two cats but I've begun to feel detached from them and the rest of the world.  I live life on auto pilot without any motivation to do anything and I've gone several days without eating because I don't have the motivation to eat. It's a vicious cycle and I don't know how to break it.
