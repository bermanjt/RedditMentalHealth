0,"Hey everyone, so something pretty awful happened and I need some advice. My father was outside this morning, preparing for work, he’s a contractor. the landscapers in my complex have been blowing leaves and can get close to the cars parked in the driveway. He thought they had scratched his car. A member of the landscapers was walking by, said hello, and my dad just said nothing and the guy turns back around, and says “do we have a problem?”, so my dad, a little angry says “yeah, you guys blow grass all over the place and I think you scratched my car”, and then - the dude got right up in my dads face and says something awful- “don’t talk to me like a n****r”. My dad was stunned and the guy was big, and so my dad backed off, and he asked where the scratch was and said he was the owner of the landscaping company when my dad asked his name. He started walking away and turned back around and said “let’s try this again, hello” and ya know. So my question is- do we report this to our complex owner? He seems like a vindictive guy,",20Jul2019,1
1,"I have been keeping everything to me for years, and now it feels so overwhelming that I can't bear it anymore. And the sad part is, I don't have anyone to share with.

Family, not a choice, they've never understood me since my childhood. Friends, too busy, self/pre occupied with their own stuff and problems. Specialist? Out of my monthly budget, can't afford to tell my parents about this.

Choices left = ?

I still remember, I tried sharing it with one of my close friend, but she wasn't able to handle me and even started to ignore me for the same. Well as I stopped sharing most of the things, she came back to normal.

Man I feel so alone because of this. I just want someone to understand me, to accept me for who I am.",20Jul2019,4

Which I typically don’t mind being friendzoned i guess but the problem is i really like her and it only hurts to think that it will never be something more (atleast i think).

My younger cousin (19M) who I’m close to lost both parents within 4 months. Parents were separated and he did not see his dad as much.

He’s always been more introverted and quiet and we play video games together but I wanna know if there’s more I can do. I’ve offered to take us to the beach and going hiking but I know he’s not in the mood to do much.

I guess I just need advice on what to say and what to do. I don’t wanna push him to do things he doesn’t want to do and I don’t want him to feel like I’m coddling him.

I got laid off and applied for job after job after job while collecting unemployment being told repeatedly that I was overqualified or undereducated. (I was not being picky-any job, any pay, any hours) 
When my unemployment neared it’s limit, I applied for government assistance and listed most of my belongings for sale and started posting and searching for side jobs-anything I could get.

15,"Hey after a lot of scrolling and finding minimal ""advice"" for my specific situation I thought I could ask others.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a fun-sapping soul-sucking addiction to cheating/hacking/modding games. For example, I recently purchased Stardew Valley  (maybe you've heard of it) and I played for a good amount of time  (14 hours) over the course of a week, but then I came to a point where I got extremely impatient, frustrated, and tired. I gave in to my feelings and within minutes I had already installed mods to cheat myself levels, abilities, items, ect.

This happens every time I play a new game. Old gamecube games, minecraft, skyrim, dark souls(1-3), kingdom come: deliverance, mount &amp; blade warband, call of duty games, and even shitty arcade games or flash games online.

It's so bad that I have even feverishly bought new games JUST to hack or cheat them.

It feels like because I know that I can easily cheat whenever and however I'd like, it becomes just a natural crutch that really cheats me from a true gaming experience in the end.

The only solution I've found is story-driven games because I'm more invested in watching the story unfold then actually seeing if I can break or cheat the game.

I've looked at many video game addiction studies, clicked many unrelated articles about addiction, and even read a Quora post asking about the ""psychology"" of cheating in video games, but it was not really an explanation I specifically related with. It talked about a ""winning at any cost"" mentality related to no limits in the household? and another suggestion that it may be caused by an abusive home? neither of these things really apply to me. I will link the post \[here\]([https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-psychology-behind-cheating-in-video-games](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-psychology-behind-cheating-in-video-games))

I just get a cheap thrill from cheating. I don't even care about ""winning"" most of the time. Just the instant satisfaction of seeing infinite expendable resources or flying through walls is just so gratifying.

What do I do?

16,"My mom has some sort of feud with me whenever my head hurts or when I get migraines, while is true that I often suffer from them, I try to not take a lot of Tylenol. But, today I was suffering from a painful headache and I couldn’t handle the pain, so I decided to take a Tylenol to help me with it. My mom went ballistic on me when she noticed that I took Tylenol for the pain, as she threatened to punch me in the head for taking Tylenol. I told her to leave me alone and there was no reason for her to act like that, for I was in deep pain. 

It’s rare for me to suffer from headaches and migraines, it’s usually whenever I have a lot of things going on or when the weather is unbearable. I also wear glasses and I had to upgrade the receipt, so I am also adapting my vision.  

Last time I nearly passed out from the pain and I couldn’t look for something to help me with the pain, I realized that, she hid the pills so I wouldn’t take them. She told me that it was for my own sake, but I cannot handle the pain. Also, I do not take Tylenol every single day just when my headaches are unbearable.

17,"So basically, I (M16) have a long distance friend (F15 or 16) who I've known for a couple years. We dated for, like, a month, but after we broke up we remained good friends. I like to think we're close. 

Basically, she was dating this guy and she was really in love with him. But after a bunch of drama, their parents found out they were dating and they banned the guy from talking to her, which devastated her. 

She was relying too much on him and now he's gone, and she's in shambles. 

She says that she's in a constant pain and almost never feels emotion anymore. She doesn't see the point of living and wants to end it all.

She has a history of self harm, and she was recently sent to the hospital on account of a suicide attempt. She considers suicide pretty much daily. 

She told her parents and her parents just say things like ""you'll get over it"" and shit. 

She refused to call the hotline. 

She cries often when we call. 

She had a breakdown today and almost committed suicide today. She said she was feeling better and happy, and she said she'd stay for me.

21,"To explain the title a little more;

I live in the Netherlands and all universities have this system which requires you to earn credits (so called study points) by successfully finishing a course (5 credits). I studied Computer Science and our academic school year was divided into 4 quarters, each quarter consisting of 3 courses. With my particular study we had to rake up at least 45 credits in order to be allowed to continue the study. The maximum amount of credits you could earn was 60 credits.  


So this is where the fun begins.  


I consider myself an introverted person that also enjoys socializing when I feel comfortable / am in the mood. Not gonna lie; alcohol makes me a better version of myself socially, but I don't drink regularly. Before the school year begins there's always a weekend intended for all 1st years with the intent to make people comfortable with the whole 'student life' and to make new friends. This weekend takes place about 150 km (95 miles) away from the university because the uni has an accommodation over there. First I doubted whether I was going to attend this weekend but eventually I really felt the urge of it because otherwise I would be 'that kid'. So there I went. I was quite anxious at first because I couldn't locate a friend of a friend (let's call him Carl) who said he was going to do the same study. We weren't allowed to have phones for 3 days but I told them I needed it for work and they bought it. My friend, Carl, yet to be located, had no phone because of this but eventually I found him and damn I was relieved. Luckily I knew at least someone, and Carl was already talking to 2 other dudes let's call them Ian and Sam, along with 2 girls that we'll call Julia and Emma. As the weekend went on I got to know them better and better and honestly they were (still are) such amazing guys, also another guy joined our 'group', let's call him David. First I was sceptical of David but after a while he seemed like a funny, slightly weird guy. Also we met a guy which seemed chill and he wasn't quite part of 'our group' but we still talked and hung with him regularly, let's call him 'Leo'. The friendship with the girls didn't come until the school year began. All in all I thought the weekend went amazing considering introvert me.  


Following this weekend there was a 5-day event where basically everyone from uni parties and drinks in the city. The whole city is turned upside down for this event. Long story short, I didn't want to go at first, then I changed my mind and wanted to go, but eventually decided not to. I basically don't drink and if I do it's a few beers, no liquor, also I get drunk very easily. Also, I am definitely not a going out to party type of person. I feel like I did miss out on it because all my friends mentioned above did attend the event, but I am also thinking how I would actually enjoy it because I'm not a party/alcohol guy.

&amp;#x200B;

Following this event is the start of the actual school year. I was motivated at first and had a really lazy attitude now I look back on it. Carl, Ian and Sam really were the only reason I made it as far as I got. I was too confident studying for my first 3 courses because I had foreknowledge on it and it resulted in me not studying at all / only a little. 3 Weeks in David quit and never heard of him again lol. I must've thought ""Wow, that's weak"" or something to quite in the third week. Still I thought I was going strong, finishing assignments successfully (basically the only work I did) and procrastinating studying for midterms and final exams. Guess what, didn't do any exams for the 1st course = FAIL, failed the 2nd, failed the 3rd because I had to get an assignment assessed on a day that I wouldn't be able to be present which resulted in me having just insufficient points to pass the course. 3 Failed courses, 3!  


2nd Quarter started and I now had the pressure of 6 courses. 3 courses for the 2nd quarters and retakes for the 1st quarter. (Yeah we were allowed to retake almost all exams). I told my friends I would be fine if I just did my best studying and would even beat one friend by passing all 3 1st quarter courses. During this time I thought I would be fine and therefore still had a lazy attitude, I did feel this but I didn't quite realize it I guess, this came much later. Fast forward a little, my friend Sam also quit. Not because it was too hard for him, quite the opposite with great grades, but because he didn't feel like studying yet. Fast forward to the end of Q2; I had 3 retakes and 3 finals.

**Retakes went as follows;** 1st course didn't study anything again because I thought I'd just let this one go because I had too much to study otherwise. 2nd Retake went even worse than the original even though I studied so hard and didn't study at all on the original. 3rd Course I failed on 1 question. If I would have answered 1 more question correctly I would've passed the course. 

**The Q2 finals went as follows;** 1st course I studied hard but failed because it was hard. 2nd Course I didn't study at all because I thought I didn't have enough time to study it with the other 5 courses which resulted in a fail. 3rd Course midterm I didn't do because I was too busy but other than that I was looking great. I had to retake the midterm in Q3 and guess what, I failed on just 1 incorrectly answered question.  


**That's 4 definite failed courses and 2 courses still having a chance to be passed.**  


At this points it went downhill really fast, not that I was not going downhill fast already. Q2 retakes in Q3 and Q3 courses brought with them the expected pressure and let's guess; the same as Q1 and Q2 happened. Failed course upon failed course. I did manage to pass 1 course in Q3 though. Now it really came to be that I was so dumb being this lazy and procrastinating. At the end of Q2 it already meant that I was not allowed to go into the 2nd year because I had failed 4 courses = maximum 40 credits (45 needed).  


But all this time I had been hiding something from everyone. Don't be shocked, because it isn't something to be shocked about. I discovered that I suffered from tinnitus 1 year earlier. Don't ask me why, but I've always thought this was normal. I'm not great at concentrating while reading and with this tinnitus it makes it even worse. I was stressed during the first weekend and basically all of Q1 through Q3 because of all of this pressure that was put on me. With this stress the tinnitus became worse and worse and I didn't look forward to reading a book or of off a screen because every minute I would be lost anyway. This was the main reason for all of the things mentioned above.  


If I would have quit before the 1st of February I would have been able to redo the 1st year. But all this time I thought I was able to save myself from the downfall, I was wrong. Eventually I contacted my academic counsellor and helped me guiding with what I could do and referred me to a physician. He would send me an e-mail with the referral right after we were done. It was the end of the week and the email didn't arrive so I thought that must've been it. I waited till after Monday and just kind of forgot about it because I was studying hard. So a week later I remembered and emailed him and he told me he had totally forgotten to send it. After receiving the email I went to work and contacted the physician and other people and basically a lot of things went wrong on their end.  


From my talk with the counsellor it became clear to me I didn't need to see my own doctor for this tinnitus and just had to go to the referred physician (doctor). Fault No. 1; I did need to go see my doctor. Fault No.2; they asked me for permission to request information from my own doctor regarding my tinnitus, I gave permission even though I hadn't seen my doctor for it. And they forgot I had given permission and emailed back to ask permission. Fault No. 3; I mentioned I hadn't seen my doctor yet because it wasn't needed as I understood. They asked my permission and fault number 2 happened. After that they just said that it was not possible because I had to go see my doctor first.  


This took me a whopping 2 weeks. 2 Weeks to find out two words; ""Not possible!"". Nearing the deadline (to request postponement in credits awardments) in 4 days I began to feel defeated, not only was my doctor full of appointments, the time it would take them to request permission and ask information and get a statement and finalize everything would take more than 4 days.  


So that's it, the end. Of my study. One month later I'm doing well, I took some breathing space and I'm realizing everything I've done wrong and thinking about what I'm gonna do about it and will be doing in the upcoming year.  I emailed my counsellor again to ask whether there was any possibility for me to restart the 1st year, but no, I had no possibility.  


Fun thing to mention; when family asked how it was going I answered it's going well and I'm doing good to soothe their worries and my uncertainties I guess, because I thought I'd still be able to make it. Right now only my uni friends know about this and my best friends. My parents still have no clue and it's been one month since uni ended. I keep saying I haven't gotten back my results yet. 2 Weeks ago I was gonna tell it to my mom because she is more understanding than my dad in this regard, but I didn't because I was little angry with her. The next day we sat outside and she asked how I was doing and asked about my results and that was honestly so relieving. I didn't have to tell her, she just asked questions. I made clear that I was not passing it, but I don't think she understood or believed because of my joking nature regarding things I'm not allowed to do.  
{*Example: my dad asks where I'm going at night and what I'm gonna do. I answer that I'm going to friends and smoke some weed and drink beers. I'm not allowed to this and didn't do it either, but I was just saying it to startle him and he would reply with something like ""Yeah okay, you go man! You go smoke and drink!"" because he knew I wouldn't do it. I've never smoked, but when I drank I just jokingly said I was wasted (I wasn't I just drank beer responsibly lol) and he thought I was joking as usual so he of course didn't believe me.} - Sorry if this it out of context*  


Right now, my mom knows but doesn't understand / realise what I told her. Also I'm feeling even worse for lying to my grandparents because they are and have always been supportive.  


I'm now stuck in a position where I don't know what to do. I'm quite literally not interested in anything other than Computer Science as a bachelor. I am fascinated by Astrology and such but I don't see myself studying that and working in that branche later and earning a living. I take too much pride in myself that I don't want to do 1 level lower than university which we call HBO (**not** the TV-service) to the degree that not studying at all seems better because otherwise I would be disappointed of myself for not having the highest degree / level. For reference, in high school I did the highest level + IB which is a big deal here.  


The one thing I really enjoy is working for my own, thinking of and carrying out projects. Even if they fail I have the experience and that is also quite rewarding I think. I aspire to be my own boss and earn a living doing what I like right now or as quick as possible, rather than spending at least 3 years for a bachelor in something I don't quite like or at another university.  


***-I forgot to mention that I didn't do anything during Q4 because I had no chance of passing and my only option was getting credit postponement a.k.a. redoing 1st year in 2 year and shift courses around.***  
\-***Also, contrary to reading, I was extremely concentrated when programming and genuinely enjoyed it so much which accounts for me passing 1 course and just failing another course due to 1 question.***  
\-***Next to that, when I had a slight reason to skip class I would just don't go at all for the whole day because I didn't feel like the travel time was worth it and I'd just do it at home.***  
\-***Lastly, during Q3 I only had to be present on Monday and sometimes on Friday. On the other days the lectures were just really inconveniently placed timewise and therefore I was only present on Monday and sometimes Friday. (We, except for this Monday/Friday in Q3, were never obligated to go to lectures so hence the skipping, which was done by a lot of people also)***

25,"Jobs? Suggestions? - Child of Narcissist Father (backstory in post)

I'm 22 have only had two other jobs besides working with my father, have learned a lot from him business wise but hard to think for myself as I can only thing for him. - My backstory is posted below.

I have never been praised or acknowledged by my father like he praises my older siblings and compares me to them, I only am given gratitude when i am making money. Business, work and constant endless favors or tasks is the relationship I have with my father, hes very successful and self employed,  we do not talk about me, my interests, girls, friends anything of my personal life he hasn't ever known and hasn't ever asked. I have never felt a true emotional connection with my father that I have always longed for and even pouring my heart to him about how our relationship is and how I want to make it better, I want to see him cry, I want to see some emotion out of him besides anger, but he's cold and holds its against me playing the victim as it is my fault. He talks to my sisters in ways we dont talk and being around him gives me constant all day anxiety as if i'm about to be scolded for doing something wrong since he only praises me when im making money. I don't do anything for myself that im growing in besides working out, that is what I do in my free time besides playing video games at night from 9-11 or watching podcasts if I have time or short moments with friends, the rest is all working for my dad. 

I feel like i could never be a normal kid, taking naps in the day, wanting to watch a movie and just relax at home and do nothing for a day, these are all the things i couldn't do as the moment he walks in the door i get bad anxiety jump up and do something different, if i'm not doing something productive he starts the abuse and it has made me become shameful of myself, i have very low-self esteem and always asking for permission on everything i do feeling constantly guilty because instead of having fun i should be "" making money"" This has taken a toll on my relationships with friends as they always ask me to go places and even though my dad would say yes to me going, he guilt trips me when i come back of how i have all this work to do and it never ends which has made me in turn become introverted by staying in instead of going out. I'm surrounded by all day anxiety towards him and have social anxiety because i restrict myself going out and already have anxiety as it is. Friends invited me places but i make excuses sadly ( a part of me tells me not to do it. ) 

Ever since finding out he was a narcissist a year ago it has made things a lot worse on my relationship with him and my mental health as im aware of how this routine and loophole i've been in has affected me mentally by reading on it, I give more effort and have a better work ethic than anyone he could ever hire. I'm smart, but I feel like im becoming a wasted talent. I make little money from my father but save what I can I have a little over $30,000 saved and want to use this money to get to a better mindset but leaving him is just as hard, and im scared, im lost, i'm scared of failing. I know he will always hold it against me. Money is not my ultimate fascination like my father, i don't know what it is but right now I want to feel free, I want to know myself, I want to be happy. 

What do I do?",20Jul2019,1
26,I'm currently going to be a sophomore student. I finished my first year of Online School two months ago and was thinking if I should go back to regular school now that I'm going to Sophmore. But I'm thinking about staying because of the Duel Enrollment that my Online School offers. My Online School is pretty much part of a local community college's charter school. And they allow me to enroll in actual classes for free (I just finished a class in humanities) as if I were a community college student. But is that worth not fully experiencing high school?,20Jul2019,1
27,"So I made this friend online about a year ago and we pretty much have spoken to each other all day everyday from the moment we met. Like we clicked immediately. Our conversations are fun and silly and full of laughter with some flirting mixed in here and there. I personally enjoy it a lot, which is weird considering I don’t really like texting all day. We text good morning, goodnight, talk about how each other’s day is going, give each other support and advice. Our personalities go together really really well in my opinion. 

However, I wonder if this behavior is odd? Like I’ve heard of people texting their friends here and there maybe every other day or a few times a week but not everyday. Again, I honestly love talking to him as I think he’s hilarious but I just worry if this behavior is healthy or not. I’m 22f and he’s 22m",20Jul2019,1
28,"Hi, I am a high schooler who is currently on summer break. Many people say I should be having fun and enjoying my summer, but that has not been happening. Others, like my parents, say that I should be working hard as possible to be as competitive as possible in the job market. However, I have been having mixed feelings this summer for several reasons. Because I am away from home, I get to have as much fun as I want. However, whenever I try to relax and enjoy life I feel like because I am not doing anything to advance my future I am wasting my time. I have already done several things to improve my resume this summer, but I still feel guilty that I am not working as hard as I should. My parents have always made sure I was challenged in school and had many extracurriculars, but I feel they have put too much pressure on me and I'm not sure how to deal with my workload.

  
When I take a break, I feel guilty for not working at that moment.    
When I work, I lose productivity and focus quickly, which leads to me to taking a break. 

  
This cycle has been wearing me down and I just don't know how to deal with it. And if my feelings are normal or not. It prevents me from being productive AND enjoying my time off.  Please help me with this.",20Jul2019,1
29,"Background/Context: I’m a 17 year old guy going into my last year of high school. My home life is horrible and causes me anxiety. I have somewhere to go if I abandon everything and move elsewhere. I have a grand in savings.

My issues: I’m turning 18 in two months, which is the legal age of majority in the US. I’ve been trying to plan a way out for years, due to my parents refusing to change their emotionally abusive and gaslighting ways. I’m already a year behind in school, meaning I’d have to double up on every subject next year (taking half in school and the other half online) if I want to graduate in 2020. I have been told repeatedly that I need to get a job when I’m 18 in conjunction to my schooling.

The question: What should I do? I bounce between;
- Abandoning my life and starting over without telling anyone,
- Staying with my family and finishing school, then moving out and telling a select few, AND
- Staying home, finishing school, then working for three years until I have [more] money of my own
I have two months to figure this out. I’ve been stalling long enough. I can’t continue to live as though I have a bomb on my shoulders. I need to figure this out before my parents figure out that I want to move out this bad.

If you can offer me advice on what to do I’d be eternally grateful.",20Jul2019,1
30,"Someone tried to break into our home in the middle of the night five years ago, and it took me a long time to get over it.  We called the police, who showed up 30 minutes after our call, and the only reason nothing happened is because our alarm system went off and probably scared them. We even noticed they had gotten into our car and definitely went through some merchandise we wanted to return. The police didn’t even believe us despite us showing him and despite the fact that the alarm clearly indicated someone was trying to get in (we noticed the door they likely got into had been unlocked from the outside).  

I think someone is trying again now. Last night around 1AM I heard some noise but I wrote it off thinking I’m probably paranoid from last time. But today I happened to go outside, and noticed that the entire bolt/lock on our door had been physically moved, and that there was a space between the actual bolt and where it was supposed to fall (I hope this makes sense—like imagine the circle where your lock is supposed to be, then imagine someone moved it so it’s part hollow). Explains the noise well. I haven’t noticed anyone outside or casing or home.

I’m just so frustrated because we live in a nicer neighborhood and the police are useless/don’t care, I think in part because they don’t think it could/would happen to us. Even though it already has and I’m afraid it will again.",20Jul2019,3
31,"I'm going to post the whole thing, but if you've already read my other posts you can skip to after the first tldr. 

I'll try to make this as short as possible, but I'll have to provide a little background. I dated the same guy (23M) throughout middle school and high school and eventually married him, but after getting married he never worked or helped out around the house. When I would ask him to he would punch the walls or punch me. I begged him to work time and time again, but he never would, so I eventually decided to become a stripper in order to make enough to support us. Romantically, my life sucked, but I did love stripping. I loved the feeling of empowerment it gave me. Some strippers get caught up in the lifestyle, but I was using it to save up enough money to move to LA. My dream is to be an actor, so I began taking acting classes and going to auditions. My plan was to build my resume for around a year while I saved money. My job worked great with that because it allowed me to make around $2000 each weekend. Sometimes more. I could also choose my own schedule and even just not come in at all for a week or two if I didn't want to. 

At the club, I met this guy (19M) who kept coming back in to get dances from me and only me. I led him on hardcore, that's what I was supposed to do.. but he kept coming in every time I worked and I could tell he was actually trying to peruse me. I liked him, but I was married. I decided to meet him outside of the club, tell him the truth about everything, and give some of his money back. Things didn't go as planned. We started drinking and I told him everything about my life with my husband. We had one of the best nights of my life just talking and getting to know each other. We continued to be friends for a few weeks until eventually I left my husband for him. This happened around four months ago.

At first he told me that he was fine with me continuing my job as a stripper for a few years and that he wanted me to follow my dreams and move to LA. We had so much fun laughing together and he did so much for me. He bought ne anything I needed, took me anywhere I needed to go, he did everything for me. I did see that he was a little jealous though, and he wanted to be very serious very fast. I was living with him within the first two weeks. 

Every time I would come home from work it would start a fight and he would ask how many dances I sold and stuff. I understood that, so I quit my job and began working as a waitress out of respect to him. I lost a lot of money, but love was worth it. That wasn't all he did though. He also kept my Facebook logged in on his phone, he would go through my phone all the time..not just the messages, but my search history and YouTube history as well. He would even look through my old stripper accounts while showering and make himself sad. He started out making little jokes every now and again about my outfits, but then he got to the point to where he would yell at me for wearing a crop top and get upset over almost every little thing I wore. Even just a sleeveless shirt. I see girls who wear what they want and do what they want as empowered, but he does not. He even once said he doesn't understand why someone would want to be with Selena Gomez because she ""shows off her body too much."" SHE'S ONE OF THE MOST MOFEST CELEBRITIES. Be bas mentioned having problems with me continuing acting because of love scenes and kissing scenes as well. He also said that he does not want to ever move to LA, so I went along with it and said we didn't have to. On top of all of this, I've just felt isolated from the world. Every time I try to go out he asks where I am every few minutes and will not stop texting me.

It's also worth nothing that I've always been an activist and very into social issues, but he is not. He does not believe they concern him. I am also very emotional and have horrible anxiety, but he doesn't u understand that. He also expects me to get a better job, but still do his laundry, clean the house, and cook sometimes. I've never been a housewife though. That's never been what I wanted to be. 

I finally told him that either his mindset on my outfit changes or I'm out. At first he said I could wear what I want around him, but to cover up more when he isn't around. I was okay with this at first, but then I wasn't. I told him he needs to stop thinking everything I wear is ""too revealing."" I almost left.. I tried telling him in person but he wouldn't listen, so I packed my bags, lied and said I was going to sleep, and left, but he found out my car was gone from his friend and called and asked where I was. He said to just stay until the morning. I did, and we talked things over and he promised to do better and try to make things good. 

Things were better, he said he only asked that I do not strip, have guy friends without him being there, or show my boobs or butt. That was fine, I suppose. So then I tried to make plans with a friend from work and he asked a million questions, like where she lived, what we would be doing, if I trusted her, if she had a husband or boyfriend who would be there.. all kinds of stuff. Then that night we started talking and he said something along the lines of ""I'm not trying to be mean, but I just feel like I keep compromising so much for you and you aren't doing anything in return. I'm trying so hard to just be okay with everything that you wear and stuff, but you just aren't giving anything in return or trying to compromise at all.."" I asked what he wanted and he said I could stop wearing crop tops all the time..but I had only worn them three times that week and all of my crop tops show about two inches or less of stomach. I wore them with jeans that week too. I asked how he'd feel about me posting a bikini picture and he said ""if you want.. don't expect me to comment though. Whatever.""

I decided that our differences might be too much and left again yesterday. He kept blowing up my phone begging me for another chance. I told him i just needed some time and i was going to my mom's house three hours away. I guess my snapchat location said i was somewhere else, so he got upset about that. I really was where i said though. He called me saying that he was sorry and he explained that I have helped him become a better person and that he was slowly changing for me. He said that sometimes he acts like he cares about things more than he actually does (like bikini pictures and outfits) because he doesn't want me to think he just doesn't care like my ex husband didn't. He said that I'm his world and he never wants to lose me. He's saying that he wants to show me off and wants other people to think I'm beautiful and he wants me to shine. Ge even said ge secretly wants to move to LA, but he's scared to leave the state because cha ge scares him, but that he will do it and enjoy it with me. This is all stuff I've told him I wish he wanted before though, so a part of me is afraid he is saying anything to get me back. He made a bunch of posts about me on social media too. Just sweet things. He said that he has been afraid to open up to me but now he wants to and he wants me to live my dream. I asked for space but he blows up my phone every few hours saying that he can't stop talking to me. 

What should I do? I do love him and I know leaving him would break his little heart, but sometimes I'm afraid we just aren't meant to be. That we're too different. He has done so much for me though and he says he will never stop fighting for me. He said if I'm not home today he's driving here and proposing.

Tldr; I am in love with someone I find too controlling, but I'm afraid I'm over reacting. He says all the right things now that I've decided to leave. Please help?


I blocked him on everything and told him we needed to be apart, but then he drove three hours to my mom's house just to say goodbye and bring me the rest of my stuff. He was crying and he said that I make him a better person and I make him see things in a different light. He says he wants me to shine and he wants to help me follow my dreams, he just asked that I don't strip in order to do that. I ended up going back with him because despite everything seeing him was the first time I had smiled since I left. He makes me so happy when everything is good. I'm still unsure though. He keeps going above and beyond to do everything for me right now and he keeps asking me to promise I'll never leave again. I can't yet. I'm still afraid he's only saying all of this because he wants me back. He swears he isn't and that he was only pretending to care too much about small things so that I wouldn't think he didnt care and leave. His mom even told me that she believes he wants a girl next door type and we aren't compatible though. He says she has no clue what he wants and that he wants me and who I truly am. He wants to get engaged. I haven't even unpacked my stuff yet because I'm so unsure.  

He says we can save for LA without me stripping, but it feels impossible. He also wants me to work a 40 hour a week job and go to.school 20 hours a week. It's going to be impossible for me to do both of those and act and make YouTube videos as well. Stripping provides me with a way to do all of the other three, plus save up money easily. I would hate to give up love for money though.  

Today I wore a crop top, Jeans, and a choker and he kept saying things like ""well, that's fine. I'm not worried.. if anyone flirts you'll just turn them down, right?"" And at one point he asked why I was wearing a choker, I replied that it's cute, and he just said ""...okay. nothing wrong with a choker, I guess.""

Other than that he's being so, so sweet and perfect. But I still just don't think I can reach my goals with him. 

Please help. 

Tldr: I went back to him because we put in so much effort to get me back and he makes me happy, but I'm still unsure if he truly means what he's saying.",20Jul2019,1

42,"I'm entering a new era of my life where I'm pushing out of my comfort zone more and doing things without worrying what people think. I consider myself a decent singer. I mess up sometimes, and I'm ambitious with my range pretty often (can't hit high notes), but even if I wasn't very good, I don't want to care what people think of my singing if they hear me. Deep down I don't really think I do care. But whenever I get the urge to sing in a scenario where someone would be able to hear me clearly, I just can't do it. If someone asks me to sing for them, it's even worse. I get paralyzed, flushed, and I just can't do it. 

I do occasionally break through this barrier. I sing in my car with my window open, or when I'm riding my back. I know pedestrians and people with their windows also open will hear me, but sometimes I can cognitively tell myself I probably won't see them again, so I can sing. I sing around my very close friends, but usually ironically, and often purposefully bad so it's just a joke and they can't possibly pass judgement on my skill. 

So I know it's not about breaking the dam and just doing it once to make it easy to do it forever. I've gotten this advice before, and I know it hasn't worked for me. I've also started slow, like I can sing twinkle twinkle, jingle bells, happy birthday, the alphabet song, I'm a little teacup. But I can't sing my favorite songs around anyone who can hear. I really want to break past this.",20Jul2019,3

Hi, looking to get a dog. I have a fear of big dogs so thinking a smaller breed like yorkie, pomeranian, maltese, etc. I'm thinking of a pomeranian and I will be owning an apartment soon. Also, I would prefer to adopt a dog and ideally older than 2 years.

My reason for getting a dog is because I'm depressed and hate life and looking to have a dog that I can take care of and who in turn could be my best (and only) friend. I am willing to take care of the dog, train it, and spend time as much as necessary outside of work - don't have friends so time isn't a problem. This would also help me get out of the house as I now have a reason to (i.e. take the dog on a walk). I also have the financial resources to take care of the dog. I will be away Mondays - Fridays for work for about 10 hours.

Don't have a girlfriend and too ugly/short to go on dates or get a girlfriend in the future so this won't be a factor.

What dog do you think is right for me? Is there anything else I should know or you want to ask me? Thanks for taking the time.",20Jul2019,1

I give him rides to and from work. This isn’t the problem. What is the problem is that he works 3rd shift so that means he goes in at night and gets out early in the morning (5-5:30 am) and when we are together it’s only for a few hours. Despite that, he proceeds to be drinking the whole time. I’m not a drinker but i do smoke and he doesn’t smoke but drinks everyday. He drinks at 6 am until he goes to sleep around 12-1 pm. The problem is he has a very short temper and throughout the time we’ve spent i’ve witnessed him speed up while driving in my car in a fit of road rage to curse out anyone who even looks at him too long, threaten a man because he was too close to him, curse out his union rep. for a decision they made he didn’t agree with, and say he wants to hurt his ex girlfriends new boyfriend that she cheated on him with. Just the other day he got so drunk he didn’t remember what he had done. That day he drove onto someone’s curb, dropped sodas we had in my car, drove over the speed limit, (55 in a 25 zone) tried to make me give him oral sex and when i did he proceeded to fall asleep and get upset when i stopped, tell me off for not
letting him drink more or drive. he doesn’t remember a thing he did at all. On top of all that he doesn’t give me gas money, he doesn’t even mention us going out ever to get even breakfast, and he has shown many more red flags.

I plan to fly internationally, potentially in excess of 30hrs, to my next step in life and I just don't feel right putting an animal through that. I've looked into it, and with where I'm planning on going I can't take any potential pets into a plane cabin with me, they'll have to fly cargo.

53,"To start off, sometimes I lack social skills and I struggle with panic attacks. Here's a bit of how I felt about the situation, and just straight up what happened and what I did wrong. From the beginning of the year, my college roommate and I would talk a little bit and stuff, but as the 1st semester went on, she was really quiet. I will say she was out of the room more than me (she had a job), but when she was in the room, she never talked to me first. (Though in the summer she did say she was an introvert before school started). I would sometimes try to be friendly like offering her cookies. She would say, ""No, I'm good."" I just got bad vibes from her. She didn't smile enough, and when she did, it looked fake. Then, mid-semester, she started doing things that bothered me, such as changing menstrual pads in the dorm room (our beds are lofted, so I never saw her do it, but I could hear the wrapper and I know she threw them in the trash. She at least wrapped them, but still), leaving her desk light on way too late/early, not taking out the trash as much as me, and leaving her laundry basket in the way. Eventually, we had bed bugs. I asked her if we were going to get reimbursed for this, and she looked uncomfortable and didn't say anything. Then I was like, ""You don't know, do you?"" She said, ""Yeah, sorry Idk."" She was super grumpy the day we bagged our stuff (due to the bugs) and slammed the door. She also glared at me a few times.

Honestly, I just decided to tell the RA it wasn't a friendly environment, I was scared my roommate would judge me and I didn't feel safe. The RA talked to my roommate and we eventually had a meeting together. My roommate was super irritated because I didn't talk to her first about the issues I had and she didn't believe I was intimidated by her. She said that personal issues should be discussed with the roommate first, because that's what ""mature adults do.""

Her: ""Why did you say I made you feel unsafe???""

Me"" ""Because you glared at me, slammed the door and stomped! Wouldn't you be scared?""

Her: ""......What? IDK.""

Her: ""...but it's not like I threatened you or anything. Saying you don't feel safe is a very bold claim to make. I don't believe you're scared of me.""

I responded, ""That's because I told my parents about this, and they told me not to act scared so I don't give you power.""

When the RA asked about hygiene during the roommate agreement, I said, ""Sanitary napkins should be changed in the bathroom, and I looked this up-body fluids spread disease and pests and that also makes me feel unsafe."" The RA asked my roommate if that was okay with her and she just nodded. By the end of our meeting, she signed the agreement and burst out of the room crying...That night she packed a small bag and slept somewhere else.. We didn't talk for the rest of this semester, but she did follow the roommate agreement. During Christmas break, she sent me a text saying she didn't appreciate my going behind her back and that she didn't think it was fair to blame me for the unfriendly environment, because she tried to be friendly, too. She said I was condescending towards me sometimes, and that she wasn't very talkative in the room because she's super tired from work all the time. She said she'll follow the roommate agreement, but she doesn't want any drama next semester. I didn't respond.

At the beginning of 2nd semester, she apologized for making me feel uncomfortable and brought me oreos. I agreed that we didn't need anymore tension in the room, and then everything was fine. However, my guy friend started talking to her even after I told him the weird stuff she did. One day he invited her to go to the mall with us when it was just supposed to be us 2 (She hesitated and he was like, ""maybe another time?"" She said, ""Yeah!""). I was worried she would talk behind my back, which is why I asked him individually why he wanted to be friends with her. Then, one day she suggested we get dinner once a week to just talk and make sure we touch base. I agreed, we set up a date- Monday after 4pm. On the day we planned, that Monday after 4, she asked what time I usually eat dinner. I was like, ""It depends."" She didn't mention it again and we just stopped talking the rest of the semester.

Eventually, my college roommate sent me another long text at the end of the year, confronting me for everything I said to her. She basically said I had a condescending attitude, that I was judgmental, and I didn't belong in the psychology field (my major) because I judge people for not being ""happy enough"".

For example, one time (in person) she said, ""I'm not trying to avoid the room or anything, I'm just not here most of the time because I've been working a lot.""

I said, ""Oh, I don't have a job because my parents have good jobs, and I got lots of scholarships because I'm smart, or at least that's what people say.""

She also was talking casually about how she hoped her skin didn't look too oily.

I was like, ""let me see.""

She says, ""uhh no....""

I was like, don't worry I won't judge."" I got up in her face and looked at her skin and said, ""Oh, you just have large pores. I have small ones.""

She also showed me her theatre headshots a different day, because she wanted her top 10 chosen for the photographer to edit.

I said, ""To edit this, I would take out the red part on your forehead, and then sculpt your cheekbones, but idk what the acting industry likes"".

She also asked me one time if the school's internet was working for me, because it wasn't for her. I responded, ""Yes, I have unlimited data on my phone.""

She also mentioned that I was rude for offering her one of my dresses for one of her auditions. I asked what she was wearing and she said, ""one of those dresses."" I looked at her clothes and then offered her one of my dresses, which she rejected. (This was during 1st semester, before the RA meeting)

Then, at the beginning of the year during welcome week, she showed me a craft she made at an event and asked me if I made one. I responded, ""No, I'm not really into material things. I'm more into making memories.""

There was also a time she auditioned for something in August during fall semester. I asked her how it went and she said she was really nervous but she was happy to get it over with. I said, ""I mean, you're not an A class actor, but for what you're trying to do, it was pretty good. You didn't need to worry."" She also said she was aware I talked behind her back to my guy friend. Those were just a few things she confronted me about in her text.",20Jul2019,1
54,"Hello, I am currently in high school and I was just wondering if it is a common occurrence to have thoughts of killing oneself or even having dreams of endings one's life at some point in an average person's life.  This has been going on since 8th grade and I've been ignoring it since, but recently it has become more consistent.  Although I have began to pick up some hobbies to help keep my mind off of it and even a job, it still happens even feeling as if I have no place among my friends and will go on weeks or months avoiding contact with them even though they ask to hangout. Recently I went to another friends house, but found myself unable to keep up even a proper conversation past  15 seconds and my responses failed to stray further from the occasional ""awkward laugh,ok, alright, and nice"" and the whole time I had trouble breathing normally, in fear that it would appear that I was breathing too hard as well as trying to hide my hands to not reveal them shaking, afterwards I felt that had done nothing, but wasted their time. I have had some realization throughout the past years that I'm probably not and probably won't be as good as I wish I was and will either fail or just do mediocre which I have accepted, although I am trying to currently better myself through grades going from a 2.0 gpa freshmen year to a 3.6  and joining a sport which is good and all, but I still feel like its all for nothing for some reasons. I just feel like a waste of space sometimes and it might be due to other things, besides my lack of conversation skills and my ability to not be able to relate to a lot of things with my friends, such as finding out my dad cheated on my mom and witnessing the verbal abuse between them at a young age, or the guilt of my half brother's death due to feeling alone and not having a father because his father was too busy taking care of me in which I shouldn't have been born because I was an accident as well but I honestly don't know what to think and I might be over dramatic as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just wondering if this was a common among other people as well and if so how do/did you deal with it?",20Jul2019,1
55,"The title is a bit triggering but it isn't as bad as it looks.

 Well, I don't think I've ever told anything as personal as this pn reddit but here I go. I'm a male, 21 years old and was dating a friend also male, 20 years old. We were together as a couple for four months, he had never had sex with a guy before or even dated one, despite casually making out with some dudes. We always wanted to had sex but never got the timing right. One night, we go out for drinks and I have a little bit more than usual, he does too but not as much. As we were getting ready to go home (each for their own), he invites me to go to his place. I drunkly agree with it and from that point on, my memory was a blur. I don't remember going to his home or getting there, how do I undressed myself or how do I got dressed back before sleep. 

I have a troubled relationship with having sex while drunk, some really dark experiences on my life came out from it and I had come to conclusion that this shouldn't happen anymore. I stay true to a promisse I made and for four years (Yes, I did underage drinking) I didn't had sex while drunk but I just trusted him enough to not to worry about him hurting me or not using a condom. I wasn't unconcious and I do remember some flashs were I was making love with him. 

The next day come up, this was a couple months ago, and I don't remember almost anything from the time I said yes to the time I woke up the next day. So, as I was trying to convince myself that this time around it was different because it happened with someone I trust that was also drunk (But with memory of what happened) he says ""I always do the wrong thing when I'm drunk, last night I was really drunk"" and it happened, like, in the very same second the sentence ended I felt so shitty and like I was just wrong. I spoke out and asked ""So, am I a wrong thing for you?"" He apologizes and says he regrets saying that. We broke up that day but since we had a friendship before actually dating, we remained friends.

The problem is, I can't trust him anymore, It wasn't his fault, we both were in the wrong in this scenario but still I just can't trust him anymore and it fucking kills me that I can't. I don't know what to do or how to feel about being close to him anymore, I'm not afraid of him hurting me or that happening again and it was consensual and never felt forced but I can't look at him in the same way and now I feel like I'm a broken person.",20Jul2019,3
57,"My parents are in their late 60s/early 70s and aren’t exactly in great health. As a family we’ve always taken in stray cats when my siblings and I were younger, but about a year ago my parents took in a stray pregnant cat and apparently they did a really terrible job of getting the kittens fixed because the number of cats in the house has *exploded* exponentially from the original momma cat. I’ve lost track of the number but it’s definitely into the 30s. 

The cats have completely taken over the house. They’ve destroyed the floors because they relieve themselves everywhere and they’ve torn up the furniture and broken a lot of other items. A friend of the family mentioned to us that you can smell the cat-stink from outside the house. We always had multiple cats (like 5 or 6 max) but it’s never been like this. My father’s health is clearly affected by the filthy house and I’m sure his stress levels are killing him just as quickly. They’re also spending a fortune on vet bills because they’re actually trying to keep the cats healthy. 

I have siblings, but none of us live in the same town as my parents and half of us don’t even live in the same state. We know we have to do something but we don’t really know where to start. It’s *very* important to us (and my parents, I’m sure) to avoid just having all the cats euthanized. We’re about to reach out to the local animal shelter for advice as well as possibly hiring a housekeeper to mitigate the situation with the house, but I’ve seen enough episodes of Hoarders to know that we are going to run into some emotional roadblocks with my parents. 

I guess I’m just looking to connect with people who have been in similar situations. Reddit, do you have any advice for me going forward on how to deal with all of this?",20Jul2019,1
58,"Around 6 months ago I walked out of my job that I had been at for a few years because of absolutely horrible new management. I went a few months looking for a job anywhere I could and had no luck until a friend of a friend offered me one about 2 weeks ago. Ever since I started it has kind of been a train wreck. I am having to work 2 different departments (making food and working the floor) at the same time and I am not really being trained at all on top of having to work 10+ hour days almost everyday. I am constantly pulled from one section to the other to the point where I can't even do the stuff I need to get done and then get sort of fussed at for either not having everything done for the next day or not doing it right. 

I'm getting pretty stressed over it and part of me feels like I'm going to be let go very soon because I'm not able to keep up with it all so I'm not sure what to do. Any advice? I really don't want to go back to job searching while unemployed because that might have been the worst thing I have ever experienced in my life.",20Jul2019,1
59,"Before I get into the main part of this post, I want to give a little bit of background. I’ll try to make it as short as possible but as you can see from the title, this is my second attempt at college. The first time I went to university, the stress was too much and I developed really bad mental health issues, which caused me to get terrible grades/GPA and basically “forced” me to leave. This isn’t something that I’ve told many people (only my family and a couple close online friends know what happened). I know I made a big mistake and wasted money, and I’m not proud of it. This was just to give background on my situation, so please don’t dwell on this part of the post too much.

Anyway, I’m having a second attempt at going to college. After what happened the first time, I took a break from secondary education to try to figure out what I wanted to do. I’m 20 now, and I recently decided to go to a community college (I think?) that has multiple different locations throughout my state. I also believe that it’s a Tech school, so it doesn’t have as many choices in terms of majors and also focuses more on Technology-based and science-y majors; e.g. stuff like Nanotechnology, Cyber Security, Accounting, etc. This college is also a 2-year college that you can start at and then transfer somewhere else.

I might be able to get into a normal university again and have a wider range of options, but there are none in my town and I don’t think that there are any that are very close by. I don’t want to go far away again and go to school away from my family and everyone else that I know because that was part of the problem the first time. So I don’t have as many choices as I would at a normal university. 

I’m not exactly interested in the Technology majors that much. I’m not a fan of math-related stuff and technology stuff in general, so it’s not for me. I thought about doing Cyber Security, but I don’t want to have to be sitting in front of a computer screen all day for my job. The science majors like Biology and stuff aren’t bad, but I can’t see myself doing something like that. In fact, I struggled with trying to figure out what I was even interested in and what kind of major I wanted to go into. 

That was until...I looked into the Liberal Arts/Humanities majors. Now I know what you’re thinking...a Liberal Arts major is pretty much worthless and won’t really get me anywhere. And I know that. But trying to figure out what I wanted to do, plus the fear of choosing the wrong thing, was stressing me out so badly that it was almost reducing me to the point of tears. I really, really like the stuff involved with Humanities/Liberal arts (foreign language, art, history, literature, etc.). This is the stuff that I liked in high school, and these were the classes that I was actually able to enjoy when I was going to the first university. Again, my options are kind of more limited this time and I’ve already been accepted so I don’t really want to change my mind on which school to go to right now.

So...what should I do? Is a Liberal Arts/Humanities major actually worthless or is there something that I can actually do with it if I’m really interested? I also thought about doing a Psychology major and kind of...doing the other stuff that I listed as “hobbies”? Psychology is pretty interesting to me but I’m on the fence about it. And thank you to those who read the entire thing because I know it’s really long; sorry about that.",20Jul2019,5

61,"So I usually go to this store, and there has been incidents with this bigger guy. At first I talked to him because he seemed nice and friendly. No big deal just talking and smiling. Then one day I go up to buy some food, and he tells me, it's free with a smile. And I'm think nothing of it and I am really grateful because that day, my account had literally $4 which was not enough for the full meal... I was planning on searching for coins in my bag. So I accept thinking it was God who intervened that day because I would not have had enough to buy the food otherwise. So I go in there another day he is very ""kind"" to me and compliments me.. again I think nothing of it.. I am just happy to have friendly customer service. Then. One day I go up to him. And he immediately tells me the food is free almost pushy, and I wasn't prepared and  so taken aback so although I was pissed that he insisted for him to give me it free when I wasn't asking for any favors and had money that day.. I just walked away and that is when I started realizing something was wrong.

From then on I told him not to give me anything free that I could pay. And he STILL insisted but with a weird (falling in love loser smile) like he talked to me like he knew me. Instead of showing respect and professionalism. Am I right? Do you know what I am talking about when you have professionally friendliness, and just weird creappy falling in love delusional friendliness?

Anyway.. is there something I can do to hold this guy responsible for his creepy behavior? If anything at least for giving me free food for more than 7 occurrences?",20Jul2019,0

63,"I already posted this somewhere else but no response so I’m just copying and pasting:

Even though my childhood wasn't great, my parents did their absolute best to be good parents to my brother and me. There was never any hitting in the house or anything like that. I had an especially close relationship with my dad, he made it a point to do all the dad stuff: teach me to ride a bike and things like that. 

That said, things were pretty crazy. My dad had done a lot of illegal things back when he was my age, that he learned from his dad who robbed liquor stores and hustled pool halls, and he never really shook his old gangster habits. Just one example: when he was in his 40's some jagoff hit his niece (my cousin) so he and my uncle tracked him down and pistol whipped him. Incidents like that notwithstanding, he went (mostly) straight after my brother and I were born, but he was a felon and my mom had dropped out of high school, so the job prospects and income for them were both thin. A lot of his old gangster friends hung around our apartment. 

When I was a pre-teen the family moved across the country and he stumbled into a job that made a crap ton of money despite his record and his lack of education. Problem is he, like many of the newly rich, spent all of his money and was completely wiped out in the Recession. I was in high school at the time. Overnight, he just changed. His confidence was gone. He lost all his motivation. He quit his job, even though he was still making 6 figures, and declared bankruptcy. We lost everything, and now my mom had to support us all on her income. 

When I graduated high school, I stayed in the new city for college. He and the rest of the family went back to the old city, where he met up with all of his old friends. Pretty soon my 40-something dad was selling pot and heroin with his old buddies. He ended up getting caught bringing things across state lines, and went to prison my sophomore year of college. He's been out for several years now, and did a few more shady things, but now he does nothing. That old high paying job is still there for him. Instead he sits at home watching tv and coming up with get rich quick ideas, forcing my mom to support both of them, as well as my brother who still lives at home. He has made no effort to find any kind of employment since getting out. Of course we want him to go the legal route, but he hasn't even gone the illegal route! He's gone no route. My mom is constantly stressed over this and calls me crying constantly. Any time any of us bring up any kind of employment my dad first responds with anger and then cries at ""what a failure his life has been."" He also refuses any kind of professional help. 

Luckily I've been pretty successful. I've tried giving my mom money but she refused to take it. Instead, I venmo it to my brother who withdraws the cash and slips in money here and there. 

I was always pretty sympathetic to my dad. I owe him a lot for how I turned out and all the efforts he made. But lately I've just been so angry with him for putting my family through this. Especially my mom. His absolute refusal to do anything to change the position, and instead acceptance at putting my family in serious financial jeopardy when a real solution is just staring him in the face. 

I visited for a week last month, and was blown away by the fact that day in and day out he just sat watching TV and getting angry anytime my mom complained about money. The real problem, he says, is that they spend too much money, and poor kids in Africa could live for years on my moms $17 an hour job and whatever. He keeps trying to get her to buy rice in bulk because a full days serving of rice is like $1. Rice for breakfast, lunch, and dinner until I make enough money to support all of them. 

There's one other thing. Like I said, he and I were always very close. I got an enormous scholarship to one of the best colleges in the country, so I decided to stay in Boston where it was at while everyone else moved back. My mom has said he instantly got worse without me there. That he always cries every time I come up, because he can't stand that I'm gone. He's begged me to move closer to them dozens of times, but I just can't. I have a very successful career and personal life here, and a fiance who is going to graduate school here in January. And it really hurts that he wants me to abandon it for a city I don't even like. But I really have to wonder if my family would've been better off had I just stayed there.

**TL;DR** My dad did shady stuff in his 20's, not-shady stuff in his 30's, shady stuff in his 40's, and now no stuff in his 50's. He refuses to work or even do anything, and is putting my mom and the rest of my family through emotional and financial hell because of it, and I've been trying to pick up the slack because I've managed to be moderately successful.",20Jul2019,1
64,"I started a job working on a concrete floor 8 hrs a day, five days a week and I'm having problems. It's been like four or five months and my feet hurt to some degree everyday. I've swapped shoes and insoles and been to a couple of doctors. They basically told me to take pain meds.

We’ve taken about 4 breaks through out the relationship and it’s to the point where I’m done with her and I don’t want to continue this relationship. It’s not healthy, it’s toxic, and I can’t stand it. The problem with this is that every time I try and leave, she starts telling me she’ll take her own life or she’ll hurt herself. Even though I don’t want to continue an intimate relationship with her, I still care about her and hearing about her death would break my heart, especially because the cause would be me.

My friend told me that her threatening to take her life is a form of her abusing me, and she said that even if my girlfriend is actually depressed and is at risk at taking her own life that she’s wrong for using it against me and using it as an advantage, which I agree on because i’m really stuck here. 

Another problem is that she’s overly controlling. We’re on a break right now, and she said she wanted to get back together with me. I talked with her about it and she told me she wanted to make sure I wasn’t talking with anyone else before we get back together, which makes sense right? Well the problem with that is she demanded I hand over my social media passwords and allow her to log into them and go through them. I said yes because if I didn’t she’d start talking about how she would harm herself and everything. 

I don’t want this relationship anymore. I need to get out of it but she just won’t let me. If I weren’t afraid of her actually doing something to herself then I would have left a while ago but I feel like i’m trapped. I need to get out of this.

70,"Tl;dr at end.
I'm gonna start this with some back story. My boyfriend and I have known each other for several years, but we've only been dating for a year. When we started dating I was a tinder girl, like sleep with anyone who'd buy me dinner type of bs. I wasn't in a good place. I unknowingly gave him chlamydia, but I lied to my doc and got an extra dose of antibiotics for him because he didn't have health insurance. I still feel guilty abt that. So we started dating and things got weird. He goes thru my phone routinely, had me stop talking to some people, including my family. We moved in together. He'll call me useless, brain dead etc. He doesn't let me go out by myself, to the gym, grocery store, coffee, for a walk, nothing.  He says he doesn't trust people and doesn't want me to get hurt. He was abused growing up. He has nightmares every night about his dad. I can see the hypervigilance, and PTSD because of his past, but it doesnt excuse his current behavior. This controlling behavior seems to stem from his own traumas, not from malicious intent. This is something I've been struggling with, I can't decide what I should do. Of course I love him dearly, we were homeless together for a number of months, and now that we have a place I work 2 jobs and go to school full time. He doesnt work, doesnt have a liscense (hes 30) doesnt clean up after himself and does stuff I would imagine a 7 year old doing. Like putting dirty dishes in the bathtub instead of washing them. I feel like I mother him a lot despite him being several years older than me. He also has a ridiculous weed habit. If I dont buy his stuff for him he'll just take my card and car after I go to sleep and overdraw my account to buy what he wants. He calls me immature, childish, and a 3 year old when I call him out on any of this. I dont know what to do.  He seems to think it's okay to force me to have sex with him, whether he literally over powers me or just begs and pesters til I give in. I've tried talking to him about it, but ofc it's my fault (sarcasm). Do I kick him out or not? It's also difficult bc the apartment is in my name alone, so I would have to kick him out, rather than just leaving.

71," I posted this on r/ApplyingToCollege but i didn't really get any replies, I just need some advice on what to do now, a pert of me just wants to give up and go back home, but i don't want to have the time i spent be wasted.

So a little backstory is I moved away from home last year in order to go to a college in a different state, I just went to a community college so I can get my core credits done cheaper and this school offers a program to directly go to the university I wanted to go to. So I worked for a year and a half full time to save some money so I could afford to move and I also took out 2 loans to pay for classes, initially I thought that getting the residency would be easy enough because I had the valid IDs and documentation to be considered a resident by the state. But everything kinda went bad when I went to the student center a day ago and asked if i was able to qualify as a resident. They said I was unable to because I wasn't considered independent so I had to have my parents fill out the documentation, but they have to be residents of the state and they aren't. when i asked why i was unable to qualify as independent they said that it was because i was not yet 24, or military, or had 10,000 on my last tax form. Now the reason I didn't have 10,000 even though i worked last year was because I only worked for half the year before I had to leave home to move to a different state to start classes. they also say that if the student can prove that they paid for 50% of the cost of attendance they would qualify as an independent, but they exclude any financial aid so my loans don't count to that.

76,"it's something that is incredibly hard to explain for me but apparently my friends find it relatable so hopefully you'll get what i mean.

basically, i over-analyse my feelings about things. if I'm sure that something is gonna happen and i dont question my conviction that this thing will happen, then the exact opposite happens. and this is only true when my fate in said thing happening never falters.

the harder i hope for things or i am convinced that things will go in a certain way, the more likely they are not to happen. so, whenever i am optimistic about a certain thing, I'm scared shitless that it will go bad.

also, whenever something bad or good happens, i always try to remember how i felt before it happened, to try and be able to tell what's gonna happen in the future when i feel that way again.

it's an incredibly elaborate and complicated mental process that i am not even able to explain. but the bottom line is: it's fucking exhausting. I'm always overthinking this stuff. and I'm dead scared of optimism. and the worst thing is, I'm convinced that this works.

sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't, and overall the mental gymnastics i go through to analyse my thought processes to ""tell the future"" are so nonsensical and complicated that this alone should make me realise it's a pile of bullshit. but i cant stop relying on it.

a side issue i have but that's not as bad is doing dumb stuff like ""if the paper im about to throw lands in the bin i will pass my exam"" or ""if i open the textbook and the last number of the page is odd, then I'll never find love and I'll die alone"". i dont know why i keep doing this but i do and apparently i need some strangers online to tell me to stop.

i asked my friends to talk some sense into me and it only works for like, a couple of days. then i slip back in those dumb ass processes. i just need it to stop. i just want to live without wondering if i really won't ever have a girlfriend because i landed on page 155 instead of 156.

it's stupid, i know. but goddamn it i need someone help me. my therapist has always shrugged it off and said it's normal and it might as well be but i need it to stop",20Jul2019,3
77,"I wasn't really sure where to go for advice on this, between Reddit and Google searches I didn't come up with much so here goes...

&amp;#x200B;

I live on a small one lane alley with 5 other homes and a dead end. All week long tri-axel dump trucks have been in and out literally one every ten minutes. At first I thought the guy at the end of the street was taking on fill because he's fixing the house up but today I found out a natural gas company has begun the process of putting a well in. They put a gravel road in that took nearly 10 minutes to walk to the end. My property is a few hundred feet from the beginning of the road they've made. I have two questions on this:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I'm not very far from what looks to be their well site, and I've heard stories before of fracking sites on larger properties and bordering properties getting a cut of the deal because natural gas would/could be drawn from under their properties as well. I've never been notified of this fracking and just found out today but I would assume my neighbors and I might be eligible for something such as this, being as close as we are to this well?
2. My road, which is an alley isn't going to be able to handle all of this equipment back and forth as much as they're going to be. Who should I be contacting about this, because I feel our road is going to get destroyed by this and I'm also worried about property value going down some.

I'm relatively neutral on my stance when it comes to fracking, but I do have my concerns now that it's happening a few hundred to a few thousand feet from my house.",20Jul2019,1

1. I work at a big company, it has more than 400 employees. Because of the type of work I do, if I don't know you by your full name, you are probably new. 
2. I'm a female with waist length hair.

I've been working with this guy since day one. Not in the same department. We've never talk more than: ""Good morning Dude....Morning Verite"".  Today, he got to my office looking for one of the other engineers, when I told him he wasn't in the office, he said it was fine and headed out. So I turn back to my computer, .....as soon as I grabbed my mouse he started to grab my hair, caressing it and trying to put it on a pony tail but letting it fall again and again running his fingers playing with it in a pulley way, saying: I just love when you let your hair down. I was so shock I didn't say anything more than: wha...what...wha what are you..stop...dude. He laughed, patted me on top of my head saying how cute I look and left.

I felt so disrespected, I don't want to turn it into a issue and I feel this is just one of those things it's easier to ignore, but at the same time I don't want that dude think he can touch me just because he wanted to.",20Jul2019,1

83,"

So my uncle is leaving jail soon as his sentence is up. I believe he committed the crime he has been in jail for (murder) for the last 13 years. My family all believe he is innocent. I've completely forgiven him for his crime and visit him regularly in jail with no bad will, despite his victim being my grandma whom I was incredibly close to. My wife and friends I confide in think I'm deluded. Opinions please? 

So backstory (all my perspective). My uncle was jailed 13 years ago for murder. He killed my grandma (his mother-in-law) in an act of desperation by bludgeoning her to death with a ceramic elephant in her house (the murder weapon has never been found but we are confident it was this item). They were business partners and he had got himself into debt. He wanted to provide for his family and over extended himself financially and was in bad debt. He was skimming from the business (which was profitable) to pay his debt and got caught. When confronted about missing money he panicked and the deed was committed. He is a good man who did a bad thing in desperation. 

My family all believed he is innocent. The evidence was circumstantial and there were some serious flaws in the prosecution. At the end of the day though, they believe he just couldn't have done this. There was evidence that it could have been a burglary gone wrong. All appeals have failed to reopen the case though. 

I initially followed the family line and believed his innocence. I had to be a witness in the trial for the defence as I was the last person to see my grandma alive before her murder. She suffered from mild schizophrenia so quite often we dismissed things she said as I did the morning before her death. Following the trial I came to my own conclusions that my uncle was guilty, and acted out of desperation. For loyalty to my family kept this to myself. 

Over the last decade I have visited my uncle in prison regularly, shared correspondence with him and speak to him on the phone when possible. I follow the family line (my family are amazing, strong people who I respect so much). But privately I know he did it. 

It took me a while but I have completely forgiven him for his actions. I hold no bad will towards him as he is paying the price for his crime hence why I can be comfortable with the family line. 

Several of my close friends and my wife however (all who believe he is guilty) don't seem to understand my attitude and it has led to many discussions/arguments. While they understand the family aspect, they do not see why I still hold him in high regard and why I continue to defend him despite his actions. When he is free I intend to act like he didn't commit the murder and help him move on with his life.

I'm not looking for gratification but am curious to peoples opinions based on this limited information. What you reckon?",20Jul2019,1
85,"I’m 24F, I haven’t always made the best choices in female friends. I always went for the “damaged” souls since I could relate and they were always more understanding (so I thought).
I made some bad choices in friends starting at 16 and carried this on til 22/23?

Anyway, I decided to cut ties with a certain girl last year and since then she has made my life a living hell. 
She has spread so many things about my secrets, texted my exes things about me, and I know it’s her because these are things only she knew.

She recently went at it again by really trying to ruin my current relationship by exposing my past. She also exposed other certain things again lately. My reputation is trashed completely and I feel so bad that my bf keeps getting told things about me. (None about cheating, I’m not that type of girl) 
But these are other personal things she’s spilling. 
I’ve kept silent and not once bounced back at her but it just won’t stop. The obsession with me has become very stressful and I’m sick of hearing new things about me every month.

I don’t know what to do. Today she messaged me some bizarre shit and I had to bounce back with threats for once. Probably not the smartest move but I have shit on her too and never once exposed her. I told her this is the last I ever wanna hear of her or from her again or I won’t be so nice. 
I have blocked her on everything, which I’ve already done, but I’m scared it’s going to continue. I don’t know how to make this stop. It’s ruining my life, my relationship, friendships, reputation, and my mental health. I’m really hurting from this. It’s been a constant year of this.

87,"TL;DR : I'm recently officially divorced, and I've met two amazing women, I'm not sure if I should listen to my heart and make things official with one, or give myself more time and enjoy the recovery.



my wife [33F] recently left on a whim, she had been depressed, i did everything and all I could.   I was a good husband.   Not posting to discuss that.   after she left, I became instantly happier.  

I'm writing this because I've downloaded tinder and I've been successful to say the least.    its boosted my confidence and I've had fun.   but I've met a couple great women - which is the problem 

part of me wants to take my friends advice - go fuck everything you can, enjoy yourself, catch up on what you've missed etc.   I understand that, but I also dont want to miss out on something great because I'm thinking too much with the wrong head.

I've met 2 wonderful women, they all both made me much happier than my ex wife - but, it's also only 1 month after the official divorce (total time single being 1 year and 1 month).  

my father tells me to just keep hold of both - thanks dad.  morally wrong, but pimpishly right.  

is it too soon to walk into something serious,
should I give myself more time? should I just keep hold of both, ultimately resulting in either my ultimate loss of both, or letting down one? 
or am I just leeching to having someone care about me because my emotions arent in check.

it's a very difficult thing for me and no matter what I lean towards mentally, it feels like the other option would be better, resulting in a seesaw of mental indecisiveness.",20Jul2019,2
88,"I live in a small college city. There are plenty of bars downtown and most have the same issue, the men's toilets are basically unusable. One bar has a see-through shade next to the toilet and others have the doors and locks removed. I've asked my wife how the women's bathrooms are and she said they are very nice and private. Only two bars downtown have men stalls with a door that locks. The rest don't. None of the other businesses downtown have this issue, just the bars.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm surprised this is legal. I do want the issue to be known and these bars to fix the men's bathrooms, but I want to avoid legal action. I asked one owner why he doesn't fix the bathroom and he said his sewage pipe is messed up. In order to fix the pipe, he would have to hire someone to dig up the road. The women's bathroom goes through the same pipe, so I didn't find the explanation convincing.

89,"On mobile. I'll start by saying that we have 3 children all under 10 years old. We also have 2 dogs just over a year old and 2 cats that are 10 and 17 years old. We've been married almost 11 Years. One thing to note about my wife is that she's always been an animal person trying to save the world, one small animal at a time. She's literally swerved into opposing traffic lanes to avoid hitting a bird. Love her for her compassion but it can be a bit much imo.

A year ago last April my family went through the hardship of putting our 11yr old white pitbull to sleep. (Not going to entertain any debates on pitbulls) My wife raised her from a puppy and she was very much a member of the family. Her health was failing and our oldest son was really attached to her so we got a puppy to ease the transition for him when it was time to let her go. After we had her put to sleep we saw how much our other puppy needed a companion (high energy) so we got our second puppy.

The last year with those 2 puppies has been full of happiness and anger. I can't tell you how much destruction they've caused but it's into the thousands.

Just recently my wife came across a rescue page detailing a momma dog (white pitbull that resembles the one we put to sleep) abandoned by her humans and was in a rescue with her 6 puppies. Due to lack of foster people, they had been in poor conditions for the last 5 weeks. My wife had been feeling strongly that we needed to foster them and frankly we do have the space and ability, so why not? Maybe we can be fosters and help animals if this works out.

Now here we are with 9 dogs and 2 cats. The puppies can be adopted out in 2 weeks so we're stuck with them until then. However I'm noticing my wife is growing attached to the momma dog, partially due to the resemblance of our old dog. Frankly she seems like a sweet dog with a good temperament and gets along well with our other 2 dogs just fine. Also my 2nd is starting to grow fond of one of the puppies.

Here's where I need advice! I DO NOT WANT ANOTHER DOG PERMANENTLY. The last year has pushed me to the breaking point in learning about how destructive dogs are despite my best efforts. I love them, but I do not want to add to it.

I've expressed to my wife that I don't want another dog and she's understands. However she says she doesn't want the momma dog to have to go through getting placed in another home, especially after we give her puppies up for adoption. I've said that we'll keep open minds through the process but that if we keep the dog we're never fostering again. Also, how do we keep the momma dog but make our 2nd child just deal with it when his favorite puppy gets adopted? No way I'm keeping 2 dogs.

So do I give in and let my wife keep the dog? It's important to her and I care about her feelings. BUT I feel like I don't have the energy to take care of another dog full time after I've already given in to the idea of temporary fostering. I would appreciate some perspective!",20Jul2019,1

94,"Approximately a year and a half ago my [30, F] ex boyfriend [now approx 37, M] contacted me on social media. 
We dated when I was around 17/18 years old. 

When he contacted me on social media a year and a half ago he was talking about how his life took a turn for the worse, how he struggled with alcohol and that his most recent relationship was really harmful to his MH. 
I felt really bad for him and continued to let him speak to me about his worries, but I also told him I have a bf. 

When I didn't reply to him one night he decided to contact my now bf on social media and tell him that we had been talking and he basically started to trash my bf and made a lot of wild accusations that were total bullshit. When I showed my bf the chats and said that I had no feelings for my ex my bf was entirely understanding that I was just being friendly and basically told my ex to jog on.

Fast forward to now, I hadn't heard from my ex since and I had blocked him on the two different forms of social media he had contacted me on. 
He requested to follow my Instagram, meaning he went out of his way to make a new account since his other is still blocked. 

I blocked it immediately and told my bf but something written in his bio concerns me; ""I have videotapes to return"". When we were 'together' I was quite young and immature, we would usually get really drunk together every other weekend.  Sometimes to the point that I couldn't remember what happened.
A few of those times I woke up entirely naked and I'm really worried he had sex with me when I was extremely drunk and also that he filmed it. But I was always too scared to ask. 

Does anyone have any advice for me incase he contacts me again? 
Is he just messing with me or should I take this as a serious threat? 
If it is a threat what can I do?

What can I do to get her forgiveness? Should I just not talk to her?

I was told to never call a girl flat chested or flat assed, but I don't understand why. Why do girls care about those parts so much? Why is it so offensive to tell a girl her ass or chest are flat?
And why are girls so confident when they have big butts or big chests? I was told that having a big ass or big chest is like a guy having big muscules which gives them confidence and why they often flex and show off their gains.

104,"Hello,

My mom just bought a new house a month ago and everything is going smoothly but her. She is a single mom, no help from dad, and is stressing over everything. She rushed to buy this house so when she bought it there were already tons of renovations needed to be done. So far, she has spent around 40k on renovations, and there still needs to be more done. Over the past month, she has been slowly becoming someone who I do not know. Straight up, I feel pity for her. She always wants other people to pity her and see how ""hard"" her life is. Recently, my dog got ran over (7 pound yorkshire) by a car and managed to live. That was a miracle and we are really thankful. However, he needs often visits to the doctor and my mom stresses about him every day. Whenever she meets someone new, she opens up with something like ""I am a single mom, my dog just got ran over, there are so many things going on in my mind, theres too many things going on, I need help from everyone for this house, etc. She brings this up multiple times in a conversation to every single person she meets. 

She ALWAYS tries to help, but she tries to help when its most inconvenient as well. Whenever a contractor is over to move furniture I am there to help just in case it is needed. However, my mom has almost no strength and always tries to lift the heavy stuff. I always tell her not to because she will just get in the way and hurt herself. Even then, she always tries for EVERYTHING. I always tell her to go sit down and rest because she has done enough, but she just always seems like she NEEDS to help with everything. And then after trying to help, she sits down and just has that face and aura of regret/depression. As her son, I can tell she looks terrible. Literally terrible. She has aged so much within the past month it looks like a decade of aging. 

Each day she has been getting worse. Today I talked to my sister about it and she asked me, ""is mom going to turn back to her old self?"" I answered with, ""after this is all over she will"" but I dont know how to help my mom at this point. Also today, she was worried about printer cords. I told her I would find it and look for it and she should get some rest. She agreed. 5 seconds later, she asks about the printer cords and we should be looking for them. I told her I would look for them. She stands there and brings it up again. At this point im extremely upset because I have tried to tell her to rest because she is putting too much on herself and she isnt listening. I told her to go take a shower and rest and I leave downstairs. She comes down, goes in the garage, and I ask her what she is doing. She replies with ""nothing"" and I go to check on her. Shes looking for the printer cords....

I have already tried to have long talks with her multiple times. She agrees she needs rest but the next day does the same thing again and again. Please help me. I do not know what to do. As it is going, I feel like her well being will go through something seriously bad. I can already see changes in how she acts, moves around, talks to her kids, and how she looks physically.

TLDR: We moved into a new house that had many issues with it. Mom is very frustrated and is putting too much workload on herself. She doesnt know when to stop and it is becoming a really big problem.

plus I may have to prepare for the university exam in my country again since I'm dissatisfied with the results I got. But I'm really lonely. I think I'd collapse into depression if I had to keep it up again for a whole year, cutting out social life.

109,"My fiance and I haven't talked to this friend in person since early high school and we only get updates on her life through a close mutual friend of ours. This girls is 21 and her parent won't allow her to get a job or have a car. She also can't go anywhere or do anything without her parent's involvement. Her parents also monitor her phone activity and only allow her to talk to the mutual friend I mentioned.

This girl just told our friend that she wants to run away but the only thing holding her back is that she has no where to go (her parents know where our friend lives so they would go straight there). I know she's an adult an she can make her own decisions but it doesn't seem that simple due to how much her parents control her whole life.",20Jul2019,1

111,"I got my cat 2 years ago when she was 2 months old. At the time, I lived in a 4bed by 2bath apartment with my bf and his frat brothers (people always there). Always weed to to be smoked. At 5 months old I moved into a 2bed apartment with my bf and life settled more (less partying). We dated only 7 more months after that and I moved back home (my dad also had a stroke). I lived there a year until I just moved into my own condo two days ago. Things have been kinda rough in terms of getting all my stuff into the new place and working around my work schedule. Anyways, my cat, Daisy, seems kinda stressed. She’s meowing a lot and constantly rubbing up on my leg 24/7. Scratching at the walls. And every time I leave she cries. When I’m in the house relaxing, she’s still the same loving cuddle bug waiting to snuggle and purring. I’m wondering if she’d have a better life at my parents house. So much more room (single family home). A dog sister. Someone always home (my fully functional father who had a stroke but is a teacher so has summers off). And my mom who’s retired. Is it too soon to tell? I love her so much, I raised her. But I know she has a strong connection with my mom and dad now too. I want what’s best for her.",20Jul2019,3
112,"And I honestly don’t know how, or even if I should, stop.

It cost me my marriage, and I’ve permanently ruined my relationship with my family because I constantly pressure them on toxic or irrational beliefs they hold. I’ve had employees leave work in tears because of how I’ve treated them.

I obviously have some apprehension about these things, but I just can’t seem to care too much? I don’t see why I should validate other people when I’ve had to work several time harder than the average person around me. Life is vicious and cruel, get over it? I sort of want to get better, but I’m not even internally convinced that he attitude that’s let me succeed in everything I do should even be changed.

113,"I'm using a throwaway because I'm going to get personal with this... and yeah.

For context: I'm currently a uni student in my second year. I have a full-time job in the summers and a part-time job in the school year, but it's not even close to covering my tuition and living costs. I do live frugally, but uni costs quite a lot. I won't qualify for financial aid ever because my family's income is quite high. I also struggle with anxiety and depression, so that's a huge factor in all the decisions I make because I need to make sure I won't slip back into suicidal thoughts.

The main problem is my step-dad (if you can call him that) is extremely toxic. He's been in my life ever since I was a toddler, but he's grown increasingly toxic and twisted throughout the years. My mom can't leave him since she has some medical issues and can't afford health insurance on her own (I'm fully aware of how depressing this sounds). He is supporting the rest of my college fees, but that's mainly because my grandma (his mother) threatened to disown him if he did not. We're Korean and education is extremely important and most of the families I know have been saving for their college funds ever since their children were born. I understand my parents are fully within their rights to not support me at all, but I guess cultural context is important too especially since I've been set on the path toward higher education since birth. However, if I get cut off I won't get any financial aid because I still have to list my household income on everything. Some examples of his verbal/emotional abuse:

* Screaming/insulting me for buying a desk for uni with my own money (yeah... literally I bought it myself)
* Screaming at me for my college tuition all the time. Anytime he gets remotely frustrated he starts going off on how he's spending so much for my college fees and threatens to stop
* Telling me my mental health problems are all ""in my head"" and that his problems are ""real"" and that I'm the cause of all of his problems.

Living at home this summer has been a nightmare. I work full-time but it's awful coming home and just being insulted and yelled at for the slightest things all the time. I want to move out, but if my step-father views it as unnecessary spending hell will be raised. I also want to be around to take care of my mom, so yeah. I want to figure out ways to become more independent without throwing myself into a cycle of debt and constant stress about stability. I also want to figure out ways to grow stronger mentally because the years of toxicity have really affected my self-esteem and mindset. I'm constantly afraid that everything I've achieved will be taken away from me or that I'll slip back into the worst of my depression. However, I know that if I keep going through this for three more years the chances of that happening are just as high. Any advice for dealing with a toxic household and recovering mentally?

TL;DR I have a shitty step-dad and want to figure out how to be more independent financially and happier emotionally.",20Jul2019,2
115,"Okay so this might be a bit jumbled but I hope you can provide some criticism and/or advice on how to work through this.

So, a couple days ago my mom, siblings and I had an argument. The gist of it: I have been a liar for so long that everything I do is questioned; even if its legitimate. How so? Well a few years ago some girl started bothering my brother. She still does, and we've tried everything to remedy it. However, there's a caveat: my brother said he knew that I had a vision from our deceased uncle telling me to tell my brother that I told the girl that my bro was interested in her. Sadly, I did not say that, or have that visionary experience. But, that didn't stop my mother from believing that he ""knew"" what happened. She was merely biding time for me to come clean. When I didn't my brother kept ignoring me and talking about me behind my back to my mother. So when we had an argument where that ""special experience"" was addressed, I told them that I never had that happen. My mother didn't believe me. She said these words: ""Well, if you're not telling me the truth..."" and I know what that means: I don't believe you even if you believe yourself. So, instead of trying to fight about it I just admitted it and accepted fault even though I know it wasn't my fault to bear.

Now, a few years later, I took my younger sister to the store. She was upset that she couldn't get what she expected to find, and I explained to her what she thought was one thing wasn't. So, I guess to spite me, we start looking for other items on her list and she just up and takes off. If I didn't turn around I wouldn't have noticed. So I catch up to her, and follow her around; tapping the shopping basket because I'm bored and as a drummer it's a nervous tick of mine. Then, we checkout and go home. On the drive back, she starts yelling at me for making her hurry because I was tapping the basket and whatnot. She then starts having a seizure (epilepsy) because of the stress she's causing. I have to keep calm and drive home and when she gets out of the car, she runs into the house and comes undone.

I spend the next few minutes trying to be calm in front of my mom and dad, explaining what happened at the store. My mom simply says that I haven't been honest about everything lately and brings up a time many years ago (before the initial issue mind you) when I was up late with my brother, I went to bed and he stayed up late but the ice cream was all gone. And I was the one who ate it after he went to bed. When it is I who was asleep all night. I don't say anything about that but I bring up the more stressful issue and that I copped up to it to avoid any more harassment. But my mom and brother don't relent. My sister has another seizure and my dad goes into their bedroom and starts crying. My mom takes care of my sister and then points at their bedroom and then at me:"" Now I have to go take care of him,"" she tells me. Because, it's all my fault.

My brother even accused me of ejaculating into his AXE body wash. Now, I don't know about you but I never even heard of that until watching Deadpool 2. Which he saw too. I can only guess he said I did that as a jab and used that idea from the movie. And, as I think more and more about it, I couldn't fit in the bottle (pardon my frankness) and taking off the lids just to get the rest of the soap out is a pain anyways.

After letting out his pent up anger/frustration and sadness my dad simply asks us all to start over right then. He tells us all to let go of what happened no matter how long ago it was. So I agree to and have made it what...four days so far? Here's why: my brother, after all that has been giving me the cold shoulder and when I try talking to him, even if it's small talk he just shakes his head. But, he'll talk to my sister and mom and dad with no problem. I don't know what to do. I can't find work to move out, but my mother used that as an example of my behavior too; that I will distance myself to not have to coexist with my family. I do that when I'm upset and don't want anymore contention; but when my sister said when she freaked out that she understands why my brother can't stand me any more it makes this forgiving and letting go difficult. I mean I want to, I did; but when this happens the previous thoughts come flooding back and make me want to just disappear.

But I can't. I have no family to turn to that is supportive either. But that's for another time.

Thank you for reading and like the post asks: am I an asshole?",20Jul2019,1
116,"So my partner recently graduated with their phd. It's been a long road and I'm super proud of him!

They are an unflattering angle for me, my dress looks misshapen, my makeup can't be seen (sort of taken from below) and of course frizzy hair from all the rain!

119,"Hello Reddit, this is my first time posting, and my first time turning to the internet to help me out in life. Because I’m in quite a pickle. 


I’m 18 years old, and I just graduated high school. I had applied to a bunch of schools that offered my major (architecture) that I thought were very well suited for me. I worked extremely hard putting together my portfolio of work from the past years, and ended up getting accepted into my number one school’s program! For someone like myself who has had doubts about my future, this was one of the most fulfilling and proudest moments of my life. 

After my mother and I sat down and figured out everything, I committed to the school, applied for housing, and even found a roommate for the first year. Everything finally seemed to be lining up for me, and after years of battling depression and anxiety, I started getting healthier. 

And then tragedy struck. The day before my high school graduation, I went over to my friends house to have some fun and reminisce on all the good times we had during our school years. Late into the night, I get a call from my sister, frantically telling me that I have to come home immediately, without telling me why. 
I drive up to my street, and as I drive over the last hill to get to my house, I am absolutely blinded by emergency vehicles lights. And that’s where everything really starts to go numb for me.

My mom went to sleep that night, and never woke up. Her heart completely gave out on her. And mine sunk to the floor. As she was a teacher at my high school, she was supposed to read my name at tomorrow’s ceremony. Instead of celebrating, our entire community mourned. 

This was the biggest loss I could have ever suffered. Not to exaggerate, but my mom was my absolute everything for me. And now, without her, I’m completely lost as to what to do for college. Here is a bit of context for my situation.

My parents had gotten divorced when I was in the seventh grade. I was considerably mindless at this age so the idea of my parents separating didn’t exactly get to me so much. However, the ways things would unravel, it created a disastrous effect on the relationship with my father and I. We had always had a rocky relationship. My mother had been the buffer between him and I, as we were unable to see eye to eye on any situation. In fact, a lot of the fights between my parents would be ignited by me - where my mom would be defending my position against my dad. The fights were absolutely horrible. My other siblings were in no way capable of making things so toxic between my parents, which gave me a hunch from early on that something was off between my father and I. And soon enough, my mom had had enough of him and left. And without her, there was no buffer, and I was left defenseless to my father. 
With no buffer, it slowly turned into emotional abuse over the years, and I would often turn to my mom for an escape from him - staying at her house for a couple days or so to let things settle between us. Except nothing would ever change between us. I would go back there, we would maybe be fine for a day or so, and then we would blow up at each other over something and I would be stripped of all my privileges again. I became absolutely miserable at his house, and did not know how to deal with my situation. I fell into a deep depression, and contemplated suicide numerous times. I felt completely alone where I was. Sophomore year after New Years, we had another outrageous fight. And I don’t know if at that point I had hit my breaking point, but something made me feel like it’s not safe for me to be there. I ended up calling my grandfather, and he brought me over to my mothers house. Because my mother had literally the same issues with my father, her whole side of the family absolutely had my back for my decision. I never went back to my fathers house, and up to the point of my mother passing there had been no contact between him and I. He took my car and removed me from his insurance policy, cancelled my phone plan, and like that, he was no longer holding anything of value over my head. My mom willingly took me in full time, supporting me completely without any adjustments to my fathers child support, as she knew he would drag it out in court to drive up the cost for lawyers. She simply just toughed through the hardship of having a shitty ex husband who didn’t pay enough child support. 

At this point, I’m not sure what I can do. My father has not been apart of my life for almost three years now, and I fully intended on taking on college without his financial support before all of this. I applied for Fafsa in March with my mother’s numbers, and she had her EFC figured out. Now, if I am forced to resubmit with my fathers numbers (who made a lot more money than my mom), I would certainly be left with a higher EFC that he absolutely would not pay for. My question is, would I be able to file for a dependency override and become independent? I have plenty of resources to confirm my case like school counselors, therapists, my doctors, close friends, and the families I have been staying with since I lost my home. 

For anyone who has gone through this process before, please feel free to message me with any questions or specific advice for my situation.

I ignored it at first because I get tired of people after a month or so, but after a week of distancing myself I'm totally fine with them. 
But it's been two months, and just thinking about him makes me want to throw up. I'm so relieved that it's summer because I don't have to see him. However he still texts me occasionally, asking to meet up. I hate knowing that he could text me anytime, and I just want him to stop talking to me. Is there anything I could say that won't hurt his feelings too much?",20Jul2019,28
133,"It's my fault, don't get me wrong. I'm 17 and in the UK, so I've just finished my first year of sixth form (year 12). My mental health took a big toll when I moved schools at the end of year 9, and it got worse and worse until I couldn't take it. I was in hospital for one of my exams at the end of that year, and since that point I've been doing worse in school. I'm a lot better now for the most part, but I feel myself going downhill again. I can't go back to therapy, I hated it so much and it made everything a lot worse, and I don't want to become a burden to my family again so I can't tell them.

When I say it's my fault for being kicked out, I didn't put enough effort in this year, and since I figured I was going to fail one of my subjects, I just didn't turn up for the last month or two of school, and obviously that's had repercussions. I was officially kicked out on Monday, and for the last couple weeks my family have been giving me lots of talks and trying to give me options, which I understand why but it's really not helpful. I've got the choice of either going to a different college or joining up to the army, which is what my brother is pushing a lot. I'm weak, I'm constantly tired, and I'm really not built for the army. However the other college is even further away, and I know I'm still not going to do any better there. I need commitment and a will to actually do anything.

All I've ever wanted to do for 7+ years is become a game programmer, and I've been slowly trying to learn C and try and get my own game out, but the problem is I'm not going to have any spare time no matter what I do. My parents will get a large fine if I don't do anything by September, and I have to make a choice within the next couple days. I'm not 18 till march either, so it's not legal for me to just do my own thing. I really don't know what to do, does anybody have any kind of advice?

I honestly just want a break, to think about what to do next

TL;DR: Got kicked out of school, have to decide soon whether to join the army or a different college",20Jul2019,1
134,"So, I’ve been wanting to talk to her in person. But, she was on vacation or something this week because no one really saw her. I won’t be at work until Tuesday now and I really want this addressed before the new schedule is posted. (Plus, with how discussions work at this place, it’s probably best to get any possible promises in writing anyway.) Therefore, email!

So, when I was offered the job, I was told I’d be in Department A and had to work to get into Department B. I was told that my average shift would be 10-6:30, rarely having to work past that, and never having to work past 7:30 if I had to even work that late. (I was unaware of that being department specific, it just clicked recently.) I was also told it was PART TIME. (So, I assumed 4 days a week at the described shifts.) 

So, first day comes and I am told I’m starting in Department B. Which was exciting! Department B is the goal for everyone working there. I’m there for a few months and I’m getting mostly trained (training is never done at my job, but I was getting to the point of being able to do everything by myself for the most part unless shit hit the fan), and then they tell me I have to train in Department A. I was upset at first. It was overwhelming, felt like I was working backwards and being punished, and I just didn’t like it. I wanted to be in Department B so bad. 

(The reasons for being in a different department are shady in my opinion. First they said I just needed to know the main job in that department in order to technically be allowed in the second department, because being fully trained in Department B requires being promoted, and you can’t be promoted unless you know how to do X from Department A.... then they said I need to know the entire Department A trainings to be eligible for the needed promotion. And then I was told that there is no promotion at all because they are too slow business wise and the company blacked out promotions until we get into our busy season.) 

I started being scheduled later and later. I was 10-6:30 or 10:30-7 for the first two months maybe. After that it started being until 7:30... and now my average is until 8:00. I’m still in Department A, and while I like it now, I’m pissed I’m scheduled until 8:00. That department closes at 7:00 most days. Add an extra half an hour to clean it and you’re good to go (which is when I realized that’s why I was told I’d only have to work until 7:30 if I ever had to work closing shift- which was supposed to be rare.) Sometimes they’ll let me go, sometimes they won’t. 

(Ex. When I was taking the transition hard, because it was overwhelming, I was scheduled to be in Department B one day. I was relieved and happy. I needed a break. I was in that department for an hour before the one manager essentially called me useless and sent me to Department A - despite being useless there, too! There wasn’t anything for me to do. But whatever. Anyway, come closing time. Department A is closed, and they decide to pull me to Department B to do the work for someone else so that person could go home early. I had to stay past my shift. Two nights in a row it happened. I left at 8:30 when I was scheduled until 8:00, despite being useless in that department... useful enough to keep past my end time...) I felt extremely used and have resented the department, the managers, and my schedule since. 

I know they only schedule me so late so I’m on the back burner in case they need to pull me to help close Department B. I’m sick of it. 

I’ve talked to the scheduling manager twice (the second time a second manager was a witness.) The first time I just asked to be taken down to 4 days like I thought was the entire deal anyway. The second time I re-mentioned the 4 days a week thing and also mentioned how 8:00 shift ends weren’t working for me. Both times he said it’d be no problem, he could definitely do 4 days a week at least temporarily and that he’d give me a more even and fair schedule with earlier shifts. Since the last time, 4 schedules have been posted at least and it’s the same exact shit. 5 days a week until 7:30/8:00. I’m tired. I live an hour from work. I don’t have time to do anything when I’m supposed to work 11:30-8:00. 


I wasn’t demanding when I talked to the scheduling manager. I said I would work late every so often, but I wanted an extra day a week off on weeks I’m until 7:30/8:00. 

My last resort is talking to the main manager. The head honcho. But I don’t really know how to bring it up and stay professional. I’m not okay with being used the way I have been. I’m at the point where I want to lay it all down like “either you find a way to schedule me 4 days a week, where my shift ends before 7:00... or figure out how to schedule without me completely” but I can’t really do that as I don’t exactly have a job lined up. I’m sure I could get hired at Walmart which is a pay cut, but so much closer and not a huge pay cut. So I’m willing to consider it. 

What annoys me most is other people have their schedules completely altered a day in advance. A girl can be like “I’m scheduled until 6 tomorrow but my daughters daycare closes at 5:30” and it’s instantly “no problem, I’ll change the schedule. You’ll be out by 5.” And they always are. There’s not even a promise I’ll be out by 8:00 if that’s my end time. It’s not fair. I feel used. I haven’t been given new training in weeks and I’m starting to think it’s because it’s more convenient to keep me where I’m at so I’m easily accessible between the two departments. Just trained enough in both to close them. 

I don’t know what else to do. I’d rather do email, not just to avoid anxiety, but also that way if I get the promise of a changed schedule, I’ll actually have proof.",20Jul2019,1

141,"So I was going through a stack of hard drives I have laying around, and on one of them I came across a document that I'm fairly certain is a suicide note. Out of curiosity, I googled the guy's name (there were several other documents on the drive with his name on them) and I discovered that he died in the hospital four months after the note was written; that can't be a coincidence. He also lived only a couple minutes from where I do. I guess my question is, do I try and find out what happened and give the note to the family?  It was about ten years ago and I hate the idea of digging into the poor guy's circumstances. My gut tells me to let it go and leave it alone; but at the same time, if a member of my family died suddenly and there was a note, I'd want to know about it.

143,"I like to create stories, mostly ideas that I could see being formed into an animated show. I am no artist but with most of my ideas best fitting an animated format, I made it a goal for me to practice getting better. However one thing has stopped me from doing that...

I have a mindset where I don’t like putting anything out if I feel it’s the not the best I could do, put that with how I always feel like I could be doing better, and I am never really able to create things I am happy with. Even when I tell myself I am only doodling or just sketching for practice, my mindset is that it has to look like a great work of art and it just ends up getting frustrating and many things I leave unfinished because I tell myself I can never make it look good enough. Instead of focusing on getting better, I always expect myself to be the best it can possibly be, even if that standard is impossible for me.

This isn’t only with drawing too, it happens with basically everything I create. If I film a video and start editing it, I start telling myself that I should scrap the entire thing because it’s not good enough.

144,"In my mid 20’s, a few weeks ago i asked this coworker my age to get coffee, somebody whom I rarely talked to in the 10 months of working this retail job...

I msged her on facebook, she replied with no because she has an ""overly jealous boyfriend"".

a few weeks went by and she randomly accepted the facebook request, and seemed more pleasant than usual around me at work (retail, yet we work in different depts)

So I messaged her shortly after, and we began conversing... she began opening up to me, we unexpectedly connected and we've realized how much we have in common. Lots of deep and rare things we share in common.

** She began telling me how she has been through so much in life, that so many bad things have happened to her...
And told me that not a lot of people have been thru what she has either, after me saying the same thing about my own life.. 

sounded like maybe something happened with her boyfriend, leading her to open to me like this..

After about 5 days I decided to once again ask her to talk in person over coffee, because we were having good conversation and the feeling was mutual... 

Yet she now told me that her ""hours are crazy because of my 2 jobs""...

Hmm okay... so a day later I asked her if she wanted to get lunch the next time we work, we can schedule our breaks at the same time and go for a walk, or eat etc.. and she agreed.

Why did she use the excuse “i’m
busy” when we both seem to
be mutually interested and are getting lunch during work soon? That always seems like a sure sign someone isn’t  interested...

Could it be that she would feel weird saying yes which would definitely mean she doesn’t have a boyfriend anymore?

149,"The way people perceive me dictates a lot of my actions and I hate it. One big thing that it dictates is what I post on social media and the plans I make with friends. 

Especially on Snapchat, I’ve started posting or going on rants just to prove to people that I have a life or that I’m busy or that I have friends. I hate it because personally I find it annoying, and I don’t wanna be one of those people. It doesn’t bring me immediate happiness, so why do I keep doing it? 

With plans, I used to be totally okay with skipping a party or not even considering going. But now, if I’m invited and I am free, I HAVE to go. Even if I’m invited and am already busy, I will feel anxious that I’m missing out on an opportunity (although it’s normal to miss stuff because of conflicting schedules). I debate cancelling or missing plans because I’m afraid I’ll regret it, or that I can’t make up for lost time. Even this week, when my mental health has been terrible and therefore has made every day that I’ve gone out with friends basically awful, I still want to go to that party tomorrow. I cancelled it because it was causing me so much anxiety, but what if that was just my anxieties talking? What if I really would have such a good time, even though recently I have not been? 

Before I would’ve been fine saying that I wouldn’t go, but the fear that people will see me as not involved and the fear that I’m missing out on something I might enjoy now eats away at me.

151,"For some context:

I met my best friend when I was in 7th grade.  Being two years older than me, he graduated high school two years before me, and is basically always ahead of me in life by that much.  For instance, he is now 21 and preparing for his final year of his 4 year degree program while I am 18 and entering into my second year this fall.

Shortly after he graduated hs, he met a girl, and after a few months of flirting the two entered into a relationship.  They started spending time together on the daily and still do nowadays.  I understood the code of what was happening and decided to let off a bit so they could have their fun, but they have always been very inviting to have me come and hang with them as well.  

They are absolutely perfect for each other and I really want nothing but the best for them.  But something weird happened tonight and I am concerned.

We went to see a movie, and afterwards on the drive home they began talking about their future family and life, while I sat quietly in the backseat.  This is not the first time this has happened, nor is it the first time they’ve had that conversation in front of me.  However it WAS the first time they’ve had that discussion and I began feeling jealous.

Shortly after we got back to my friend’s place, I excused myself with the excuse that I have work early tomorrow morning (I do, but I wasn’t comfortable with how I was feeling).  So here we are.

I know this is probably a really stupid thing to be worried about, but I’ve been best friends with this guy for years, and I have hung out with him and his girlfriend many times and never felt a pang of jealousy.  Why did this happen all of the sudden and should I be concerned?",20Jul2019,2

154,"For background context, I am 17 and my mother is 48. She has three kids, my brother with her ex-husband, me with my father — her current husband — and my sister, who is my father’s child from his previous marriage. When I was very young my mother suffered with weight issues and moderate obesity. She also decided to go back to school when I was 3-5 to get a nursing degree. Only a year or two into her job she suffered a neck injury (she had a broken neck that never healed properly) and the next four years of our lives and my childhood were rocked with surgeries, seizures, and stress. My mother slipped into clinical depression during this time due to her weight increasing and losing what felt like any control. She was a mother, but she wasn’t there, almost emotionally absent all the time. She also kept me from socializing outside of school with other children due to her being embarrassed by her weight. She then recovered, and lost weight and seemed better for 4-5 years.

In the last year this has changed. As a result of her injury she can no longer work for hospitals or medical fields requiring lifting patients. She applied for a staff position at a health department, but she passed up in favor for the employers family. My father also had to take a new position in his job that results in him being home for at most two days and gone anywhere from one day to even four. 

Lately my moms started talking about how she has no life outside me and my father. How she has little to no friends because my father and I are so needy at home. She also blames herself solely for my low self esteem and own issues with depression, while at the same time lashing out at me when she finds me crying or upset.

Most recently (tonight) she seemed spacey when I got home from a friends party, and began to ramble about how she may “have skin cancer on the end of her nose, but if she removed it she will be uglier then she already is.” And blatantly telling me that’s what she thinks it is but has no intentions of doing anything. She also talked about the fact she hasn’t left our house in over a week even when she was ill and needed to visit a doctor. When she realized her talking this way was upsetting me, she lashed out at me telling me I can’t be upset because I “don’t know Jack shit about life”.

My mother is a good woman. She has had a difficult life, but I’m extremely worried. So if my father. It’s gotten to the point where it’s strained my parents marriage but also made me want to be out of the house more, while also being anxious to leave her alone.

Anyway during the fight i lost my mind and started screaming at both of them to stop i had to physically separate two adults over 40 from hitting each other, i was so pissed because of my mom (she throw a bottle at dad so that's how it started) i took her to her room and i started yelling how stupid what they did is, i was rude but i was so angry too, now i'm feeling guilty because we talked back and forth she cried, this is not why i'm feeling guilty, i am feeling guilty because after about 2 hours she got up made us pan cakes, but then she said "" i made this because Op got angry today"" i felt so angry and i felt hate she then started nudging me to say something or smile but i was so livid i couldn't say anything, she then slept on a cough in the guests room.

I am lost i feel no respect to either but i can't stop feeling bad, i did nothing wrong she treated me in a way so bad she can't even realise how bad it is, i am currently having no friends and i wish i can take advice from someone irl but i can't both of my parents basically treat me like a pet they feed me to keep me alive not in a loving family, they make me the favourite kid because i have the highest grades, honestly i hate them i just wish i can stop feeling this stupid guilt, please reddit i have no one.",20Jul2019,2

166,I have 2 dogs and a kitten. One dog is 3 years old while the other is a year. The kitten is a few weeks old and he doesn’t let the dogs come near him. This has had an effect on the first dog where he can’t sleep in my room and when he does he is always watching for the cat. The other dog is a pit bull and even though she is larger she is also scared of the kitten. The kitten will growl/hiss at both the dogs and I’ve seen him scratch the dogs when they got too close. I don’t know if it’s because the kitten is still small or if the dogs are large.,20Jul2019,2
167,"Back story:

Started this year leaving Seattle with my sister on a road trip to help her move down to San Diego. 

Everything was going pretty well until, San Francisco. Our car blew the transmission and we had to sell it for scrap and buy a new one. 

I was originally supposed to drop her off there and go back to Hawaii where I had lived for a few years prior to Seattle. However since buying a new car wasn't exactly part of the plan it turned into looking for jobs and a place to save some money then split ways.

We ended up in Temecula, my sister got a job a gym she used to work in Seattle. I worked at an Indian restaurant until getting a job selling solar. Lease started in March and is up the 23rd of next month, August. 

Over the course of the lease it has been living paycheck to paycheck and we lost another huge chunk of cash getting our car a new head gasket.

I have $200 to my name after rent. Solar is all commission and I went a whole month not getting paid with two bad solar companies earlier this year which left me working at a farm to get rent. I just got on with Vivint and it has been a bit over two weeks over 8 plus hour days knocking doors and I haven't been able to close a deal. At this point even if I make a sale i don't get paid until after installation which is most likely after my lease ends. 

I don't know what to do. My sister is moving to San Diego with a friend from college after the lease, and taking the car we both share.

The only reason I'm still knocking doors every day is because the commission for a single deal can be up to 10k and would solve most of my problems, but again I probably won't even get that before the lease ends and I won't have a car or place come the 23rd. I think I can stay with a co-worker, but I dunno.

I can't ask my parents or anyone I know for help because we're all broke. 

I dunno if I just keep knocking and keep faith or get another job and do both? Problem with that is transportation sharing a car and the fact I've been eating a meal a day (if a bowl of ramen or pasta counts as a meal) and maybe an apple which makes it hard to even knock all day in the 90 degree weather we have here.

I feel like I'm slowly dying, I'm depressed and broke and hungry and don't know what is going to get me out of this. I keep working and working and I'm not getting anywhere. 

If I get a sale, like just them to sign the contract and go site inspection I get $500 the next Friday. Up to 6. So potential for 3k (have to pay taxes later, bc 1099) by then. Even then though I owe my sister money for helping with rent during the period I went a month without pay. 

The number make my head spin and I literally have a meltdown at least once a day. I've been having terror dreams for the past week. I need to find a way out this mess..",20Jul2019,2

Even if something makes complete sense to me, it doesn't make any sense to other people.

It's definitely due to a lack of intelligence because a lot of things that make sense to most people make no sense to me. Then when I try to ask for clarification, I just get ridiculed because everyone else understands it, so why shouldn't I?

173,"on Tuesday my family helped me make the painful decision to euthanize my baby Kitty. She was the first pet I’d ever had, and lived for about 14 years, which is an average age I guess. The day prior she wouldn’t come to get her food and we found her underneath her cat tower, and then she moved into the basement to further isolate herself. She (we assume it was her because our other cat is younger and healthy) peed on the basement floor, nowhere near either litter box. It smelled horrible. 

So the next day (Tuesday) we dropped her off at our vet early in the morning because they were fully booked. Much later in the day the vet calls us and tells us that they really couldn’t get any samples from her because of how she was behaving, said that her teeth were really bad, and she had lost about 1 1/2 pounds since her last visit. So she said we could either put her under anesthesia, let her wake up, then run tests, or euthanize her. They said they would check for infections, kidney problems (urine smell), thyroid/gland problems (I think it was bc of greasy fur maybe?), and diabetes. After talking to my family, I decided that i thought it was best to let her go. She was my best friend, and I felt that I could see it in her eyes, that she looked sad and tired. I know her so well, and the look I saw in her was that she wanted to go. So I let her go. 

So I guess the advice I’m looking for is help for myself. I’m feeling a tremendous amount of guilt for not trying to test her, even though I didn’t want to put her through that, because 2 years ago she had an emergency surgery. I can’t help blaming myself. But what if it wasn’t something simple? My reasoning was that if her teeth were bad, then wouldn’t her quality of life be bad, especially if one of her favorite things to do was eat? Any advice is *greatly* appreciated, as I’m sure many people may have felt this way too. Sorry for being so morbid.",20Jul2019,2
174,"Hi Reddit! 
So basically my roommate/good friend has this boyfriend who... is not great. He’s admitted to being a pathological liar, and a narcissist. He treats her like utter trash. Unfortunately she’s been in love with him for nearly 2 years, and is still very in love with him. They have been dating only around 5 months, well after we believe she fell in love with him. Well recently there was a bit of a mishap in their relationship where they went on a two week break, and the last I knew she told him she didn’t want him in her life anymore... and then hey, he comes over yesterday night and they bang. I really don’t like this guy, so I try to stay out of this whole thing in general anyways. But.... I really think this guys sucks, treats my awesome friend like trash, and needs to get out of the picture. I happen to know that he tried to cheat on her with a girl who he was, and maybe still is, very much in love with. I really think that breaking up with him would befit my friend strongly in the long run. Should I tell her about this whole cheating thing?

175,"This might be long, but I think it needs to be said. I feel as though I constantly fall short of what’s expected of me. I dont know if it’s due to some undiagnosed mental illness I have or if I’m just a flake of a person in general. I suspect I may have depression but I don’t want that to be what holds me back in life. I have been suspected by my primary care physician that I may have a minor case of aspergers which would explain my difficulties with people but again, I’d need to go further with that and still I wouldn’t want for it to define me. I know I have anxiety, which I frequently let get the better of me. When I’m stressed, I often default towards being impulsive and doing self destructive things such as not getting important work done (which I believe to be self destructive). All of this has impeded me from making progress and being where I want to be right now. As if this moment, I should have been someone going into their sophomore year of college with not a perfect gpa but a decent one. Instead, due to my own wrongdoings and all the other factors that seem to regularly keep impressing my progress, that idea seems miles away. I’m a first year still who just lost all financial aid and now I have to appeal to get it back which may not even work out in my favor. I’ve never felt such a level of disappointment in myself. Right now, I’m laying out everything that seems to be wrong with me just so I can do some self analysis. I need to know how I can improve and stop all these things so I can finally get to where I want to be. The thing is, I don’t know whether I’m just a lazy disorganized person, or if this is due to factors beyond my control such as depression or my possible aspergers.

176,"Throughout my life I have often been taken advantage of. I’ve been called too nice or seen as an easy target. Project partners wouldn’t do their fair share, and people generally wanted a piece of me without giving a piece in return.

Today I found out that one of my roommates swapped out my original bed and bed-frame for her shitty mattress prior to me moving in. I didn’t tour the apartment with any furniture, but apparently the girl I sublet from had a much more comfortable bed than the one I spent sleepless nights on for a month. I finally caved in and got an actual bed and was planning to throw away the other mattress because no sane person should sleep on it (after getting permission from my subleaser). Then my roommate YELLS at me to not throw it away because it’s hers... 

Furthermore I went into my roommate’s room, and it’s twice the size of mine and she pays the same rent as I do. The kitchen and bathroom is never clean and she expects me to do the same amount of chores even though I never use the kitchen or the bathroom. 

But when directly confronted, I can’t say no, but the whole situation feels shitty. How do I stand up for myself?",20Jul2019,1
177,So here's some context. I'm under the impression that any time I open up to people and actually let them know that I'm not fine and that I have a lot of anxiety and insecurities I just end up making their life worse. I've never really had someone to talk to about my problems and such so when someone comes along who is willing to listen to my stuff I guess I over load them with it. I'm just wondering how to not open up to people anymore. I am also wondering how I can keep my problems and my personal life to myself in a way where I don't spiral into depression. I don't want to hurt people anymore. So while it's not true to me being me I am ready to pretend everything is fine to the whole world. I don't want to lose friends or hurt the ones I love by telling them how I am and that I have problems. So any way to avoid such topics and deflect everyone from trying to get close to me is appreciated.,20Jul2019,3
178,"I am graduating from a good college with a degree in Political Science at the end of the month. My parents have been fortunate enough as well as kind enough to support me by paying for roughly 75% of my total college expenses (tuition, food, rent, etc) as they thought nothing was more important than focusing on school and getting my degree. They didn't want to see me crash and burn by being forced to work 25+ hours a week while going to school full-time just to support myself and cover most of my expenses. For that, I am forever grateful and I do tell them this often. 

Now, as I mentioned, I'm graduating at the end of the month. I have had an (unpaid) internship in politics with a great district representative office. My job prospects are good, but it's a slow process, not to mention still needing ~2 weeks to finish my degree. As I only have ~1100 in my personal savings (took some time off school a couple years ago to save up and pay for more of my own expenses), my parents expect me to move back home (about a 4.5 hour drive away) if I don't find a ""good job"" before the lease on my current apartment ends (August 14th). Their definition of a ""good"" job would be full-time w/benefits, related to my degree. While I understand their reasoning is sound in wanting me to not waste (their) money by staying in the town I went to school in (also where 99% of my job prospects are) after my lease ends, I will have no place to look for a ""good"" job at home in addition to having no friends or social life outside of my family there. I am then worried I will have to start from scratch and attempt to secure a ""good"" job while living from home. I know plenty of recent graduates do this, but it would not be hard for me to get a job at a restaurant, bar or golf course (as I have in past summers between semesters near my campus) for the time to support myself while I continue to interview with potential employers in the area. The problem is, I know for a fact my parents would think this is a dumb idea and would threaten to stop financially supporting me immediately.

I haven't been financially independent save for a year or two in high school, and my parents have had this ""we paid for x, so we think you should do y"" mentality ever since they decided to pay for most of my school expenses. I would only need them to continue supporting me for about a month (or less) during this transition period but knowing them, they would adamantly insist I come live at home. 

How can I explain to them I *want* to transition to being financially independent without sounding ungrateful? How can I convince them this is the best plan for my career and for my mental health? I just feel stuck because they've done so much for me, I don't want to let them down. At the same time, I want (need) to move on from school and pursue the life I want.",20Jul2019,1

180,"This girl and I met and class and from the very start I thought we would just be acquaintances. For the beginning she wanted to sit next to each other during lecture and study together, and we did until winter break. I had no way of contacting her when school started again, but she happened to see me and call me over. We exchanged numbers and she would continue to want to study every once in a while, although it was mostly talking.

Eventually after a couple weeks, she invited me over to her place. She wanted to watch a movie, and so we did. However, we ended up watching 4-5 movies over the quarter with each other. She always initiated and it was always just us. I didn’t think of myself as orbiting because we got along so well, always laughing and having fun, but there was no flirting/touching going on by either of us. I did know that she was a talkative person, saying she had a lot of guy friends and talking to me a lot about a dude she liked. Yet she also did stuff like get food with me, cook with me and sharing the food, giving me a gift from where she lives, facetime me multiple times, and asking me to get her soup when she was sick even though i let her know i was hesitant to, which i ended up doing. That night she made me watch the movie on her bed and asked me to stay past 1:00 even though I already said it was time to go. Some days later after a movie we got talking and she asked me questions like if I’m looking for a relationship, if I like cuddling, and that although a girl might not say she likes me she might be sending me subtle hints. This moment set off a switch. It was time to talk to her because I liked spending time with her, but not too much as just a friend. I never expected her to keep escalating how close we would get. She also started to say that she didn’t expect me to be this way.

I wan’t to talk to her as soon as possible, but for a couple days she was very busy and didn’t have the time. I was really anxious and confused though so i pestered her to finally have a call with me. I began saying that we simply spent too much time with each other, saying that I might get feelings for her, and she ended up shaming me saying that none of her guy friends before have done this and that its just what she does. We ended up not talking for the rest of the quarter, and to be honest I was ready to move on, but this summer she checked up on me and we’re now communicating a very tiny bit. I understand why she’d want to get back in touch if she did value what we had as much as I did, but I’m still confused why she would after she shamed me super hard. I don’t know what her exact intentions were for making me so close to her and it seems like we’d meet up again once school starts. How should I approach this moving forward and I’d like to know what you think her intentions are?",20Jul2019,1
181,"My husband (26) and I (23F) have just moved to a new state for his career. MEANING, I’ve put mine on the back burner because that’s what loves about right? My car and some of our personal belongings are still back in our home state. 

Since my licenses have yet to transfer I’m back to being a CNA but I’m still in the hiring process. It’s been about a month and a half since I’ve worked but the only reason being is because my husband wanted to take a camping trip with his family. Meaning I had to post pone my orientation. Everything is now falling into place. Now while he’s at work all day I’m stuck in our apartment doing nothing. I’m going absolutely crazy. 

We use to have a very sexual relation as well as adventurous one. Anywhere from roaming around a new city or laying in bed cuddling watching our favorite shows or dumb YouTube videos. We were trying to have a baby but we weren’t overly critical about it. We were just being young and not preventing it. Since our camping vacation everything has come to a screeching halt. He doesn’t seek out affection or even accept mine. We don’t kiss, hug cuddle have sex.. nothing. He comes home from work and sits on his computer. When I try to suggest we do anything or ask if he even wants dinner he just gives me a limp answer or says no. When I try to go and explore our new city alone he get defensive and insist I just stay home. 

I’m starting to get lonely and I feel unwanted. On top of it, I can’t just go to a friends to get away for a drink or some laughs. Is there anything I can do? Did I do something? Should I snoop through his stuff? I’ve never even thought to go through his phone until recently. Am I not enough?

184,"okay so there was this guy who I was really good friends with and would hang out with all of the time. (for context, we were high school seniors) I loved hanging with him and his friends, but then he started to try and ask me out. I didn’t realize at first because it sounded like he just wanted to meet up somewhere like we always did so i would bring friends but when I finally realized he was asking me to hang out with the intention of it being a date, i freaked out, made an excuse to him, and then had a friend tell him I was not looking for a boyfriend at the moment. (This is so cringey and terrible, believe me i know.) We had class together everyday and it was awkward from then on. I tried to talk to him normally but it was just never the same and i blame myself. He also would sometimes talk in class about how he was “not salty about anything” and “didn’t need a relationship to be happy” (both were in context of class discussions, but were clearly about me rejecting him) and most forwardly, he said in a list of advice for next year’s students to not “let a rejection ruin everything for you.” i feel terrible about having ever even made him upset, so this really broke my heart to hear. 
it’s now about seven months later, school is over so i don’t see him daily, and we don’t talk unless we see each other out and we’ll just say hi to each other and that’s pretty much it. I am dying to express to him that i’m sorry for how i acted and how none of the reason I rejected him was him, that I just wasn’t ready for a relationship. I also want to compliment how good he looks now, as he’s lost some weight and definitely looks more handsome, but i’m afraid he’ll think that i might have rejected him because he was heavier (not by much at all but enough to notice). 
So I’m just wondering if telling him these things, especially seven months later, will do him any good at all. will it hurt him to bring everything back up?? i just want him to know that it was me and not him in any way! but i’m also scared that I only want to apologize so i can feel less guilty for what happened, and that is terribly selfish. i would not want to hurt him any further than i may have already, i just want to know what would be best for him. thoughts?",20Jul2019,1

192,"This just happened a couple hours ago. Me and my boyfriend were staying at my uncle's house to dogsit for him while he's on vacation. Today seemed like a normal enough day, but my boyfriend was acting really distant and upset. I asked him what was wrong several times and he didn't want to tell me, so I figured I'd give him space.

After coming back from a walk with the dogs,  I sat next to him at the kitchen table as he was looking through his instagram. He suddenly started asking me why our messages on instagram were deleted and why he wasn't following me anymore. I told him that I had deleted my instagram account about a month ago. Then he told me it was still up, so I got super confused and told him I thought I deleted it.

He then said ""I heard that before in my other relationships,"" which was a reference to a bunch of other girls he had dated before who supposedly cheated on him. He then went upstairs and started packing his bags to leave.

At this point I was pretty upset because I was being falsely accused of cheating for reasons that didn't even seem logical to me. I was honestly fine with him leaving because it wasn't the first time he has falsely accused me like this and I was feeling really frustrated.  However when I went upstairs he was sitting in the living room on the couch with his packed bag next to him watching tv. I asked him ""are you going to leave?"" several times which he ignored.

I was getting more and more upset at the absurdity of the situation and he would not leave. At one point he told me to phone the police to take him out if I wanted him to leave, which made no sense because he had packed his bag to leave himself. 

Eventually he left, and called me a ""fucking immigrant"" on his way out the door. An hour or so later me sent me a bunch of nasty messages saying to never contact him again, that I proved him right and that I should go back to my country.

I am beyond hurt and confused and feel entirely blindsided by all of this. I woke up thinking it was a normal day and that he was just in a mood and it ended with this mess.  After he left I remembered that a long while ago during another fight I had blocked him on instagram amd then promptly unblocked him because I realized how silly and emotional I was being, which might explain the weird stuff going on on his instagram. I don't know what to do with myself right now or if I should respond to his messages or bother explaining this to him, because he'll probably not believe it anyway. I feel like our relationship just ended on some idiotic misunderstanding, but after his nasty insults to me revealed how he actually felt I don't know if it's worth it to bother reaching out. What would you do in my situation?",20Jul2019,1
193,"I’ll try keeping this short and simple. I’m 14, boy. So, whenever I’m horny I’ll always watch straight porn. I like seeing a female being pounded, I already know that. I’m experiencing lots of OCD related issues (I think) like, POCD, HOCD, TOCD and it really sucks. I’ve had it for a while now and I wish I didn’t have it anymore. I wish I didn’t have to worry about any of this, but I am. I can’t do nothing about it. Recently (literally yesterday) something new has happened and it’s scaring me. So, for some weird reason, the thought of females isn’t getting me as excited and aroused as usual. I still do get somewhat aroused, but not full on stiff anymore. Before, if I thought anything of a female, I’d instantly get aroused. But now, I have to imagine boobs bouncing in my mind or any other female body part in order to get aroused or hard. It takes a lot for me to get aroused by it now. It’s just strange. I feel like I’m gay or something, and it’s really bringing me down. I’m honestly really upset. If you viewed my profile and all my posts, you’d probably understand why. Lots of questioning I’m doing right now. All of my posts are regarding sexuality and sexual orientation. It’s weird, I had fantasies before of me helping out a cute runty girl. It was kind of romantic you could say. On the other hand, I feel somewhat relieved. Maybe this means I really am bisexual. If somebody asked me what I thought about guys, I’d probably freeze and have to think about it. But, I don’t even think I could give them an answer. I just don’t know anymore. I legit feel so gay right now. I want to be like every other guy who has a girl. But maybe that’s not me after all. Or maybe I’m just overthinking this. I mean, I don’t hang with females at all. I don’t know what they think or are thinking. I get very anxious around them or maybe uncomfortable. I have social anxiety and paranoia too, so that doesn’t help. But I do like females. Maybe I’m confusing this with being bisexual. I know I’d be more comfortable around guys, because we are both guys. It’s all good. I just don’t understand what’s up with me right now. If it turns out I’m bisexual, than maybe I could live with that. After all I could choose my partner anyway. But it still upsets me if that is the case. On my profile, I have lots of OCD related problems like HOCD, TOCD and POCD I think. I’m really getting scared because all of these things are feeling realer and realer. Maybe I am all of these things after all. A bisexual transgender pedophile. That sounds awful honestly. I know OCD can make these things feel real. But honestly, I mean it, they feel real, honestly real. The only thing here that probably isn’t true is TOCD. But I feel like I could be everything else. The idea of being with a female makes me anxious just thinking about it. I’m just worried I might prefer a guy over a female or something. That might not be the case at all, maybe I’m overthinking everything. I honestly feel so depressed right now. I’m just going to stop writing this. Well, any type of feedback is appreciated. I don’t even know why I’m posting this. I’d appreciate it if maybe someone viewed some of the posts I posted on my profile. You don’t have to obviously, I’m just desperate for some good feedback. Have a good day or night whoever reads this.",20Jul2019,1

I don’t know what else I could do, my dad picked me up from the accident and was in my ear yelling he just showed his true colors and that he’s a dick so I texted my bf (ex) that he’s never going to hear from me again and we’re over then I blocked him on messages and on insta. I’m so broken. I can’t believe it. I have been so invested and he’s just such a horrible person and was always making me the problem and blaming me and making me question myself. I can’t believe he did this he’s so fucking evil. I hope he just gets horrible karma. I’m so sad now, and I only talk to like two/ three people and no one is answering and I’m just so messed up rn.

195,"I only just realised how much of a problem this is, so basically long story short there is a sub for teenagers that I use a lot, but recently the sub kinda went to shit, especially for women, so they made their own sub, that sub is way better in every way, but still, whenever I even think about btowing that sub, I literally feel queasy, and it's not like that sub only allows females, they openly allow men too, but just the thought of having even one femanine trait shakes me too the core. I think this all started when I was young, my dad was the type of guy who would never support me, for as long as I remember my dad would tell me ""men don't cry, so stop crying"" and he would call me a pussy if I cried too much and would sometimes beat me too. Also, It's not like I could turn to my mom, she was always too busy dealing with my diabetic sister(I understand, the world doesn't revolve around me, especially when my young sister is having so much issues). So these things kinda turned me into the man I am today, a teenager who is almost overly masculine, I mean, I lift weights, play and watch football, am in jiu jujitsu, never wear any feminine colors, will borderline bully people(I am not proud of it), etc. Just whatever is stereotypically masculine, I will do anything to seem masculine, but this insecurity where even browsing certain subreddits will make be want to throw up. I really want to overcome this, but don't know how.

Tldr; Ever since i was a kid, I was always told to be masculine, and now it has made me too insecure to even browse subreddits that are slightly feminine.",20Jul2019,36
196,"My roommate brought 2 eight week old kittens home yesterday. They were a bit spooked by the puppy that lives here so I decided to let them stay in my room. I think it’s been their safe spot so far. They’re very curious and explore a lot, but get afraid of loud noises which is definitely understandable. I’ve been doing my best to be a great cat mom and so far they trust me a lot. I get to keep the boy kitten, and the girl is going to my boyfriend’s mom in about a week and a half. 

The girl kitten is so smitten with me. She was so afraid of everyone at first but I gave her a lot of patience and within the hour she was sleeping right next to me. They both stay near me but she definitely trusts me more than her brother does. What I’d like advice about would be dealing with the emotions of letting her go. I love her already. She’s so sweet and the fact that she chose me already just makes this so much harder. My roommate even told me not to fall in love with her, yet here we are lol. I’m going to go through with giving her away of course, but I’m afraid I’ll be dealing with a lot of sadness once she’s gone. I’ll have the other little one, but he’s already chosen my boyfriend as his person, so I won’t be able to bond with him as much as my boyfriend has already.

197,"TLDR: my best friend of 6-years might have sex with my ex-fwb tonight and I don't know how to approach it

&amp;#x200B;

Long:

I met this girl Last November (Laura), and after some flirting we started a FWB thing. Around March I started to catch feelings, I told her and she freaked out and ghosted me. One of my Best friends (Tom) had a FWB thing with her roommate (Nancy) and they had a falling out a while ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile just recently the 2 girls got into a huge fight and Nancy is getting her own place. Tom has since started talking to Laura since they ended hanging out at one of their parties. Tom told me that he had talked to her quite a bit when he goes over there. He told me he wanted to be honest with me and he's starting to like Laura.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile it took me a while after March to get my shit together and move on, and I met my now girlfriend Stacy. Thing is Laura tried texting me about 2 weeks ago and I ignored it, and thats about when this all started.

&amp;#x200B;

Now Tom told me tonight that he was going to be hanging out with Laura late, like 3 AM. I'll be honest that I hate the idea since I can't admit to anyone that i'm still fucked up over the way we ended things, and I don't want her back in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Tom and I were planning on moving out together in a couple of months, but if he keeps at this I don't think I want to go through with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that this could be a thing for them to get back at Nancy or even Laura getting back at me for trying to move on but also I could just be a paranoid loser.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I justified in the way I feel? Im really conflicted. I feel like this is a real break in our friendship and I made him aware that it would when I left tonight. Do you guys have any advice on how to approach this situation going forward?",20Jul2019,1

200,"So my friend (26m) told me (22f) a couple days ago that he wants to commit suicide. 

So here’s the back story, I started hanging out with him about 8 months ago. I knew he liked to drink a lot since the start but a few months into getting to know him and going out to the bar I realized he was an alcoholic. He would drink bottles before picking me up without telling me and a couple times did some lines of meth in front of me. I’d always tell him how horrible that was and blah blah but guess what he wouldn’t listen. I’m not sure if he still does the meth but I wouldn’t be surprised if he still did. Like most people who do meth he sometimes gives off obsessive, manipulative vibes that I sometimes brush off and just forget about.

Also he is totally in love with me even when I have told him plenty of times I don’t see him that way at all. I don’t date men. He’s always posting on his snap talking about some girl he could totally be with and care about and blah blah blah obviously talking about me. It’s a small town so everyone obviously knows he’s talking about me and I’ve told him how embarrassing that was for me and that he shouldn’t be posting literally 5 minutes of him rambling about me when I don’t feel that way about him. He’s always making these passive remarks on how he’s trying to “turn a bitch” or when he wants a hug wants me to hug him forever as if I’m his girlfriend, it just bugs me. I don’t mind hugs but he literally just doesn’t let me go. One time I even kicked him off of me cause he wouldn’t listen.

Well he told me he wanted to kill himself out of nowhere 2 days ago. Literally everything was normal and then he hits me with that and tells me he wants to hang out cause he needs to tell me a secret.  We went out to the bar and played some pool to get his mind off things, trying to get to the secret later on in he evening. Then he tells me “so you want to know the secret?” And of course I say yes. Well he proceeds  to tell me reptilians are real. And I didn’t know what to make of that. I asked him questions about it and he talks about it but nothing really only how he’s seen someone shapeshift. Literally that conversation ended in 10 minutes. So we go back and play some more pool and drink a couple more beers. 

He takes me home and the whole way home he’s saying that it was nice knowing me and that I’ll get whatever I want in life and how he knows I’ll be happy in life. Tell him to stop talking that way, and he just wouldn’t. The whole way home was me trying to comfort him and tell him people care about him and so on and he would just say that it’s time for him to go. He told me he loved me and gave me a hug and I gave him a hug back and then he says “I wish you were straight.” 

I hate to say it but I feel like this is his way of getting attention from me. I know it’s horrible to say when someone is feeling suicidal but I just can’t help but think this is a way for him to see the way I feel about him. Like he wants me to beg him to not leave and show him affection, like a test. He’s always saying how he likes testing people, how he likes using psychology on people. 

I talked to my mom about it and she told me to stay away and honestly I feel like I should to for the sake of both of us. It feels like emotional manipulation. 

Am I a horrible person for feeling this?",20Jul2019,2
201,"I’m having a hard time deciding which job if actually hired by both I should take. About 2 months ago I applied for a TSA job and I’ve been going through the process and had to wait for the airport assessment for them to call me to set up an interview. I’ve waited waited about a month and half for this phone call so in the mean time I just continued on with the job I currently have now. Recently I applied to be a CCA at the post office and I received the emails to schedule my drug test &amp; do my background check. 

I went to the interview for the post office this past Tuesday but the day before on Monday I received an email from the TSA regarding if I’m still interested and  that they are calling those who are still interested for an interview this week. I replied back saying I’m still interested with my name &amp; number. I get the phone call to schedule my interview for this upcoming Wednesday the 24th. I also received the emails for the post office yesterday (the 18th). I have till Sunday the 21st to schedule my drug test &amp; Tuesday the 23rd to do my background check for them. 

Now I do know that as a CCA I have to wait to become career &amp; it may take a while. I also know it’s a lot of work as I’m told by others &amp; have to work 6 days out the week. There’s a high possibility that I won’t get no weekends off especially Sundays as they told us. TSA is a longer process as I still have to do drug testing &amp; background checks (would have to do fingerprints for both jobs). Then spend 2 weeks in Glynco Georgia for training. The post office position is a much faster process while TSA is more stretched out. 

When I applied for the TSA position it said full time also said it in the email on the headline &amp; the lady over the phone as well said full time. But the email says it’s a part time position (20 hrs, 5 days out the week). I well inquire during the interview if it’s actually that or full time and if I am able to work more hrs and do OT. OT at the post office seems guaranteed and available. 

My question for anyone who currently or has previously worked in either jobs which would you prefer &amp; why? I know both are government jobs that include benefits. I should say that the TSA position would be at Newark in New Jersey while the CCA position is in Staten Island New York. So I would have to deal with the weather especially during the winter as a CCA. Newark is 24/7 so I’ve already prepared myself &amp; wouldn’t mind working overnight.

203,"I just got contacts four days ago and I'm having trouble adjusting. I had been wearing glasses since first grade, so I was both nervous and excited to try them. 

I got them the day of my eye exam, so they dilated my eyes and I chose ""1 or 2"" and whatnot. I learned how to care for them. My friends described contacts as immediately being so amazing and being able to see clearly, but this hasn't been the case for me.

My eyes were dilated so of course everything was blurry. I waited for the next day, it wasn't blurry anymore but I haven't gotten the ""aha"" moment of seeing clearly. I just assumed I needed to get used to the new prescription.

 So today I still have this weird feeling. I feel like I'm walking around without a prescription almost. I feel like my eyes are yearning for me to put my glasses back on to see better. I took the contacts out to compare what everything looks like with them on and off. I can see there is a difference, but when I wear them I feel like I need my glasses. I can read (which is what they are for I'm farsighted). I just can't get it out of my head I need more magnification I guess. 

I even took some lenses out of an old pair of sunglasses and put them on just too see if the weight is what I'm missing, but I still feel like it's not as magnified as it should be. I'm not sure if I need to wait a little longer to adjust or if maybe the prescription needs to be a little stronger. I just haven't been able to feel like I can see good. I get on my computer and I can see the screens, but it's just not as big as I would like it. I look into the mirror and see my face; I take them out I can tell I see better with them on, but it's not as close as I'd like.

I was wondering if anyone has advice or has experienced this. It just has been really bugging me and I don't know if it's me or the contacts. I've been debating on putting my old glasses back on just because I feel like I'm not wearing a prescription on my eyes, even though I know I am. It never took me this long to adjust to new glasses before.

207,"I live in a trailer park, just moved into a new lot, and the only problematic noise I seem to have to deal with is the guy next to me. He'll play whatever so loudly I can hear the bass or whatever it is from inside the trailer. Now, I'm able to play my music and tv loudly enough that I can hear it but nobody from next door can. He's not deaf, he's at least in his 30s. He seems to be a nice guy, but tonight proved me wrong.

We have a quiet hourly time where any noise that's bothering others is prohibited. Any noise bothering others in the daytime is prohibited too. It was 12:30 AM when I noticed a lot of noise and I knew it was him when I saw a light on from inside. I decided to call the police since I knew it'd get louder. But then I tried knocking on his door. No response. 10 times I knocked and he refused to answer. I knew this guy was a jackass. I called the police again letting them know I tried communicating with him and they resent the officer out (some reason they returned - difficult place to find in the dark I guess) but the guy stopped making sound so I called the non emergency again to let them know the police weren't needed anymore.

I am so sick of this ass playing music so loudly. I've reported him at least 5 times to the office. No idea if they ever spoke to him, but I left 3 messages tonight (once to let them know what was going on, second time to let them know he was refusing to answer the door and third time that he stopped and that I was fed up with it).

My blood is literally boiling at this man's selfishness. Now maybe I can get some sleep, but I'm so mad that I feel wide awake now. Anything further I can do that will shut this man up? Moving isn't an option, but this jerk needs to respect neighbors.

209,"I’m 23 years old, my parents are together, I’m one of 5 children. Second oldest child, oldest boy. 

I grew up in a middle income home through high school. By the time I was in college my parents were living in a $1-2m home. 


*Im not sure if any of the above matters, I just wanted to provide as much detail as possible*

I’m not even sure where to start, but my father has been cheating on my mother for approximately 15 years, that I know of. I mean seriously cheating - cheating is cheating, but in this case we’re talking payments for cars; random payments here and there, dozens, **DOZENS** of partners, etc. 

Growing up my parents often fought, I never knew why. Now I do. It caused stress on everyone my mom used to threaten to call DCFS on us and give us up for the littlest things we did wrong, think: kids being kids (we were ages 2-10 at the time). 

I began to understand it all when I saw my father on match.com as an 8 year old.  He was using the family computer. I honestly couldn’t believe it and didn’t sleep for months. I was naive and thought maybe he did this for business purposes to gain clients for his law firm. 

It went on for years he even rented an apartment for a decade or more, that was secret. But I knew, and I even explored it. 

Things that hurt me:

Him spending money on these women, dozens of them, while I slept on a couch in the living room from 5th grade on. This didn’t just strain me but also the rest of the family; my bedroom was the living room. I got made fun of for this in high school too. Never grew up with any privacy. 

I love working out and my parents kinda refused to buy me a gym membership growing up. I remember getting sad about it and ultimately using a fake ID to join a gym as a teen. 

Complete lack of a sense of family, example my father spent 4-5 days this past week “working” in AZ with chick. 

It’s honestly been so upsetting to me and caused me many many sleepless nights as a kid. As a 2nd thru 4th grader. I always went to sleep laid in bed as sometimes cried wondering if I should ask my mom if everything was ok. Cause on my dad match.com profile it said divorced. My mom knew of the cheating btw.  I still Live at home and can’t decide if I should just leave my family behind, move on and never talk to them again. 

Another thing that makes me really sad is I’d often see tickets to a sporting event on the counter, my dad would then bring a “client”. Nothing got me more hopeful than going to watch a sport with dad. 

Other small things, that still bug me are things like him taking me to my baseball game as a kid, but instead of watching hed be talking to other women. 

It made correction hard, I was always mad and When he corrected me I was alway even more mad. 

It made school hard, I lost focus and motivation sometimes, but as many know even a week or 2 I’m a semester that you’re not 100% KILLS, it absolutely kills. That’s why I was a 3.0 student. 

At this point, I don’t know what to do sometimes I want to love him and my family but sometimes I want to just leave and never talk to my family again. Just do my own thing pave my own path. 

And whenever there is issue with money, I get extremely mad, and upset. 

Example, my lifelong passion has been woodworking, since I was a toddler. My parents on my college graduation “gave” me a saw, they never ended up getting it so about a year later I bought the gear. The other day he yelled at me and said who gave you permission to take over the garage with the equipment. It honestly made me so sad and upset because. When they said they’d give me a saw I was honestly one of the greatest days ever a GREAT gift that I will love and use from the people who watched me work on my craftsmanship over the years. 

If we really didn’t have money I’d be more understanding , but it’s just the way that he sends Zelle payments a few hundred dollars to like 10 different girls it seems like every other day, and also was paying $1600 a month for an apartment basically to fuck girls in. 

Does anyone have any advice?",20Jul2019,1
210,"(using a throwaway because all my friends use reddit and this is embarrassing) 

I know this sounds bad, but let me explain.

We are all high school/college age and work together in a restaurant. I met him first and instantly had feelings for him, however I’m not all that outgoing and it took me months to even interact with him outside of work. I was feeling good about things, and getting more comfortable with him at around the time my friend began working at the restaurant. 

This friend and I are not all that close, but I had talked about this guy to her a few times. I never mentioned having romantic feelings (guess I should’ve). Her and I have had a fairly rocky friendship, and from past events it’s fair to say that she’s often in her own little world and she struggles to consider others before acting. Within a few days of her working there, they’ve hooked up and not long after they begin dating. 

I have been respectful of their relationship thus far, however lately I’ve continued talking to this guy and he’s telling me how unhappy he is with their relationship. I don’t know what to do... I feel torn because I know I should just stay out of it and let them figure out their own stuff, but at the same time I just really want to tell him how I feel.

212,"So I have been dating my boyfriend for six months now and throughout the relationship have mentioned many times how much I love concerts. I have been to a few dozen, some that I have traveled for. Concerts are kind of special to me in my own little way. He had never been to a concert before in his life and I was extremely excited to share that experience with him. I was able to get some free tickets to a really good band performing in the area and was very excited to go with him. Since they were free I also showed the link to my friends to get them too. I had thought the concert was in a few weeks, but it turned out to be the next night, so I had invited my best friend(lets call her C) that I have been having a hard time talk to because we had some serious shit go down the previous week. The only people I invited that could make it were my boyfriend, my friend(lets call her S), and C. I was fine in that big of a group, but any less with her made me a bit uncomfortable. Back to the main story, I have a concert ritual that includes getting there early to make sure we get the best seats and have everything ready by the time the concert starts. I had been planning on leaving earlier, but my boyfriend couldn't go until after his shift so I waited until he was home and ready before we left. We got there and sat down and listened to the beginning acts. He looked miserable the whole time. I was trying to have a good time and get him to dance with me to at least have some fun, but he ended up sitting down and sitting with his head in his hands. I was left to dance on my own because I was not comfortable enough to dance with C, who was dancing with S. I tried several times to get him to at least enjoy something, but nothing worked. I understood that this wasn't his scene and he wasn't a fan of it, so I let him be. He ended up having a 10:30 curfew which greatly affected everything for the last part of the concert. I would have to leave way early into the headliners act and hope the train to the car wouldn't have too long of a wait. . . etc. I told him that we wouldn't make it if we stayed for the whole concert, which he knew had been the plan. I had told him earlier that day that it was going to be from 5:30-10:00 p.m. I told him we could leave early to get him home on time, but he said he'd ask for a later curfew. He then asked to get picked up. He got picked up at around 9, when the main act finally came onto the stage. I was trying my best to have fun, but I had been trying not to cry since he had asked to get picked up. Along with that, I was stuck with C and only one other person to provide a buffer.

214,"Hi everyone, I would like to thank you all in advance. 

So here it goes. My dad has struggled with saving money for a long time now. Now he has no money and is supposed to be driving trucks for a job but just quit because his boss “shorted him money” which I feel like is only half of the story. He has been trying to find a ride for him and his dog to get to Illinois and well the person that said would take him didn’t follow through.  So he kept asking me to take him. Well I can’t because I work 40 hours a week and I’m getting ready to move in 2 weeks so I need to pack, and save money. So he is living in his semi truck with no AC and the battery is dead so he can’t charge his electronics and he keeps getting mad when I can’t drop my things and take him to a different state, or come down and see him. 

Then just today he was talking about how if he is still in town when I move he will help me. I mean that sounds great being able to have help moving to make it easier. However my boyfriend of 5 years and I are finally moving out after having to live with his mom for 2 years and it was less than ideal. We are both finally financially stable and able to move into this gorgeous 700 square foot apartment. My only problem is o think my dad may try to stay with us after we move. I mean I love him to death and all but I just can’t have him living on my couch after I finally get the chance to move out on my own. So my question is how would you handle it? What would you say? Again I really appreciate any answers that I receive. 

Have a great rest of your day.",20Jul2019,1
215,"I’m 18 years old, so I technically don’t need my parents’ approval for any healthcare, but I have a close relationship with my parents and I’m financially dependent on them, so I feel compelled to keep them in the loop. 

Anyway. I’ve never gotten any kind of mental health treatment in my life and I’m starting to think that needs to change. I’ve been experiencing frequent panic attacks and it’s kinda interfering with my life. I also have several other symptoms associated with anxiety disorders. My parents are rather progressive when it comes to mental health. My dad has a few mental illnesses that he takes medications for, and my mom always talks about how important it is to get help for things like depression and bipolar disorder. Both of my parents meet with therapists on a regular basis. 

However, the issue of anxiety has never come up. I don’t think they’ll take me seriously.

My mom has witnessed a panic attack from me once or twice. She chided me for acting childish and not being in control of my emotions. I’ve always been kinda high-strung and I put myself under a lot of pressure, so my parents could be staring my symptoms right in the face and be like, “eh, that’s just her personality”. I feel like if I tell them I think I have a problem, they’ll think I’m making it up or exaggerating it. Also, telling my parents about this would require me to admit to my mom that I’ve panicked at work a few times lately, which would be awkward because I promised her I was done with my “outbursts”.",20Jul2019,2

218,"I think I need to admit this as soon as possible so I can start towards fixing it. Might end up being very long. 

For as long as I can remember, I've been a topper at school. I never really studied much, just the average amount and was able to score well. 
As I grew older, the amount I studied slowly decreased as more and more distractions (mostly electronics) fell into my lap. 
I used to make coffee the night before an exam, pull an all nighter and show up sleep deprived to school. And still I would end up topping. I was that kid who people hated who used to say ""Ugh I haven't studied at all"" and still score well. 
But the thing was, I wasn't lying when I said it. I'd show up to exams just barely reading through the syllabus and trying to finish it in the school bus. It's a miracle how I scored so well. I guess it was because I had a good memory or maybe because I was usually attentive in class. 
I was never a hard worker and marks came easily to me. In fact, life came easily to me. 

I never found school tough. I always knew the answers in class. I was a model student. I had lots of friends. A good reputation. Everyone I knew loved me. 

Well, up till 10th grade anyway. 

The difference between 10th and 11th grade in India is very evident. Studies just shoot up exponentially. Still, having done a lot of the 11th syllabus beforehand, I didn't find it that difficult. In school anyway. 

I joined a coaching center for the preparation of the infamous JEE engineering exam in India. That's when things grew really hard. I started finding it very difficult to catch up. Never having been one of those students who studied daily, I started lagging behind. I had no clue how to do the questions and I lost interest. By the time the first exam arrived, even though I studied for it, I only scored average. Then a reshuffling exam was held and I was put into the second best batch. It wasn't too bad, and it was where my OWN efforts had landed me. There I befriended some friends who'd been cheating at the coaching center for years. They'd each study one subject and then pool in their knowledge at the day of the exam. 

I'd already been struggling in the center for a long time. I hadn't finished any of the topics done in class. 
The thing with JEE prep was that it needed a lot of hardwork. You had to do all exercises in the modules and finish assignments. There was simply no way to bullshit your way through it. I'd never studied that much before and by the time the second exams rolled up I had no clue what was in half the chapters. I joined the group of friends who cheated and gave the exam with them. And I ended up topping in my batch. Everyone congratulated me and my mom was very proud. But I was ashamed because only I knew that I didn't deserve these marks. The rest of the year, I got used to this easy way out. I didn't have to study much, and still I got to score well. 

There was another reshuffling exam at the end of the year. My mom desperately wanted me to get the top batch. I didn't know much about what was taught the entire year so I decided to stick with the cheating troupe. 
As expected, I scored well and got the top batch. One of my friends from the cheating group did too. The others remained behind. 

In 12th, I was determined to turn my life around. One might think that since we divided the syllabus between us, I would be adept in some chapters at least. 
My responsibility was physics. At first, I actually did study for it. But by the end of the year, I'd gotten used to searching the answers on Google. So by the end of the year, I didn't even know the subject I handled everytime. 

So it was crucial for me to fix this. 

But no matter what I did, I just couldn't make myself fall out of the procrastination loop. 
I'd been pulling all nighters all of 11th grade to study for my exams. 
But in 12th I couldn't even be bothered with that. I was heavily relied on my phone. The first exam of 12th, I promised myself I wouldn't cheat but ended up doing it anyway.
It had started to become an addiction. The few times I did study, I never put any effort into the questions because I was so used to looking up the solution. I lost my interest in all the subjects. I didn't feel like studying for anything. Just lied at home and binged tv shows. Showed up to exams with my phone and managed to score well. 

I'm now mid 12th grade. I've realized that if I continue doing this, then I will fail the actual JEE paper. I won't get a good college. 
My marks have dropped in school too. I still don't struggle with the concepts in school, but if I don't study AT ALL, then obviously I won't score well. 

Uptill 10th I would at least try to finish the syllabus. But I don't bother with that anymore. I convince myself I'll do it later and at the last minute I just go to bed thinking that these exams don't matter anyway since only the final exam counts. I've dropped to scoring 70% in 12th from scoring 96% in 10th. 

I've an exam today. I'm going to use my phone for that too because I haven't done much of the syllabus. I don't want to do it anymore. 

I'm not a dumb student. I'm sure that if I put in the hardwork I'd be able to score very well on my own. I just don't know how to do that. And I'm well aware of how spoilt and priviliged I sound. 

I don't even have any goals or ambition. There's no job I want with all my heart. No college I dream of getting into. I think that's part of the issue. 

My life is a mess. I should be studying but I've ended up falling for this girl who's leaving the country in 2 months. I watch tv shows when I should be studying, knowing perfectly well that it's ruining my life. 
No matter what, I can't bring myself to study because I know that I'll end up scoring well in the exams anyway. 

A point to mention is that my sister never studied at all, scored horribly in school and never did anything substantial. Still, she's in a good college because my mom paid an arm and a leg to put her in it. 

I don't want to do that. I've always gotten good marks so my mom trusts my ability to get a good college for myself. 

But I'm a cheat. And everything that I've done has been a lie. 

I really want to turn my life around. I don't want to feel guilty anymore. I've tried making schedules and planning out my studies. It just won't work. I keep procrastinating. Somewhere inside, this voice tells me, ""hey it's fine even if you don't study because you'll score anyway."" 

I know I sound like a pathetic lazy slob. Believe me, I know. I hate myself for it. I've lost any beliefs I had in myself. I don't even TRY to solve questions anymore because I'm so sure I won't be able to do them. 
The friend I had in the cheating troupe is doing much better than me at school. She's given up on cheating. Since she actually studied for the subject that she was supposed to do, she's good at it. She's used to working hard too so she's doing well. 

I think a slight issue might be that my parents never gave me any attention, unlike my other friends whose parents help them out with their studies and monitor their life. My dad left us and my mom is busy at her job so no one cares what I do in the house. 

I'm not sure if anyone can actually help me. 
I just need to get this out so I can accept that I'm a lying cheat and nothing else. 
I think the more people say it, the more I can bring myself to accept it because I've never had anyone call me out on this before. 
But if anybody knows how I can fix this I'll listen gladly. 
I'm sorry this is so disoriented and half of it doesn't make sense. I just needed to get it off my chest.",20Jul2019,1
219," 

I   have been working in banking for over 4 years - for 1,5 years I had   worked under a boss who had pushed me to emotional depression and an  allmost burnout. I loved this job, but as soon as I took problems home, I  noticed a change in my behavior especially towards my wife and my  relationship began to suffer.

I   couldn't catch more than 4 hours of sleep for months and begun to   struggle attention leading into a depression. This all for an underpaid   position in one of the big players in banking.

After   a while, I decided to quit the job and was sent out for a paid   gardening leave. This allowed me to recover and gather my thoughts. I   wanted to stay in this field I had built a great network of clients and I   just wanted a company who would support me.

I   was able to recover for over 4 months and pushed myself back into the   job market during this. At the beginning it was frustrating I had not   found a good fit or a company who had the plan to hire me.The last 2  months things started very well and I had quite a few interviews and  very interesting offerings all leading to two.

Company  A : A  company who shares the same values in banking.

A  strong  backbone and very conservative old financial instituion. Their  benefits  were a small team with a very good and experienced boss. Great  growth  potential. A Position and great support. Plus a very good  salary for the  same position I had previously had held.

Company B introduced by a Headhunter over Linkedin :  Company providing financial software -

a  field of expertise I have no idea of. I had a great interview process  with the team and enjoyed the people, not the position. Both had offered  me a position at the same time.

My   financial cushion was destroyed after my wife changed her jobs too and   had no money for two months. I had to pay for everything with the rest   of my money. I had to sell my stocks and other savings to pay the  bills  including a car because mine broke down.

I required job quickly - since I had to cover two hungry mouths so I asked both to start on the 1st of August.

Being   unemployed officially for one month and my account running into the   red. I was offered a contract from company B starting at the 15th   Company (Company A wanted me to start on the 2nd of September). Company A   had changed the original contract and asked me to pick it up, I wanted   to take it back home and decide then. So I went there had a great talk   to the Head of the HR department. He gave me the changed contracts and   the expected me to sign them the front page immediately. I refused  first  and told him that I needed some time...

This is where I fucked up -

He   asked me what are the issues? I had told him that I had some open   questions and just started to baffle some stuff to get him off my back   and back home. He answered all my questions I took his pen and signed   the contract. I don't know what went into my mind at that moment. Maybe I   was scared of losing it all.

He   introduced me to the rest of the team and other colleagues and I saw my   manager again. I was happy for some time. I left the building went  home  on the train and wrote company A  that I had decided to work for  another  company. I had sent off the mail and then saw that they had  offered me a  new starting date on the 17th of August.

As   soon as I jumped out of the train I suffered from smaller panic  attacks  for 3 days now and I can't sleep anymore. I had written a thank  you  note to company A for all their work and time they had put into  the  interviews. They replied that they were shocked by my decision and   wished me all the best.

I  have  signed the contract with company B because I liked the team  I  would  work with and I didn't want to disappoint them. I really think  this  positions doesn't suit me or my skills.

I   always had problems with decisions since I was young... But this was  one  of the biggest fuck up's... I wish I could reverse time and grow  myself  a pair of Balls.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore... I have signed the contract with company A on wednesday and turned company B down the same day...

[TL;DR](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_do_all_of_these_acronyms_mean.3F):  I have turned down my dream job because I like the people at a  different company and didn't want to dissapoint them or my headhunter.",20Jul2019,1

225,"Hi everyone, I’m after some advice and maybe some reassurance. I’m 21 and have been employed in a government law enforcement job for the last 6 months. I worked my ass off to get it, went through 3 months of intense training over an hour away from home, and yet it is not fulfilling for me or what I was hoping for. I’m working 4pm-2am with a 2 hour round trip to work and back, and I honestly hate the shift work. I thrive on structure, and this job has hardly any structure to it, which is challenging for me. I’m also very non-confrontational, and this job requires me to call people out on their shit and I find it’s just not who I am.

The only thing keeping me there is the benefits and the friends I’ve made. I have a car loan I’m paying off, which if I stick to this job, could be paid off by March next year, but I believe my mental health and my uni degree are more important than my car loan being paid off early.

This last week has been the most life changing week of my life. My mum has been diagnosed with a rare blood disorder that nearly killed her, and is looking at the prospect of some form of brain injury that could possibly be permanent. This has made me realise that life is too short to be doing shit you don’t want to do. I start my psychology degree in November, and my dream is to be a clinical psychologist. My job at the moment is not flexible enough for me to go to uni and work, so I’ve decided I will work for the law enforcement agency, but as an admin worker instead. I’ve applied for some jobs that suit me and my lifestyle, but there’s this part of me that thinks I’m making a mistake.

228,"24F if that matters. I recently had a break up after being together for a couple of years and I realized I need change some aspects of myself. Use previous experience to become a better person, ya know? My ex hasn't been clear on why he broke up with me so I admit that has been a motivator but it's not the entire reason why I want to change but I have been seeing why someone would be put off with me as a person.   


I've been going to a community college for the last couple of years and finally transferred to a four-year university. This is both because I have had trouble getting through classes and because I didn't know what degree I wanted to pursue. If I'm being completely honest, I'm still unsure. I've taken different classes, finished my general courses, joined some clubs, but nothing has really caught my interest. I haven't found my passion. Or anything I really enjoyed to keep myself interested.   


I don't have any friends, mostly just acquaintances. I've joined study groups but I don't feel I can contribute and feel awkward about it. Often they're groups where they already know each other so they socialize and I try to contribute but it feels very forced. I can't really follow the atmosphere and feel left out. I end up leaving the group. It's more discouraging since I've seen other people join as well and they instantly jump in and fit with the group.   


My initial instinct is to just go home after class or the library to study on my own. If I'm invited somewhere I want to say no. If we decide to go to eat, I want to say no because I'm a super picky eater and don't want to embarrass myself so just don't go. of course, when you say no enough times they stop inviting you. That's fair. (I would like to note that yes, me saying no to wanting to go out, have spontaneous trips, basically just hesitating on anything that wasn't routine was a reason why my ex broke up with me; again, understandable).  I want to change this. I want to be less scared of the unknown. I've forced myself to go out of my comfort zone for my ex, of course. It wasn't just us being enclosed and never having fun. I don't actually enjoy going out with people because I feel can't contribute. I'm the one awkwardly lagging behind while everyone is in conversation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no hobbies. Again, I've tried different things and none have stuck. I've tried reading, drawing, graphic design, running, hiking, pilates, make-up,  gaming, knitting, coding, jigsaw puzzles, etc. I can't seem to find something that actually sticks. They're interesting, of course but whenever someone asks, 'What do you do in your free time?"" I can't give an honest answer. I just stare at the tv without actually absorbing what is going on. I want to find something that people can associate me with. Have experiences so I can share interesting stories. Be someone they want to be around.   


On the bright side, I've noticed that I do attract people when I'm confident and energetic... but I admit that is very rare. This is how I've met all of my romantic interests/ex boyfriends and the one or two acquaintances that have stuck around so I know I'm not hopeless. Those times I feel that give a great impression but then after a while it is revealed how boring I am.  


TL;DR: I've come to realize I am negative in nature and I am aware that people don't want to be around that so I want to work on myself. I've tried to change things with hobbies and initiating conversation but it doesn't help much. I still need help on what I can do to or any advice on not losing hope and become a better person and be happy about it. What do you do exactly to improve as a person?   


Thanks for anyone offering their advice!",20Jul2019,1
229,"Hello,

I’m a 20-year-old woman and Deist who has a strong interest in theology and religion, despite of my upbringing in a secular household.

I began my interest at the age of 13, when I discovered and read about Theistic Satanism (as is typical of an edgy teenager). I then moved on to LeVeyan Satanism, Luciferianism... then I came across the various Pagan faiths. 

At the age of 14, I decided to become Wiccan... but after researching more about different belief systems, I dropped my religion at the age of 15.

Suddenly, an interest in the Abrahamic religions washes over me, and before you know it I’m already hopping onto Reform Judaism at the ripe old age of 16. Same thing you’d expect. I attended synagogue regularly for a total of about eight months, but bailed when I realized it doesn’t line up with my beliefs.

Now that I’m an adult and not so prone on clinging onto the first thing I see, I’m at a complete loss. I tried to get into Christianity... but I just... can’t. The Bible makes so many radical historical claims that archeological evidence just can’t back up, such as the great flood, for instance. 

I know that exploring religion is about faith and finding what’s comfortable for you, but I can’t wrap my head around that mentality. I just can’t. I feel like I need proof in order to believe something, even if it’s just proof from logical reasoning. 

I’m starting to realize that no religion could fit my impossible standards beyond Deism and feel lost. I feel like I have no foundation beneath me anymore. I long for a set out path for myself, so I can feel safe and secure in my everyday life, knowing that I have the answers to life’s most burdening questions and a unchanging set of ethics. 

How am I supposed to deal with such uncertainty? It may seem silly, but this bothers me practically every day.",20Jul2019,1

Most questions about myself I can't seem to answer. Not honestly anyways. Subjective facts such as my name, age, birthday, obviously I have those down. But ask me a matter of my self or of my opinion? Expect me to give you a blank stare. Or perhaps make something up.  


What's your favorite color? Hell if I know, they all look nice. I think it changes though, and for some reason right now I prefer pink and grey. (This is new, trust me)

&amp;#x200B;

What's your favorite movie? I don't... watch anything?

&amp;#x200B;

Favorite music? I don't listen to anything either. 

Favorite game I can answer. It's Pokemon. But I can't be defined by just... Pokemon. So I guess that makes me feel a little better for not having answers to the others. 

&amp;#x200B;

But deeper questions about my beliefs and opinions? I really don't have opinions. Like wtf is wrong with me?  Like I believe queer people should be accepted (and I am one. But that's another thing else entirely) but theres a lot of other things I really \*don't\* have an opinion on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Global warming? Yeah we're all gonna die or something.

Believe in God: I mean I used too... now though it's hard to say.

Democrat or republican? Can I go with neither?

Sexuality: I don't think I have one of those? Or I have all of them at once? Can I just say queer?

Hobbies? Bro I don't know what I like to do. I also keep getting rid of stuff and like my room is getting empty but I dunno if I wanna replace it with more stuff. Am I really this much of a nihilist? Am I just in the middle of an existential crisis?

I’ve been in a relationship with this man for three months. I’m 22F in college, and he’s 23M and just works, not in school at all. He’s never met my family, yet they know I’m dating him and they don’t seem happy about him. He doesn’t have his life quite together (no place of his own, no car, not in school) and they believe I deserve better because I work too hard to be with someone like him. They don’t think it’s fair for me to date someone who doesn’t have much going for their self. They tell me these things because they love and care about me and I understand their perspective. 

Although he doesn’t have his life together, he treats me very well and goes beyond to make sure I’m happy. He is not selfish at all. He always makes sure that I eat, have enough money for groceries or anything else I need. Right now he’s even going out of the way to make sure my rent will be paid in full, putting his money together and mine. I’m always modest when it comes to money and I hardly ever ask for it, so I never want it to seem like I’m taking advantage of him. He’s been through a lot in his life but he has a very good heart and I appreciate him for always being kind to me.

He really is a sweet guy and is very supportive about my schooling, but it’s almost time for the fall semester to start and I’m having mixed feelings about the relationship. I graduate from nursing school next May and my priority right now is getting my degree. Until I get there, I won’t always be available for friends and family because of studying, so I know I won’t be available for my boyfriend. At this point, I don’t want to burn bridges or leave on a bad note but I need to be as focused as I was before I met this man.

Basically, I don’t want this relationship anymore. I want to focus on school. I will do whatever it takes to secure my future. I’m not scared about breaking up with my boyfriend, it’s the outcome I’m worried about. If I do it now, he might be spiteful and forget about helping me with my rent. He might try to contact me via text/call afterwards. Or worse, he might try to see me since he knows where I live. And I just renewed my lease here and start next month. I live in student housing and there are penalties for breaking the lease, but I feel that it may be necessary to do so because of my safety, and if need be I would stress that to my landlord and hopefully they would cancel the lease without it going to collections and hurting my credit.

I’m also afraid my mom might pop up to visit me, since she knows where I live too. I explained to her how I feel about our relationship and she wants to help, but she also has a bad temper (and the rest of my family) and I don’t want things to escalate in an unnecessary direction.

TLDR: I don’t want relationship anymore. What’s the best way to end it in my situation?",20Jul2019,1
234,"Some Context. On July 20th 2014, a teaching assistant i cared for very much swerved off the road around midnight and wrecked her car in a field. She was pronouced dead later that night. I awoke the next morning to my mom on my bed. She told me I didn't have to go to school as Miss Shirra ( The Ta) had been killed in a wreck last night. I was in that much shock that my Dad was considering calling an ambulance. 

So today is the 6th anniversary of the death and I need some advice to help get through the day and not have a nervous breakdown or a panic attack. Thanks",20Jul2019,1
235,"So redditors if reddit. Please help my cringefest of a teenage wreck. I’ve run into quite the scenario that I think only the most meme-filed website can help me with.
So, here’s what’s happening.
I am a female yeah? And I have a male friend. No problem yet I promise. It just so happens that last year this male friends best-girl-friend person disappeared off the face of the earth. They both liked one another and did nothing about it. So the two of us became close friends as the school year continued. Still, no problem. 
   MF Began texting everyone in his contacts good morning and goodnight. I was one of those people. And since I’m a helpless romantic, this made me just a little bit mushy happy in my heart. So around his birthday in April I realized that I liked him. A lot. And I had for a while. Now there is a problem. I just brushed it off as my normal romantic fantasy’s that would lead to nowhere. Now a month or so passes by. He got suspended for a notebook that had information on most people he knew. I was upset, but he told me eventually. So, MF goes back to school. He is socially awkward and tells me multiple times that he dislikes everyone at our school. Which is for the most part understandable. 
We get closer as friends. I eventually began to think that this might lead somewhere. I don’t do anything of course. We are close friends. And he has told me that he does not think that dating would lead anywhere. I knew that nothing could happen. But still, I entertained the idea that he could like me back. I began wishing on 11:11 for him to like be back like people do on Snapchat. Only I did this in my head of course. 
One day at our hiding place, he tells me that he has a new journal on his phone. He does not plan to show anyone this time. He then shows me my entry, which explained that he loved me like a sister. I couldn’t really respond. I got what I wished for. And for a while, I tried to love him like a sister. I even told him that I loved him like a brother. But I still wanted more. I had still felt that he tried to use that as a way to politely reject me. A few days later I  convinced him to tell me who his crush was. It was another girl who I had suspected he liked for a long time. Again, I felt rejected even if I hadn’t done anything. 
I still really like him. I began asking a few other friends for help. I wouldn’t tell them who I liked, just that I liked someone. They would occasionally give me advice. Eventually, I told a small group of friends that I liked him. Unfortunately, he knows that I like someone. He might suspect that I like him, but I hope not. He asks me who it is a lot. 
Now he wants me to tell him in exchange for one of his secrets. He has told me that this might be the first person who he liked. My fool of a helpless romantic soul thinks this might be a chance that he likes or liked me.
Now whichever Reddit browsers see this, I ask you for either your pity, opinions, or advice to tell me that I’m being an idiot. Or you can just laugh at my misfortune.  The laughing seems fair. I would appreciate no upvoting. As he browses reddit very often and I don’t want to take the chance of him seeing this. As this is a very specific situation, anyone who knows me and reads this will know who I like. And that is the opposite of my goal here
Thanks for reading this far if you do, and for responding if you do. I appreciate it",20Jul2019,1

240,"Hi all.  

Some backstory: I have a decent, but relatively distant, relationship with my parents - mostly out of filial piety.  I care for them deeply and still communicate with them, but they were away working for most of my childhood, and I have lived away from home since moving out for college.

In the past few years, things have been rocky.  My parents resent each other and are ""separated,"" but still live under the same roof.  My dad is almost at retiring age but owes more money than he'd ever be able to pay back (longer story).  My older sister takes my mom's side and wants nothing to do with him.  

However, my dad has been openly depressed lately.  Whatever personal disagreements I have with him I think it's important, as a daughter, to just be more present in his life (he's worked so much as a small business owner that he has no hobbies, friends, or any sort of ""outlet"").  I have been calling him more often; encouraging him to see a doctor/someone to talk to; I drive home on weekends to help around the house.  So I feel responsible for whatever happens from here.  He's really not a bad guy, he's just had horrible luck, a greedy streak, and too much pride. 

Now: in recent weeks, I have been seeing strange events pop up on my phone's calendar app: ""DUI meeting,"" ""Alcohol and drug testing,"" ""ABHC class,"" ""Victim Panel,"" ""DOL Hearing.""  Turns out my dad's email address is still synced to my phone from when I was helping him out with some work last year.

His behavior has been very erratic lately so maybe I should've expected things to blow up eventually, but I'm still kind of in denial about this DUI.  I want to be there for him since it's not something anyone should ever go through alone, but I don't know how to approach the topic if it's something he doesn't want anyone to know about. 

I've been getting bursts of wanting to take action: to call his DUI attorney (appointment listed on the calendar); to take a day off work to secretly attend his required meetings; to call him up and just tell him that I know.  But the reality is that I'm walking on eggshells, I'm a passive person, and I don't know any facts: not the circumstances, not when/how it happened, not why he was drinking, nothing.  I have plenty of very plausible theories, but none that I'd like confirmed. 

I need some advice, please, on everything. I'm just so lost. Can only imagine how much my father is struggling.",20Jul2019,1
241,"My cousin had this friend who I met, and we added each other to social media. He was on there for a few years, occasionally liking eachothers photos. He messaged me and hit on me in the middle of the night looking for a booty call, and from there I lost interest and we stopped talking

He messaged me a year later at 3am saying, ""hey"" and I ignored him because I thought he was going to hit on me again

Im only getting 60% of my pay during this time. 

 Back at the end my May my boyfriend lost his job. He's applied to all the local warehouses and businesses but nowhere will hire him. He doesn't have much experience and he changed jobs frequently when he was younger so he doesn't have the most impressive work history.  He's even having a hard time finding jobs through temp agencies. I can't help but be angry at him for putting us in this situation when we were doing so well financially.

247,"Hi, I'm 17 and am about to start my senior year of high school at a new school (I move alot). My concern is that every other school I've been too, there has been either a majority of white people or close to it. One negative is this is that my other schools have all been majority white and Hispanic with less that 5% african american. (I'm white). But the new school I'm zoned too is only 11% white people with 60% african american. I'm not racist, but my parents are and they keep putting all these fears in my head that it will be a ghetto school even though it's supposed to be a good school. My parents comments paired with me already being nervous about being a minority for the first time have me pretty nervous. But my aunt lives about 30 minutes away and I could just use her address and go to the high school she is zoned to which has a similar demographic to my previous schools, but I would have to wake up early and drive signoficantly further every day. 

So my question is: should I just get over my fears and go to this primarily African american school, or should I drive further and go to the primarily white school, so I'm not as nervous?

P.S. I have pretty severe social anxiety and since my previous schools had like zero african american students and my parents not having any african american friends, I'm not afraid of african Americans, but it would definitely be a shock to me to be around such a significant amount of them so quickly. For example, one of the only African american men I ever met was my friend's cousin's boyfriend who tried to give me one of those like bro handshake things and i had no idea what to do, I had never done anything but just the normal handshake up and down and he was trying to like shake my arm in the air and also hug me at the same time but I didnt realky understand so it was realllllly awkward.",20Jul2019,1

For the last two weeks, my boyfriend has been on a family camping trip. With no electronics, and we've had no contact with each other at all. We've been together for ten months, and we're in a very serious relationship. 

I read his horoscope yesterday, and, again, this is so stupid, it said it was going to be a great day to meet someone new.

I'm usually not one for believing in horoscope or astrological readings, but reading this after having no contact with him scares me so much. He comes back Sunday, and I'm so scared he's going to say that he wants to break up.

But at the time, i wasn’t sure if I could say it was hard/soft because I didn’t know how soft/hard t should be to count as hard or soft. So for fear of the worst, I said soft. Doc said that because it’s soft, it’s nothing. Now that had more time, I can safely say it’s hard. But it hurts to touch. Recently I’ve been having heart troubles as well. A dull pressure and an occasional sharp pain in the middle of my chest. The pain in my chest moves all around but mostly sticks to the middle and right side. Right now my biggest concern is that it’s cancer in my balls and it has now spread to my heart. This seems far fetched, I know.

250,"Hello everyone,

I know the answer to the title seems obvious but please allow me to give a little context.

I have been working as a bartender for the past year and a half. I don't hate it but it has been getting harder to deal with the constant socializing, it really exhausts me.

This is not my dream job, it was supposed to be temporary until I work on my career as a freelance translator. I just kind of got stuck in it a little longer than planned. I have tried to improve my conditions by working only 30h per week (it used to be over 40h) and using the rest of my time to develop my business. 

I feel it is time for me to really launch my own activity and to quit bartending but here comes the problem. I don't have a guaranteed income for the first months and I still need to pay rent and food. 

One solution would be to get unemployment money. I just need it to secure my back in the beginning and I worked my ass off these two last years so I'm allowed a good share. 

However in my country, if you have an unlimited contract (with no defined ending), you can only apply for this money if you get fired or if you and your boss both agree on breaking the contract. If you quit you need to wait around 5 months to get anything. 

As you can probably guess, I saw my boss and he doesn't want to break the contract as it would cost him money and if gives it to me everyone will ask him for this way out. Instead he suggested I quit, and he then hires me for the opening of his other bar in September. He offers me a limited 4 months contract working 40+h per week. That would allow me to get unemployment money at the end.

So I could do this, knock myself out with work until 2020, then take a break and finally start doing my dream job without worrying about having a roof over my head. Or I could reduce my working hours even more, like 15h or 20h a week, to secure a minimal income while I start my business. 

The thing is, I really can't take this job anymore. I'm someone who smiles all the time. That's what most customers and coworkers like about me. But inside I hate it. I'm exhausted. I cry almost everyday because of this. At first I thought the best solution was obviously to take his offer as it is only 4 months, it would be interesting to open a bar and most importantly I know exactly when it ends, but lately just the thought to do this full time until 2020 makes me think I couldn't take it, I wouldn't handle it so much longer.

Sorry for the long post, fellow redditors, and thank you if you read it. So what do you think? Toughen up and do the 4 months knowing I'll be stable afterwards or be more gentle with myself but be less secure financially?

Either I work a job that is draining me physically and emotionally for 4 months full time but I'll have a stable income after that or I work the minimum I need to eat and live and try to start my business.",20Jul2019,1
251,"So I don’t normally rant on reddit but its really bothering me and I genuinely want to know what you think. 

So I have a group of friends but two of them don’t really get along. The tension between them is just so strong that sometimes, when we hang out as a group, we often feel uncomfortable. 

One of them asked me and another person in the group to hang out with her because she only feels comfortable with us, not with the other two in the group. We’re also supposed to hang out with another person but she’s supposedly unavailable at that time so it was just us three.

Today, the three of us went to the mall and we saw one of our friends from our friend group and she immediately told the other friend that us three have been hanging out. She called us fake and dropped a couple swear words at us- she was just hella mad.

I understand that she’s upset that she wasnt invited but it wouldn’t have been fun anyway since she does not get along with my other friend who originally invited us. And if she does not like this other friend, then why does she care so much about not being invited? Why would she expect the one person in the group that she does not get along with to invite her?",20Jul2019,2

 Im basically scared of what i feel , im not used to it.And the fact that shes going to a vacation with her friends(there will be other guys) is not helping at all.Sometimes i think of braking up with her just so i dont go deeper.

253,"So backstory, I'm still in school and I am a closeted furry. As far as I know nobody suspects anything so far and I feel extremely awkward about it around my friends at times but I don't feel as though telling them is the right move. I've got a few people I could let know but I feel like I should ask the internet first.

About me, I'm a huge band nerd in the percussion section, you know typical gamer with a fair steam library and an ancient Wii with some GameCube game from my parents. I play DND and do other nerd shit with learning basic quantum physics and immune system stuff. I'm also in the Calgary stampede showband, and won the WAMSB world championship for field show competition so I'm not that handicapped as a person I hope. I also have mostly average grades with a ridiculous talent for math.

Now for the others I could tell

First is one I'll call JM, he's someone who I've known for a couple of years now and have grown to be silly close as friends, he dms for my DND group and is all around one of the best people I've known as of recent. However he is very vocally antifurry and has also had personal experiences with furry family so he isn't exactly uneducated as to the fandom as a whole. I'd rather not risk the relationship taking a hit but I don't know what I should do about this.

Next is my family, the best I could have ever asked for. They are hugely accepting of most people, although my mom is vocally against Trump. My dad isn't always as tolerant of typical sybling hyjinx as I'd like, often raising his voice and fighting with my sister, who has an ego to large for her own heart. They are the best people I could have had as family and I wouldn't change a thing if I could. I don't think they'd take the news as hard as I am imagining but my mom has shown disgust to furries and I believe most of them are uninformed of the extent furries and their beliefs go.

Next I could go to people from showband to talk to it with, the band is hugely accepting of basically anything and already has someone who by memes is know as the ""not a furry"" kind of furry. I feel like that would be the least likely to backfire for reactions, however marching bands kind of are interconnected as a several close knit families so secrecy after exposing myself isn't much of an option.

Lastly I could probably go to a professional, a teacher or  a counselor about this. I'm sure that nothing of impact would happen in my real life, but I feel as though they wouldn't help me substantially and I would be back here without making much of any headway what's or ever.  

So yea that's that also if you think you know who I am I'd like for you to please try to tell me in private, even if you think that I'd be ready to tell somebody because of this post, I don't want  ore people to know that need to know. OK?

It’s been around a week, and she hasn’t said anything and I’m not sure if I should just check in and ask her how everything is, she suffers from anxiety, and I’m pretty sure she has depression. Not from the break up but just overall, she always seemed sad and she told me she always feels sad so I want to be a good friend and check in, but idk if it would be better to just give her space. She’s also very like shy in a way and gets anxious to try and tell people things and what not so I feel like she would probably never text me again.",20Jul2019,1
264,"It’s not that I can’t get into one. I’m confident enough that I’m a decent person who could make a relationship happen if I tried, but that’s the thing, I don’t. I never actively try to make a relationship happen.

See, I’m really disassociative, to the point that any relationship I try to start goes nowhere because it doesn’t feel real, and not in a starstruck sort of way, but because nothing feels very real.

I’m too much inside my own head to make a relationship work. Yeah sure, if I scraped the bottom of the barrel I’m sure I’d find someone who could put up with me, but I do have standards, albeit low ones.

My point is, I don’t know how to form real relationships because I’m in my own head too much, I’m not here all the time, meaning Im not always very responsive to other people. 

I’ve been prescribed antidepressants to help with this sort of thing, but it doesn’t help much. I still feel like everything I do is meaningless. I still feel like nothing is real. And unless you know me, and know that I’m like this, I’ll usually come off as rude, or stupid, or just plain weird in a bad way.

The way my brain is wired is ruining the social and mental aspects of my life, and I don’t know what to do anymore.

One of my biggest fears is that I’ll never get past this and end up being alone and unhappy.

265,"I think I may be a sociopath. I can understand how others feel but I enjoy watching someone in pain/suffer. I also have social anxiety, but it's been getting better and better since I've tried talking to people more. I like inflicting pain to myself sometimes but mostly others (I will ask them for permission of course, and some do accept). When I see them suffer I enjoy it... Sometimes when I see 2 very good friends (e.g. A &amp; B) I will try to third wheel them. I will try to be very good friends with A and convince/manipulate them to leave B. After they do so, I just leave A. I don't know why but I just like it when I see others in situations worse than me. I also get agitated/angry when I don't successfully third wheel them. I've also realised I'm very self-centred/narcissistic/controlling. If you're my friend for example, I will try to force you to do things for me. If you don't do what I say, I will get angry at you. If you're my friend but have a better friendship with someone else, I also get jealous and angry. I will try to third wheel them in attempt to revenge. Let's say originally A was my friend, but now has a better friendship with someone else (B). I will try to third wheel them by being better friends with B and manipulate/convince them to leave A. After they do so I leave B. Does this mean I'm a sociopath? Do I need help?",20Jul2019,1
266,"My brother and I have noticed a very slow decline in my mother over the past several years. At first I thought it was just my brother [21] and myself [23] getting older and better understanding our parents as people instead of early life mentors. 
My mother is in her late 40’s, she has had trouble holding down jobs. Verbally she does ok but written communication, specifically texts, she heavily struggles with. It’s like she doesn’t reads 1 out or 5 words we send her and she often responds unpredictably and in ways that don’t make sense. She has a pretty bad alcohol addiction but functions well with it. She doesn’t morning drink she doesn’t get blasted drunk. She struggles heavily with friends and is pretty isolated. I feel like she’s very depressed all of the time but will often feel comfortable and happy with my brother and I. Today she tried to get my brother and I wound up about domestic violence. She has a husband who she hates and she’s a total bitch to the guy. He dropped a plate in the kitchen and my dramatic mother blew it way out of proportion like she’s nearly being attacked by the guy. She’s highly suspicious of everybody and has a very deep seeded victimization mentality where everything and everyone is against her. This is why I feel apprehensive to approach her about her signs and symptoms. I have never asked her about any delusions or hallucinations  but I feel like I need to know. It feels like she’s slowly starting to lose touch with reality. 
Overall, has anybody had anybody close to them who have struggled with things like this? I’m looking for pretty much any and all information.",20Jul2019,1
267,"During my first year at university I met this girl I really liked. We started off friendly enough but my aspergers made it difficult to maintain conversation, which may be the root of her awkwardness that slowly developed around me. I felt as though I've managed to bypass my autism with her a couple times before hand, and she felt mostly comfortable around me, although this slowly degraded overtime as I started holding her up to a pedestal after realizing that I really liked her and became extremely awkward again. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the semester ended we didn't really have any opportunities to see one another irl so I resorted to mostly online conversations, to which she seemed to respond sporadically to. Sometimes it would take days for her to respond, and on other she would be more responsive than usual (At least enough to get a lengthy conversation in). I tried to use as many opportunities as possible to arrange a meeting irl, but the online convos never lasted long enough for me to bring it up (partially because of my caution), and part of me is afraid that she would just find an excuse to reject the offer so I wanted to at least get a good conversation in so she feels comfortable enough to hang out. I did my best not to be overbearing online by either waiting until I get a response from her or starting a new conversation a couple days after the previous one, and although her responses were sometimes brief or dismissive (one word replies and such), she pretty much always responded enthusiastically. 

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest hurdle showed itself this week, when she started actively posting on social media in general while leaving me on unread on for days on end, and when she finally saw the message, I had been left on read for the first time (as in she's the only girl I talk to due to social incompetence, so it's not something I experience on the regular). She's a really nice girl, so the fact that I've gotten to the point that she would leave me on read isn't exactly good (there's also the fact that my last message was asking if she had a long day of work, which would seem strange to respond to after a couple days). 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm debating whether I should try to catch up with her online again later down the line to try to repair things or if I should wait until next semester when we may have classes together again to try to interact with her (our majors seems to have some of the same pre-requisites so it's possible). While talking to her online again may repair things, it may just result in me screwing up again, which could push her even further away in the event of us somehow meeting in class. Waiting until we see each other in class again may also be bad, as our last online conversation may increase the awkwardness levels between us, and considering the size of the lecture halls, it wouldn't be difficult to avoid me in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really feel like giving up as this is probably the only girl I ever have an opportunity with due to some of the previous history between us in high school, so I really only want genuine advice on how to repair the situation (which in this case would probably just be the option that isn't as bad) rather than ""I think it would be better to just give up"". I'm prepared to quit my pursuit of her, but that's something I want to decide on my own terms when I feel like it's absolutely done for.",20Jul2019,1

So I though I should spend some time with my dad for the summer because my step cousins were visiting and they're just too much to handle. I had to get to work some how and my dad is unemployed. I thought it would be a good time to get to know him also since he's been hinting at wanting me stay after him and my moms divorce a few years back. (My mom couldn't take me to work because she had work). A month  in and its all good nothing too bad. But recently, one of his friends died one night ( by suicide the cops suspect or something) The next morning I wake up, get dressed and sit on the couch with my phone, and I see my dad walk in the house with a big gun or something, I was shocked because he told me he had gotten rid of all his guns so I suspect its illegal. While going into the garage to hide his gun, he is on the phone with his friend. I overheard the convo about how he thinks some lady killed his friend. I dont come home the next morning cause he needs space for the day to get drunk. So I spend it with my grandma (dads side ) and shes talking about how he isnt crazy he's just messed up from the military ( ??yrs which he got kicked out for suspected of being in a gang ). Two weeks go by and recently he got super drunk with his friends at like 5-7 pm. I had just gotten back from picking up pizza with my sister ( who is in college and staying with him ). She opens the door to see a dog then my dad peer around the corner to get the dog saying weird things( I guess to  command the dog to calm down or move). I walk into the kitchen to greet the people and drop off a pizza. My dad is still mumbling to the dog to shut up drunkenly. My dad starts yelling things like imma kill you to the dog and scaring dog so it hides under the table( not his dog). He then goes into the garage to get his gun or something. I go upstairs with my sister. I hear him down stairs yelling at the dog again ( saying things like ""on crip ill kill you, cuz"" ) and to his freinds tell him to calm down. I'm upstairs trying not to be scared. Hoping he doesnt have his gun and it accidentally doesn't go off, and mainly because it reminds me off how he used to be when he wasn't depolyed and we lived in the same house. He was very verblly abusive and he used to scare me alot. His freinds leave and he goes upstairs. In just scared he might do something to me or somebody any day, I'm just scared to be around him in general. So what should I do besides leave.",20Jul2019,2

271,"I’m a teenager, and I live between houses of my mother and father. During the school year I’m with my mom, but during the summer I’m in a different state with my dad. 

Like most people, I have a lot of irrational fears, some weirder than others, but they don’t bother me too much. Until it’s the summer. At my mom’s, I’m busier, happier, and surrounded by love, support, and friends. Don’t get me wrong, my dad loves me very much, but he’s bad at being sensitive, giving me guidance and advice, and handling my emotions. Summer to me is three long months of quiet contemplation and loneliness in a hot, humid state. This is terrifying.

I find in the most dull moments, my fears are escalated. I have a terrible fear of bugs, for example. I tried to take a shower and saw a moth trapped in the light above the shower. I immediately got out and sat in the corner until I could psych myself up to get back in. Later that evening my brother thought it would be fun to describe to me a horrifying bug he saw, and I stayed awake the whole night tugging at my ears, scratching myself, and checking the floor and my covers, the whole time filled with unbearable anxiety. It’s insane to me how debilitating this fear is, and I want to know what I can do to toughen up. Like I said, my dad isn’t very easy to talk to. He wants to listen and help, but every time I reach out I’m left feeling like I’m a teenage girl, so I must be overreacting.

Another debilitating fear I’m dealing with is a fear of loss. Often when I sit around and think for a while, I start to imagine relatives, close friends, or my boyfriend dying tragic deaths or being taken away from me in a worst-case scenario. This is totally normal, as I’ve been told, but less normal that I let it bother me the rest of the day, sometimes breaking down crying imagining these situations, and other times having nightmares about them later on. I don’t even know where to begin expressing this one to my family; it just seems so commonplace. 

I’m losing sleep and willpower and feeling like crap constantly. Everyday life is made so much harder because I’m scared of the six inch white millipede waiting for me behind the coffee pot. I don’t know who I turn to or if I just need to get over myself (and if that’s the case—how??), and frankly—I’m scared.",20Jul2019,1

Anyway, I’m currently 18, for my sixteenth birthday my parents gave me my dads 2007 toyota fj cruiser he had been using for work (he got a work truck so he no longer has a use for it). I loved it, but i’m a car guy so i was always saying stuff like “this thing is so slow” yadda yadda, you know basic teenager-with-a-slow-car talk. In mid-March my dad got a promotion and a pay raise, and he was like alright tell you what, you find a car we both can agree on for $10k or less and we’ll go look at it. (Mom doesn’t know much about cars so she refused to give her opinion then, but now happily gives it lol). So after around two weeks of looking, I found a 2004 Subaru STi for $10k, and we went and checked it out, and i fell in love with it. My dad could tell and he liked it too, and so we got it. We purchased it from a guy who didn’t tell us the extent of the modifications he had done, so we thought we were buying a somewhat modded car. Unbeknownst to us, he had all sorts of stuff done, such as swapping the stock block for a stage 2 short block and had it fully built. He just sorta casually said “yeah it’s sorta built, nothing too fancy” when we were looking at it, so we had no idea. We got it March 19 of this year, now it’s just over three months later and I have a nine hour drive to college in less than a month, and after having it for these three months we’ve figured out all the stuff wrong with it, like halfassed stuff the guy we bought it from did just to get the job done. We never got around to selling the FJ cruiser, as the Subaru was in our garage while we were fixing something on it / at the shop getting something fixed. With college approaching and my interest in the car deteriorating, my parents gave me an ultimatum; the FJ cruiser or the Subaru. One is a reliable, sensible car, that I can trust will run when I need it to. The other is a perfect weekend car, and is fast and cool. It’s a 50/50 chance of it turning over. It’s a shitbox, but a shitbox I love. It’s been a week since my parents gave me the ultimatum and I’ve been having a very tough time deciding, it doesn’t help I’m already an indecisive person to begin with.

My boyfriend is a tutor at a math lab who I went to for math help but one day he asked me to have lunch with him. I’ve only interacted with him for about three weeks but he has already asked me out. He’s an international student and a bit older than me so we have difficulties finding things in common and talking about certain things due to a language barrier. 
We’ve only dated for maybe about a week but he keeps insisting me to hang out at his house. I’m not sure if it’s normal to go to your boy/girl friend’s house that early but I told him that I felt like we shouldn’t be meeting at his house because things keep escalating to quickly. For example, every time we are at his house he asks me if I could sit on his lap or lay next to him on the bed to cuddle or kiss. I like the feeling but I just feel guilty doing so because I just think it’s too much physical contact during the beginning of this relationship. His response to what I said was that he saw physical contact as a way to bond with someone. He does always tell me that he will never do anything I don’t want to do but he still prefers hanging out at his house than going on the date. I just feel like we are going to end up touching each other too much because we are in a private place. I’m just really confused. I think I like him but I also think I’m just falling for his touch. 
I’ve been unsure how long I should keep this relationship. I did previously tell him that I think it’s better for us to be friends first and build a relationship but he said he would be really sad and that he doesn’t think he could talk to me again which made me reluctant to break up with him.

Long story short: 

My grandma wanted to get money for the making of the house and asked me to get the money from my moms purse she was busy not listening I didn't know if I could do it or not so I waited for my mom to say something she finally noticed and gave my grandma the money but she started yelling saying how slow we were for money later on she says ""she doesn't want me to still her money omg.""

289,"I’ve always considered my father to be pretty crappy. Growing up in a divorced family, dad lived in another state, got remarried quickly, started a new family and didn’t ever really talk to my mom and my siblings anymore. We would still go visit during the year due to dual custody but my dad always seemed to not really care. He would only want to do stuff he liked to do and often times I’d find myself arguing with him. One of my siblings (the youngest from my full blood siblings) was obviously his favorite. My dad never really connected emotionally to any of us really. He’s always been one to keep to himself, goof around a lot and I’d get frustrated with him not seeming to care.

He never really supported me going through school, my academic achievements or personal. Would never make the journey to visit us for something I accomplished or my siblings (with the exception of high school graduations). As a young adult I found myself in therapy for many years to come to terms with it. I’d have to be the one constantly fighting for a relationship with my father who was never going to fight for one with me. Years of being a hopeful youth waiting for some kind of connection. I remember waiting for months checking the mail everyday because my father said he had sent something for a birthday or Christmas . The packages always seemed to “get lost” and never come. Therapy proved useful and I came to terms with the fact that my dad just wasn’t a superb father to me. (There’s a lot of other drama and stuff I just won’t go into but I hope you get the idea).

Anyways. Just the other day I was sitting with my older sibling and some friends, sharing some beers as we all sat around the table and laughed. The topics of families and parenting cane about. My usual coping strategy is to make jokes and a lot of them keep my father the butt of the joke. Yes I know this is petty but it keeps me sane. After making my usual joke my sibling made a comment about health histories and that a certain disease she had wasn’t genetic.  I corrected them stating our father had sleep apnea and that if my sibling was showing signs of it they should talk to her doctor because it runs in our family.  My sibling then let slip that our father developed sleep apnea from his PTSD from being in the military. I knew about my dads military past but the way my sibling said it made me curious. The alcohol made her confess more than the usual. She had asked my mother recently about sleep apnea running in the family and our mother let slip that our father got sleep apnea from being a POW (prisoner of war). She talked about how our father had been deployed during desert storm and in 1991 he landed in Iraq and was immediately taken hostage with 2 other service members. He was held for who knows how long. Who knows what he endured . The other 2 were apparently killed and my father was the only one to survive . He returned home to my mother  (pregnant at the time in 1991) and later went back to Iraq. He was transferred from one camp where his good friend was at to another . Soon after his transfer, his original camp where his friend was stationed was attacked and bombed. Like nobody survived. They sent him and his camp to clean up the bodies . 

My mother told my sister to never mention it. Our father always held survivor’s guilt. To our knowledge he never got help for it. He never talked about what happened to him while he was a POW.  After finding out this information, a lot of things clicked for me. How he is able to easily turn off his emotions, distance himself from people, keep to the things he knows. I’m not saying it excuses his actions over the years but it makes a little more sense.

Now here’s where I need the advice. My sister specifically told me never to mention this to my dad. Apparently nobody knows how he would react. She said he would “disappear for days if this was brought up”. But I can’t leave this alone I want to know more detail than my sister is giving me. Do I ask my mother directly? Do I ask my stepmother directly (I don’t ever talk to this woman and we hardly get along)? Other than my sister, nobody in my family knows that I know this. I wonder how many others know something.

At first she was told that it was fine, though when she went for a check up they told her that they should have increased her thyroxin and she was misinformed. About 6 months later they told her that her Thyroxin meds were too high and she should have been losing weight (she hadn't lost much if any). And they put her meds down again.

I can try and provide further details if required, though she does not know I am posting this.

She isn't a huge girl, I personally don't think she needs weight and I tell her this.

Does anyone know anything about this sort of thing and can give us advice to help her out. She is very upset and frustrated especially as she tries so hard and this week she has actually put on 3 pounds.",20Jul2019,1
295,"This past week was full of problems.  After I told my 2 bfs (they are brothers, lets call them mr16 and mr17) that I was pregnant and that I cheated on both of them. Mr 16 was aggressive and ended up hurting me. Mr17 was heart broken but he still wants to be with me, he still wants to support me with this problems.

Mr16 threatened that he will my parents everything, he also told/swore to me that he will kill me if I ever talk to mr17 again. He told me to abort  the baby too. I told mr17 that mr16 is threatening me. Then 4 days ago, mr16 and mr17 met each other in their mothers house, their parents are divorced and they live separated with each one parents. They aren't close and they almost never speak to each other. When they met they ended up in a huge fight, mr17 told me, I face/video called him and saw bruises on his face.

Then 2 days, mr16 showed up in my house with our WhatsApp texts printed on a paper. All my family were home and he stood In front of our house, called my father and started saying everything non stop. He threw the papers to us and he also printed my pics that I took without hijab. My family are muslims.

My family were all furious at me, they believed every word of course, he also told them that I am pregnant. My father wanted to beat me up but I ran to my room and locked the door. They shouted to open the door but I didn't, they told me to pack my things and to get out.

I ended up taking everything I need. And I called mr17 because I had no one else. I went to his fathers house and I am now still with them.

298,"Hi all

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to try to explain myself as clearly as I can. I have lost all desire to be alive anymore. It's like nothing makes me go ""fuck, I'm lucky to be alive"", you know? There's nothing that is able to provoke that kind of emotion in me. I don't really *love* anything. Yes, there are some things that I do enjoy (listening to music, sleeping, and that's pretty much it), but I don't have that one thing that everyone seems to have that drives them and pushes them to become better and better. The only thing I ever do anymore is go to the gym (it's summer so I'm not currently attending classes in college), listen to music and sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I study medicine and honestly I only got into med school because I knew it would pay the bills and provide financial stability, not because I actually love it. I don't hate it, but it's not my dream job if you will. I don't think I have one. There's nothing I'd like to do professionally. Growing up I never had that dream of becoming anything as a lot of kids seem to have. And sadly I still don't.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any real friends either. The people I talk to occasionally are all from med school and we are what you would call ""school friends"". We don't really care about each other's lives. We only talk to each other when we need something from the other person and that's pretty much it. I guess you get the point.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd go so far as to say that I have never truly had any real friends, but then I'd be lying. I'm currently going in my sophomore year at college (idk how med school works in the US, but I'm 19 and I finished high school in 2018 so I guess you get the point) and during my first year I did meet somebody who just completely blew my mind. He became my entire support system and I relied on him for literally everything. He was always there and so was I for him. I guess that over time I ended up falling in love with him. Anyways I'll spare you the details of that. In the end, he decided he'd be better off just cutting me out of his life and so, he did. Around that time I had also befriended his best friend, who had become another big part of my life. She'd be there for me everytime he wasn't and I thought she had become really something, you know? Somebody I could trust, I guess. However, when he left me, so did she. They just completely disappeared and abandoned me. No explanations given whatsoever. 

&amp;#x200B;

As one can imagine, I started to fall into a deep black hole that I'm still trying to crawl my way out of. I had always felt isolated and out of place my entire life. Until I met him. He kind of made me see life in a different way. He made me wanna get out of bed every morning and he just made everything easier. I don't know. The thing is when he left, he took a part of me and I still haven't been able to get it back. In a way, it's like he would cover all the bad things in life, and by leaving, it's like the curtain that cover all of that suddenly just disintegrated.

&amp;#x200B;

For a couple of months I decided to just focus on studying and not think about it. And I did. But now that it's summer the only thing I ever do is think about him and the way he made me feel. Over time I guess I will forget him, but I still feel like there is nothing in life that I wanna do. I feel like I did before I met him. No hobbies, no real friends, no drive, nothing. I live what one would call a relatively good life. I live with my mother and sister. We have a relatively good relationship. We are financially stable. Everything is going well on the outside. But inside my mind it's a complete disaster. Hell I can't even watch a movie anymore because I just don't have the energy to sit through a 90 minute activity and pay close attention.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, the only thing I do is go to the gym. And that's because I'm not honestly comfortable in my own body. Which is even more weird because I am relatively fit, skinny but muscular and I still feel like it's not good enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, this was supposed to be a rant about how I have failed to find something in life that makes me wanna be alive, and ended up me spilling all of my thoughts into this post. I honestly don't know how to cope anymore. Everyone tells me I'm young and I should live life to the fullest. But honestly what am I supposed to do when there is nothing in life that makes me want to be alive?",20Jul2019,18
299,"I have a feeling that I'm projecting my own feelings onto him and that he doesn't really like me more than as a friend anyway. But I definitely don't want to lead him on. The bullet-pointed story: 

- I told him some months ago that I felt like I was forming feelings for him. But he couldn't say anything due to professional circumstances 

- I then later on told him that whilst I liked him, I don't think I'm ready for a relationship due to my own life circumstances and that I don't want to hurt anyone. He said that it's fine and that we could just be friends and that any guy would wait for me to be ready if he truly liked me 

- Now the professional circumstances are no longer there, and he has offered us to have a coffee together. He also asked about my current plans and questions about my friends and ex

He's always been kind to me. Listened to me whenever I needed help. Essentially taking care of me. And whenever I'm with him in person, he does seem interested. Though he seems to be fine without texting me frequently at all. But the issue is that he claims to have never asked out a girl before and that all of his previous girlfriends were a result of them asking him out. So from this I can guess he'd be silent about his intentions?

See, I'm from a small town in a country that's not very developed. Most people here aren't aware of the gravity of rape and sexual assualt. They even sometimes use it as a punchline. Some ass-clown made a small writing on the stage of the university open-air theater saying that rape is ""not a crime"" but a ""surprise romance"". Yep, that's the shit I'm dealing wih. Victim blaming also isn't an uncommon sentiment with the people here.

I don't have a problem with dark humor, but the point of dark humor is to juxtapose something serious and heavy like rape with some nonchalance or levity. Dark humor concerning rape or assault first acknowledges both as being grave and horrible. They don't seem to realize that at all. I don't know if this makes it worse, but the people I'm planning to speak with are women themselves.

Here's the background

I'm in a co ownership of a restaurant. It was doing well for the first few years and it is a good restaurant. Myself and the other co owner are the chefs. The last few years business hasn't been growing and its slowly getting worse. There are many obvious reasons for this and I'm trying to address it but my other co owner is very negative about everything we try and stops us or when he thinks of ideas it's not thought out and just terrible. I've had numerous staff leave because of him and customers complain about him. His quality of work ethic and food prep has progressively gotten worse. 

If you ever watched kitchen nightmares it's actually getting to that stage.

So basically we both own 50/50. I did put in at least 20% more than him in the business but we at that time old friends and we agreed to 50/50. Stupid me! (I did however get him to sign a contract to either equal his share in the business or return the money to me from the profits we made before any dividends were released.)

The co owner wont sell or buy my shares and refuses to sell the company. 

My question is is it possibly to release shares for investors to buy, but have myself buy the shares in order to gain majority to either run or dissolve the company?

I’ve ended toxic friendships, started a gym routine, ordered more books to read, got a job, working on improving my style, and just trying to be a well rounded person. 

I’m trying make my senior year one for self improvement. I really don’t like most of the people I go to school with and I’m ready to get out there and blaze my own trail. My dad works at a local college and they have a program that allows the children of employees to attend over 300 colleges across the country for free. All I have to pay for is books, housing, and food. I’m really excited about it.

I’m ready to begin my own life. I want to go to a school across the country and completely start over. I want to meet new friends and hopefully meet an amazing girl (one of the reasons why I’m working out so much lol), 

I’m also really trying to work on my social skills. I work as a cashier at Walmart so I’ve been learning how to talk to strangers. I make myself look like an idiot sometimes but practice makes perfect. People in general don’t usually take me seriously. I’m 5,4 and kinda skinny. That’s why I’m hoping with some gym time and confidence and a complete change of character people will start to see me as a man. 

It can get lonely though. I do miss my ex gf as I was the one who ended things (the relationship got kinda toxic, her brother was an asshole) she tries to make me jealous, she moved onto a new guy in 2 weeks and told me recently that he’s done more for her in 2 months than I did in 9 months. That gave me the drive to improve even more. I want to meet a girl who will appreciate the things I do for her. 

I’m changing my style as I mentioned earlier. I want to look more rustic and manly. I’ve been trying to wear more jeans with timbs and jackets or brown dress shoes with khakis and a collared shirt. When it’s hot I usually try to wear plain t-shirts or collard shirts with dressy shorts or cargo shorts. 

I’m just very excited about my future and what could happen. I want to forget my past and move on. So much drama and bs has happened in the past few months I’m just really to become my own man. I’ve been watching videos on how to fix shit around my house and I’ve really been trying to figure out how I react in situations so I can become a better leader.

It's related to a old tinder match. We had small conversations up until around March/April. We still follow each other on insta and the communication now is rare and small. But what confuses me is the use of the X by people other than family. 

I'd see the single X used a bit. But on certain messages I'd see the XX. Example being me sending a picture of a weird statue in the town she was in. With her reply ending with the XX

332,"I'm at Uni and live with my boyfriend and our friends, we've been dating 3/4 months. (I'm 24, he's 21)

We barely ever talk or spend actual time together, I try to communicate with him but he just does his own thing and doesn't seem interested, mainly because I go to work and he works on commissions.
When we tried to have sex the other night I put in a lot of effort for him by buying lingerie that was his kink and go to the gym a lot to stay toned but he couldn't maintain an erection and I felt like he lost attraction for me but I comforted him and told him it was okay and that he probably needed to eat better or smoke less.

It doesn't really feel like we're boyfriend and girlfriend, it just feels like we're good friends who occasionally have sex, I know if we broke up we'd still be friends.

But over the past two days, I have been recognised in public twice. Once was at a festival and the other was just in a mall, adding to this I got a comment a couple minutes ago asking if I filmed a video in a certain spot and yes I did film it there, the comment went on to say ""I think I saw you in \*\*\*\*\* mall last week lol"". I'm honestly concerned and as my followers grow I'm scared this will be a more common occurrence and I don't want that, having people hug me as if they know me really well is pretty awkward and uncomfortable.  Seeing as I don't feel how I think someone with status should. I don't feel like I deserve this attention. I'm slightly concerned about the safety of my privacy.

My girlfriend knows about my anxiety and is very supporting even though shes very social and doesn't understand it however recently I've dropped out of a social day with her family because ik I will not cope and I'll make a fool of myself.

She respects my choice however shes using it against me in certain ways like saying ""if I make you so happy why dont you see me"" and I try to explain clearly that it's not that simple.

335,"Hi.
So I met this guy at work training back in February and instantly we had great chemistry. However the training only lasted a few days and I never got his contact info. Thankfully, I found him on Instagram later on (he’s an old friend’s cousin??) and he dmed me first and we talked everyday for a few months from then on. Thing is: he’s left for the Air Force Academy (which I already knew) and he’s Mormon (his parents were very strict on who he dates). We had so much in common, and he was a really big light in my life but those two things really blocked us from it. So May/June comes around and we sort of drift apart - I do it because I know there’s no chance really, I wish I had talked to him about this but I didn’t want to seem annoying. And then on his last day before boot camp, I tell him “Ya know, I really liked you. I guess life just be like that” - I can’t confront people without making jokes, I’m working on it - and he basically said the same thing. And told me to write to him (which made me happier than needed). I have and I’m waiting on his second reply.
Thing is, I’m not sure if this will go anywhere. The odds of it are really stacked high against me but he is a SUCH a great guy and we have so much in common. I honestly cannot stop thinking about him ((daily)). What should I do?",20Jul2019,2
336,"Been going back and forth all week on whether to go to my cousin's wedding...some backstory:

We are not close, and pretty much none of my family interacts with me. I grew up with my dad and his family 2 states away until I moved here 7 years ago to be with my mom and her family.

Despite occasional visits, we were never close. I do take some of the blame here as my moving here was not by choice and I spent the first few years wallowing in depression and avoiding contact. I've made a few attempts to get close to them but it's like no matter what I'm always forgotten. Even my mom gets along better with them, and I'll see pictures and posts of them (them being my younger brother, various cousins and family)  going to movies and etc. without even asking me. 

I feel like they expect me to be there, but no one has given me an address, no one sent an invite, no one asked about a gift, I dont even know what time it is today! Should I make the effort and go anyway or just say forget it?",20Jul2019,4

338,"Hi, I need to get makeup to cover acne scars. I have a skydiving trip in two weeks which I’m excited about, but unfortunately there was a breakout on my skin and neck. They’ve healed enough to be smooth but are very visible and dark spots. I paid a lot for a picture package and don’t want it to be ruined by that :/

I’ve never done makeup before and don’t know what to get. Anyone experience with makeup have any recommendations for concealers? How do I get one that matches my skin tone. I do not want it to be obvious that I’m wearing makeup either, do I have to worry about it looking natural at home with indoor lighting then looking uneven in the pictures from outdoor lighting?",20Jul2019,1
339,"Long story short, I own my own house and my best friend moved in with me (previously with her boyfriend but they split up). We used to have a fantastic relationship before I realised what an enormous ball ache she is. 

My parents sadly passed away and left me the house - so naturally, I have a lot of respect and love for this place and my mother taught me to look after it. I wouldn’t say I’m necessarily OCD, but I definitely have high standards of cleanliness. Over the time she’s been here, it’s honestly just gotten worse.

Since we were best friends I assumed she would understand and respect the house similar as I do. That wasn’t the case whatsoever - I’m an animal lover and agreed to let her have her dog here with her (I have animals myself too); this soon turned into disaster as she didn’t want him sleeping downstairs and only in her room. She never used to mop up the water spilt from the water bowl and over time this caused the wooden floor to rot and raise. It took me saying “you’ll have to replace the floor” for her to move his water/food downstairs. So clearly money is an incentive for change. 

Now, he’s a fairly large dog and he sheds enormously. She doesn’t keep up with cleaning up his hair (I have wooden floors and rugs placed throughout the house), there’s dog shit all throughout my garden, and never apologises when I step in it because she’s too lazy to clean it up. Dishes are sometimes left for weeks, she can’t be bothered to buy her own toilet paper, cleaning supplies or food. She doesn’t help me with the chores and will just watch me while I do them. The girl doesn’t even know how to flush a toilet and there’s regularly turds floating in the communal bathroom of which we share. I’m genuinely embarrassed for her. Her room absolutely stinks and is filthy, the smell even carries through the house (so I become really  conscious of it when I have friends over). I am not her maid or her mother, but purely out of frustration I find myself cleaning up after her as I cannot stand the state she allows it to get to. 

We have had countless conversations about her keeping tidy (of which I now realise she doesn’t care) and I’m at my wits end. I begin my Masters in September and I refuse to continue to let things slide as much as I have been. I also really don’t need the added frustrations if I come home to a filthy house because she’s too idle. I really honestly don’t know what else to do apart from ask her to leave; but then that would surely end the relationship completely.",20Jul2019,1

341,"TLDR at bottom. My mom is just an example of a stone cold hypocrite and she can’t help but hold other people to higher standards than herself. Whenever she wants to know something even if it’s none of her business she expects and demands a nuanced explanation. Yet when the tables are turned and you want her to explain, she doesn’t have to answer to anyone because she isn’t on trial. In comparison to how grateful I am for the gift of life, she’s just massively ungrateful towards her whole family. We constantly do things to make her life easier but she tells us that we don’t do anything at all. She would’ve gone out and bought a whole new lawnmower last week if I didn’t take the carburetor apart and clean it. She’s doesn’t think about things like that. It doesn’t cross her mind that I could’ve just said I didn’t know what was wrong and sent her to spend money on a new mower. It’s like it doesn’t mean anything to her because she could’ve done it with her own money. When she wanted me to fix a doorknob and a shower faucet I told her I would do it later because I had to go grab the tools. She continues to ask me why the tools I have out already won’t work. That question about lit me on fire because why explain that to her if she never has to answer to me for anything so naturally I got very annoyed. These are only a couple of examples and I don’t even argue anymore because arguing leads to one place and one place only. She will say “you don’t even have to talk to me or be around me” which is very true but it just doesn’t feel fair not to be able to have a relationship with my mother when I want it so bad I am just unwilling to take things from her that she will not take back from me. I don’t know what to do I’m torn between moving to another state and staying here trying to solve problems with my mother before I can get on with my life. I have the means to leave I just cant do it without resolving my relationship with my mother. If I left and she died without this situation being resolved I’d be crushed.

TLDR: My mother and I have very conflicting personalities and her answer to every argument ultimately is that I don’t have to be around her or in her life at all if I don’t want to. And it kind of sends the message like she doesn’t even care if I move somewhere else and just leave which kind of hurts. I don’t want to leave without being on good terms with my mother because if she were to pass while I’m gone I wouldn’t know what to do with myself.",20Jul2019,4

344,"first off ,we worked for a fashion brand together. I do everything even though she was assigned the brand manager.  Literally took her job and fixed the brand after the mess she left. (she lied about a lot of things)  I had to take in multiple creative hats and worked hard so that the brand can grow even though i was the only person left in marketing (i did copywriting, graphic design, promos)  We grew a 1000+ following in a month after she was gone and her job was replaced by someone better. 

The frustrating part is, i look at her instagram, and her bio literally says ""Brand manager for @____"" and she STILL stories the brand's posts like it all came from her. Its been a month. This isnt something you forget. I can tell everything is intentional. She has nothing to do with it but she posts it on her stories to brag to her followers. Im so frustrated. I work so hard and i dont even talk about the brand to my personal account but I see her flaunting my hard work like its hers. She hid her stories from me too (along with my friends and the brand) and I only found out because her account is public.  I blocked her on the brand's ig account. Is that the right thing to do? Should I just leave her alone? I feel like im being immature or petty but at the same time she doesnt stop.

TLDR; Old brand manager still brags about her old job on her instagram like she never resigned. Brags about the posts ive made like it was hers.",20Jul2019,4
345,"I am a 25M who is single. I have come to the conclusion that my standards must be too high.

Compared to most of my friends, my standards for physical appearance are WAY higher. I used to think theirs are too low but I'm slowly starting to think my friends are right.

The thing is, I want a girlfriend I find attractive and beautiful. I don't even care too much about the body especially since you can work on that.

But I have a few requirements for a woman's appearance that are absolutely necessary. Unlike my friends I'm not the kinda guy who just wants a skinny girl and that's it.
Some of them:

- Full lips
- Decent nose
- Nice eyes
- Good cheekbones
- Good facial proportions (no fivehead, no horseface, please)
- Good smile/teeth


How am I supposed to ""lower"" my standards? Does that even work? I can't really change what I am attracted to am I?

My friends have showed me pictures of girls they think are in my league or above and I honestly either thought ""nah"" or I was simply repulsed.

I know how harsh this sounds but I just think the majority of girls out there are unattractive. Like 95%-98%

And I'm constantly being rejected by the top girls, while I have to reject girls who I find ugly.

I just can't accept the girls who have been interested in me.

One of them had close set eyes and a bit of a hook nose which is a no no. The other girls had thin lips or no bone structure to speak off.

I realize I sound terribly shallow, but I can't change who I am attracted to.

Is this how most men work? They call every butterface ""hot""?",20Jul2019,0
346,"I suppose most guys fear approaching girls because they fear rejection. I do not fear rejection.

I fear being seen as an aggressive male, a sexual animal, who exerts his horny penis all over women. Who makes his sexual desires known at any cost to get the pussy. A disgusting animal who cannot control his urges. A potential rapist. A potential stalker. A horny dog. A sex crazed animal.

As a result, I have always been terrified to let a girl know I am attracted to her or like her. Somewhere deep inside, my inner self tells me to never let a girl know. Because she will then believe I am just another typical man. An animal, a dog controlled by his horny penis.

Now consciously, logically, I know it’s not true. Logically I know girls like when a guy does certain things.

For example I have a bit of a crush on a girl. Guess what I did? Despite all that I feel negatively inside, I managed to get her by the hand and I pulled her in for a kiss. She came willingly. She wanted to kiss me. It was such a nice kiss too!

But my inner self has the power. All we did is kiss, and now I can’t do anything more. I know this girl wants me to just “take” her. But I cannot. The demon inside me tells me that she will be upset with me and hate me for wanting her. For liking her. Even though she kissed me. She’s so beautiful and I love her personality, and yet I’m scared to tell her how I feel. I’m terrified to tell her how I feel. I keep reading about how girls like when a guy tells her how he feels and yet I’m absolutely terrified inside. Because inside it tells me she will hate me for being a horny mindless sex crazed animal.

There is another girl. She is such a sweetheart. She flirts with me all the time. She hugs me. She leans on me and lays her head on my shoulder. She pokes me and slaps my butt or touches me in other ways. I love it. In a way, she is literally teaching me how to flirt. 

But when I try to flirt back, that little demon inside me  rears it’s head. For example, we will pass by eachother and ‘hit’ eachother, or bump into eachother. Especially if one of us comes from behind the other. So I’ll come from behind her, and have the idea to just poke her in her side. Just a little poke with my finger. And just before I do it, I’ll abandon the whole plan, because that little demon pops up and says “don’t do that! That is a display of sexual attraction! She will think you’re a horny thirsty animal and hate you for it!”

So after missing 5 chances to have a small flirt with her, I finally overcome that little demon and I manage to poke her. And she smiles and pokes me back and bumps me with her hip. And she comes and hugs me and it’s always nice. P.S. this girl must be so patient with me lol. She does 95% of the flirting and I’m always so scared to flirt back. It’s taken literally months for me to feel comfortable enough to initiate a hug. Now I have been hugging her every time I see her yay! She had to initiate all of the hugs but now I can too. But Jesus it shouldn’t have taken this long to get to that point.

It’s really depressing. I know girls want to flirt with me. But I just can’t get that little voice to stop. Even when a girl is flirting with me like crazy it takes so much for me to suppress it enough to actually take action.
Like I’m literally crying, because I feel like I will be alone forever. Not because I’m not worthy of love. But because I’m so screwed up in the head.

I also can’t believe that any girl would ever like me. Even though I know one does, she flirts with me all the time. I know a few girls like me. Friends have passed the word to me that x and y girls like me. So I know some do.

And I do like one of them. And yet I can’t say anything to her. Because deep down inside I cannot believe it’s true. I still feel like once I take that step, she will recoil in disgust at how much of a sexual animal I am. A disgusting man waving his penis trying to catch some vagina like a fish. That’s I how truly feel deep down and it just won’t go away. 

I am so lonely and alone. I want to flirt and be normal with girls. But this “belief” I have is so solid, so deep down, I just can’t get it to go away. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to change this belief.",20Jul2019,2

Hey guys, so I was in a relationship with a 27 year old man. I am 17. He was divorced and had a 4 year old girl. We did have differences I know, but we really loved each other and we was genuinely respectful of me in every way. Him and I lived 17 hours and 49 minutes away from each other. Him and I were strangers for 7 months and then we met just for about 15/20 minutes. He came down here just to see me. 
     How we started talking? He had just joined instagram and he thought I was someone else and being nice, he apologised and thats how we started talking. We were friends for about 2/3 months and I was the one to tell him to join tinder and find a girl for himself and don’t get me wrong he is good looking but he still chose me, someone who lives far away, has restriction being from a brown family and has differences. We were madly in love without evenhaving met each other or video called. We talked on call and texted. I know sounds crazy hey? And maybe stupid, I know, if someone said all of this to me 7 months ago I would’ve said the same. 


So everything was perfect, he came down, he was even more gorgeous in person and had a warmth to him and i loved those 15/20 minutes with him. 
My brown family found out about it after two days of him and i met each other. Shit went down if you’re brown you know what i mean. Having married before, aged 27 everybody was pissed as fuck. I had talked to his mum maybe once or twice but he told her i was 18 bcz nobody was gonna like me being under 18 although we never had anything sexual and him and i knew what we shared and we planned on eventually telling everyone in a couple of years about age and fixing things. He was willing to wait for me, until i did uni, found a job. He never forced me to run away or settle as soon as i turn 18 or anything like that. Basically he was genuine. 
And yeah him and I aren’t in contact, when his family found out i was not 18 his family and my family both were mad and deleted our contacts. His number is changed, blocked me off ig, removed me off sc. We were never friends on Facebook so i cam still see him from there and my private ig account. 
So basically i am gonna wait until i am 18 and go see him bcz i know him and he said he will always love me. Am i stupid to thibk that way?",20Jul2019,0

A lot has happened since this post. First of all i’d like to thank everyone for their kind words, I didn’t expect that post to blow up like that. It’s been very rough and dealing with everything is very hard. Many of you suggested I breakup with my girlfriend. We have been dating for 6 years, and this is the first time she’s ever acted like this. She’s been there for me with everything but she just blew up at me about the guns because she’s so against them for some reason. To those who said i’m a “loser” for not standing up to my girlfriend, i’m in no mental state to even do basic addition. 

I was told to have the firing pins removed, and after some thought I will not being doing this. I plan on having children one day, and I would like to teach them how to shoot with these rifles just as I was taught. It would mean the world to me to pass down these memories. I’m not here to debate guns, so please leave that out of this. 
Having the firing pins removed would have only been a temporary solution as one day i’d have to get them put back in. 

So what happened? Well, we talked and she’s still strongly against having them in our home. However, she’s never shot a gun in her life, and I told her i’d like to shoot them one last time. I asked her if she would like to come along and shoot for the first time to ease her mind about having them in the house. She agreed and we’re going this weekend. The situation is less hostile now, and she did apologize for over reacting. 

I have an oak gun cabinet with lock and key that was also my grandfathers, thats where I would store the rifles. 

Thanks again everyone. You’ve provided so much support it’s insane.",20Jul2019,338
349,So I’m 18 y/o and I have got my first girlfriend. We’ve been together almost a year and we love each other. I’m not gonna be naive and say it’ll last forever but as of right now she’s very important to me. My father has reacted horribly because it goes against the religion of Islam that we were brought up in. I told him I wanted us to have a good relationship and for things to be normal but he says I’m partially on my own now and he’s only going to spend his money and time primarily on his parents and his business because I’m not following Islamic traditions. He also says it’s his goal to make sure I die a Muslim so he will never let up on treating me different until I leave my gf and start practicing Islam again. I offered for us to go to counselling but he says they are a waste of time and asked if I’d pay for half of it in a really snide way. I love my dad and want a close relationship with him but he’s made it clear that’s not going to happen until I become Muslim again. I don’t know what to do.

351,"Hey all, long time lurker, first-time poster (using throwaway).

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently undertaken an engineering degree full-time while working a full-time job for 4-5 years. It was a massive undertaking, and I managed to keep a decent GPA. Honestly, I'm proud of myself and can recognise the achievement. 

&amp;#x200B;

Toward the end though - during 4th year, I was going crazy, and I promised myself that I'd get a new motorcycle if I completed it with a high distinction average (first class honours), which I did, but I also didn't think I'd achieve that, so it was a bit of a joke to myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to hold myself to it though because I made that promise, and don't want to go back on my own word. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I can afford the bike I want in cash, but I worry that i'm going overboard. Even when I considered getting a nintendo switch instead as a low-cost alternative, I still felt the same. I don't feel like spending money, because I feel like it's frivolous, and I don't need it. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, I worry that if I don't reward myself, there will be nothing worth working for in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that I've felt really non-functional since finishing the degree (I feel like I'm going insane). I've lost track of what makes me happy and how to go about my day. I started stuttering in 4th year during social situations a bit (because when I wasn't working or sleeping, I was studying). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I realise that there are probably deeper issues, but I don't know if I should go ahead with my promise to myself. So many motivational pieces suggest rewarding yourself, but I don't feel like I can regulate it or do that properly.",20Jul2019,2
352,"I've been hiding my bulemia for a little under 10 yeas. The fear of having a pot belly like my father, or being seen as undesirable to women has often led me to groom in ways my Father would classify as gay, not that I have a problem with gay, but his hate of homosexuals impressed negatively on my perception of gay peoplee  in my younger years. Shaving my pits and chest, maintaining a clean lowcut pubic area, etc. These things were all frowned upon while growing up. So image was a big deal in my house growing up. If I gained weight, I was considered a cat slob. Lost too much, I look like a weakling. There was no medium.

But now, after so many years of conditioning,  I constantly find myself still purging almost after every meal. I find a way to discretely excuse myself, and purge full meals. Gross right, I know it's gross, I want to stop, but I dunno how.  I'm 5'7, and weigh 144lbs. I'm just scared that if I stop I'm gonna balloon up.

For background, let me mention that I absolutley lust after thick women, I think a pot belly on a female is incredibly sexy, and thick thighs, a couple of rolls or curves drives me wild. So it's not about weight shaming, I just have this residual image of myself I feel would turn people off about me.

353,"I would really appreciate any advice on how my family can handle this stressful and fragile situation. My aunt (we’ll call her P) and my uncle (C) have been married for over 10 years, and I do believe that originally it was a happy marriage.

However.

In the last couple of years C has gone completely off the rails. His mental health has tanked and he is genuinely crazy. He threatened to shoot the postman, their kid’s dog mysteriously “vanished” (we all think he killed it) and he sometimes takes my aunt’s phone off her so when my mum used to text her there would be no reply. We suspect he is emotionally/mentally abusing her.

My aunt has quit the job she loved, never leaves the house and hasn’t seen any of her sisters or her elderly mother in over a year. (They live nearby, distance isn’t the reason.) Everything she used to do has just... stopped. The last couple of times we drove to their house, we could see people inside but the door stayed locked and no one answered.

Everyone is very worried about my aunt. The last time we saw Uncle C, he sat in the corner of their kitchen, chain smoked and ranted about pedophilia and other horrible, extremely inappropriate stuff in front of their 8 year old kid. Everything that comes out of his mouth is rude, mean, awful or all three. He swears constantly and goes off on crazy conspiracy theory tangents. He is a completely different person to who he used to be, and his bizarre, awful behaviour has clearly taken a toll on P. His constant smoking has made her asthma worse and given her multiple chest infections, and she does basically everything for him (cooking, cleaning, parenting etc), but she still loves him and won’t leave him despite the fact that she’s obviously unhappy.

The only person that has seen P in our family in the last year is her brother, and he says that things aren’t looking good. Our family is considering staging some sort of intervention, but without damning proof to show the police there’s not actually a whole lot we can do if P won’t leave.

355,"Hi there, I'm completely new to reddit and joined as per recommendation by a friend like... yesterday. I'm not sure if this is the right place for my question but, I read the rules and I hope it is!

Basically, I am in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend. We were from the same hometown growing up, but he got a scholarship in the states so we don't attend the same university. He got a job in his field, so he didn't come home for the summer but his family is well off, so we have visited a few times. He will fly to me, or I will fly to him (I pay for my own flights). A few weeks ago, he was flying down to visit for Canada Day Weekend, because I had that Monday off from my job. Anyway, he had a morning flight on Saturday (7:45am or so) and missed it by sleeping in. His roommate, who also had to wake up that day for an appointment, also slept in. When I woke up, I had a text from my boyfriend saying he slept in and missed the flight but booked one in which he would arrive 5 hours later. Here is where my question comes in...

I was quite hurt honestly by the text. I'll admit, he isn't the most punctual person, but he works late hours sometimes and he says he must have just been really sleep deprived. I didn't want it to be awkward or start an argument over an accident so I acted like everything was fine. In reality though, I felt like he couldn't even wake up in time to see me, even though I've done so for him countless times and I work late hours as a bartender. It just made me feel like he didn't care/I wasn't so much of a priority. He acted like it wasn't a big deal either, but the lost 5 hours reduced our short 30ish ours together to 25ish. I got the impression that he would be angry at me if I was upset, so I just let it go. So, how could I have handled this better?",20Jul2019,2
356,"So some background. I started studying computer science at my community college when I was 22. After two years there I transferred to a four year school with the intention of continuing my studies in CS while taking up a physics minor, but there was an issue with the transfer of my transcripts. By the time it was sorted out I was told that the CS program wasn't accepting more students.
 I decided that I would just do a physics major and down the line maybe switch. Well I never did, not because I was happy about the physics, rather I think I just got so caught up in the course work that I kind of forgot about the computer science. 

In my second year at the university I decided to join a research group that was studying lead-free solders for microelectronic applications. They needed somebody to do simulations and I figured that that was at least closer to CS than the alternatives. 

At the end of my third year (it took three years to graduates instead of two due to the major switch) I had no idea what I was going to do. The university has this program where you can take graduate level courses in your senior year of you B.S. and then continue straight to a M.S. (in Materials Science) and finish in a year. I decided do that.

I'll be finished with my M.S. next month and I need to decide what I'm going to do.

I know that whatever it is that I end up doing, it wont be related to my research. While I do find what I do interesting, I do not want have it be the focus of my life. Currently I spend the majority of my time in a lab focusing on the movement of atoms while the rest of the world goes on outside.

I would like to work in a field such as data analytics or quantitative finance. I've done some research on the field and have read a few books and it seems like something I'd enjoy. I enjoy analyzing data and finding trends, which I often do in my current research, and being able to work with real world data sets is a plus.

However, I also don't like leaving things unfinished. While I've made progress with my research, there is still more to be done. My adviser was nice enough to reserve funding for me in case I decide to continue with graduate school, but there is a time limit on that, they cant hold onto it forever. I'm told that If I continue with grad school I would be able to get my PhD in about 2 years.

I have idea what to do. I've been in school for so long, I'm starting to feel almost useless. I'm 28 and I haven't done anything professionally that I can say I'm proud of. I do well in school, but its only school. I really just want to move on and start my life.

That being said, I've spent the better part of the last three years on my research. It was slow going in the beginning because I was the only one working on the project, my group is otherwise entirely experimental, but now I think I'm getting somewhere. If I stop now then then it was all for nothing. If I keep going then at least at the end of two years I'll have some meaningful results and the title of Dr. to go along with the piece of paper.

Another pro of continuing with the PhD is that it gives me another two years to hone the data analytics skills I have and to learn more about quantitative finance on the side. Also from what I've seen many job postings for data analytics or quant jobs do say the prefer quantitative PhDs.

I'm just looking for some outside opinions. 

Thank you.

TLDR; I Have spent the last three years doing Physics/Materials Science research that I don't particularly enjoy. I'm about to graduate with my M.S. and need to decide if I will continue for another two years and get meaningful results and a PhD, or look for jobs in data analytics or quantitative finance and leave my research behind. Either way I will not be continuing my research after school.",20Jul2019,1
357,"Just to put things into perspective:
I hadn’t told anybody how I felt about him.
I’ve been good friends with him for a few years now, and I never tried to hide the fact that I liked him but nobody (especially not him) seemed to pick up on that.
And now recently, him and one of my best friends have started dating.
I’ve let her know, she’s okay with it. I’m not going to sabotage their relationship and she trusts that I won’t do that which makes this situation easier.
Unfortunately, I’ve been irritated with him recently and have been avoiding and ignoring him whenever I see him because being around him really hurts. I have no hard feelings for my best friend, by the way.
We’ve also both agreed that it’s best that he hears it from me in person when I’m ready.

358,"I suddenly got chlamydia. I didn’t cheat. Obvious answer is that my boyfriend cheated, right? Apparently not. He never complained of any symptoms ever, and when I told him he needed an STI check immediately, his results came back clean. It’s been doing my head in for the past few weeks. How the fuck does this happen? 

So we’ve just like.. moved past it? We didn’t break up because he had a clean result and my reaction to my diagnoses was showed that I wasn’t the shady one. 

One of the conclusions I have come to is that he could have gotten treated before my symptoms came on (there was about 3 weeks between unprotected sex and symptoms occurring). 

I need proof from the doctor (we see the same one). I haven’t mentally relaxed in weeks. I NEED some sort of conclusion. 

The doctor knows we are sexual partners. Is there a specific way I could ask to see his results/if he got treated before the most recent sti test? I feel like this is breaking patient confidentiality but I can’t see any other way to find out the cold hard facts

Also please don’t just tell me to break up with him. We are otherwise in a great relationship of 4 years and it’s extremely out of character for this situation to even exist. I’ll obviously break up if the FACTS prove he is lying. If he has been telling the truth then i need to figure out how tf I tested positive for a STI, which may be one of my roommates shady sex partners using my dildo or something idk.",20Jul2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

So, to TL;DR - My husband's best friend of 20 years killed himself in December of last year. Earlier this year, my husband attempted suicide. I tried to help, but got caught up in what I wanted instead, and hurt him. I'm trying to be better.

&amp;#x200B;

So, by accident (I wasn't snooping, I promise), I found my husband's reddit account. He posted in r/UnsentLetters a heartbreaking, and kinda' beautiful letter to his dead best friend. He talks about me a little in his comments, and in general posts about his favorite games, his creative projects, his family, yadda yadda yadda. The letter, though. Reading it broke my heart for him all over again. I can see in his comments that people don't get his very nuanced jokes all the time, and he's not afraid to be downvoted for keeping it real, calling out bullshit, and making questionable jokes. He's so much himself on reddit, and it was a refreshing read. So, yeah, I guess I did snoop a bit. Anyway, that's not how he is at home.

You have to understand, my husband used to be a comedian, a counselor, a caregiver, an editor, and he wore those hats so well. He was outspoken, energetic, brilliant and cute af. Now, he's quiet, closed up, hesitant and somber. Seeing the contrast between who he is on reddit, and who he is at home is  really making me think more about how long this has been going on. It's been months and months, but still he's lost. I can tell he's trying, and therapy has helped him so, so much, but he's still in a fog of grief and shame.  

I miss the man who would leave me little notes in my car, send flowers to my work, and take me to fun places he found. Now, I sometimes find it hard to be around him for too long because the grief is like an aura radiating out of him and I want to hold him but he doesn't feel worth being held. I want to help, but he feels like a burden. 

&amp;#x200B;

His best friend was the absolute ying to his yang. They blended together in a way only two platonic men can. They loved each other in a way I wish I had with some of my friends. They were brothers, and trusted allies. They carried each other so well, and it's like my husband isn't his whole self anymore without him. 

My husband still makes trips every month to visit his best friend's family, including his fiancee. He helps them any way he can, and it wears him out so much, but it also heals him a little, I think. 

Anyway. I want to get a bit of what my husband shows on reddit. I miss his jokes and observations so much. I know I should stop stalking his reddit, but I miss him, and I feel like I'm only seeing the old him here. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone can offer some insight, perspective, or general advice, I'd appreciate it. Telling me to stop being a snoop would also be helpful.",20Jul2019,3
360,"My friend 26f lives in Canada, she has really bad anxiety (has panic attacks and ends up in ER), OCD and an eating disorder and is on disability. She can only eat certain foods and has to take taxis to leave the house as she panics if her heart rate goes up and she ends up in ER.

She has recently managed to get a therapist and is being refereed to an eating disorder clinic but it's taking a long time. She has run out of money and despite her doctor and therapist saying she is starving and needs to eat more her family aren't willing to help her. She's been getting dizzy when standing and was told by her doctor she has low blood pressure and higher heart rate when standing from malnutrition and dehydration which is the cause.

Her family situation isn't good. Her mum and sisters wanted to move into a new apartment and pressured her to sign the lease as they have bad credit. Everyone including my friends therapist told her not to sign it as she didn't think they could afford the higher rent and she didn't want to move but her mum pressured her and said she was emotionally blackmailing her by not signing it (blackmail seems to be the other way around to me). She didn't have much choice as she would be made homeless if she didn't.

They also borrowed the deposit off her now ex-boyfriend. Her sister, who is also getting disability, received some money off the government to pay for the deposit but is now refusing to pay him back. She also won't use the money to help my friend eat which her ex would be okay with as she's decided it's hers. I could go on and on about her family but basically they won't help and are making things worse.

362,"  

Hello all, I don’t post on Reddit very much and this is my first post in this sub so please be kind. If I do something incorrectly please let me know and I will try again until I get this right. TLDR is at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

So as a bit of background, I have been with my partner (I will call her Rose from here on out) for almost 9 years now. Rose is a Transgender woman and was in the closet about it when we got together, so essentially she was my boyfriend but then came out about 4 years into our relationship. We have been through every part of her transition together and I have loved seeing her blossom into an amazing woman. Transitioning has also really helped to lift her depression, allowing her to actually feel her emotions again and express herself, something that is very common in people who have experienced depression since a young age. Unfortunately, this also means she is feeling her anxiety stronger as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to a messed up childhood and literally the worst luck I have ever seen in my life, she has been diagnosed with severe anxiety (she is essentially agoraphobic and doesn’t leave the house without me) as well as two different types of depression. On top of this, she also has many undiagnosed medical issues having to do with her guts (the gastroenterologist labeled it as a “severe case of irritable bowel syndrome” which pretty much means, ‘Hey yeah something is super wrong with you but I’m not sure what it is so here you go!’), her sleeping habits, her teeth, as well as a LOT of chronic pain (fibromyalgia runs in her family and she also used to skateboard soooo yeah).

&amp;#x200B;

Rose is currently unemployed, though she is a computer programmer and tries to get small work on the side (which tends to fall through for various reasons) which doesn’t make much or even consistent income. She also has a few game development projects of her own, which is awesome but is more of a “in the future” thing (being a self-starter requires resources after all). I am the primary breadwinner of the household, working two jobs five days a week. We do have a roommate who helps out, but I am still struggling to make ends meet and am falling more and more in debt. In the past Rose has offered to look for a small part time job, but I did not want her to not be able to perform consistently due to her health and get fired (again), which would then further deteriorate her mental state. Recently however, I have amended that to, “If you feel like you need to get a job I will not stop you. However there are other things we can do first that will help more” (such as renewing her food stamps, which is a whole other kettle of fish for a different day).

&amp;#x200B;

I do not mind working two jobs and providing for her. As self appointed “Husband” I love feeling like I am taking care of her and just want her to be healthy and happy. Whatever baby wants, baby gets… as long as I can afford it. This does not necessarily gel well with her though, as she used to be a very independent person (as in ran away from home to a different state with people she met on the internet at 14 and survived) and hates being seen as a “burden” or “leech”. This is something that very much weighs on her mind and ABSOFUCKINGLUTLY attributes to her anxiety. However, since I am working so often and she cannot leave the house without me, her health has kind of been on the back burner and it all seems to be catching up to her now.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently she has told me that I am not capable of being her caregiver on top of being her partner. Too many things are falling through the cracks and something needs to change with her mental/physical health or she’s going to break. For the first time in a long time she sees a light at the end of the tunnel, but it’s so faint she doesn’t know how to nurture it and is terrified of losing that hope. So she has tasked me with doing the research to find a replacement caregiver for her. Someone who is able to contact doctors for her to set up appointments (she doesn’t own a phone because her voice makes her anxious) and transportation to said appointments if I am not available to take her (she refuses to take public transportation because it’s not worth it money wise, takes WAY too long and then again anxiety).

&amp;#x200B;

When I asked her why she couldn’t do this research herself she replied that if it were up to her she would just never see a doctor again and just die whenever she dies, but realistically she understands that it’s not plausible so she needs to get help. If I can’t get her this help, she’s going to have to get it herself. The only way she can see getting that help on her own is to harm herself for attention. She assured me that she would try her best to not actually die, but if push came to shove that was her only option…

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously this scared the shit out of me, so I have been trying to look into this for her but have had no luck. The other day she broke down again and said that time is running out and she doesn’t know how much longer she can hold on. She also told me that she did hurt herself and showed it to me… She said that she feels trapped in her own body. Like she is screaming in her head to just move her hand, just pick up that one piece of paper and throw it away or something, but her body doesn’t respond and she just keeps staring straight ahead. That is the point that she started to cry, which is something she has struggled with as long as I have known her (because you know, toxic masculinity and stuff). I am worried sick and I don’t know what to do. Everything I have tried has led no where and I just don’t have the time to drive down to the doctors office and ask these questions.

&amp;#x200B;

We live in Washington State and Rose is a part of the Apple Healthcare program. Is anyone else familiar with how this program works? I don’t know what else to do… any advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

The TL;DR is that while growing up I never ate poorly, but I didn't exactly eat healthily either. 

Now that I'm in my early 20's I'd like to change that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the context. 

So growing up my diet mainly consisted of carbs and red meat. I'm actually rather thin still because of my metabolism growing up. I did sprinkle veg in there and was ensured that 5/7 meals featured at least 1 green item, which of course I ate. 

Now that I'm in my early 20's and living with my partner, I'm looking to eat better and healthier because I've been getting all sorts of comments about the food that I eat, and how it's not great. 

My issue is that because the way I grew up, I'm not used to eating a lot of fancy-pants veg and fruits, so when I take a bite into an eggplant my bodies first reaction is to reject it because I've never had anything like this before. It's either the taste, texture or swallowing the food that seems to make me reject it. 

I want to remedy this issue because while growing up with a good metabolism is fine now, It won't be fine in 10 years time, and my diet won't exactly be good for when I have kids.

As of right now I'm done with school, have a decent job, and am living with a partner. They are able to eat anything fine as they grew up on a farm as opposed to my city life of a supermarket offering everything and anything.",20Jul2019,1

375,"Some background info:
-I’m 16 rn
- I have a twin brother
- these two things happened in Shanghai and Hong Kong respectively


It happened a few days ago, but I first wanna back up a bit.

Around 4 years ago (when I was around 13 or 14) in my house in Shanghai, I remember i walked around in my house and I heard my mom crying softly in her room. I thought I heard wrongly, but I kept hearing it and when I wanted to enter my parent’s room, my dad stopped me and told me she was “feeling ill” and that she was “sleeping”. I decided to trust my dad and I quickly forgot about it.

After around a month or so, she decided to tell my brother and I that she opened my dad’s phone to accidentally find a seperate whatsapp account that she had never seen before, using another phone number. She found some messages that I absolutely could not believe.

I never saw my dad the same again, but I decided to forgive him, since he was the person that I used to looked up to. I began to see many of his flaws and started to despise that he could act so naturally, without even apologizing to my mom.

After two or three years, I had to move to Hong Kong (where I was born). I loved Hong Kong, and I found out that my dad wasn’t going to move to HK with us. After a few months, though, my dad came over to HK.

At this time, I had almost forgotten about the past incident. We lived quite happily but I still kinda had a bad impression of my dad, as he is quite egotistical and self centered.

Fast forward to a few days ago:

At the time I didn’t know, but my mom already discovered that on my dad’s icloud drive were some beautiful photos of a beach, seemingly innocent. However. the photos said 1 May 2019, but my dad told us that he went to the beach on the 4th. Little did he know that the photos had time stamps, and more importantly, locations that come with the pictures.

The photos were marked to be some hotel that was different from the one he was supposed to be staying at. 

Like any person would, my mom asked my dad for an explanation, but my dad didn’t respond at all.

My dad was supposed to come home from another business trip that day but he never did, and no matter who tried to call or text him he didn’t answer.

My mom later came home from work, crying. She told me that she had found out something. She took out the computer that my mom and dad shares for photos of family trips.

She explains what the photos and their time and location stamps mean, and to be honest, I wasn’t surprised.

My dad didn’t cone home that night when he was supposed to, further affirming that he was guilty.

Aftermath:
My dad came home early in the morning and put down all his luggage and left for work with the car.

Throughout that day, my dad finally responded to my mom. Though I didn’t know the specifics of my parents’ conversation, ny mom told my brother and I that “we need to work better as a family” and “he says he doesn’t feel trusted and loved”.

My brother and I didn’t know what to say.

At the end of the day, my dad picked my mom up from work. I was baffled. How my mom acted around my dad... it was like nothing even happened at all. My mom forgave him, and too easily, in my opinion.

Even worse, my dad acted as though nothing happened, as if he DID come home last night, and as if he was innocent.

My brother and I instantly lost all respect for him. Not only did he act like nothing happened, he acted like he was the victim and that he deserved love.

From what I could gather, he never apologized to my mom. Honestly, I don’t know if I can ever forgive him.

1. If my mom is too kind
2. What my mom should do
3. Is my brother and I too harsh
4. What we should do",20Jul2019,1

He lost around 400k(!) in a Ponzi scheme in the 90s. All I can remember is us living in very shitty neighbourhoods for about 7 years where I wasn't allowed outside on my own .

378,"I am a virgin and I understand that's not really a big deal and sex is not that big of a deal but the people I know like my brothers, childhood friends, and past acquaintances on social media all seem to have wildly successful relationships with insanely attractive girls doing awesome things like jet skiing, or traveling to exotic locations while I'm stuck trying to get Netflix to work while the girl is getting her best friend to do that whole emergency phone call trick to get away or something similar. This is showing me that I need to improve my life.

One way I'm am improving my life is by quitting my porn addiction but why is there so much porn? Women seem to be very sensitive to the idea of others seeing them do anything sexual as they have a fear of being slut-shamed but every day there are hundreds/thousands of amateur videos being posted. If you are being very generous 1% of all sex in the world is posted online so there is an insane amount of sex going on but why can't I seem to find a way to do it? is it just money? or am I just that much of a loser? I do think i'm good enough in looks, personality, and humor most days but i’ve always had a real hard time with girls that it is depressing me. This depression sucks because it makes me worse for the next girl i try to get a relationship with. I’ve been working on overcoming my depression with therapy, pills, and meditation but it doesn’t feel like I am doing enough.",20Jul2019,1
379,"In my mid 20’s, a few weeks ago i asked this coworker my age to get coffee, somebody whom I rarely talked to in the 10 months of working this retail job...

I msged her on facebook, she replied with no because she has an ""overly jealous boyfriend"".

a few weeks went by and she randomly accepted the facebook request, and seemed more pleasant than usual around me at work (retail, yet we work in different depts)

So I messaged her shortly after, and we began conversing... she began opening up to me, we unexpectedly connected and we've realized how much we have in common. Lots of deep and rare things we share in common.

** She began telling me how she has been through so much in life, that so many bad things have happened to her...
And told me that not a lot of people have been thru what she has either, after me saying the same thing about my own life.. 

We talked about some deep stuff..
and it maybe sounded like something happened with her boyfriend, leading her to open to me like this.. maybe.

After about 5 days I decided to again ask her to talk in person over coffee, because we were having good conversation and the feeling was mutual... 

Yet this time there was NO Mention or a boyfriend... she now told me that her ""hours are crazy because of my 2 jobs""...

Hmm okay... so a day later I asked her if she wanted to get lunch the next time we work, we can schedule our breaks at the same time and go for a walk, or eat etc.. and she agreed.

Why did she use the excuse “i’m
busy” when we are getting lunch during work soon? 

Could it be that she would feel weird saying yes to hanging outside of work, which would definitely mean she doesn’t have a boyfriend anymore?

Not sure if she’s genuinely interested but just busy.

tl;dr asked female coworker to get coffee, said no... weeks later we talk again and everything is different it seems....",20Jul2019,1
380,"So, I recently was pretty drunk &amp; slept with my friends ex girlfriend. Normally I'd never do something like that - I'm still kinda shocked that I did - alcohol I guess. 

Well, now I'm just wondering if I should straight up tell him what happened or just leave it as is - never talk about it &amp; pretend it never happened...
Normally I'd say I have to tell him that, but I'm not sure how he would react - I'd be fucking pissed if I was him, sooo yeah. 

Any advice on that? I know I fucked up &amp; it's my mistake &amp; I should stand up for that - but if he'll never get to know what happened, wouldn't that be easier?

381,"DISCLAIMER: These aren’t real names. 

When I was 14, freshman in HS, I made a post on r/MakeNewFriendsHere and met someone we shall call Sebastian [THIS IS NOT THE REAL NAME]. He was 22 and happened to live in the same city as me. Everything was fine till he started asking me things like “Do you have a big a$$ or tits?” I brushed it off and I can’t remember what I said but I ignored it. Next thing you know we move to another platform called “Discord.” He constantly asks for verification photos because he thought I was a catfish (?) Anyway, I sent them regardless. He then kept going saying how he had a relationship with a 15YO a year ago and now she’s 16. He apparently didn’t know she was 15 till they met in real life. They were sexual online but only cuddled irl. He claimed they ended because since she was so young they couldn’t do anything so it was best for them to stop talking. 

He was being an a$$hole throughout the entire time so I just ghosted his ass and left. A few months later I posted something on Reddit and he knew it was me. NO IT WAS NOT EXPLICIT CONTENT. It was just a normal r/selfie. He messaged me saying I looked cute and wanted a “flirty friendship” with no nudes but suggestive pictures. THIS IS A V IMPORTANT DETAIL LATER ON. He also told me he had a girlfriend [24F]. Even posted a picture of her on his alternative account. 

Long story short, he asked me a shit ton of questions about meeting up which I kept making excuses and bluffing. He then asked for a picture of my chest area [AKA EXPLICIT CONTENT] I sent ONE nude. WITHOUT MY FACE IN IT. Then he asked for more and I said no and got blocked. Before I was blocked, I took screenshots of everything and reported him. 

People at my school found out. Called me a hoe, desperate, slut, weird, bitch, etc… I came home from school crying and my mother forced it out of me asking what was wrong and she even saw the rude messages people were sending and yelled at me saying “fuck you you’re a bitch everything they said is true you said you wanted to go to UCLA yet you don’t even practice for the SAT or study extra.” I was so fucking angry and hurt.

385,"So I live in a small country in Europe. I am thinking of starting my own food place in the capital (my hometown). I have been researching about this field and I want you guys to share your wisedom with me. I want to hear your experiences, what you learned, links, obstacles I could face, how to plan, anything you consider important for me to know etc. 

I am planning on opening on March 2020. My idea is to open a small store where I serve salads, soup, sandwiches. I want to make it a low budget place where people would come have some food and go (not a place where ppls would open their laptops or hang out for beers). 

There are not so many places that serve food like this. There are either restaurants or fast food places (like burger king). I want something in the middle, affordable, fresh and tasty.

388,"I know this is a trivial problem, and it should be an easy thing to do but I just can’t get over a person who I liked, who I didn’t even date. They rejected me, and showed no sign of interest (it was pretty obvious they didn’t feel the same) yet there is still always a shred of hope lurking in my brain that gives fuel to this obsession with them. I’m a student, and I’m leaving the school I went to so I’ll never see them again. But I can’t help thinking about them in my spare time. Like I begin to ruminate about all the little moments we shared, however insignificant and I judge it in my brain. I get angry at myself for being embarrassing, I get angry at them for not treating me the way I want them to(even though we’re not even friends and they don’t owe me anything). Or sometimes I gush and indulge in thinking over the time they smiled at me, or looked into my eyes, or asked me how I am. They are constantly in the back of my mind, and really I just want to forget them. Like in that movie ‘eternal sunshine of the spotless mind’. I feel so trapped by this obsession but I am helpless to stop it.

I know, you’re probably thinking ‘just get a life you loser’ but I’ve tried everything; to distract myself, to express myself by ‘sitting with my feelings’ or writing about them, I’ve tried to completely ignore it but it is all futile. Eventually it all leads me back to fall in to this obsession. I think I need to go to therapy, but I can’t afford it anytime soon. So this is the second best thing, I just need some guidance from someone who is more emotionally mature and wiser. I can’t talk about this with anyone in real life, so I would really appreciate advice. Thanks for reading to the end, it’s a very long post.",20Jul2019,1

Nothing is physical but they take 90% of situations the wrong way and instantly get angry. It is at everyone in the family and it tends to catch on too frequent visitors. They're usually pretty good in public because they get super embarrassed when they get caught being douches.

They can't properly argue. They change the subject ""do you think I'm stupid or something?"" Then the fight is about that for 15 minutes of shouting. No one even insinuated that anyone was stupid. It feels impossible to make progress in this situation. I know they'll get angry if I bring up their behavior and they'll blame me for starting a fight.

391,"So basically, a few months ago my girlfriend went to a club for the first time. She had never gone before and her friends were over from another city so they all decided to go together. I didn't feel too good about her going but I get she just wanted to have fun with her friends and she had never gone before so I understood why she wanted to go. 

So she got really drunk (while I was at home cause it was a ""girls night out"") and went to the club. The next day she told me she grinded and rubbed her vagina on other men. Now this made me a little bit mad and sad at the same time but I get she was drunk and it was her first time so I got over it. She also said guys asked her to hook up but she said no so that's a good thing.

Now last week she went out with her friends again and got really drunk and went to a different club. She did the exact same thing, which was grind on other guys and such. Her friend told me this the next day and she didn't tell me because she told me she didn't remember that. I do believe she doesn't remember because I picked her up after and she was extremely drunk. Again I didn't feel too good about that and it made me even more mad and sad this time because it happened again. 

I told her I didn't like her going to clubs anymore and I would break up with her out of anger. I know I shouldn't have given her that ultimatum but I was mad because of what happened again. 

But anyways, I told her i don't want her going to the club anymore because it makes me feel like shit cause of what she does but she is calling me controlling. I didn't explicitly say she can't go to the club just that it makes me feel like shit when she does, which is the truth. 

Now I am wondering who has more reason here. Should she be more understanding about how I feel or am I really being controlling?

393,"Thank you for your time. 

As a professional, I'm here looking for pragmatic solutions, steps I can take. I need plan of some kind to rescue my working life. Many conversations have been had amongst my peers and no one has any ideas that could possibly pass as good.

As a person, I've come to realize that the only thing that I can do is let go.

By let go, I mean that I'm never going to sue this person or work to make a mockery of her on social media. I will not try and fix my business by attacking her. Much of me wants to but the correct move is as a person is for me to let go. Breathe and let go. 

I have conversations about these events almost everyday and that process seems like it will continue for many years.

18 months ago a woman came forward on the internet accusing me of being a sexual predator. She said that she had evidence of some kind and the verbal corroborations of multiple other women. After her initial post, there was no follow-up. She never told her story publicly or presented the evidence that she had.

I did my best to respond, the only real result being me spreading the story far further than she was able to.

I have come to realize that my life will never be the same. I can communicate with one individual at a time, answer their questions, listen to their understandings and almost universally this alleviates their concern completely. I'd say better than 9 out of 10 times those I have to speak with will end their conversation with me by expressing empathy for my situation, it makes them sad and they're sorry.

I am an artist. A one-man manufacturer. I make things and then sell them. Art is not a necessity, art is something that people bring into their life because it makes them happy.

Obviously, people that think I'm a rapist will not give me money. Less obvious, people that have come to the conclusion that I'm not a rapist will still not give me money because these are not happy thoughts.

My prices are down 75% on a good day and sales are difficult to find. All of my savings and investments are depleted. I have borrowed money and am delinquent on payments. Emotionally, I am destroyed and thus a pretty shity worker.

I don't know what to do.

I love my job. And no matter what the implications I will never do anything else.

I have this fear, perhaps confirmation of this understanding is why I have posted on Reddit.

I fear that professionally, the only thing I can do is let go. Breathe in my powerlessness, breathe out my sadness. Just accept. Try and have a good day.

However, I like to eat. And have a safe place to sleep. Not being on the defensive for my life and my art would be a thing I would enjoy.

As an employee, I am destroyed. I have to fix the mental health of my employee and I don't know how to do that.

As a business owner, I own a brand that is destroyed. I have to create conditions where people will be happy to give me money. I don't know how to do that.

Again, my fear is, there is nothing to be done. Accept and accept again, for all that remains of life and career. If this is your advice, so be it. That's my advice too.

I'm desperate for any other type of answer. Something proactive. Something with goals. Something I can do to fight for myself.

399,"I’m from a big and loving family and we all get along well but there’s issues with my eldest sister who is 5 years older than me. I have deep rooted resentment towards her which stems from when I was 8 years old and she went through her ‘wild teenage phase’. My parents were overly strict which they gave since learnt not to be and so we were pretty sheltered growing up. I do understand this could have been a cause in her behaviour but I can’t get over how much damage she has caused within my family. 

From the age of 8, my parents started depending heavily on me to perform the roles of the eldest child even though I was the third child (even though it was annoying that my second sister wasn’t given responsibilities, I knew this was because of prior medical issues she had when she was younger, so I got over that pretty quickly). 

I had always been mature so I did everything naturally but as I’ve been getting older (I’m 21 now) I’ve just been realising how unfair it’s been for me. And throughout it all my sister was still being such a selfish and entitled person. I was essentially a second mother to my entire family (even to the older siblings) and I regularly cooked and cleaned and helped my parents out as much as I can, while the rest of my sisters just sat back and watched. I’m not resentful at helping my parents, just at my eldest sister because it was essentially her role, not mine.

She has matured over the past 4/5 years (partly due to her boyfriend who she is getting married to next month) but she still has selfish tendencies. She chooses to ostracise herself from the rest of us sisters and then complains to my mum about how she feels left out. She also complains about how we’re not involved in her wedding planning yet she never asks us to join her or for our input. She is also such a disgustingly messy person that my mum still cleans her room even though she’s 26. My parents tell her repeatedly to help out but she always has an excuse so they have now stopped bothering. I’ve told them that they’re just enabling her but they’re just sad she’s moving out in a month so they just tell me to get over it. 

There’s so many other issues I could mention about her selfish and entitled behaviour and stories I could recall from her rowdy phase but the list is too long.

I’ve always been a person who never holds grudges and I never actually realised how resentful I am towards her until my younger sister recently asked me if like our eldest sister and when I asked why she said it’s because I act differently around her. This made me self-reflect and realise that I don’t actually love my sister. I am incapable of getting over how she essentially took my childhood away due to her selfish personality, how she would always beat me up whenever she felt like it and how she still has a sense of entitlement to this day. I’m honestly looking forward to the day when she finally moves out and I don’t have to see her that often. 

Our relationship today is pretty neutral, save for little arguments that we have, I don’t really speak to her. I do understand the way I’m feeling isn’t the norm and I do feel sorry for her sometimes for having to deal with my parents being super strict with her but I just can’t seem to get over my resentment towards her. I don’t want to still be angry at her when she has a child because I’m scared that I’m not going to love my future niece/nephew(s) because of their mother. So how can I get over my anger and resentment towards my older sister?",20Jul2019,2
400,"So some background. I started studying computer science at my community college when I was 22. After two years there I transferred to a four year school with the intention of continuing my studies in CS while taking up a physics minor, but there was an issue with the transfer of my transcripts. By the time it was sorted out I was told that the CS program wasn't accepting more students.
 I decided that I would just do a physics major and down the line maybe switch. Well I never did, not because I was happy about the physics, rather I think I just got so caught up in the course work that I kind of forgot about the computer science. 

In my second year at the university I decided to join a research group that was studying lead-free solders for microelectronic applications. They needed somebody to do simulations and I figured that that was at least closer to CS than the alternatives. 

At the end of my third year (it took three years to graduates instead of two due to the major switch) I had no idea what I was going to do. The university has this program where you can take graduate level courses in your senior year of you B.S. and then continue straight to a M.S. (in Materials Science) and finish in a year. I decided do that.

I'll be finished with my M.S. next month and I need to decide what I'm going to do.

I know that whatever it is that I end up doing, it wont be related to my research. While I do find what I do interesting, I do not want have it be the focus of my life. Currently I spend the majority of my time in a lab focusing on the movement of atoms while the rest of the world goes on outside.

I would like to work in a field such as data analytics or quantitative finance. I've done some research on the field and have read a few books and it seems like something I'd enjoy. I enjoy analyzing data and finding trends, which I often do in my current research, and being able to work with real world data sets is a plus.

However, I also don't like leaving things unfinished. While I've made progress with my research, there is still more to be done. My adviser was nice enough to reserve funding for me in case I decide to continue with graduate school, but there is a time limit on that, they cant hold onto it forever. I'm told that If I continue with grad school I would be able to get my PhD in about 2 years.

I have idea what to do. I've been in school for so long, I'm starting to feel almost useless. I'm 28 and I haven't done anything professionally that I can say I'm proud of. I do well in school, but its only school. I really just want to move on and start my life.

That being said, I've spent the better part of the last three years on my research. It was slow going in the beginning because I was the only one working on the project, my group is otherwise entirely experimental, but now I think I'm getting somewhere. If I stop now then then it was all for nothing. If I keep going then at least at the end of two years I'll have some meaningful results and the title of Dr. to go along with the piece of paper.

Another pro of continuing with the PhD is that it gives me another two years to hone the data analytics skills I have and to learn more about quantitative finance on the side. Also from what I've seen many job postings for data analytics or quant jobs do say the prefer quantitative PhDs.

I'm just looking for some outside opinions. 

Thank you.

TLDR; I Have spent the last three years doing Physics/Materials Science research that I don't particularly enjoy. I'm about to graduate with my M.S. and need to decide if I will continue for another two years and get meaningful results and a PhD, or look for jobs in data analytics or quantitative finance and leave my research behind. Either way I will not be continuing my research after school.",20Jul2019,0
403,"Have no one to share this with, so I'm posting this here. Pardon me in advance, I don't know how to start and end this, I'll just throw in whatever comes in my mind first.

I was a transferee back in high school, shy kid who's always anxious, would probably not talk to you if you didn't initiate the convo (not because I hate you, I'm reeeaaally just shy, would warm up after few serious talks and if we jibe). A lot say that I'm good at school. Typical student who gets praised because she gets high grades, nothing more nothing less. But I didn't consider myself special, I got low self-confidence and I'm the type who just blends in. My parents would always push me to study, asking more from me, so I did, not because I enjoyed it, but because they told me to and because I'm scared of punishments. During primary school, failing marks, for them, called for punishments. Basically, I considered studying as a requirement and as an escape from getting hurt. My childhood life was pretty much on autopilot. Those days were ""bad"" bad. 

Anyway, going back, high school came. I had this teacher---strict, intimidating, competent, very smart. Everyone looks up to her because she's one of the best (if not the best) teacher/s in the campus. (No shit. She really is.) She has high standards, haven't given an A to any student in her entire career. So yeah, I was still the same, I did schoolworks because of fear and as an act of compliance. Now, to my surprise, this teacher then started complimenting me, saying that I'm good and all, even to her co-teachers. Knowing her by the words of many, she wouldn't just go around saying something if she didn't mean it. She is the best in her craft and she knows it, so it's a huge thing to hear that coming from her. It felt awkward and touching to my part. It's a first for me to hear such compliment without the person needing something in return. Plus it came from someone who has established her name and is excellent in her calling. I myself didn't even believe in me and the things I could do. I felt honored, appreciated, and validated. 

This then drove me to strive hard in school. The next thing I knew, I got straight As the whole school year in her subject, which, no joke, shook the hell out of me and my classmates. She never gave an A. Ever. I was all along just like, ""What did I do to deserve this?"" It felt like hitting the jackpot. Students from other levels started to know me as the kid who got As in this teacher's subject. A friend from other class even said that this teacher brings up my name whenever they talk about excellent academic performance, same thing was told by a senior schoolmate. It was extremely awkward, I can't deal with too much compliments and people caring about and appreciating what I do, but I felt sincerely grateful to my teacher. This went on the next year. This teacher continued to motivate me by leaving positive remarks about my works (seniors never heard her praise a kid this much before), mentor me, even bring out some potentials I didn't know I had. Studying suddenly had a new meaning and developing new skills inspired me to become better. Funny thing is my teacher and I didn't become close. I'm awkward as hell and I treat authorities as authorities, plus she's still super intimidating even at times when she just casually talked to me. I still know deep down inside that she believed in my capabilities, considering that I got low self-confidence, and that she was a life-changer and I owe her a lot.

Fastforward, I graduated high school with the highest honors. I got in to one of the top universities in the country (teacher's former uni). A lot happened in college, long story short, I graduated yet didn't manage to get a latin honor. As it is grad season, I suddenly got a message from her, asking me about uni and graduation. I didn't know how to respond. I felt sorry and embarrassed at the same time, because that one student whom she once took so much pride in graduated with no achievements now. I'm honestly so thankful to her yet I couldn't even express it for I have nothing to offer in return. It sucks when you disappoint the ones who genuinely believe in you. Yourself kills you every day.

It’s been over two months and several small payments later, he still owes $700. Things keep “coming up” and I 100% believe him because he’s always been honest with me. At the same time, I’ve decided to re-enroll in college and need a laptop. 

I have offered to just buy it back for $1200 (the amount that he has paid so far) but he insists that he will be able to pay the $700 in two weeks, if not he’s up for me buying it back. His wife enjoys using it too much and he’d hate for her to not be able to use it. 

I’m 99.99% sure he will not be able to pay the $700 in two weeks. I feel like it’s the right thing for him to sell it to me back. I’ve given him several chances and have been EXTREMELY lenient. I’m only now being assertive.

What should I do?",20Jul2019,1

I am shocked how most people think there are no easy jobs out there with little responsibility. I mean world has a lot to offer.. not every job out there is considered hard work.

I feel like I can never be in the moment no matter how much I try to encourage myself, because of this I end up overthinking in retrospect.

I don’t give a shit what I drive as long as it works and love watching all sports, this just being an example of many things. The man is also a terrible father to his biological kids, spoiled kids who are both in their 20s who get whatever they want, which wasn’t how I was raised. I don’t care for them or the rest of his family as they all speak a different language and don’t care to adapt. Whenever he tries to discipline me he’s harder on me than his kids, it’s ironic. Him and my mother fight all the time because he has pretty bad ADD and doesn’t really listen so my mom, who’s pretty controlling, gets frustrated. I have a close relationship with my mother, but my SD is so obsessed with her (which I guess is good) I can’t get a word in without him being constantly around, as he is super needy.

413,"(I apologize for the shit grammar) 

So as a back story, my dog lily died about four months ago. My cat (Gemma 10 years old) had spent most of her life with lily. So when she died it was a lot on Gemma. to add on to the problem my family has had to very suddenly start renovating and moving to a new home, with the added bonus of my parents going though a rough patch in they’re marriage causing the two other people that live in the house (including me) to a certain extent flip out.


Things the Gemma is/has been doing is 

• puking everywhere, like there are puke stains on the floors, furniture and clothes even her cat tree has several stains
 
• she for a while was peeing and pooping on a pile of clothes until we noticed and cleaned it up but now three weeks later she’s peeing in front on the back door

• has been a bit more vocal than usual but not enough to be drastic 

• I haven’t really been around enough to know whether or not she’s been sleeping a lot so I can’t say much on that

• she has been constantly (like 24/7) on the windowsill which is a big change cause, sure she’d hangout there some times but not enough times for her to become some sort of celebrity in the neighborhood

• she has been bouncing back and forth between my family’s house and my sisters house (my sister has two cats which Gemma gets along with) like two times by now and we might be doing that again because of the renovating that’s happening in the house right now 

I can’t think of anything else at the moment but if you have any questions about Gemma that can help me I’ll gladly answer. Thank you!",20Jul2019,1
414,"I’m 22 years old, I have been dating since around the age of 13 and my mom has met almost all of my girlfriends. Despite only ever knowing I’ve been with women anytime I have to tell her something serious she will say “it’s ok, I know and I support your decision to be gay” and I have to sidebar the serious conversation and try and figure out why she thinks I’m gay. She always points out that I own  a pink hoodie and a pair of pink vans.  I also goto the gym regularly, shave my chest, get my eye brows done and go tanning but is that seriously something people consider “gay”? I have nothing against gay people I just don’t know how many times I have to tell my mom I’m not gay.

415,"I just started dating someone new, and he is a gosh dang dream boat. Checks all my boxes: tall, athletic, intelligent, good job, great family, kind, attentive, charismatic, outgoing, etc etc etc. We clicked immediately and I was so excited about where this could go. It’s been a while since I’ve found a guy I felt I could actually build a meaningful relationship with...

Except, last night after doing a bit of digging I found out that he is involved with Amway / Worldwide group. He has a lucrative full time job doing something else, but mentioned that he has a separate business on the side and was pretty vague about it when I pushed to ask. He promised it wasn’t anything illegal or sketchy, just something that takes a very long time to explain. Me wanting to be trusting, I stopped asking pointed questions. But then he mentioned he was attending a private conference this weekend with a ton of his “mentors” and it just got me thinking. I called my mom immediately and sure enough, it’s an Amway conference in town. And he clearly didn’t want to outright tell me it was Amway, since I had to discover for myself.

So my advice needed is this: what do I do? I felt like I could build something truly real and amazing with this guy, but I don’t know if I feel confident going into a relationship with someone who believes this company is actually legitimate... someone who fell into the alluring depths of a pyramid scheme company with the thought that it’s going to make him wealthy quick. And it’s not like he has just started - apparently he has been involved for two years.",20Jul2019,1
416,"So basically I met this really amazing guy and we have been talking every single day almost constantly for quite some time now. But just about two days ago he started to switch up on me real randomly. We went from talking all the time to not even talking at all. I know people get busy and stuff everyone has a life but for this certain individual this is highly unusual. They had admitted they had feelings for me and I did feel the same (probably more than them actually) so we had started making all these plans and whatever. but then I got a weird text the next day that almost sounded like I was put in the friend zone?! I’m so confused. Maybe I’m just overthinking that or maybe I’m overthinking all of this. But usually when people start to become distant on me they stay distant forever unless I start the conversation which leads to me losing people because I feel like they have found better people. truly honestly feel like I said something wrong somewhere somehow but I don’t know what to do. Or maybe I’m just that replaceable? They really went from flirting with me and telling me how much they liked me and wanted to be with me to leaving me on read.

Maybe he just needs some time? Maybe he’ll come around eventually. but what if he doesn’t?

I want to ask what happened because communication is literally everything but at the same time I don’t wanna bother someone that probably obviously doesn’t even want anything to do with me anymore whatsoever. I’m kinda hurt by this persons actions cause it’s almost as if he just wanted me to catch feelings so he could pretend to be as in to me as I was for him and had plans to ditch me anyways just to hurt me.

Should I ask him what’s wrong?

Let him come to me?

Or simply just move on?

I backed off on the sale because I saw the amount of money he was spending instead of paying his part of the bills (we should pay half each). He also said he would help with the cat that he gave me when I went to the vet.

I lied about selling the TV, but should I give him his part anyway? Or his part should cover what he didn't paid?
Also I paid for soooo much now that I look back and I paid rents without him giving his part to me. He already called me asking for 20 bucks (he used to do this constantly throughout the relationship)

432,"To give some background, I'm currently working full time as a personal banker, and I immediately head over to my 2nd job as a head swim coach. I'm doing this mostly to help out a very disorganized team, but the pay is good too. 

Anyway, I told the board that I was going on vacation at the very beginning of the season. In June, I told them the exact dates of the vacation in July, no issue. There has been one instance of them trying to cut into my salary because practice starts at 6, I get off my 1st job at 545, get home at like 605-610, and show up to coach at 645 which starts at 6. I tell them about this in advance. We were able to work that out without taking my pay. Which is absurd because I led this team to back to back to back championships. Something that has never happened before, something the previous coaches couldn't do with the same kids. 

At one point, and this where I shoot myself in the foot, I gave my blessing that the two assistant coaches should take my place. Which, let's just put, I was being a little too nice. One of the assistants, without letting anyone know, took off two days in a row because he was upset. Fast forward to July 15th, and I get a text from the administrative coach saying that one of the board members said that I said, back in June, that July 15th was my last day and if I wanted to pick up my half month salary. I'm absolutely livid because I know what they're trying to do. Here's my argument for anyone trying to read it:

----for those who dont want to read it, I'll cut to the chase: I'm on vacation till Tues, but I want to ask about what they're thinking now. Should I wait until Tuesday, or text them now? Btw I tried calling the President and the admin coach that day and they never called back. The president texted me they'd review the contract (have t signed one in 2 years) and get to the bottom if the misunderstanding. 

Thank you all so much for you time. 

:::There's absolutely no reason I should be getting half pay. Up until the day before regional practice, it was well understood that we weren't doing swim lessons. And then you guys decided to. And I agreed to go along with it. In actuality, with my vacation, I'd only be missing 4 hours of practice. I was on deck in Wisconsin for a total of 8 hours, not including the commute. 

I told you guys of my vacation right at the beginning of the season. And a over a month ago, I told you the exact dates. It was only after I told you guys I think Amy and mark should be coaches that you got the idea that I was done July 15th. I never once stated that, and even if I did, why would you only bring it up the day of, when Sylvia claims I told her in June? I leave early due to a headache and I lost my Aunt that week, and I get a text from both of you asking if I left early.

Perhaps you feel that the assistants deserve more pay for covering while I'm gone. Ok. The entire season is budgeted. They have taken off plenty of days, not including their vacations. There is an accumulating pool of pay they put into every time they dont show up that you could use to pay them. 

I've been at my other job two months and they give me a paid vacation. I've been here for over 3 years and now I'm have to take a half pay. After everything I've done for this team, do you really think that's fair?",20Jul2019,1

My mother kept the house we all lived in together, a nice spacious ranch style that used to be kept in a state of despair due to my fathers hoarding habits. Now that he has moved out, it is a really nice home. Don't get me wrong, I really like my father its just the facts. He now lives in what used to be a fishing cabin and also keeps this home in well a state of despair. It's messy and cluttered, and far from my job, friends and boyfriend. 

So the issue as of now is my father is forcing my mother to sell our home. I'm really torn, upset and negative about the whole thing. I don't want to go live with my father despite him being my favorite parent due to the condition of living I will be in. There are some cool things about the surrounding area but there are a lot of negatives that come with it. His stuff is legit everywhere and he won't have a bedroom when I move in, he's planning on sleeping in the living room. I just can't fathom being a half hour away from everything and having so little privacy which is so important to me. Also, it's not fun to be at my dads house being so small, no wifi, nowhere to be without a bunch of stuff or other people around. I know for a fact my relationship that I hold really dear to me will suffer because of this, and we can't go to my boyfriends house because his parents don't approve of me being white. 

My dad fully expects me to move in once the house im in now sells, which people are currently constantly coming to see it, I can't have my personal belongings out and I have to leave everytime people come which is sometimes 3+ times a day. I already hate it. I know my dad will be so hurt and upset if I don't come live with him, plus he has taken care of my dog for over a year and I enjoy his company a lot more than my mothers, and he has always been there for me while the past with my mom was extremely rocky. My mother also fully expects me to live with her, she says shes been trying to get an apartment for us and will kill me if I don't live with her, because she will say she could've gone and lived with her sister to save money if I wasn't planning on living with her.

445,"so, this is gonna sound kinda pathetic but anyways...

&amp;#x200B;

I have just started a new Job which I am pleased with. I regret nothing about leaving my old company apart from the fact I left without really ever getting to know the girl I had a crush on. I was there for two years but I was in a different department so never had much opportunity to interact with (apart from when she came for help with some work related matters) and we were never really in the same circle of work friends. I could have just approached her but I'm a little awkward so I kept on delaying it and now its a lil too late. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be weird if I added her on FB? Just to get to know her a little more at least...to see if we are even comparable or do I just bite it and move on?

446,"I'm not intending this to turn into a rant, but recently my partner (26F) and I (22F) (together ~3 years, lived together 1-2 months) hosted my parents (~50 and ~70), who were visiting so they could attend my university graduation. They stayed in a nearby B&amp;B and came to our house the evening prior to the event, for breakfast the morning of, and for lunch just afterwards. I am hurt and disappointed with some of the ways they behaved, but as know they meant no malice I don't know how to handle it. (For context they are separated and both live 2.5 - 3.5 hours away, so we only see each other every 1-2 months).

1 They both commented on how stressed I was, but didn't ask if there was anything they could do to help - they only took offence when I spoke sharply or otherwise expressed feeling stressed.

2 One of them spent most of the time just prior to and just after lunch on her laptop looking up directions to her friend's house, whom she was visiting straight from our house. This included talking about and commenting on the route and directions even though it was irrelevant to the rest of us. I was very hurt by this as I would have much preferred we actually spend time together.

3 She also spent a great deal of the time we were together (e.g. while in a restaurant the evening prior, and while travelling to and from different locations) trying to entertain us with long and over-dramatic stories featuring people and places that have little relevance/interest to anyone else present. This included accounts of her prior behaviour which I think were poor ways to behave (putting us in a difficult position as we don't know how to respond), and monologues on controversial topics which are likely to provoke disagreement between us.

4 They also appeared to have very different senses of urgency than my partner and I. I tried my best to communicate plans in advance, including what time we needed to leave in order to arrive places on time, but it got to the point that when I said ""we need to leave NOW or we will be late / miss the taxi etc.) they were still happy to finish their conversation before and while getting ready to leave. In addition to them now taking more time to get ready, it is also distracting for me and my partner as we need to be going into different rooms to get shoes/coats/bags etc., and that is hard to do while trapped in a conversation.

The point of this post is not to make them out to be terrible people (they are not) but is to ask for advice on things I can do or say to make sure in future, our boundaries and expectations are clearer and this doesn't happen again.

**TL; DR: I'm unhappy with the way my parents behaved while visiting (commenting on my poor emotional state without trying to help, ignoring me in favour of their own priorities, monologues on controversial topics, and not respecting my plans when I say we need to leave at X time). How can I address this and make it less likely to happen again?**",20Jul2019,0

I'm trying really hard to get better (meds, psychotherapy, working out, spending time with good people, getting out of the house, eating right), there are still some bad days but I'm feeling a little better.

A few days ago, I applied for a ""national service"" (which is a voluntary community service) that would allow me to go study sharks and rays in the carribean islands and  exchange with locals (divers, fishermen, kids at school) to try to protect them sea life in general. It's a dream come true, for a 9 years old me who wished to save every endangered species on the planet and stop climate change and ollution.

459,"I want to know if there’s something I’m doing wrong because I’ve been left for someone else 7 times in a row. It fucks me up mentally believing that I am never good enough and someone out there will always be better than me. 

I’ll try to keep things short here &amp; mention the ones that affected me the most. The names will be changed for privacy reasons. 

My first boyfriend is Cameron. We met in high school and were together for 2 years. He was a year older than me so when I was a senior he was a freshman in college. He would purposely make me jealous of other women so I wouldn’t leave him because he has always been the one being dumped. We never really fought and I kinda got bored later in the relationship but I knew I still cared about him. I had no intentions of leaving him. Fast forward almost 2 years later, he became very friendly with this girl in college he told me not to worry about. His facebook &amp; instagram accounts were logged on to my phone and this girl would constantly send him messages. I was getting upset and confronted Cameron. He told me not to worry because I’m the only one in his heart. I believed him until I found out he had been seeing her behind my back. I immediately dumped him and all he said was “I’m sorry for not being a good boyfriend”. I was heartbroken for nearly a year. (side note: we broke up in 2016 &amp; they are still together to this day)

The things I lacked &amp; learned from my relationship with Cameron: Failing to address my feelings and issues no matter how small.  

A year later I met my next boyfriend Matt. We started dating 5 months after we met. We were together for a year and a half. We’ve only argued a handful of times and I was able to address any concerns I had without feeling afraid. Matt was everything to me; he was my best friend and we shared a very special bond together. There was always something to talk about and it was never boring with him. Out of nowhere, he dumps me through text at 6 in the morning saying that he needs to find himself. He picks me up later in the day and we talked in the car. You best believe ya girl cried so much lol I have never cried this hard in front of anybody. He explained that he wants to be happy on his own and not to rely on anyone for happiness. I was that person and he had to let me go. HOWEVERRRR he goes on tinder shortly after and meets up with other people. At the same time, we still acted like we were together for the next 5 months because I couldn’t let him go. Big lesson I learned here. I cut him off completely on New Year’s Day this year. He is now in a relationship with the person he was seeing at the same time as me. 

Lacked &amp; learned: I don’t know what I lacked but I learned to express myself more with ease and that I should NEVER stay with someone who has no intentions of getting back with me. 

After Matt, I rekindled with an old crush named Jaime. We agreed to be fwb but then we started liking each other. He said that he wanted to date in the near future whenever I was ready. I found it difficult talking to him because I feel that we don’t get each other emotionally but we had the same sense of humor. The night before my 21st birthday party he told me he found someone else. Yikesssss

Lacked &amp; learned: Never stay with someone who you see no future with especially when it’s hard talking to them in an emotional way. 

I didn’t want to see anyone for a while so I was alone doing my own thing with school, work, &amp; friends. I was on Tinder and Bumble after Matt and when I was seeing Jaime but I did not have any serious intentions getting anything from the apps. 

Gerald was the last guy I was seeing. We matched on Tinder nearly a year ago. We’ve only sent each other funny tweets and he would send me positive messages from time to time. I was lightweight curving him because I wasn’t ready to see anyone. He was always so sweet to me and I decided to meet up with him when I felt ready. We instantly clicked and met up so many times. He’s showed me so many things and we’ve done so much more than I had with any of my exes combined. I have never felt so much love and kindness from him. He wasn’t a great texter but I enjoyed his company in person. He lives 90 miles away from me but I don’t mind coming to see him. We never established our relationship but we acted as if we were already together. I deleted all my dating apps because I was so incredibly into him. We were so weird together I loved it lmao he was so eager having my mom know about him but I didn’t want to tell her yet bc I have thy asian strict parents lol he was the first guy I thought about telling my mom. 

Unfortunately this lasted for 3 months. He started texting me less and I was getting frustrated because he is a hard person to read. I didn’t say anything because we weren’t even together and I told myself I shouldn’t expect so much from him. Just two days ago, he texted me that he is sorry because he started talking to someone else. This crushed me, and I have never felt so much pain from someone I was interested in for 3 months. My heart feels like it has been tied into a knot and I don’t know if the problem is with me. 

Lacked &amp; learned: To define the relationship before allowing myself to get too attached

We ended up coming across a small town with a little kaltire. We pulled up and the most amazing employee ever helped us. I didn't catch his name. I wish i did, i know it starts with a ""D"".

462,"Backstory/ Disclaimer: **I am pretty young right now (below 18) and I haven't really found any help as to how I would remedy this problem, but if anyone can help I would be happy.** To start things off, my family had recently moved to where I currently reside right now roughly a year ago. My Uncle (Dad's brother) had already settled in the area where I am and has also become pretty close with my family as well. We go  to each others' formal and informal events pretty frequently and everything seems well, but their family's relations with us is a complete disaster. My uncle was sick recently (chickenpox) and their family decided to send their kids (my cousins) over to our 2 bed +2 bath apartment to stay over, and that's where the last straw was drawn. The issues about them as a whole has already been a lot, but I'm done with them using us like this.

Story: The cousins, one is 10 and the other is 5, stayed over at our apartment for close to a week as my uncle was sick with chickenpox, and it is known to be contagious. I was still a little skeptical as to why they would send their kids because they lived in a 2 story house with plenty of ventilation, and the kids have gotten the vaccine as well, but I can't blame them for being a little health conscious. Anyways, the cousins stayed at our apartment ,and everything went well for the first 1 or 2 days, but after that, it was a nightmare. The cousins went to sleep very early at night (6-7 PM) and so when they were to wake up, it would be around 6-7 which wasn't very good for me since I slept with them in my room (although they eventually slept later so this wasn't a big deal). Next up, the cousins apparently had no control over their portions when it came to food,snacks, and anything consumable. This meant that the pantry that held most of our household's snacks would be empty  after they left. In addition, they ate like maniacs at breakfast, lunch or dinner and sometimes ate more than ME, and I eat decently large portions once in a while. Lastly, their behaviors in our house had almost driven me to resort to violence in order to discipline them. They literally make the floor shake when they walk (we live on the second floor so there is people beneath us) and we constantly tell them not to risking complaints, or even an eviction. In addition, they can't do the simple of tasks like putting used clothes away, putting away your dishes that you've eaten on, as well as being loud and invading personal space. Now all of this might seem as a petty issue, but I have noticed that when my Aunt comes to our apartment just to get updates on her children's behavior, they immediately straighten up and act as if they are the perfect children. That act they do just makes me so furious. It makes me wonder if they were taught to think of us as servants, and we can be used for their every need. Now that all of this is over, my family has decided to make interactions with them to them to a minimum, and those interactions are a simple hello, goodbye type of thing. Now I don't have intentions of doing any harm to the family, but rather want to talk to them about it despite my family being against it. This isn't the only time this has happened, as the cousins have been to our home 5-6 times during the year we have been here. Now this unfair use of family doesn't just apply to them sending their kids over, but it involves EVERYTHING. When there is a meetup of people that our family is familiar with, we aren't even notified of this. My dad even picks up the cousins and us to go to a foreign language school EVERY. SUNDAY. MORNING, but my uncle has never done the same, despite the fact that they are obviously free and have no plans whatsoever on those days. Furthermore, their problems extend to even small favors revolving around overseas affairs, but I won't get into that for now. The point is, my family has stayed silent, and when we do try to raise our voice and talk about this, we eventually forfeit because of family relations and the influence our revolt will make on our reputation. I can't take this anymore, and I want to know what I can do. We have been used for so long, and we have been silent for so long, and this cycle needs to stop. If anyone can help, please do so, I am open to any legitimate ways of stopping this.",20Jul2019,1

464,"An old friend of mine just called me, sounding somewhat distressed, telling me that he is in dire need of 2500 bucks, and he would pay me back.

He said he transported something (I would guess drugs) for someone, which he lost, and if he doesn't have the money for it, he is in trouble, because these guys are no joking matter. I am not really supposed to talk about it because his relatives and gf aren't supposed to find out, so I came here to atleast vent about it/ get some advice.

Background: We have known each other since kindergarten, and somewhat grew up together, however I usually see him just 3-6 times a year nowadays, we are both in our mid 20s now. For years no one in our circle of friends knew exactly what he was doing for a living (or even in general), though he sometimes had jobs like bartending, or retail. His father used to be quite rich, so we assumed that he covered atleast some of his living expenses.

I know that he goes to clubs a lot, and takes drugs (like speed, sometimes mdma), but I still don't really know wether I am  supposed to believe that story, because it's so absurd. He used to be a notorius lier during our childhood, but nowadays he is just really obscure about what he is doing exactly. One of his relatives also had a psychosis, they think it came from smoking weed or maybe some psychedelic substance.

I am personally quite normal, still in college doing my masters, and have no relation to anything criminal, nor do I really do drugs. I do have the money, though it is money I mostly got from family over the years, and some work I do besides my studies, so I would kind of feel bad giving it away for a reason like that.

Now I don't know what to do, what if it is actually true, he really has problems, and I am letting a good old friend down?

I also don't know what the chances are of me getting my money back, he was never even remotely reliable/responsible.

465,"I'm incredibly socially isolated, I'm not antisocial or introverted but I'm Autistic which must be the issue - I'm told people like me, but I'm just not capable of making connections with people. 

I've been without friends for a year, even then the people I spent time with were via Meetup rather than actual friends. If I'm being honest it's been closer to five years without friends - we drifted apart for a variety of reasons. I don't feel like I've ever really had good friends, but I'd be happy just having people to go out for the odd drink with.

I spend most of my time alone, I don't have much reason to leave the house (this is not a choice, I hate being stuck at home), at work I'm there to work so haven't made friends there and I've no hobbies - this is not for lack of trying but nothing really 'sticks' as things just aren't much fun alone. 

The general idea is to make friends you have to find ways of interacting with the same people on a regular basis, right? So how on earth do I find that opportunity when work/volunteering is out, hobbies I've tried have been a dud and I'm out of ideas. Even when I can get opportunity to be around the same people regularly...nothing. 

I don't make connections, other people seem to interact with each other and form friendships while I don't. There have been times when I've been in a group of people all getting on, but then somehow they all make plans or add each other on Facebook while I'm sat there like I'm invisible. I don't understand why I'm excluded/ignored. 

It's the cause of my depression, but I feel like I can't do anything about it because I'm out of ideas to try to meet new people and even when I do get the opportunity there's clearly something wrong with me that means people have zero interest in getting to know me. What do I do?",20Jul2019,0

467,"Hi everyone, I’m 25f (about to be 26) and will be purchasing a home with me bf (27). We’ve been together about 7 years and have lived in an apartment for 5 years I believe. We both have full time jobs. 

Our apartment was perfectly fine for us when we moved in, but we’ve out grown it now and have really been wanting to purchase a house.

However my parents (mom in particular) are really opposed to us buying a house. She basically thinks we’re looking at houses that are way too expensive and that we won’t be able to afford it, we’re too young, we won’t have any free time, it will be so much work, we’ll hate it, etc. 

I told her that I calculated our budget and we can afford it. We know it will be a lot of work but for us, but the pros of owning a house outweigh the cons.

She thinks I should buy a house in a crappy part of town for cheap or just get a nicer apartment, which we can’t do in our area because it’s literally more expensive than buying a house. Sorry if I want to feel safe in my own damn neighborhood. 

I think part of the reason she’s being so negative about this whole thing is because my parents had a bad experience buying their first house. It sounds like they were almost tricked in to buying a house that had a lot of problems with it and were basically told the problems were no big deal, that they didn’t need homeowners insurance, etc. My parents are also very grumpy, negative people to begin with. I tend to have a brighter outlook on things. Actually, I thought I considered myself to be quite pessimistic, but compared to them I’m not lol. 

I totally understand buying a house is a huge deal, and I explained that to her but I feel like she thinks I’m an idiot and I’m not responsible enough.  I wish she could just be supportive as I wanted this experience to be exciting. And instead, it feels like I’m just making everyone upset even though it’s my life and will be my house I will be living in, not hers. 

I guess I just wondered if anyone else had shit from their parents when buying a house. I feel like she genuinely wants me to be miserable.",20Jul2019,0

He says he's pretty sure she's trying to hook up with him and he's down for it. I feel like he'd probably regret it, especially if they end up getting caught by her husband. At the same time, it's not really any of my business and he's an adult and can make his own choices.

That's all well and good, but I want a hobby that is also a useful skill and that I can be proud of. I also want it to be something I can use to be emotionally expressive. After giving many potential hobbies my thought, I boiled it down to either learning to play piano or learning to draw.

I own a piano as well as art supplies and a drawing tablet (I usually prefer to draw digitally). I'm very interested in observing and listening to art and music. So for me it's difficult to choose.

I personally feel a little more drawn to learning how to draw. At the same time, I think the piano would be a more valuable skill and would be useful since I don't in choir and enjoy performing.

The question I would like an opinion on is the following: do I continue the family business and pretty much guarantee being comfortable financially but highly dislike the work OR follow my passion of scuba diving and pursue something in that field and potentially do something I love but struggle financially (most likely) for the first years of doing it.

Also, the way I was brought up, money is very important to me because I enjoy having the ability to experience things in life and the not having to worry about bills are pretty nice.

475,"Hi everyone, recently I’ve been trying to get into making educational videos (audio only, no face cam) and I’ve been really struggling with getting the speaking down. I make a lot of mistakes when trying to record even though I know exactly what to say. Even with a script it doesn’t help. I just make mistakes (like stammering or occasionally stuttering) every 3 sentences or so. It takes me a lot of tries just to get 1 or 2 minutes of speaking done well.

&amp;#x200B;

In day to day life my speech isn’t perfect either but its not this bad. I sometimes have trouble getting the words out even when I know what I want to say, or I mumble unintentionally. Speaking slower does generally help but it doesn’t completely fix my issues.

478,"So in a previous relationship with a very strict christian dude, i made friends with his sister and his sister's bff, their parents are also very strict christian and are friends with my mother. That dating relationship ended and i've scored huge with my bf in college of 1 year. 

Moving in with my new bf was a difficult decsion, and my mom was insanely embarrassed that we werent married, and i understand her fears for me, so i neglected to tell anyone i knew who was a child of her close friends, so that she wouldnt be at risk of getting scolded for not being a good christian or something, so i let her break the news to her friends, but some stronger evangelical friends of hers dont know about it. 

These two girls are technicaly my only friends, and they brought up visiting my new apartement earlier, but i guessed that they wouldnt folow through with it and they didnt. They've let me down before and i consider them friends dispite knowing that theyre closer to little siblings or girls who come to me for advice rather than someone i can rely on, i am 20 and they are 19 and 18. 

Today one of them mentioned a specific date to visit me, and now i'm worried that they will find out, and tell my ex and their parents. 
I guess i dont care if anyone finds out, but i was really close to their parents and friend group, and i dont want to find out somewhere in the future that they're dissapointed in me. 
These two girls are my best friends, because they always assume good intentions, and dont cut me off when i spent time being un-social and away at college.

I've been really lonely lately and I want them to come over, but their parents might not let them stay the night f they knew, when should i tell them that i'm living with my bf? If they stay the night do we set up sleeping bags in the living room? Or do i sleep in my bed and set them up in the livinf room? I'm not an expert at sleepovers even if this happens. 

I guess i have more questions than i thought, if you guys have any advice let me know? Thank you so much for reading thru this.

479,"I struggled with depression for a long time and I though I had taken care of it but it kept coming back really hard. My best friend died 2 years ago and it still hurts me a lot because I never got to tell her how I actually felt about her. I really liked her more than just friends but then one day she just left. I never got to tell her anything about it and she died from a car wreck so it's not like I could have time in the hospital to tell her. I still feel like it's my fault a little bit and it hurts. So I told my friend that I wanted to just drink a little and he said he'd get the stuff. Well about 3 shots of Kentucky bourbon later I just thought never mind I don't want to drink a little I want to forget everything, so I did. I had about 8 shots and I can't remember much about last night and it honestly felt amazing. I liked not being able to remember anything I liked not feeling anything at all.

483,"
There's a lot of background info here...it all started earlier this year, me (F16) and a colleague of mine (M16) decided to apply for this summer job together, we'd agree to stick with one another to cover each other's backs. The last time I had a job on my own was last summer, and there were a few instances where I had to deal with inconveniences on my own. I had no one to rely to and it was difficult since there was favoritism. So, we decided to have a summer job together to avoid that (as the same thing happened to him last year in a different work site). Unfortunately, neither of us got accepted, so we part ways to finding a job on our own. He manage to find a job at this supermarket while i struggle to find one on my own in my area due to language barrier (I don't know how to speak Spanish in a Spanish neighborhood).

 Recently however, he contacted me and mentioned how there was a job opening at his job, so I immediately spring into action to find out the details. After doing research, the supermarket was 30 minutes away from my home, it was closer than I expected it to be! I was looking forward to being a cashier, yet he mentioned how this job will continue even after the summer. I was still interested nevertheless, I'm a rising senior this year and it's required to have an internship/job to get the necessary credit in my high school, perhaps having this job will cover up that criteria!  It felt like the right opportunity so I went in and submit an application.  It was a guarantee that I'll get accepted as well since the manager wanted to hire people.

 The problem however, is my parents. Don't get me wrong, I love them to death, and they love me to death as well, and it felt like a miracle that they said yes to this job. My mom was on board at first, i told her all the details and information about it, but she was hesitant about me working in the fall. She said ""we'll see how it goes"" and we eventually told it to my dad. To my surprise, he gave the green light. Now here's the problem- as I went to the supermarket to submit my working papers, the manager asked about the info to my school, and asked if I can work in the winter time. I told her that it depends on my parents over that topic, and she said that she can't hire me for a month since it's already late in the summer. She then said to come back and  submit the working papers if I get the green light from my parents that I can work during the school year. 

I texted my mom what the manager told me as I get home, and she responded with a simple ""no"". When I came home, my dad told me that my mom explained to him what happened. At first he said he wasn't sure if he'll let me do it. I went to my room and thought about my decision- I knew that this year will be harder to go through, that it'll be another responsibility that I'll have to put my all in. After thinking for a while, I felt like it was the right decision to work during the school year. I was aware that it might become the next burden to stress about, but I am close to broke after spending my all of my money to help my family get out of debt (the same money that i earned with my last summer job), and I really felt like this was a good footing. I went to my parents to tell them about my decision...

...except, once those words slipped out of my mouth, I hadn't realized I opened Pandora's box.

My dad started to lecture me, saying how he said no was no and that i should have accepted the answer to it. His tone became anger infested over time and he started to yell at me, I pointed out that he was getting mad and said that he is in fact, mad at me, and started to blame me for not having a summer job because of my own decision (aka, not going to the same job I worked before despite telling him my experience...). He tried to drag my mom into this but she didn't want to be a part of it from her lack of attention, her only response was to clarify that she doesn't want me to get this job. 

He also mentions that he wants me to follow the ""get in, get out, go home"" rule he established in my head (to go to school for school only). He did mention how he was worried I'll get stressed out for having work and I'll admit, that was a fair point. But he's forgetting that my high school (who he happen to work there!) has only 4 classes (gym included). 

Then he started to pull out the religion card....

This is where the sensative stuff begins, I really feel uncomfortable when talking about religion based on how it plays in my life, but given how it plays a part in this scenario, it's best to bring it up. My parents are in this strict religion. Although I respect their beliefs and teachings, I slowly grew out of that given mindset simply because I'm no longer interested in it..and honestly, I'm worried about posting this post because of this topic ..not sure if my dad will see this since he can see what I post...but...I'm desperate...dad if you're seeing this...now you know...I'm sorry...

He mentions how I should prioritize my religious practices more instead of this job. He mentions how it proves to him where my heart is placed in, and after he said that, he immediately turned down my position for the job after that thought...he isn't aware I proclaim I dont want to be a part of this group, but he has the idea...and I feel like it's dragging me down with these sort of opportunities....I need to get money as well in case of i get kicked out for not following his beliefs. My colleague is aware of this situation hence why he's helping me get this job (he even recommend me to his work place!). I trust him with every ounce, (hence another reason why I want to work there...). 

I am aware that a job is a job. It's not a place to hang out or goof around, it's a responsibility to take...but after taking the initiative by doing this on my own to get the process of working there, being aware that I'll work during the school year, having money to save for my future with someone nearby that i can rely on... It feels right to take the position as soon as possible...

My parents are amazing, I'll take a bullet for them if something were to happen...but times like these makes me feel as if they're being too over protective/meticulous. They think this is for my own good, but in reality, it's a lost hope for me. 

So...any advice to convince them to work there during the fall/winter time?

484,"So, here's some background on the general situation that I'm in. I used to live with my mom and she was horribly abusive, screaming on a daily basis at the smallest things. If my shoes were in the wrong spot she would go into hysterics and threaten to harm herself as well as myself. I moved out a couple of years ago and since then have graduated college and things have gotten better.  


Here comes the part I need help with, she sent me money today. Specifically she sent $200 and told me that it was for my tuition payments (which are currently in a grace period). I contacted her to ask why and essentially she told me that she was upholding a previous promise that was made and that the money would continue to be sent on a monthly basis. My issue with this is that I feel the money very much comes with strings attached and that her ""generosity"" will be thrown in my face at some point down the road. I'm currently unemployed and could use the money, but I am weary and don't know what the correct course of action is... I've had issues with her that involved money in the past.

485,"I guess I could divide my loneliness into sections:


1. Friends - My friends flake on me all the time. When I invite them to things they bail on the last minute. They don’t invite me to things. Last weekend was supposed to be my graduation party and every one of them cancelled the day before.


2. Boyfriend - My boyfriend doesn’t spend time with me. I have to drive 30 min to see him, but he can’t drive and never makes his dad drive him to see me. He can’t see me like 4 days out of the week (which includes weekends) because he “has to spend time with his little brother.” I am working Mon-Fri from 7 am when I leave for work to 6 pm when I get home and yet he doesn’t try to meet me halfway on this. 


3. General unhappiness - I don’t have anything I enjoy anymore. My college is going to cost soooooo much and I am absolutely terrified. I fear I’m going to have no future. I always wanted to be a PhD researcher, it was my dream, but with the cost of college I’ve realized that such a dream would err on the side of impossible (or at least it’d be a massively stupid investment). I have no real hobbies except running and lifting...


The adults in my life say things to the tune of I shouldn’t be so worried about my future, I don’t need to worry about my boyfriend and it’s better for me I don’t see him, that of course friends will bail on a weekend party bc their families will make plans...I just feel so incredibly lonely and like a huge loser.

491,"So about 5 months ago I lost my full time job that I'd held for about 5 years. The job market where I live is tough, and it was very hard for me to find a new job. I applied to hundreds, if not thousands of jobs over the past few months and went to several dozen interviews. This week, I finally landed myself a new job. 

In the advertisement posted online, it was very clearly stated this would be a 40 hour/week position. I was told it would be 40 hours per week in the interview also. I was told it paid $16/hour and provided great health insurance in the ad and the interview.  $16 isn't great, but at full time would be enough for me to pay my bills, or so I thought. 

On my first day, I was informed by my supervisor that the job would actually pay $13/hr for the first 90 days, and after that point I would get paid $16/hr. This was not mentioned in the interview or in the ad at all. I asked how to enroll in benefits, and then I found out that I also would not be getting health insurance until 90 days in. I understand that some employers make you wait to receive benefits, but they made it seem like in the ad and in the interview it would be immediate. I have a heart condition that requires me to take medication and see a doctor, and I definitely worry about having to wait another 3 months to get insured. Lastly, I was told this would be a full time, 40 hour position. I can see the schedule through next month and I'm only going to be working 25 to 31 hours per week. This is obviously not full time, and has me worried now that I won't be able to pay my rent, student loan, and other bills as I'll be making $3 an hour less than I originally thought and working way less hours than I was told I would be. Basically they reeled me in letting me think I was going to be making $640 a week but in reality I'm making half that for the next 3 months. 

Is there anything I can do here? I feel like this was extremely shady and deceptive on my employer's part, but I'm scared if I kick up a fuss I'm just going to be terminated and be right back to where I started. $13 an hour and 25 hours a week is still better than the $0 I was bringing in before.

I’ve now asked again, completely stable and with a job. Feel like I’m being pushed back- should I be suspicious and how should I deal with it? 

My stepdad came into my mums life in 2013. He is okay I guess. On the one hand he is good for my mum, they seem to get on well and he makes her happy, so I am happy up to a point. On the other hand I find him rude and abrasive and I believe my mum puts up with a lot of crap behind closed doors. I think he’s on the spectrum somewhere and has strange ways of doing things. Despite claiming otherwise he is terrible with money. He has two children, both are married and extremely successful. I am my mums only child and the sole inheritor of everything she has. 

4 years ago I became unwell with bipolar disorder. I experienced a psychotic breakdown where my main ‘delusion’ was that my stepdad was extorting money off my mum. I confronted my mum in this very unwell state and demanded to fix her will. Of course she said no, and she was right to- I was very ill at the time. 

Fast forward 4 years and I’m moderately happy, sadly divorced but successful in my own right. I’m about to finish my nursing degree and will start work as a mental health nurse in a few months time. I take my meds every day and have been relatively stable for a long time now. I don’t have psychosis any longer and haven’t had for many years. 

I have asked my mum a few times in the past few months to sit down with her and my stepdad to discuss her will. At present, or so I’ve been told, all that is written is a scrap of paper that says her house is mine and anything my stepdad has belongs to his children. The only problem is that my stepdad recently ploughed a good deal of money into an extension on her house, so saying the house is ‘mine’ is a little unclear. Because I’m stable, I have a job and also have a 4 year old daughter to think about, I have asked my mum for us all to sit down and discuss what’s what. It is also obvious to me that my mums death would fuck my mental health up pretty badly, so I need to understand and know what is what ahead of time so that I can protect myself and my daughter. 

I get on okay with my stepdad. He’s never really made any active moves to get to know me. When he met my mum he didn’t take me out for a meal or go for a walk with me or anything like that. He asked my mum to marry him without asking me which, being brought up the way I have, I found very difficult to deal with. I would never have said no, don’t get me wrong, but I’ve always thought it’s nice to ask. I asked my ex’s dad and brother to marry her, so I guess I’m traditional like that. At best I find him entertaining and funny, at worst he is rude and abrasive. We’ve never truly warmed to one and other, which I think might be the problem. I’ve tried my best with him but I’ve kinda just left things now. I’m too busy with my kid, my degree and my work to do much about our relationship. 

There’s something fishy about this whole will thing though. Don’t worry friends, before you say it, no, I’m not relapsing in my mental health- I promise you that. Every time I’ve asked to sit down and discuss it, my mum will say ‘oh (my stepdad) thinks it’d be a good idea to have a few months work under your belt’ or words to that effect, which worries me. My primary concern is this- my mums death will probably make me mentally unwell. When I am mentally unwell, I am vulnerable. I need to have everything carved in stone so that I can focus on my health, grieving appropriately, my daughter and getting back to work when something happens to my mum. I need to have it written explicitly- this will go to you, that will go to them. The house will be split this way, and that will go other other way, so to speak. I need to be sure that, should be stepdad turn out to be the manipulator that I wonder if he could be, he has no way of fucking me over whilst I’m unwell with my mental health. Being a nurse I know all about capacity, and I do not want my capacity, or lack thereof, to be brought into question if my mum passes away. 

I guess I just wanted to ask you all- do you think I’m being stupid to ask for a meeting between to the two of them? Am I being too suspicious of my stepdad or do you feel I have reason to be? What is the best way to approach this. 

Sorry for the long post. To those of you who have made It this far, thanks for reading!",20Jul2019,2
509,"So my little sister (16) has recently come out as trans and decided on a male name etc. When they were a girl, they were so tomboyish for as long as we all can remember. Like, hated dresses and all things girly. At 14, our mum finally agreed to letting my sister cut their hair really short, shaved back and sides and long at the top... 

we are a muslim family and i can honestly say nobody has a bad thing to say about it. we said we still loved them no matter what, and that we were actually not surprised. because when i looked at them prior to coming out as trans, i couldn’t see a boy or a girl. even referring to them as “she” felt wrong. it just didn’t fit. even in public, they were often mistaken as a boy. but he is boy now i guess...

Our only issue here is he is still so closed off, and has been for a very long time. i feel like i barely know him. he was diagnosed with asperger‘s at 12, and has always been difficult to talk to. he’s not a bad kid, just doesn’t know how to express himself. if it helps to add, both of our dads (we have the same mum) are very absent. like they’re literally not a part of our lives. mines is a heavy gambler and my brother’s father is a violent heroin addict. we’re very happy without them, our mum has had the shittest luck with men but she has honestly done her best raising us all. so anyway, i’ve been trying for the past week to get him to hang out, talk some, but he just wants to sit in his room or go out with friends, which is a lot of the time. i thought that after he’d came out, he would feel a lot better but not yet.

i think my mum is having a little difficulty, but there’s zero tension or arguing. everything is basically still the same. i get that he’s 16 and all teenagers at this point are mostly about themselves, but i don’t know how to find out how he’s really feeling. i’ve made him promise that if anybody says anything he’s to tell me, as in the past he’s been bullied for the way he looks. before coming out he was called “tranny”, “lesbo” and i was always there to fight his corner. 

sorry for rambling and my ignorance. i want to make sure he’s okay. every time i ask he says “yes i’m fine” maybe he is, but this is a huge journey. 

does anybody have any advice on what steps i can take?",20Jul2019,1
510,"Hi everyone, this is my alternate account because I *think* they know main, so I'm just going to use this account just so they won't see this post.

I am 13yrs/o, and only child with seperated parents and living with my mother. I have zero contact with my cousins (4 cousins) on my paternal side due to family problems I won't be talking about. On the other hand, I have two cousins on my maternal side but they live overseas.

The two cousins on my maternal side are the point of the story «19M, 21F». Also, keep in mind, that I am their only maternal cousin, and they have A LOT of cousins in their paternal side

Since they live abroad, we never usually contact, however we would have occasional DM's, and liking each other's Facebook posts and photos. But they usually come home every year or two for vacation.

We have an age gap «5 and 7yrs», but when we were children, we were absolutely close. Really close. I just can't explain, but we'd do shitty things and stuff. Fast forward to when I was 7yrs old, and that's when I've noticed things between us were definitely changing A LOT. They were around 12 and 14yrs old here. They would hang out with their ""other cousins"" on their paternal side. And they looked very happy, I was not really close with their paternal cousins but they'd invite me at least once whenever they come visit my country. I never felt socially awkward around because I was a child back then, and didn't care. Same goes for when they visited my country when I was 9yrs old.

When I was around 11yrs old, they visited again. It was for my my female cousin's 18th birthday. Normally I used to be really happy whenever they'd come home and visit us, but around this time, No I did not. I reacted with, ""Oh congrats that they're coming home"". They come home, have the party and stuff. At this point, it was unavoidable for me to notice I was awkward around them. It was really clear. Then comes the barrage of their photos with their other paternal cousins which they hang out with for multiple times, and makes me kind of sad that I was never included because I'm an only child and I wanted to have company, but my mom said it might be because of age difference to which I had agreed to. But i don't know, around that age, it really hurts that you and your blood relatives do not really have a relationship. 

Then here we come. Aged 13 me. They come home and visit again. ""oh ok"" way of thinking hits. I never really wanted to think that about my cousins. But it just really hurts for me that I do not have the validation that I am their cousin and I feel so left out.

 We can't even make a proper conversation without an awkward silence afterwards. At my age right now, I was already thinking that *it's kind of pointless* to continue to have have a relationship with them, because I never feel any validation from them, so I tend to prefer to avoid talking to them and maintain my borders around them «such as finding a way not to sit next to each other, not looking each other in the eye». I know they can feel that I'm drifting away from them. It actually really hurts for me in my part because I do not have a proper relationship with my BLOOD RELATIVES. If that continues, then I will continue drifting and I will go further and further. But, at the same time, I do not want to drift away from them, and I want a way to have a bond before it's too late. 

I feel so left out from all the other people that I have a good relationship with their cousins. I don't want to have a falling out in the future. Sorry its quite long. But please give me advice on what to do here. I do not want to have a falling out with them, and I genuinely don't know if they would even care if we do fall out from each other.",20Jul2019,1
511,"Overweight father in his late 50s had a blood test a few months ago. Doctors said it looked as though he had diabetes, but further tests would confirm in 2 weeks time. For those 2 weeks he was terrified. He hates needles, and is fully aware of the lifestyle changes and severe impact diabetes would have, including possible complications (blindness, amputation etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

Yet for those 2 weeks, he ate worse than ever, as though it was his last chance to eat what he wanted before *becoming* diabetic. Anyway tests came back negative, he's not got diabetes but is pre diabetic and unless he changes his diet, will be soon.

&amp;#x200B;

But now it's back to normal. I estimate he eats between 3000-5000 calories a day, made up from carb-dense foods (pies, chips, potatoes, bread so much bread, anything dense and unhealthy, not sugary stuff like cakes or sweets). He supposedly tries to 'diet' but is terrible at it - never sticks to it, and even when he does, it's just frozen vegetables *as well as* all the normal shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't think he really gives a fuck. As far as I'm concerned, diabetes is just the beginning. I'm worried about heart attacks, and all sorts of health issues that are inevitably to come. He won't last another 5 years. What do I do? He just doesn't listen or seem to care. What can I do to make him listen, or how can I help him?",20Jul2019,1
512,"I first met Ryan when we all went to the family cabin out in the middle of nowhere on a lake. Ryan had bipolar disorder and I remember one time seeing him sprawled out on the deck after taking too much Lithium? I don't know. He was a hippie wild dude. He also brought pot to the cabin but we lost it on a kayak trip. Anyways, Ryan turned out to be a pretty cool guy and I really liked him. And he made my aunt happy so I was happy.

A few months later I fall into a very deep depression. I called Ryan and we just started talking for hours and hours. And we really bonded. And I fucking loved the guy. I was happy and he really helped me out in my time of need.

Ryan had a ton of issues. He also did a lot of drugs and was actually a felon. But my aunt loved him. So I never really cared about his past.

Then I find out through my grandmother that Ryan was actually abusing my aunt? I don't know the full details, but apparently, the police were called in? I don't know the details and I don't know what happened, I just know..that Ryan was hitting her or something. Ryan was being shitty towards my aunt, yelling and fighting.

After finding that out, I just haven't really reached out to him.

It then turns out that my aunt got back together with him, and somehow they are together and happy? My aunt called me on my birthday and wished me happy birthday, and Ryan was there. Ryan smokes pot with my aunt's money and is kind of...a loser. I think he finally got a job though.

I love my aunt. But I just feel...kind of weird knowing that this dude I liked turned out to be violent towards my own aunt.

Obviously, my aunt forgave him, they are still together.

Ryan has been through a lot. I get that. But that doesn't mean he can hit my aunt? And I don't even KNOW if he hit her. I wasn't there and they live in Texas. So I have no idea what happened.

My aunt doesn't want to talk about it since it's her private life. But she said I could call Ryan anytime. My grandmother forgave him.

Should I just pretend nothing ever happened and act like everything is normal for my aunt? Should I call Ryan again and act like everything is just totally fine and nothing happened?

Should I just do what makes my aunt happy? I want my aunt to be happy..

516,"Hi, throwaway account here. My mom and I have drastically different veiwpoints, I am 14. BTW throwaway account, long one as well.

My mother is a hardcore liberal, while I am a hardcore conservative, we are constantly arguing about everything as she can't respect anything I believe.

She is so lazy it's not even funny, she can't take care of her lawn, and her house is a post cause, my room is typically a little disorganized, but is no match for the perverbeal pigpen that is the rest of the house. I get stuck cleaning every part of the house, and running things everywhere, while she stands there yelling at me to put everything where it goes. To clarify, I never mess up the kitchen, I solely spend most my time in my room.

I used to have a longer hair cut. But when I turned about 13 I decided to get a simple, military type haircut. I get a l1/2 in on top, and 1/4 in on top. Now every time I get my hair trimmed up, she pissed and moans of how it's too short. My dad is the one who takes my hair to get cut, they spilt up when I was 4.

If my dad's girlfriend (who is a super awesome mother, don't worry) does anything with me, she's jealous. She just recently had a child, who is now 5 months old. My mom has a book of me, she takes a bunch of pictures every year, and puts them in a book and ships it to everyone she is friends with. She keeps trying to get my little 5 month old brother into the book. My dad's girlfriend does not want that, which I respect.

This weekend, I'm going to an antique tractor show which I'm forced to go to, because if I say no she will get pissy. I then have to go to her friends house, who has two kids, 2 of which are around my age, those are the only ones I like.

We are going to Ireland this spring break, which I have no inclination to do, I would like to stay home, fish, and relax, but I can't. She also REALLY likes to take me to other countries even though she knows I don't enjoy it.

She obviously doesn't approve of my friend Matthew because he likes guns, like me, and is a conservative.

She wants me to be more into sports, though I'm not inclined phisically at all.thw only thing I do school wise, is shoot trap or skeet, whatever you call it.

She plans things without asking me what I want, and gets pissy if I decline afterwards. She doesn't let me do my own thing ever because she wants her little boy forever.

She has admitted that she wants me to be gay, even though she knows that I am against that.

She cries, bitches, moans, and will constantly throw hissy fits to get her way.

She seems to like to make me uncomfortable with many unsettling conversations and comments.

At the day I turn 18 it plan to tell her to eat shit, and walk out.

What can I do In the meantime to stubble her bitchiness. I need this to stop, I don't know what to do.

519,"I dropped out of university 9 months ago. I felt like I was going just to please my family and to follow ""the norm"", and after 3 years of pretending everything was okay and I could do it, I decided it was just a waste of time and dropped out of it. So I've gone back to living with my mum while trying to decide what to do. I've also recently started therapy to deal with that and some other issues.

But I'm still stuck. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could choose to go to another university, but I'm not completely sure on what I'd like to do. I don't know what job I want to do when I'm older (I just turned 23) and I'm afraid that choosing randomly based on some momentary preference would lead to me dropping out again.

On the other hand, I have little to none work experience and no degree, so finding a job would also be difficult. However, I would like to gain some work experience, to start gaining some money, and just have an excuse to go back to living on my own, but I'm worried that if I then decided to go back to university, I would then be too old.

&amp;#x200B;

I get it sound illogical but I sometimes already feel like I'm too old to turn my life around, and whatever I'll do I'll just end up wasting the rest of my life.

Despite being only 23, I kind of feel like I'm already late. If I went back to university right now I'd be 3 years older than everyone else, but if I waited trying to find a job just to ""pass the time"" I would be even older if I eventually decided to go back to school.

I've been stuck for a few months, and I keep feeling more and more pressure to choose quickly.

How should I decide whether to go back to University and start from scratch or try and find a job when I just feel kind of hopeless about both options?",20Jul2019,1

My whole body got itchy and hot, and these hives came up. I threw up twice, but luckily I took Benadryl, and I’m better now.

So about 2/3 years ago I got sexually, emotionally abused and raped for 6 months while I was in a relationship with a guy and after that ended I left it be until now.  I got some  counseling a few months ago but that’s stopped now, but my counselor put me in contact with child protective services (we were both 16/17) and it took months but I recently finally got to meet with them and discuss what could happen. 

During the 2/3 years I dropped out of school but a friend of mine was in school and a few months ago my rapist was being so passive aggressive towards them by eyeing them down in the hall and trying to win a staring battle (getting dominance). I don’t know how he found out but someone told him what I “accused” him of so when he was doing this he knew what the friend of mine knew too. 
A few weeks after this started they were both about to walk by each other and my friend spat in his face.
He turned and hit their back but they kept walking because they didn’t want to look back.

Now I’ve met with the child protective services and they’re going to set a meeting up with the guards to let me talk about my options. Will my friend get in trouble for spitting in his face when he mentions it after he finds out (if I chose to do something about it) what I’m saying towards him.  Is it worth pressing charges?

528,"Hello, r/advice! i just found you because I‘m really struggling with confidence in tense situations/conflict conversations. This is especially true for conflict with my partner. (And previous partner) Being that I‘m already 26 years old and about to move in with my partner whom I do love very much I feel like it’s time to change that about myself.


For a little history, I‘ve been dealing with depression (although I’m pretty fine about that right now) and what I would consider some level of social uncomfortableness/anxiety for a looong time. It’s very hard if not impossible for me to open myself up to people and I‘m rather scared of being vulnerable. I attribute this to me being very scared of people disliking me/leaving me, thus it’s very hard to be „real“. (Can’t really link it to a cause but it’s just always been there.) When I am real it makes me feel kind of vulnerable.


My main problem with it at this point is that I have a tough time telling my partner things I don‘t like or getting mad or just even asking for things if I feel like she might get upset or mad and she often doesn‘t react in the best way imo. This makes it even more difficult for me.
Conflict really exhausts me emotionally and I cave very easily. This, however, leads to me not really getting what I need and it’s been taking a toll on me. Consequently I‘m not really in a place I want to be at the moment.


Is there any way I can try to be better about just setting boundaries, complaining about what I don’t like and maybe even resolving situations in a way that doesn’t lead to me caving and saying things I don’t agree with just to relieve the tension and have peace?

I love my partner very very much and I‘ve been getting so frustrated and angry about this and her by extension and I don’t really want it to stand in our way.

I know this is a lot of text and kind of difficult but I‘m sort of at my wit‘s end and would appreciate any advice you can give me.",20Jul2019,1

Me (16)
Sister (17)
Brother (9)


My parents got divorced around 6 months ago, we all expected it and it was a welcome change because the arguing was getting too much for my siblings and me to handle. At first things went smoothly and it didn’t affect us that much because we still lived in the same house. My father made a substantial amount of money in his working career and needed to legally give half of it to my mother. Things started to get bumpy when my parents lost trust in each other and didn’t believe the numbers being sent around. After things nearly got very bad, a deal was struck and it didn’t affect my brother too much because he is young and doesn’t understand finances. An unexpected change occurred when my mother moved away to a different house. The agreement we made was to switch every Friday. When we were at our Mothers house, she slowly started to become more and more difficult to support. She was spiralling because she missed having a family and she missed her ex husband. I think this is the appropriate time to mention that my father is addicted to alcohol and he was very difficult to live with. We reminded my mother every day how difficult it was to live with him but then suddenly my father got a new girlfriend. This was the last straw for my mother and her sudden outbursts of sadness would cause my siblings to cry at the same time. Yesterday night my father and his new girlfriend stayed up until four o’clock drinking and I saw this as the last straw. I told him everything that is wrong and that he will lose his children if he continues, this was met with an angry backlash in which he told me I should just go live with my mother. I formulated a text message to close friends of the family and my mother. When I woke up in the morning my father and his girlfriend were still drunk and the close family friends came to take the children away from the environment we had become all too used to. My father quickly became violent. There was lots of shouting and screaming from both sides and my brother and sister were both crying.

Well so far we’ve had the downstairs ceiling collapse because there was a leak we didn’t catch and the ac hasn’t worked a day we’ve lived here and now the downstairs has mold everywhere. We payed out of pocket to have someone come in and look at the HVAC to see what was wrong since it’s been hot, and the worker told us the capacitor and fan motor were busted and the furnace has a crack in the heat exchange which can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning. Now we’re scared that maybe he didn’t have someone come in and ground the outlets because if he didn’t then that can cause a fire. Also he had his son come in and supposedly he (his son) fixed all these since he works as a mechanical contractor. But he did it under the table for free and so it was only him “working” on these and not his actual company. We don’t have the money to fix all this and we were wondering if we are in our legal right to sue.",20Jul2019,1

Ok so since my parents have separated, they have both become so incredibly toxic. When I try to talk to them about, they quickly shoot me down and just say ""We'll talk about it later."" When in reality, 'later' never comes. Also I don't want to be involved in all of this family drama (I come from a big family, so there's bound to be a few issues that come with it). 

I just wish I could take the car, and go. No looking back, no regrets, just me, the car, and wherever I may end up. I don't have any definitive plans to where I want to be, but I've been trying to talk to my family about letting me go on vacation by myself (did I mention that they're VERY clingy helicopter parents?). I was thinking about starting off in Buffalo, NY, which is about a two hour drive from where I live. Then, I go up to Canada, and just improvise from there. 

My question is, are there any places I could go to that might be able to shelter me? I also have virtually no money to my name so I would prefer something free.

•I am currently 18 years old, have been escorting since I was a very young age.

•I have a pimp who controls most of the money I earn and it’s been very hard for me to get away from him, he’s very possessive and doesn’t treat me well.

•I live in Odessa, I have reached out to various Ukrainian organizations numerous times via email/phone call(I have left voicemails because oddly enough they never seem to answer)

•I sometimes travel to different countries for escorting with my pimp, but I’m afraid if I say something and try to get help I’ll be made out a liar.

•I’ve escorted for a lot of well-known figures, and I’ve been threatened if I say something despite not wanting to give out their names anyway.

545,"Hello, I was wondering if anyone would be able to point me in the right direction.

Since december 2014 I started having physical issues that really controlled my life for a couple of years.  I've been doing meditation, exercise, breathing methods, diet changes, massively improved mentally, physical therapy, psychologist and some other things like a sensory deprivation tank. Although I'm more in control now, the issues haven't desolved entirely and I keep trying different approaches to find a solution.

Basically the issues come down to the fact that my body is in a 24/7 state of tension, or fight/flight mode (I think?). Mostly my chest, belly and pelvic area feel like they're on lockdown. Over the last couple of months I really started to notice that I haven't really felt any physical emotions like joy, excitement, arousal etc. ever since around the time the issues started to appear.

A few days back I started to try a breathing method called ""box  breathing"" and I got a splitsecond glimpse of ease in my chest, a possibility to relax and feel, but it went away afterwards. See, those breathing methods help slightly but I have big difficulty doing them the correct way. When I first went to physical therapy I had to do breathing exercises, but unknowingly I did them very forcefully, where I contract and tense muscles in my torso and belly to ""help"" with the breathing which have a contradicting effect. I did this for so many months, maybe years that I really don't know how to properly breath in my chest and my belly.

My question is, does anyone know how to relearn the correct way of breathing. Which type of therapist could be of help, is there any material or any other way that could be of use? And secondly, does anyone have any techniques or tips I could use to relax my body and get out of fight/flight? I'm even considering breaking a personal rule to see if something like weed could be of use as I feel like I've been trying so many different things without success.

548,"Hello, reddit! I really need your advice for this one because I have no idea what to do.
As the title says, I have major depression. I was hospitalized for my first suicide attempt, I am on meds and go to therapy weekly to keep it in check. Basically my mental health is really bad but I do my best to keep it in check. 
Now the fun part. In order to keep people close to me, I chose not to reveal my disorder to them. I have in the past and those people decided they were better off without me. And I get that, it could be consuming. I developed this strategy of me being a total different person as my instincts tell me. Try to be brave, go out, meet new people, get a new look I could have been too scared to try. It went great until people believed I was a very strong and happy person and they are trying to hurt me now. 
Because I chose my boyfriend (who is about to become a therapist) over some of those people, they became jealous. They started to threaten him and me, messaging me on anonymous phone numbers, telling us the other is cheating, getting on my nerves. They have a lot of influence in my college (they are the popular and childish freshmen who people sort of fear) and they turned people against me, which is scaring me a lot. 
I have been bullied in the past and this is coming back now from people I thought liked me. I was wrong. 
What should I do? I am too afraid to stand up for myself and I wouldn't want them to know that I am already suicidal and depressed.
Should I keep my out going and 
friendly persona? Should I tell them the truth?
I really need your advice.",20Jul2019,1

550,"I'm a physics student in my final year of an integrated masters and, despite having my dream PhD position lined up, I can't find the motivation to finish. 

Uni was always an uphill struggle, I was mediocre in school, had to catch up in sixth form, had a lot of mishaps but I always managed to get through by the skin of my teeth. Then things really looked up. 
I took a placement year abroad with a lab, got on great, constantly praised and wrote my dissertation there. Received the highest grade of my cohort, wrote publications and everyone felt as though my success was a given. 

Then I got back to uni to finish my degree. I was a little slow to start the semester out, but I felt it was normal. About half way in I began to worry, things weren't sticking and I had no drive for my lectures. It felt like all id come back to do was pick up a glorified piece of paper and leave, all but one of my modules weren't relevant to my chosen path. 

Fast forward and I flunked most of my exams and I'm facing retakes which I still don't feel motivated to do, despite having everything lined up if I can just get across the finish line. 

I'm starting to wonder if the problem is deeper, do I really want this? Do I really want a thankless, underpaid and overworked job? Is that all my passion was worth.

I can still cash out a BSc even if I fail the retakes. But it just feels like a core component of my identity is gone. To all my friends and family I'm the hard working science type. I really don't know what to do about it.

552,"Some backstory: he's a Vietnam veteran that has worked harder than any man seemingly on the planet. But all that work has come with the cost of brushing death hundreds of times. This includes falling off of several cliffs, a movie screen, breaking nearly every bone in his upper body, being in car crashes including being t-boned by a firetruck at 63, and many many more. He was forced to retire at 65, and ever since has been going off the rails with house projects seemingly every day since he retired. 

The current issue: My grandpa is 70 years old as of now, and when I came down south from my home in Atlanta he had called beforehand to say that he had a project he needed my help with. I was skeptical because he usually tells me what it is and this was the first he kept it a secret from me beforehand, but I agreed regardless because he means the world to me. Fast forward, I get to my hometown and pull into my grandparents' driveway, and my grandpa comes out looking straight up homeless (Full white beard, longy stringy black mullet, dirty, shoeless, and covered in grass) and decides that that was the best time to show me this ""project."" As it turns out he wanted to cut down this fucking massive oak tree himself without any prior experience doing so. Before my dad passed he worked for Asplundh and we know plenty of people there to do it for us at a ridiculously cheaper rate than usual, so I offered and he very obviously felt betrayed. I helped him with the first branch regardless, and after using a God damned ladder to get up to the branch 30 feet in the air, while carrying a running chainsaw, the branch he lopped off came back and nearly launched the ladder out from underneath of him to make him fall. It was there that my family and I called out friends at Asplundh anyway to come by and do it, at no cost to him, and as of now he's out there doing the job alone. 

Thoughts: I understand he feels like we're just trying to hold him back, but we are only doing this because we're worried about his health. He thinks he's invincible and that he knows what he's doing when in reality he has no earthly idea what exactly is the safest and best way to do the job. He lied to me by not telling me what he wanted to do and guilt tripping me into doing it anyway when I found out, and he's trying to manipulate our friend at Asplundh to cut a different tree down so he can do the job himself. I'm extremely worried he's a danger to himself and considering his track record of being exactly that he's not convincing anyone otherwise.

The question: What can I do? I understand his issue with us, but he's as stubborn as can be in this family and is willing to completely ignore all concern just to do it anyway. Will police handle this? What can I do to stall until the tree cutter gets here? What are some other areas of concern to pay attention to?",20Jul2019,1

562,"I know this sounds stupid, I'm so sorry to waste anybody's time. I just don't really know what to do, my brain is frozen.

Backstory:

I knew her for over ten years, we had a rocky friendship (we met because we were dating the same adult when we were Young teenagers so obviously our relationship started in a strange and unhealthy way) but the last few years she was alive we were both trying really hard to have a genuinely positive relationship. 

As far as I knew she was very happy in her marriage, but I also know she felt a little competitive with me (totally fair, I did with her as well), and probably wouldn't have opened up to me about something like that because she would mistakenly perceive it as failure.

She told me her husband didn't want us hanging out because he thought our relationship came from a negative place and wasn't beneficial. I actually understood that thinking and told her frequently that I would completely understand if she didn't want to hang out because our relationship had such negative history and it would be completely comprehensible if she couldn't get past it. we knew a lot of negative mutual ""friends"" that I cut off for that very reason, I just happened to greatly respect this woman and her drive and found her to be a generally positive person. She insisted she felt the same way.

We chatted online every once in a while, but she had moved away with her husband so we kinda stopped talking but touched base here and there.

Suddenly out of the blue her husband posted on FB saying she had schizophrenia and had died mysteriously after coming home from the psych ward. It seemed very off for her, she was an anxious person, but never showed signs of schizophrenia, but I was under the impression they were happy together and didnt question it. I was pretty emotional about it and left a bunch of comments on her Facebook telling her I wanted her to be alive so badly.

Her parents then reached out to me asking for financial support for her funeral. I knew she was very close to her dad and he didn't have much money. I didn't care if they did a funeral or just went on vacation to take his mind off it cuz I know they were devastated so I sent them some money.

They then told me a month or so before she died, she'd come back home to them. She had bruises under her clothes and said she didn't feel safe with her husband. She ended up going back to him, but stranger still when she died her husband signed off on her cremation right away, before announcing publicly that she'd died.

Since then I firmly suspected he killed her, as none of it made sense. She was always a strong, intelligent, driven woman.

Anyway, so today said husband sends me a friend request out of nowhere years after her death. Part of me just wants to ignore it and not interact with him at all...but part of me wants to know if he has anything to say to me. Part of me wants to somehow find proof of what he did, or get some inkling of who he really was.

I feel like I owe her that effort, but I also don't want to cause any trouble...I don't know. Again I know this all sounds stupid and Petty and I'm really sorry but this is tearing me up. What would you do???",20Jul2019,0

I want to give a bit of a back story. A few years back I was robbed at gunpoint. Doctors said 99% of the injuries I had people will not make it. It has been 2 years and I have 4 major surgeries. The last two have been spinal surgeries because this was the 3rd time where I started losing my legs and the ability to walk. I’ve been through hell and back many times at this point. 

Now to the point, 

A family member recently got married. I couldn’t make it because it’s still early for me to go out and do things. I’m still recovering after my most recent surgery. The family member who got married is my sister. I found out through social media that she was engaged. I was finally told a week later. So what does that mean? Her own brother doesn’t find out through her and then find out a week later? When she got married nobody FaceTime me so I could be part of the moment. I received the video. A video?! Seriously? This is after I told two people to FaceTime me that morning so I could see and yet no a single person did it. I’m beyond hurt.

That I'll just happily fall on my face and let my enemy win. So my question is: how do I handle this?

Yeah I had to deal with entitle customers. The conditions of the restaurant was kinda gross like greasy floor, old broken wooden floors and walls. Yeah it was a very old restaurant haven’t been changed for many years . And we have rats every night, two customers left because of it. Also we have no air conditioning. After we have a new owner and new manager and some employees left too after.  The new owner did made small changes at the place but also kinda cheap. I found out he cut my pay to 7.25. The servers only gets paid by tips and hated when the customers gave them $3 for a $30 meal. Which results of them getting a second job. Last week the manager told me they are cutting me and other people off  when the business is slow, but never told me I’m cut for the whole week and never gave me a solid reason that never call me about that. I just got frustrated and left because I’m reaching to my last breaking point and told my family what happened and all told me I should quit that job. How do I quit my first job?",20Jul2019,1
570,I’m currently trying to compromise with my mother about how many days a week I work my summer job. I was away for the bulk of the summer and it’s very important to me that I see my friends and reconnect with them because I haven’t seen them since the end of school. I’ve tried reasoning with her but nothing is working. I also want to say that I am more than willing to work. But the way she constantly treats me like I can’t make these decisions on my own is making me want to do this less and less.,20Jul2019,1
571,"Im 23/f. My brother is 26. We grew up normally, we fought as kids, became close as teens, and have been cordial tho a bit distant since he moved out at 22. Despite that, he's the person i can turn to when things get the hardest and seek advice on things i cant tell anyone else

When i was 8 and he was 14, we were in bed together because a visiting uncle had taken over his room. He put his hands under my covers and touched me everywhere, under my pajamas, under my shirt, just sort of ""tickled"" and poked (as i saw it then). I think he encouraged me to do the same but i didnt. He rubbed and pushed his body against mine, which i understood as cuddling, he was quite naked, i dont know exactly how much because it was dark. It didnt strike me as too odd, it gets hot where i live. We eventually fell asleep and while i must have found it odd, it wasnt odd enough to think about, when i could think about games, and painting, and candy, and friends. If anything, i think i enjoyed him giving me positive attention since we always fought as kids

I never thought about it, even when i was sexually assaulted twice during my teenage. I didnt think about it until i was harrassed/assaulted last month. I dont know how and why, but i thought back about the incident and i understand everything now.

I know my brother is a good person. He's a tech nerd and doesnt have much game but he's alright to look at and is so wildly interesting. He respects his own and the ladies integrity in relationships, and has long standing close friendships with females too. 

I don't know what to think right now. Do people change? Should he be held responsible for his actions as a 12 y/o? Should i confront him or forgive him? I know i can move on if i choose to, pretty easily too.",20Jul2019,1

574,"I’ve recently been through something traumatic, I’ve recently started drinking more than usual. At first I felt quite numb and put on a big happy front but now it’s eating away at me. I have everything together at the moment, bills payed, social life on track, family on track, but what happened has been causing me unease and steering my concentration on all these amazing things in my life at the moment. 

I don’t want to go into too much detail but I have revenge in my heart at the moment, it’s plaguing me and tempting me. I got hurt pretty bad and I want to move on but I have it in my heart to retaliate, my pride, my ego, me as a person, feel betrayed. Like I want one up on the people involved even though we all had a part to play it was an injustice in my eyes regardless. It’s like I feel if I don’t do anything I’m betraying myself but if I do something I’m betraying myself and giving into another cycle of abuse.

I’ve spoken to close friends and family. The advice I’ve gotten so far is that how I feel is understandable and that it’s my choice how I go about this. I’ve had friends tell me they wouldn’t blame me for doing what I want to do. I’ve also had a close friend tell me that revenge won’t bring anything but heart ache and negative baggage, and to learn from my experience and forgive myself and the people involved or no matter what I won’t be able to move one. That revenge is sweet for a matter of seconds and only helps to amplify the taste for more hurt and attract more pain.

Many of us go through this and experience betrayals, we all deal with it differently. Does anyone have any advice on how I go about healing? How I go about finding a conclusion to this episode in my life feeling content with being able to let go and move on without feeling so heavy hearted

575,"Yes I know sexual attraction is a normal thing, the issue is the frequency and intensity in which it happens. I find a wide range of women attractive, big women, small women, art hoes, rave girls, goth women, almost all sizes and ""aesthetics"" are extremely attractive to me in some way.

Again, I know this isn't exactly abnormal, so what's the problem? The issue being pretty much every woman even remotely close to my age gets me thirsty af by first glance. A girl I know posts a Bikini booty pic on insta? Holy fuck it gets me hot and bothered. It's gotten to the point where sexual thoughts about all these women is legitmately stressful. Obviously I can't successfully pursue all these women and for some reason there's negative emotions associated with this fact. It feels kinda fucked up that not being able to fuck every girl I walk past is a cause of legitmate distress for me. 

I try my best not to let it effect how I interact with women because I know how I feel isn't right and it isn't fair to let these issues lead me acting like a creep. Hell this is my first time really talking about it because I feel such a level of shame about it.

579,So my friends and I were going to play D&amp;d this summer but we could never find a time when everyone was free until we agreed on saturday. I was hosting and I asked everyone a bunch of times if they were free and they always said maybe and i'd ask if they checked with their parents if they were free and they said no so i'd ask them to do that. Then this morning a few hours before they were supposed to come over one person said that they couldn't come. At the time i assumed that they could've known that they would be busy if they just asked their parents if they were free beforehand. I went off on them and called them lazy and said they didn't care for not asking if they were free and i left the group chat. later i asked the rest of the people if they were still coming and they said no because i basically gave them all a fuck you and left the group chat. Im really worried that i really messed up and that theyre not gonna wanna be freinds with me again. i have kinda a history of being an asshole to everyone but ive been trying really hard to not be an asshole anymore.

Fuck okay here we go, I was at my friends moms birthday party and me and my best guy friend came and hung out, then when everyone left or went to sleep we all snuck into the kitchen and snatched the booze as people do. So we are all tipsy and eventually my other friend falls asleep. We were all cuddling on her bed btw. So eventually his arm gets uncomfortable and it comes around me, there’s like sexual tension for maybe 20 minutes until he starts like breathing on my neck and kinda mouthing it. Long story short we made out, he choked me a little it was a good time. But then he was like “ I don’t know how far I want to go with this” and I just shrugged and was like “as far as your comfortable with” and he was like “I don’t know if this is what I want” and I was like okay that’s cool. And he said he didn’t know if it was the alcohol (it had mostly worn off), being sleep deprived, or if it was emotional feels. And I was like okie dokie. And in the morning he apologized and asked if we were chill and I said yeah. (I lied I feel weird) 
Then as I was driving him home, I asked like what happened last night bc I know it happened but I don’t know the details. As he said he was too tired to remember. I left it at that. So here’s what I’m thinking, there are a couple possibilities. 
1. He was horny and I was there. 
2. He likes me but it was a weird situation 
3. He said something about our friendship and I can’t remember what. So maybe he just doesn’t wanna change it. 

The fact of the matter is, I now have feeling for him, and I can’t stop thinking about wanting to kiss him again. But the aforementioned friend has a really big crush on him. So I can’t even talk to her about this. I feel guilty and hurt and confused. I don’t know how I should feel or what to do.

I do not condone cheating but understand mistakes can be made, however, actively going out of your way and paying to cheat on his girlfriend crosses the line in my opinion.  

He has not told his girlfriend. He justifies this by saying that prior to his trip he had asked her what she would do if he did anything and she said “she wouldn’t care”. Although this may be true, I believe he still owes it to his girlfriend to be honest. 

I feel so sad for his girlfriend but as I’m not close to her and as I don’t want to ruin the relationship between my boyfriend and his friend, I feel torn with what to do. Especially considering that this is not the only incident where he has been unfaithful and not told her.

587," Hey guys, I don't really know where to post this but after today's workout I've been pissed all day and it's all I've been able to think about and I can't really concentrate on other things.

I've been going to the same gym for about 3 years now, I know pretty much all the regulars and am chummy with a few of them, but I wouldn't call any of them close friends. I usually keep to myself and work out by myself. It took me a long time to start socializing with the other people there as I am quite socially anxious, but I would say I am pretty well-liked by both the staff and the regulars because I'm friendly and I clean up my weights.

There is this other dude who has been working out there about the same time as me, and he gives off a pretty insecure vibe. The reason I say this is because my first interaction with him was about 3 years ago when I made eye contact and smiled. I like to do this because, for me, making eye contact and smiling is how I made some friends in the gym.

However, this guy's first reaction was ""What are you looking at?"" while glaring at me and I just asked him ""What are you getting so mad about?"" and he just did some ""psh"" sound and walked away.

So after this I started ignoring him. He would shoot dirty looks here and there and sometimes I'd get the feeling he was talking about me with his buds but in general I have been pretty succesful at not giving a shit.

So he kind of dissapeared for a little over a year, and recently he started training there again. He lost some mass and gained a little weight so I assume he's trying to get his body ready for the summer, however this means I see him                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            there almost every day. It also seems he really ramped up the douchey behaviour. He will look at me and shake his head, glare at me, mutter under his breath when I walk by him, schoolyard stuff.

Today I was doing stretches next to a machine where he was doing cable flies, because there's a box there that I can prop my shin on to get a nice glute stretch. I have to admit, I contemplated doing the glute stretches somewhere else, but I thought to myself ""I don't want to let this dick influence my workout"" so I did them there anyway. I guess he saw this as a power move because he scoffed and between his sets he would just kinda walk up and down the area while muttering things juuuust out of earshot, and I faintly heard him call me a ""faggot"" among other things.

This really pissed me off. I don't care that he called me a faggot, I'm just mad because now it is CLEAR he is trying to create a hostile atmosphere for me while I'm working out. I also think I'm mad at myself for not confronting him when he's talking shit to me, and it made me feel resentful.

I think because I ignored him instead of confronting him until now, he sees me as an easy target to pick on. I have to admit I really hate conflict, and when I usually do confront people, I get emotional/angry easily and I am not sure what to do, I think mainly because I tend to wait until problems reach a breaking point instead of nipping it in the bud.

Anyway, here is where things get a little blurry for me. These are the options I think I have:

1.) Tell the gym staff. I'm not saying the gym staff won't do anything to help me, I'm pretty sure they will, but I just think they will give him a verbal warning or whatever, and he will covertly continue his behaviour somehow.

2.) Talk to him myself. I'm afraid if I do this, I will release my pent-up anger and start verbally abusing him as well and make a scene.

I'm kind of at a loss and am wondering if anyone here has experience with gym bullies. I've always been pretty bad at dealing with bullies. I'm not really afraid of him physically, I'm just afraid I will make a shitty situation even shittier. I really like this gym.",20Jul2019,2

589,"So, I'm 18, I'm moving out to Canada in about a month and ten days, to live permanently, by myself, with no family coming.

My mum died when I was 2, and my dad certainly has had a depressed life since then.

A lot of family cut ties with us due to mothers death.

He's picked up diabetes, bipolar disorder, acidic problems during sleep, loss of nerve feelings in left side of his body, respiration problems, lost both his parents as of late, and his sister too, and recently he's lost all feelings in the bottom half of his body (waist down) along with a lot of function, he can't walk properly (though he's getting the hang of doing it again), and he can't drive cars, and a whole lot of other things.

The government has essentially abandoned my dad, after my mothers death he didn't get support for being a widowed parent to two children. They have also recently denied him support for becoming disabled. 

Throughout being a single parent trying to give two children the best life a broken man can give, he racked up over £20,000 in debt with zero support.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this isn't to try and pity-post, please don't take it that way. This is to put the point across, the man is depressed.

For 13 years, he was single, when I hit 15-16, he found a girlfriend. My biggest mistake is saying that I want them to marry. That I want her to come into my home.

Since then, she has been nothing but parasitic, but yet they married. He promises me he's happier with her, but he just wanted connections to people, my brother is always distant, and when I was younger, so was I, and I definitely will be literally distant soon.

She's emotionally draining to him, and she's constantly caused him to have break downs, I have never seen my dad cry more until she met him. He cried, he was depressed, but not this depressed.

Before I wrote this, he was having another break down, he says he feels like she's taken his agency, made him feel like a husk, like the house isn't his anymore, and he has no right to live here. I've heard him constantly talk about how he wants to kill himself now, and I've had plenty of scares where he's staggered or wheeled himself out of the house due to her not giving him space after he begs for it several times after she breaks him down. 

What do I do? I want them to break up. The problem is, he's no longer 20k in debt because of her. He has no support, he can't work right now, he won't be able to survive if they break up. And I know for a fact, no matter if he breaks up with her or not, he'll be really depressed when I leave, but I have to leave.",20Jul2019,1

595,"About 4 months ago, I met someone who I found to be the sweetest human being ever. She was honestly so sweet to me and it seemed like everything was perfect. 
Then one day I got a message from someone who said she had cheated on me.
I was super skeptical until I realized this person was someone who had hung out with my gf a week back. She told me he tried to kiss her so I told her to stop talking to him but now here he is. He was apparently best friends with a buddy from college and they both noticed the girl on my ig was who the guy had gone on a date with.
After talking to her about it, she had no definitive proof and couldn’t come up with anything. The guy had sent screenshot after screenshot of their SC convos and it’s exsctly how she talks, quirks and all. She had only sent me about 3 before blocking him because she was mad and sad about everything. Basically my only way of seeing her as truthful is gone

I’ve kept the relationship going saying I believe her but as time keeps going, I’m having panic attacks and just don’t think I believe in her anymore. I don’t know how to breakup with her though. She’s been through a rough life and still is but she’s been such a sweet person that I don’t know how to do it. Any advice on how to go for it?

Last night he calls me late and is dying to see me,  I really wanted to as well, I couldn't make up my mind to go or not, I was going to meet him but I fell asleep in the end,  he said to meet at 6pm then,  that his time will revolve around me were his words.  I didn't want that,  but he said it.  

Fast forward to today... I text him at 8pm asking where will we meet.  He responds saying he made other plans to go to his friends birthday at 11pm and won't be able to meet until 1am. that he made another plan since I didn't contact him until now.  I asked to meet him there,  he said it would be awkward with his friends.  I assumed he was going to be free all night,  so I am not sure now what to do.  I look like I am messing him around,  I think he will give up on me if I don't meet him later, cause it has been so long, and he has been willing to meet me all this time, I've been putting it off. The other side of me feels slightly conned and unimportant that he said his time is on me,  yet he puts the party in front of me? I feel if he was serious about me he would either not go or show up and leave quickly to meet me.  Am I being entitled and selfish thinking that?  

Let me know,  cause right now I am planning on meeting him at 1am around when he is done,  cause I want to meet him and don't want to regret it and wonder what if,  if he decide to give up on me thinking I've been messing him around.",20Jul2019,1

601,"**Note this is a throwaway account.**

During the last few years I managed to turn a modest background w/o education or work experience into a nice lifestyle. Dropped high school, educated myself in arts and technology and got high paid jobs in top cities around the world.

Sounds good? Better keep reading.

# Colleages and managers

Companies are merely schools. People never grow up.

I resigned from my roles twice exactly after earnt salary appraisals or flexible schedules, being constantly humillated or stressed by some colleage. In such situation and not handling stress, cry just in front of my managers was a topic.

During my last job, we managed to move into a fancy office using the money earned by a single project. This project supossed to be finished by 2 developers in 6 months and was HUGE.

I built the whole thing working solo 6-7 days a week for 3 months and asked for an appraisal. My manager partially refused, we argued and he asked me -doors open- if I though he can't hire two low-paid workers to do my job.

Again, I resigned.

# Immigration officers

Next, I decided to move with my savings to an affordable country (X), getting job interviews in the nearest country (Y) and flying in-out every time because (Y) was too expensive to move in w/o job.

If you tell people you fly to talk with them 30 minutes, they don't believe nor answer you. My whole year and my money flew out after send hundreds of mails, get pitty replies and barely 5 interviews.

I got deported because too much ins-outs and bounced back from (Y) to (X) and from (X) to my home country. This is a whole post by itself as all this bouncing process happened in less than a week at my own cost.

The IOs retained my passport and -again- humillated me in front of strangers, attaching me a ""nanny"" until I got into the airplane and making me feel like a criminal because of trying to get the life I wanted.

# Business people

The very story of my present looks like this, it happened two days ago.

Now I'm creating and trying to sell robots and machines, as soon as I got a reply we scheduled a phone call. I researched this guy and started feeling nervous, so I went for a walk to answer on my way.

It turned into a 1 hour walk. Nobody called. I kindy sent a reminder. He postponed the call for the next hour. It turned into a 3 hours walk. He ignored me. Head down and back home.

Same story about business people who ""clapped"" when I was doing good in my past. Now they don't give a F.

Hilarious too when any -apparently- wealth guy ask for your salary expectations. Smokebomb.

# Psicologists

I visited a psicologist for first time in my life last week.

This person spent an hour giving me a business class. Not even a single tip into handle my situation but to ""find investors"" and now I don't really know if I'm dissapointed or I fucked up her mind too.

# Advise?

I lost everything -including job+couple combos- a few times before. Always moved to another place and got further, but this time for some reason I'm unable to make a single penny.

I've been unemployed for over a year and a half, I'm feeling totally useless and -over all- invisible. My sister told me to find a job into a supermarket, but honestly it's kinda heart broken if I look at my skills and the life I lived.

I don't really want to live here or have real friends in this place. I spend my whole day sleeping while my computer send emails abroad, sometimes walking on nature and trying to exercise as my doctor gave me a choose: pills or workout.

I basically just want to go because my dad makes a specific type of food there and I am only able to have it there once a year. Obviously I am not going to be drinking, but my boyfriend thinks it’s strange I want to go. He specifically said “who goes to the Portuguese picnic pregnant?” (That’s the name of the event) (also, I am Portuguese). I assume he says that because it is full of drunk people our age. But I am a) going to avoid the large crowds of drunk people and b) only really want to go for the food, not because I care about seeing anybody there. He just kind of made me feel weird about going now even though I was excited to go up until this moment. Is it strange for a pregnant woman to be in a party atmosphere?

I’m talking like clothes on the floor, literal mold and dirt under appliances and even dead mice at one point and it stinks so bad it can give you headaches if your not used to it. It has gotten less drastic over the years but it’s still really bad. I am the youngest of four and the only one living with my parents currently. My older two siblings got taken away by child services and lived with my grandma years before me and my sister were born. Nobody did anything about us though. And now that my sister is old enough she moved out years ago and I’m all alone here. I’ve tried so many times to talk to my mom and tell her that this is not normal and it’s disgusting to live like this, she does not listen. She just says she cleans and nobody else helps her around the house and just repeats the same things she has been saying for years. And now more recently my mom has been making a huge deal about me having anxiety and depression and trying to get me to take meds.

I just wish I was different than how I am right now.

I feel like everyone hates me, and I don’t know why I just do. I feel like my friends are just tolerating me and in the next year when I leave college I’ll never see them again. And you’re probably thinking “just go online and meet friends that way” or “meet other people”. It’s not that easy.

I have severe anxiety and paranoia, I can’t talk to strangers unless I’m spoken to or if it’s something that I really want to get out. But still, it’s rare I talk to strangers on my own. I know, I won’t get far like that. But seriously, I just can’t do it. I’ve made 3 friends online over stories that I write on Wattpad, but they contacted me and I love them to pieces. But they’re all in different countries. 

It sucks and I wish I wasn’t so anxious, but I’m cautious because of past friendships and relationships I’ve had. It sticks with me and I’m afraid of everything. I cried because I was scared to do a presentation in front of my class which then devolved into me feeling like shit about myself. I wiped off all of my makeup because I was thinking “There’s no point in me wearing makeup, it doesn’t make me any less ugly.”

I hate what I look like. I just recently got 4 fillins in my teeth, one of them was removing a line stain that was across one of my front teeth. I’ve had that for at least 4-5 years and it’s been the main reason that I hated my smile. I still hate it thought even though it’s gone, I rarely have a genuine smile in photos. I want to lose weight but have no motivation to do so. I don’t like doing things alone but I know I don’t have anyone to do it with.

I have a Youtube channel, and multiple people have told me “How are you camera shy but have Youtube videos going up?” And I’ve explained; I can’t film with people LITERALLY behind the camera watching me film, but I’m ok with filming and uploading because no one is directly there. That doesn’t mean I’m not scared of people’s opinions. I’m cringey as hell IMO.

I’m sorry for the rant I just really hate keeping it in my head and feeling like crap all the time. I know, lots and lots of people have it worse than me and I WISH I could help them. If I could I would.

A little background: We have been friends nearly 15 years. Very close friends. We did everything together, we lived together and traveled together. We have been mistaken for a couple multiple times. She was always the extroverted leader of our duo, I the shy sidekick. In the last two years a lot has changed with me. I left a longterm very unhappy relationship, I began to see a therapist, I lost weight, found some confidence, and I started seeing someone who has really had a profoundly positive effect on my life. Other friends have come to me and congratulated me on how I have turned my life around. Yet, throughout this process my friend did not seem happy for me, she seemed the opposite. She made barbed comments about my new appearance, my confidence and shrugged off meeting my partner. I became increasingly hurt and confused the longer she did this, and worse I wanted to apologize for feeling good. I tried to talk to her about it, but she is the type of person who will insist that it is fine and she is fine even when it's not. And she did

Cut to now. We both just finished our last year in school. It was very stressful for both of us. We went on a road trip after graduation. Things seemed great, till we got back. I began to realize that I had really done a lot of damage to myself mental health wise pushing myself through a final 16 credit term. I was feeling extremely and almost disablingly anxious, tired, depressed and mistrustful all the time. So I decided to take a hiatus off social media, cleared my calendar for the month of July so I could rest and began to see my therapist more regularly. I am finally beginning to feel like myself again. I explained to my friend what I was doing so she knew I wasn't just abandoning her and she seemed like she understood and said she hoped I would start to feel better. But she has grown increasingly cold and short with me the more time I have taken away for myself. She seems very disinterested in hanging out with me, and really not to care about me very much at all. I am absolutely at a loss on how to proceed here. Tomorrow I am holding a brunch for my friends for my birthday and dread how things will be in person. I love her a lot and don't want to lose her but I am beginning to feel like I am trying to engage with a stone wall. It is so distressing.

I turn 20 in September and start my second year of university next month but I'm home for the summer right now. 

I really don't mind being the youngest besides the fact that I've begun to see how much my accomplishments don't impact or matter (they matter but it's more of an ""oh cool"" and brush under the rug type of matter) to my family the same way they did for my sisters because they've all already been through what I'm doing. My parents are getting old now (aging into their 60s) and all the things they did for my sisters that I looked forward to when I was younger don't happen anymore and it's getting obvious that they're really just waiting for me to leave again for the next school year. 

The age gap between me and my eldest sister is 10 years, she turns 30 this year and is getting married and buying a house and my middle sister is turning 28 with a good paying job and two college degrees. All in all, I've really been feeling like I'm last in everything and to put it harshly, an accident. It never really came to mind until I started college and began thinking about how much farther along they are and it makes me feel like I can't talk to them about how hard college has been for me or the fact that while the both of them are already living their independent lives, I feel like I'm still considered the baby (in fact, my oldest sister still tells me every time she sees me that she still considers me 12 years old). 

These thoughts have really been on my mind the past few months and I feel like I'm supposed to be farther along in life and doing more than I am but then I think back to when they were my age, they weren't doing much either. I guess what I'm asking for here is how to get past the nagging feeling inside that what I'm doing isn't enough.",20Jul2019,1
636,"Slight background.  I'm a 26M, live in Maryland, just got license for the first time and buying new car next month.    


I work \~30 mins away, will soon be losing my current means of transportation to work (carpooling) so I've obtained my license and will be getting a car next month.  I was looking around for some quotes for insurance and couldn't find anything less than \~$370-400+/month.    


After paying rent + food, etc, I have \~$1,050 left over each month.  Car payments are expected to be \~$300/month so let's round it down to having $700 left over.  Is it reasonable to pay the 370-400/month and only have \~$300/month left over for gas + ""fun"" money until my rates eventually go down?  


I don't believe I have any other options if I'm to remain employed.  Nothing else is in walking distance. If my commute wasn't 30-40 minute commute both ways Monday-Friday then I'd just buy a cheap beater to own instead of financing reduce my rates.  But I need a dependable car which I have found.    


Do these rates sound reasonable for a 26 year old male who just got his license?  I can't see any other reasonable way to lower them.  It does not seem heavily dependent on the car, I'm not getting a 2019 sports car or anything.  A modest 2010s Kia.  I even tried putting in a random 2004 Honda and it hardly changed the quote so I assume it's primary so high because of my lack of driving history?   


Any advice helps. Thank you!",20Jul2019,1
637,"So a little background: myself and this friend have known each other for 15+ years and have considered each other best friend for the better part of the last 8 or so. I lived with him for 2 years and then moved out in 2018 to live with my girlfriend for the first time. We both agreed it was time for this to happen, even though I may have preferred to stay there another year. 

Everything is mostly fine for the first year of being moved out, but as of earlier this year I started to notice a significant drop off in his communications with me. Granted, he is very much an introvert, like myself, so he admits to needing more space than most people and I generally feel the same, but his idea of space is literally no communication for unspecified periods of time until he reaches the point where he feels it’s necessary to speak to someone again. I’m very different - I tend to lean heavily on those around me in times of despair and I verbally think that’s what friends are for - propping you up and getting you through the bad times. He would rather disappear into solitude. 

So in May, he forgot entirely to reach out to me on my birthday, which was hurtful but I didn’t mention it. He tends to place little significant on birthdays anyway, so I didnt feel it warranted a conflict. But in the following months, I moved into a new house, I started back school (overcome one of my biggest fears/regrets) and have been doing excellent in my classes, as well as I’ve been making good strides with personal health and exercise. The things I would normally want to share with my best friend. 

Starting a month ago, I invited him over on the weekend to see my new place. No response. I waited a week just in case he was dealing with something and invited him again the following Friday, no response. I called the next Monday, no answer and left a concerned voicemail asking to just call me back and let me know he’s alright. Instead, I get a single text saying he’s okay but probably won’t be having any time over the next few weeks. I responded with a very light indication that it bothers me to not receive any reply and that I start becoming concerned - no response. It’s been a month now and there’s been radio silence. 

There’s been nothing, to my knowledge, that would account for any kind of chance to the nature of our friendship. He’s planning on starting back school in the fall but beyond the initial registration, I do not believe he’s so busy as to have no spare seconds to reach out and see how things are going with me. 

So I’m currently waiting it out until he contacts me of his own volition before confronting the issue I have with his conception of friendship and how it doesn’t gel with mine. I’m just really unsure of how to say it tactfully and objectively so as not to accuse or berate or even seem pathetic or desperate. Just to address the complete lack of friend.",20Jul2019,2
638,"So I used to partake in recreational drug use. I hadn't done drugs in almost 3 years but last night I caved and I did three small lines of coke. I'm really disappointed in myself and I'm beating myself up over it. I have asked my friend not to do it around me again so that I won't be tempted(not like it's their fault). I wouldn't say I've ever had a drug problem but I never wanted to go down this path again. I was really proud of myself for making it almost 3 years without doing anything. Alcohol was involved which is not surprising, I've been offered drugs in the past 3 years and I've always said no and I'm thinking it's partially from drinking that I caved last night. Honestly, if you're reading this and you have never done Coke, please don't do it because it's fun and there's a reason people do it. I'm looking for any advice on how to get over this hump and how to be less hard on myself, or should I be hard on myself? Thanks.",20Jul2019,2
639,"I started working at 15, and gave up almost every single weekend. My dad quickly made me put every paycheck and every dollar in his safe. I would keep some cash for myself, but he didn't like it. I soon had to buy everything for school, clothes, shoes, hygiene supplies, and it progressed until I was buying 90% of my own food. I eventually stopped feeding money into the safe, because I had to use a lot of it. 

Well, apparently all of the money he made me put in there is gone. I just figured out. He said he spent it on bills but I'm sure he's lying. He has a Mercedes he just traded his old one in for and wears expensive shoes and gold watches.

I don't know what to do, or if I really can do anything at all. I can't open a bank account because he won't give me my social or let me get an ID of any kind, so I'm stuck.

640,"So I live in a really shitty area. We are talking needles on the floor, bags of rubbish, somehow mattresses keep multiplying and setting themselves on fire... lovely. 

One of my lovely neighbours has a black Staffordshire bull terrier. I wasn’t even sure they had a dog the first year I lived there, but over the past year I’ve started seeing her randomly walking around the estate with no human in sight. Eating god knows what. This dog is not exactly friendly either, and has snapped at my dogs, so I always have to watch out for this dog. Ive seen her limping and she always approaches me with her tail between her legs and I’ve got my suspicions, but I don’t know what goes on behind closed doors so I’ll leave it at that. I’ve tried on so many occasions to speak to the owners, but at first they laughed at me and didn’t listen and then when I started to get mad they just threatened me. And then all of a sudden they couldn’t speak English.... I’ve offered to walk their dog for them. I’ve dropped off leaflets explaining how unsafe it is and how not only could this dog hurt others, but could also get hurt so easily. It’s the sort of place where cars will drive around on pavements and in between houses and I see her nearly get run over maybe twice a month. 

Enough is enough now. I have just witnessed this dog nearly get run over again, and then snarl and go for a pedestrian walking past the house while she was waiting to get let in.... 

I’m not going to lie, I didn’t handle it well. I snapped, I got mad, and I walked over. The bloke is clearly involved in drugs. When I walked up to the house the 60 year old man had loads of teenagers in the back of his car, one I know to be the local drug dealer, and by the smell coming out of the car, they were clearly smoking weed or handling large amounts of it. I told him if I ever saw his dog out alone again, I would take her and either keep her myself or find a family that actually gave a shit about her. He said ‘well I’m not the only one that just lets their dog out, everyone else does’ which didn’t exactly fill me with confidence. I ended up swearing and saying I was going home to call the police about the drug taking.... almost 100% sure he watched me go home and now knows where I live. Smart! 

So What can I do? I’ve rang the RSPCA and they’ve said if the dog has food and water there isn’t anything they can do, but if I keep ringing they can build a case? Well I’ve been ringing for a year!!! I’ve contacted the dog wardens but the dog isn’t lost so they won’t help me. I’ve filled out an online police report about the drugs and the little interaction (he did place his hands on me and threaten me, but I wasn’t exactly being calm in the situation so that was probably my own actions aggravating the situation further) but I didn’t actually witness anything, I just smelled weed. Which in this area is something to be expected. So nothing will probably come off that. Do I just keep trying? This dog needs the care she deserves. The owners cannot keep putting her in harms way like this. 

It’s gotten to the point where I am considering stealing someone’s dog. I need better ideas.",20Jul2019,1

643,"[Apologies, super long, blah blah blah]

I was never a social butterfly but was pretty social in my 20's and early 30's. Now at 46 and facing a possible divorce I'm realizing way too late that I've neglected all my relationships till I have basically no friends. Feeling super anxious every time I even think about reconnecting with old friends OR making new ones.

I am friendly with coworkers and customers at my work, and I don't have the kind of social anxiety that totally keeps me from normal everyday interactions with strangers in the world.

But a long time ago I set myself on a long slow spiral of talking to or seeing friends less and less, engaging in activities where I might make new friends less, and just staying home more. Most of the socializing my spouse and I have done in the six years since we met has been arranged by him (we're both men). Lately even that has waned, even though he's a more social person than me, and this has brought us both down and hurt our relationship (this is not our only problem). I still check in with my mom at least once a week or so, and one close friend about as often but that's usually just a short text conversation. 

I read reddit a lot but never comment let alone make submissions because I'm so hesitant to get into conversations with random people here or anywhere else online for that matter. I assume online interactions will be mostly negative, correctly or not. I've been trying to baby-steps myself back into using facebook more, but I think a lot of people are using it less and I'm not thrilled giving them any more page-views anyway.

I see a therapist weekly and have done a lot of therapy in the past but it's really hard for me to put anything into practice when I'm outside that office on my own.

I miss who I used to be and sometimes I get pretty lonely. Especially since my husband has sort of given up and wants to be just sort of friends and roommates. I don't really blame him -- neither of us is getting any younger and we both deserve to be in a better situation.

So, any advice, reddit? Is it a good idea to try to practice talking to people online? To start friendly relationships online even? Should I force myself to meet strangers through some kind of activities? Anything else?",20Jul2019,1

646,"To put it bluntly, I have a small group of friends that I spend most of my time with, if I want to go out, I go out with them. I should mention that I (M) dated one of these close friends (F) about two years ago.
         For the past year or so I've been branching out, making new friends, albeit not many, just enough to keep me going, however I've always missed my main group.
         Recently we've been meeting up again, hanging out, going back to how things used to be before we lost contact and it's been great, the problem I'm finding now is that my ex-girlfriend, not only do I miss her in the relationship sense, but I am physically infatuated by basically everything she does.
         Since we have all started spending time together again, she becomes the subject of thought every minute I'm coherent enough to think, and every moment I'm awake.
        It's too the point that, on top of my current stress of moving house, that whenever I'm not in contact with her, I'm talking about her to one of our other friends, or worse I'm in a really shitty mood.
       I don't know if I'm allowed to admit this, but I've started using, they give me a break from the constant droning of who she is. I'd be willing to ruin her entire current relationship at this point, so when I do use, I welcome it with open arms really.
      It's not right and I know that, but I dont know how else to handle it, do I realistically want to stop this new found contact and fun I'm having with an old group of friends? no. But what I do want is to not spend every waking moment of my day talking to, thinking about, or talking about this one person.
     How can I find a way to deal with being obsessed by every fibre of a person to the point of substance abuse and depression in a healthy manner without cutting contact?

 I never really made any friends, or socialize at all, because when i was ill, i thought that my classmates, childhood friends, etc didn't need me, i thought i was worthless.
 I feel different now, and want to change, but it's not an easy task for me. I get very anxious around new people, and i tend to just sit/stand silent, until they ask me something.

Where i work, there aren't anyone close to my age either.

So, where, and how can i socialize with my age group, and how can i help my anxiety without the expensive therapies? Also, i really need some friends, because i just don't have anyone to talk to apart from parents etc, and im lonely all the time.

I know it's my fault, i should have talked to people when i had every opportunity to do so.

649,"I have a coworker who is a know-it-all. She also tends to make rude comments to me, but will then try to be buddy buddy with me. She drives our entire office nuts. She was recently accepted into a dental school program, so she has become worse since this happened. I was in dental school a few years ago, but I was in an accident that prevented me from finishing the program. So now we both work for a dentist. My boss (the dentist who owns the practice) says that I am a better worker than her and that he likes how I work patients up for him. He said that I am to train the new hire this week. After one week of training the new hire, I did a trial run to see how she could work up patients. We used my coworker (the one giving me a problem) as a fake patient. My problem coworker started to explain every test and the whole process like I had not been training the new hire all week. If I gave a suggestion to the new hire about how to handle certain situations, my problem coworker would say, ""well THIS is how I do it"" and she even told me that I was not following a certain procedure properly, when in fact I am. This problem coworker gave no advice of real value to be honest. When I asked my problem coworker to allow the new hire to finish the tests without interruption, my problem coworker told me that ""this is her field now.""

650,"Hello! I am a 25 yo clueless guy that has become stuck at crossroads. It has to do with choosing between 2 girls. The story goes like this.

Girl 1 - I'm from Romania. There, I met a girl 4 months ago that agreed to have FWB (friends with benefits) with me. We didn't put any boundaries on our behavior, but we made it as a ""rule"" to be exclusive one for the other. And also, if there was the case for falling for someone else or falling for each other, there would be absolutely no problem, but we would announce it. The FWB has worked out well. I focused on my stuff, she focused on hers, we met and everything was good. Meanwhile I have observed during our meetings that we function differently and we have different roots of communication, but if we keep it simple, on a surface, we get along very well. So, I concluded that an actual relationship cannot really happen from here. From around 23rd of June until now it came to me that it seems that she has feelings for me (but she denies being in love with me). So now I feel a bit more responsible upon how I deal with stuff (new girls i might be interested in) cause she might get hurt. 

Girl 2 - On 29th of June I went for my holiday in Greece, where I will be staying until 8th of August (i do this every year for 16 years.. in the same place). I actually met this girl 1 year ago, here where i'm coming usually, at a salsa on the beach party. She looked (and still does) beautiful. Nothing happened at that time, but we just chatted for a bit during the night of the event. Fast forward to my arrival this year. This girl seems to be a close friend to a friend of mine. And when I wanted to meet this friend, she (my target girl) came too. That's the moment in which we started speaking more. Throughout the time.. from 29th of June until today I've observed that we are very different (she is a bit spoiled) and we communicate very differently as well (more different than with girl 1). In the same time, we are both attracted physically to each other like hell. I really like everything physically about her. But again, to me she seems like a red flag when it comes to being spoiled so how we get along with each other. Also, this girl doen't have the same ""social/emotional"" intelligence of the other girl so she is pretty slow on witty jokes and let's say irony too. So when we talk, it feels like I have to explain to her many things, because she literally doesn't understand them. In the same time, when I am with her, I feel like touching her, kissing her, and generally being like a fool in love (her beauty really stuck with me.. since the last year when I met her). The downsides, again, are those differences between us that I just mentioned. Also, she will come to my country for 2 weeks during late August, in a programme, where we can be together (if I decide to). Also, this girl doesn't want FWB, but she is more into having an actual relationship. Also, it would become a distant one if it would happen. 

The thing is.. I have to choose between one of them (momentarily). And to me it feels like I should choose between a stable FWB (girl 1) or a summer fling where I can lose myself into her beauty (she's like a trigger in this beauty sense)(girl 2). I am a bit on a countdown right here.. Girl 2 kinda told me tonight that she expects me to ask her out.. and she jokingly added ""or i will ask you out directly"". She made sure i know she's into me too. Next when we will go out, I am pretty sure a kiss will be expected.

So, how do you see this? What would your option be? What do you think about it? Any thought will be useful to read. So I am curious about your own opinions and what would you go for and what would you recommend I should choose.

Thank you, to all of you, in advance!:)",20Jul2019,1
651,"Hi Everyone,

I'm 25 years old and going to be 26 in April of 2020. I dropped out of college at 19, after a year, because it was too expensive and I just didn't know what I wanted to do with a private school education. Since then I've been working minimum wage jobs, some of which I've liked, others I've hated. I still live with my parents, but I'm able to pay for my bills and to sustain myself. As much as I would love to move out, I have no clue what to pursue or what I want to do.

The only advice I have from the people around me is that whatever it is, I need to get a move on because time is being wasted. I do want to do more with my life than work at minimum wage... but what? And is the answer really to just launch myself back into a bachelor's program so that I... have one?

The one time I was happiest in my life was during a wilderness retreat where I participated in a sweat lodge, permaculture, and cooked food for the group. Seriously, I have not since that day experienced that level of peace and joy. I wonder if maybe I should look to do something like that with my life before going back to school or learning a trade.

For the past several months, I've been dabbing in ""drag"" and picking up some small stuff here and there (like clothes, make up, etc) to experiment. I've always been hesitant looking at dresses IRL simply because I am a pretty self-conscious person but I know just looking would never hurt. 

The past week, I muscled up the strength to go to a clothing store and looked at dresses. It wasn't bad and I actually felt pretty damn good looking at everything and seeing what I liked and didn't like. No one at the store gave me a hard time, but this one group of guys walked past (since the entrance to the mall is right next to the dress department), saw me, and immediately started to laugh and mock me..

Luckily for myself, they only did it for a few seconds and then left. But it just really hurts me knowing that: we are in the year 2019 and there's still so much hate.

655,"I need a outside voice. 

I have worked with my current company for 4 years. I’ve never had a write up, never had any performance issues. 

Backstory:
In those 4 years I’ve dealt with a supervisor who would say things to me along the lines of I’m fat I’ll never find a boyfriend, I’m fat I’ll look horrible in my wedding dress I’m fat I can’t have a baby. She will get “mad” and stop talking to me and other for months at a time along. She will tell the person next to me to repeat what she just said. She will have mood swings all day in the morning she will like you in the afternoon you are horrible. She plays my heart will go on on a loop all day long, won’t allow breaks times you when you go pee. She speaks ill of all the other supervisors and is just pain demeaning to all of the workers. that’s the short version. 

About a month ago I went to hr and told them this is a horrible situation and can I be moved. They said the would look into it. Unbeknownst to me they were looking into that supervisor about a sexual harassment case started by someone who had recently left the company.  Hr asked to speak we me about things I’d seen 

On Monday I was called into the office of my manager and director for 1.5 hours they sat i front of me and asked why I wanted to have her fired, did I think I would get her job. I’m worthless and could never do what she does. They talked to all my coworkers and they all said they hate me (not true but still hurtful). That I burn everything I make, I’m a car broken down on the side of the road that nobody wants to help.

I ended up having a panic attack 1 hour into work and was taken to urgent care. While I was waiting at urgent care the director of my department sent me a text message telling me that I had to have a meeting with him and the manager again. Just thinking about it I’m honestly afraid to be in a room alone with them. It’s already giving me anxiety.

But, he didn’t send any creepy sexual messages and he was quick to ask me out on a date. I agreed. I had no expectations, but found him a little weird. I also found him a lot less attractive in real life. But he was a nice enough person, so I went out with him twice.

He told me he was looking for a relationship but wasn’t having much luck. He also told me his ex girlfriend was 22 years old, and that he bought her anything she wanted. A new phone, clothes, vacations. He has two apartments, and we live in NYC where this is not cheap. He planned really expensive dates and paid for everything. He offered to take me on vacation, but I turned it down. He even offered me a job as his assistant. I’m not sure how he has so much money but I didn’t ask. 

At first he said it felt weird being with such a young girl, which confused me because his ex is not that much older. But later he kept saying he really liked me because I’m “beautiful and nice” and wanted to date me. He never used the words “sugar baby” explicitly, but that’s kind of what it sounds like he wants.

I’m not sure if I should go for it. I don’t consider myself good looking, so I’ve never even had a boyfriend before. I have no feelings nor physical attraction to him. I really want to date someone I have a connection with, because I’ve never felt that. But, he’s respectful and never mentions anything sexual. We haven’t even kissed. And I won’t be young enough for the “sugar baby” thing forever, so I kind of want to take advantage of it. So, should I do it?",20Jul2019,0
659,"Tldr at the bottom; strap in folks, this is gonna be a long one.

I (15 F), my younger brother (9 M), my mom (41F) and my dad (45 M) are currently having my cousin (15 F) over at our house, to be more specific she's staying in my room.

Now, she really likes staying with us and my parents basically consider her another sibling to feed, they have no problem with her. 

I'm a teenager and I am a loner, big time. Being in my room on my own doing my thing is what I like. 

The problem comes when my cousin comes to our house at the begging of June and doesn't leave until late August/ early September, so my summer is completely ridden of privacy or my own alone time for those months. She is my complete opposite in every imaginable way (she can talk for freakin hours on end and will read her romance novel until like, one in the morning with my really bright lights on.) 

We are together 24/7 and I am starting to burn out, quick. I fear I might snap at her someday because I cannot stand this anymore. 

She's just made plans to make my group of friends and I hang out with her when I was planning on doing that exact opposite thing. I feel kinda sorry for her since she doesn't have any friends here but I want to live my own life without her this summer and it just doesn't look like it's in the cards for me.

My family and I have gone on a weeks trip to a nice place in the beach and of course she's tagging alone and sleeping in my room yet again.

TL;DR: cousin is living with us (me) this whole summer and has stolen all of my personal space and free time, I am sick of this.

Feel free to ask any questions if you'd like additional info on this shitshow.

664,"Hello, this is my first reddit post and I really hope I’m not screwing this up or breaking any rules. **please delete if not allowed!** Sorry in advance for any typos!

For the past year and a half, my life has been plagued by a catfish. We will call him “Fish”. Fish entered my life through a small online community through twitter and tumblr a little over a year ago. They seemed nice at first, but it turns out they were talking sh*t about me and all the other people he was talking to behind our backs. He was going to every one of us and saying bad things about others. He told me things about people I didn’t even know, people that he would insist were bad people and that he “hated”. For me, it all came to a head when I realized he was attempting to get the entire group that we were apart of to turn against me... And it worked. I suffer from severe depression and generalized anxiety. At the time I didn’t have any friend in real life, they were all online. So this community that I had been with for years suddenly turning its back on me— including my best friend of 10 years— all because of his lies, really got to me. I decided to end my life, failed (obviously), and am now here to tell the tale.

After being released from a psychiatric hospital, I begged my best friend to stop speaking to him. I told her that he was toxic, and even showed her screenshots from when he would talk sh*t about her to me, and tell me things that I knew were lies. But she didn’t believe me. He told her that I was faking the messages and she had sort of fallen in love with him, so she believed him.

It wasn’t until an old friend of mine jumped in, and was able to find proof that he had been lying about his identity that people began to open their eyes. This entire community we were in had turned their backs on me, but were suddenly apologizing to me for ever believing this random. He was outed amongst a very small group of friends amongst the larger (small) community, and people moved on.

I did too.

I became more active in the community again, but I also took a slight step back. I joined a facebook group in my area, and made some real life friends whom I still meet up with and talk to now. I started doing some hobbies, keeping myself busy, and keeping in check with my mental health. Truthfully, life was going great!

Until a few months ago when he resurfaced. I knew it was him immediately, and treated him like sh*t from the get go. Of course, this was my mistake. He took the screenshots of me being mean to him and showed them to the community, and once again I was ostracized and hated. I tried to tell people it was the same guy, attempted to get them to see reason. Sadly, I had no proof. My only proof was that I knew how he typed. I knew how he spoke. But that isn’t really proof.

I was called crazy and this time, a larger group of people turned their backs on me. I could not believe the same thing was happening to me again. My small group of friends who had dealt with Fish the first time had my back, and they decided to try and trap him. Make him out himself. Sure enough, one of my friends introduced him to someone who was very popular and loved within the community, and he *ucked with her. Popular girl’s girlfriend didn’t like that, nor did all of her friends, so EVERYBODY found out about him. Posts were made across our small community on tumblr and twitter, and soon enough Fish’s name was being talked about everywhere. I met a small group of about 4 other people Fish had screwed with badly, and we became close. Honestly, I hadn’t thought much about it, but everyone was sort of... worried about me? They all kept saying I almost kicked the bucket over him, and that I had the “worst” story of anybody.

But I didn’t feel the same. It was weird having people tell me that. Like it was some sort of *ucked up life competition and ding ding ding! I won! He *ucked up my life the most! It felt wrong. It still does, but I have a very strong group of people behind me because of it. People who don’t even know me but don’t like Fish at all, so they want to protect me.

All of his wrongdoings came out in this process and besides the fact that he got me ostracized— twice— he stole money from multiple people, turned friends against each other, sent fake photos to people pretending to be someone he wasn’t, sent n*des to people, solicited s*x from multiple minors and sent them n*des as well, got someone fired from their job, and so on and so on.

I am making this post because, you probably guessed it, he is back once again. And now I am not as forgiving. I am not as willing to move on. I am not going to sit here while he befriends more people and attemps to ruin their lives as well. I don’t want anymore minors hurt. We have tried to get his accounts suspended, to get him banned, and he just keeps on coming back. He always finds a way.

So I guess what I need help with is how to get rid of him? How to get revenge? I don’t want to ever hear from him again. I don’t want to do anything violent or illegal, but I want to show him that we are serious and he needs to back off. 

Before you ask: we have already thought about the police, but if he is not making a direct threat to any of our lives then nothing can be done. The minors do not want to go to the police, and are afraid to even speak out, we do not want to force them to have to. So, I’m resorting to this.

Reddit, please help. I don’t know what to do anymore. How do I get revenge on an online presence?",20Jul2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

I've been living in this really small town where my university is. Finished my 3rd year and currently in summer school. Don't wanna bore you with full of drama background and such but I found myself in place where I can't make friends due to town's heavily politically polarized environment. Can't find a girlfriend due to same reason and even tho I go to bigger cities near me (2 hours drive away) everyone I met wanted to someone they can meet regularly and me being far away from them is a turn off.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to socialize but no use. There are only few cafes and people go there as groups and you feel excluded from that atmosphere. No Starbucks whatsoever to potentially meet with strangers. Tried to join clubs at university but there are only clubs itself, only few members just to keep clubs exist another year.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm studying hard. Working on side projects. Planning and preparing for my potentially Master's Degree. Reading books. Learning new stuff. Trying new things to cook. Adopted a cat. Trying to be active and stay alive... BUT I desperately need to socialize somehow. I miss having conversations. Yesterday or day before that, I stopped talking with a girl I talked for +2 months because she was far away and didn't care to plan a date because of the distance.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel emotionally exhausted. My days feels empty even tho I do many things.

I'm 26 and make about 90 a year in a rural area so it's rather cheap to live. My job is comfy and I work maybe 5-10 hours a week. Sounds great? But it is bothering the life out of me. 

I recently quit playing video games because I guess I'm maturing and now I have all this time. I've gone back and looked at goals I had when I was a kid (learn japanese, guitar etc) I'm studying about 2-3 hours a day on various things now and working out. The issue is I feel like I'm wasting time? I don't like socializing and it's not easy to socialize here unless you attend college which I plan on doing in about a year. I just don't know what to do with all this time I have and feel like I'm wasting so much potential.

My job requires me to at all times be 1 hour away from my current location and to be mobile at any time. That's about it, I was thinking of getting some online job but with the skills I have it just doesn't make sense to accept a job that pays 10-15 an hour.

# Colleages and managers

Some companies are merely schools. People never grow up.

I resigned from my roles twice exactly after earnt salary appraisals or flexible schedules, being constantly humillated or stressed by some colleage. In such situation and not handling stress, cry just in front of my managers was a topic.

During my last job, we managed to move into a fancy office using the money earned by a single project. This project supossed to be finished by 2 people in 6 months and was HUGE.

I built the whole thing working solo 6-7 days a week for 3 months and asked for an appraisal. My manager partially refused, we argued and he asked me -doors open- if I though he can't hire two low-paid workers to do my job.

Again, I resigned.

# Immigration officers

Next, I decided to move with my savings to an affordable country (X), getting job interviews in the nearest country (Y) and flying in-out every time because (Y) was too expensive to move in w/o job.

If you tell people you fly to talk with them 30 minutes, they don't believe nor answer you. My whole year and my money flew out after send hundreds of mails, get pitty replies and barely 5 interviews.

I got deported because too much ins-outs and bounced back from (Y) to (X) and from (X) to my home country. This is a whole post by itself as all this bouncing process happened in less than a week at my own cost.

The IOs retained my passport and -again- humillated me in front of strangers, attaching me a ""nanny"" until I got into the airplane and making me feel like a criminal because of trying to get the life I wanted.

# Business people

The very story of my present looks like this, it happened two days ago.

Now I'm creating and trying to sell robots and machines, as soon as I got a reply we scheduled a phone call. I researched this guy and started feeling nervous, so I went for a walk to answer on my way.

It turned into a 1 hour walk. Nobody called. I kindy sent a reminder. He postponed the call for the next hour. It turned into a 3 hours walk. He ignored me. Head down and back home.

Same story about some business people who clapped when I was doing good. Now they don't give a F as I asked for help and got totally ignored.

# Professional help

I visited a psicologist for first time in my life last week.

This person spent an hour giving me a business class. Not even a single tip into handle my situation but to ""find investors"" and now I don't really know if I'm dissapointed or I fucked up her mind too.

# Any advise?

My life savings blew out trying to fit, so now I'm broke. I've been unemployed for over a year and a half, I'm feeling totally useless and -over all- invisible. My sister told me to find a job into a supermarket, but honestly it's kinda heart broken if I look at the life I lived.

680,"My dad and I got in a fight one and a half years ago. He said mean things to my mom when they were fighting and when I defended her (He was in the wrong) he called me really harsh names which hurt me deeply. It just got too much and I threw a plastic pumpkin at him (it didn't hit him, but I was very angry and now I see that was wrong) I was 12 then. Now 14.

My father has a very toxic personality, he is the kind of person who always thinks he is right. He has anger issues but he doesn't realize it. (PSA he has never hit me, anger issues I mean he just has a short temper) He has been kind to me for the most part until this. I really loved him and I still do.

My mom used to talk very badly about my father to me in secret about the rude things he says to her, they have had bad blood for a while now on and off, and she bitches about him to me. I stopped her a while ago because after all he is my blood-related father and I just didn't want to hear it anymore.

The first year of not speaking I was extremely angry at him, I hated him, I wouldn't talk to him, I wouldn't look at him. When one year passed, I started to loosen up, I didn't hate him but I haven't spoken to him. He started talking to me, it was just to talk things out. We both apologized, him for calling me names, and me for throwing the pumpkin. But the other things he said was just toxic, really making my mother out to be the bad guy and trying to turn me against her, so I just got angry again. (I really respect my mother. She is amazing. She has a good personality. I don't like it when people talk bad about her.)

But recently I have been missing him so much. I think about old memories or see old pictures of us and I get so sad. I just break down and start crying. I want to talk to him but I am too proud to and I am scared. I don't know why, I just don't know what I would say after us hardly speaking for 1 1/2 years. I am not angry at him anymore, I just miss him but I don't know how to speak to him.

He also has a medical condition and probably won't live after the next 15 years. So I really need to speak to him. Recently we have been speaking a little more, smiling sometimes, when I left for vacation 2 months ago I gave him a hug. But we hardly look at each other or speak, if we do it is only when needed. I haven't started a conversation after the fight ever but he does as I am a shy kid I guess.

I miss him SO SO SO much it consumes me. But I don't know what to do. I can't figure out words to speak to him or when I try to look him in the eye my gaze just drifts away. I guess I have too much pride. I love my dad so much.

683,"My life took a turn this past year. It caught me by surprise and although plenty of time has passed, I cannot make sense of it. I've had moments of deep despair and moments of euphoria where everything is crystal clear. I am here seeking advice from others (who aren't my friends or family) because Reddit has helped me in so many ways before. I apologize, hope this isn't too long.

I had a career change that doubled my salary, which is great but I had to move an hour away, and I essentially lost most of my friends that I worked with for 10+ years. At my old job, I was a go-to type of dude, had autonomy, and a set schedule which I was too dumb to appreciate. Although this job pays me much more, I underestimated the toll of the 1.5 hour commute (each way), the constant 12-16 hour work days, being the fucking rookie again (in my late 30's) and all that comes with that. My schedule changes every week, so that and the OT make it very difficult to have a social life. It feels like my life is just simply to work. I do enjoy the job, but this is not my life's calling. I am not ungrateful but I wonder if there is more to life than a steady paycheck.

So my divorce combined with the change in careers, left me kind of alone, and with a feeling of being lost like I've never had in my life. I turned to drinking (which I quit) to try to cope, then to reading, and journaling, and all of this has led me to question the direction in which my life is going.

The positives are that now my finances are in order, and I am in a good position. I have no debts, no obligations, and nobody depending on me for anything. This feels pretty liberating. A couple of things to mention. I have a decent amount of savings, as well as good chunk of change in a retirement account, and a good amount of equity in a rental property (which I still own with the ex). Also, as a vet, I may qualify for free healthcare through the VA (which I've never applied for before).

I want to live a life truer to my talents or personality, and maybe just find something more fulfilling (if that's even a possibility), but either way fuck it. I just don't want to live the rest of my life to finish my shift, go home to sleep, and then do it all over again. Especially since I don't really have to.

These are the main options I've thought of: A) Quit my job, go to school full time, work part-time. See what the fuck can come of this. If I fail, at least I tried. B) Transfer to a more expensive city (can pretty much go anywhere, LA, SF, NYC) with much more shit going on and see if that would change much, or C) Keep working here and save more money, and try to find peace here and now.",20Jul2019,1
684," 

My gf got me a nice dress for me because I wanted to try it, I am a male that identifies as a boy. I ended up liking how it looked, made me feel good. I show my dad the dress (not me in it, it was on the hanger) and ask him to take a picture and send  it to my mom currently visiting Spain. My dad was pretty open to the idea of me wearing it, but the first question my mom asks  is ""did he post any pictures that would impact his career?"". I argued that employers discriminate against me and others just because they look slightly browner than Caucasian. I wouldn't know either way if they did because that's not something that anyone would tell you in your face so it's not something I should assume every time I get denied a job. or is it? Oh and my dad also supports this kind of thinking, but not as fervently. She also kept saying that she ""didn't care"" but told me not to post pictures of me in the dress.  


     **So?:** I think being  concerned for a reason that you can't verify, but you know there is a  history of, still isn't valid because there's nothing saying they are or  are not discriminating, unless you interview the workers there and do a  lot of things that would take more time than finding another job  somewhere else. But that's me.   


     **For a little context:** My  dad says that my mom trusts her feelings and pretty much no one will  shake whatever Idea she may have about pretty much anything. Otherwise, she is a great mom. Her mindset has led her to make not the best  decisions about how to treat me, but I wouldn't trade her for the world. I'm also going into Industrial Engineering for my career. I'd think that Engineers would care less about stuff like political views and what their employees do in their spare time.

So, should I be concerned about it that much or should I not be worried? Also, reading back through it, it comes off like I had an impulse out of the blue to get it.

686,"Out of the blue, my mother emails me and says if and when I marry my BF, she wants to give me her sister's ring. Her younger sister, my aunt, passed away nearly 2 years ago. Up to that point they had lived together several years, my mother taking care of her as my aunt's health cycled in and out of one problem to the next. They were very close, so of course my mother inherited most of my aunt's estate. Anyway, it's a valuable ring with 12 diamonds, not to mention the sentimental value. My problem is that it is NOT something I would wear. It may have suited my aunt, but I think it would look absolutely hideous on me. If it was just a normal gift, I could probably graciously accept it and only wear it on rare occasions around my mother, but as a wedding ring I just couldn't wear it 24/7. I'm also kind of disappointed my own mother doesn't know how I'd feel about it, since I wear rings and jewelry all the time that look NOTHING like my aunt's ring. What should I do? (I'm currently not engaged, but what if she contacts my BF with the same offer and he accepts?!?)

PLOT TWIST: When I was much younger (still living with my mother) she inherited a ring from her great aunt. It may not have a lot of monetary value, but it's old and I think it is gorgeous. I even hinted many times that if she ever got rid of it I want it, or how it would make a much better wedding ring than all the usual boring designs... Of course she wears it every day (because it's beautiful) so there's no chance I'd get it anytime soon if she did remember.",20Jul2019,5
687,"Short story: I am a lonesome loser that doesn't know how to make friends or talk with people so how do I do those things?

This is my first time ever posting on reddit so I am not really sure how to do it so I'll start with a rundown of my situation. 

I am a 20 year old guy and I am extremely introverted. I just got out of a three year relationship three months ago. She broke up with me, I was really sad for a while but I'm pretty much over it now. Before we started dating I had a group of lifelong buddies that I spent all my time with. We hung out with one another pretty much every day. When I started dating this girl I started to drift away from the friend group because they weren't supportive of the relationship, their distaste for my relationship was always a sore spot for my ex-girlfreind and ultimately contributed to our demise. Due to the fact that I was spending all my time with this girl my friends moved on and kinda 'replaced' me in the group with someone else. I didn't really care much, I still kept in contact with them through video games semi-regularly and hung out with them once every few months. They became more acquaintances at this point. 

Welp, my Ex broke up with me and not a single one of them checked up on me or anything, not even a single text. I know for sure that they all knew about it as soon as it happened, but didn't bother reaching out. I guess I deserved that for drifting away from them but it still hurt like hell that I was all alone.

I reached out to them and told them I was upset about them not reaching out and I apologized for drifting away. None of them seemed to care. They gave half-ass apologies and said they thought ""I would want some space."" Whatever, I just wanted my buddies back so I moved on and tried really hard to rekindle our friendship and show them that they meant a lot to me. It was not reciprocated in the slightest. They never invited me to hang out with them, I would have to initiate and coordinate it with everyone and even then most of the time they would say they were ""busy."" Keep in mind I had all their social medias so I saw they would just be hanging out without me lol. None of them wished me a happy birthday, never checked in to see how I was, or had any interest in being my friend anymore. So I just stopped reaching out. 

This was all about two months ago. Since then I haven't really done anything. I have an internship I've been going to and I work out at the gym but other than that I do not leave the house or interact with others. I don't remember the last conversation I had with someone that wasn't internship-related. I literally do not have any friends or anyone to talk to or hang out with. I'm kind of a loner anyway so it didn't really bother me at first but now its really starting to get to me. I don't want to tell my parents I'm struggling with this because I don't want them to worry about me. I just pretend that I'm going to hang out with people but I secretly just go to the gym or sit in a parking lot and play switch. 

I'm moving away for school in about a month as a transfer student to the SF area so I figured I would just try to make friends when I get there. But how? I have literally only had one friend group my whole life and I genuinely do not know how to make friends or talk to new people. I do not like being in uncomfortable situations so I avoid all situations entirely. I have to talk to people at my internship and it is exhausting and I realized that I am incredibly socially awkward.

2. How do I become less shy?",20Jul2019,3
688,"Ok, I’m a confusing person, but long story short I’m a white English person raised athiest, but have made a few Muslim friends, and rn I’m going through quite intense depression and an abusive relationship, I’ve tried literally everything to help myself, therapy, medication, self medication, meditation, hobbies, but nothing helps. One time I had an incredibly bad mental breakdown after having a physical fight with my dad and being kicked out the house, I clapped and was crying in an alleyway begging Allah for help, saying allahu ackbar, inishallah I will be ok, and confessing every sin I’ve ever committed(most of which I have never opened my mouth about), and after a while I felt strong enough to stand up, and everything turned out ok. I googled prayers for help and came across ‘Rabbi ini magluban fantassir’, which is something along the lines of ‘God I am weak please help’ (not word for word), but whenever I say allahu ackbar or pray to Allah, it provides me relief, so much to the point where I have been thinking I am a Muslim, I’d like to start eating halal meat, but because of my housing situation it would be incredibly difficult and my somewhat racist dad wouldn’t be happy about it.

But the point of the post was, what are some small prayers a person with a simple mind can remember? I feel so much relief, even when having a panic attack or crying my eyes out, my breath steadies and I think clearly, I feel like Allah is helping me.",20Jul2019,1

This is just a summer job for me but the money is not the biggest thing in the world to me.

Another employee of another company asked me to send them my resume because he think I should be working at a place that pays more. He doesnt know about this situation though.(this isn't a confirmed position yet though)
The time off is for a camping trip that we already paid for after he said I could have time off. Friends father took time off work so he could haul the trailer. If I can't go then noone else can go because I am the only one who can drive other than the father.
I'm looking for advice if I should just suck it up and not go and let my friends down.  Or should I risk it quit and hope the other job hires me. Also any other advice would be nice.

709,"So i don't really know how to start here. I have a crazy family. It was my parents, my 2 brothers and me. My parents had a toxic relationship for years and were very violent towards each other and towards us. 
My father never hit me but my mom used every little excuse to hit and ground me. 
This started from a very young age. When i was around 10/11 years i understood that they were drunk most of the time. So i tried to blame it on the drinking for many years. I was always best buddies with my dad since he always stood up for me when my mom was fighting with me again over nothing. This was until i was 12.
Around this age is where the molesting started. My mom was on vacation and he stayed home with us. He was drunk and started with a simple hug. He kissed my neck and pulled me towards him. At this point it was awkward for me but i didn't understand what this was and if this was normal or not since i was only 12.

A few nights after that i was sleeping and he came into my room. All i remember was me waking up on my stomach with my panties pulled down a little bit and him on top of me. Screamed and cried while pushing him off of me. He immediately started apologizing and saying he'd never do it again. I was so in shock that i didn't know what to say. He left the room and i was awake all night. The next day i remember him trying to be extra nice to me and offering to do fun things. I didn't want to do anything fun and especially not with him. 
I didn't talk about it to anyone. 
When my mom came home from the vacation i was too afraid to tell her because i thought she wouldn't believe me and because i didn't want to break up the family. So i kept my mouth shut.
A few weeks later he tried doing something similar again.  And he did this a couple of different times for 2 years. 
Untill one day it happend again while my mom was on another vacation on her own, This time it had happend so many times and i was afraid and uncomfortable about even turning my back to him that i just needed to speek up for myself instead of thinking about everyone else,
So i called my aunt and asked her if she could pick me up. i explained it to her. My father has always been like a son to her. So she was in shock and couldn't believe the words that came out of my mouth.After that we called my uncle (my fathers brother) and let him come over to explain the situation. We decided that i was going to stay at my aunts house until my mom came back from the vacation. 
We called my mom to tell her what happend and, without asking me how i was doing, she called my dad and told him that he was out of the house the second she got home. And so it happend. 

I spoke to my dad with my uncle to see what i wanted. I didn't want him in jail or anything i just didn't want him in my life. He was devestated and begged for forgiveness. But i left. 

Months later was still living with my mom but, like i mentioned before, she made my life miserable. Hitting me, pulling my hair, calling me names, grounding me for days upon days while i didn't do anything. I went to school, did my homework, cleaned the house, cooked us food and everything. She still never asked me how i was doing or anything. She just pretended it never happend which was convenient for her. 

It got to a point that i had to leave but had nowhere to go but my grandma's. My grandma has alot of anxiety and is depressed. She has medication for it but we can't talk to her about stressfull things since she doesn't know how to handle it. So we never told her what happend. I was there for a few weeks and one day i come home from school and there was my dad. He didn't know i was living there at that point. But he had no place to stay so my grandma offered him to sleep in the room downstairs. And again i couldn't tell my grandma anything so i had to keep to myself. I locked every room behind me and covered every inch of my body. 

We lived like this for a few months. At one point i met my boyfriend and i told him this story. The same day he heard this he said; ""we're gonna pack your stuff and you're coming with me. There's no way i'm letting you stay there one more second."" I took my dog with me and left. 

I have lived with my boyfriend for over 3 years. Over these 3 years i've seen my family growing close to my father again while knowing what has happend. Eventually i told my grandma what had happend and she cried at first and then started to make jokes aboit it. I tried to make excuses for her since i know she's not stable mentally. But the rest of my family is doing exactly what my mother did, acting like nothing happend. And i just don't know how to be around then anymore. Is this really my family? I'm afraid that they think i lied or that i exagerated it. 

At this point i simply don't know what to do and it has already been so many years but there's not a day that i don't think about the mental and physical torture they put me through. 

Should i just cut off all contact with my family? Or talk to them about the fact that it bothers me? Am i wrong for thinking they shouldn't be so friendly with him? 
Many questions here and hoping for some advice.

Thank you for the patience and reading

711,"Sorry for horrible formats I am on mobile sooo...

I’ve searched for what’s been happening to me but it wasn’t too specific so i thought I should ask real people instead. It started a year ago when i always get sleep paralysis. It’s like I can see the whole room like I’m awake but I can’t move, It’s happened to me for many months and for a week i started dreaming about being self aware in dreams but seeing dead people or creepy stuff (I guess from fear) but I can’t seem to wake myself up from it. It feels like I’m stuck inside and all I can do is wait until I wake up. 

I got immune to the creepy stuff and then stopped dreaming about it. Then it just went to sleep paralysis, I’m gonna be oddly specific this time but this happens a lot to me, like 2-4 times a week. I’ve been experiencing it for months. I woke up just now and thought I should probably do something to it. I’ve reached about being able to move my head and arms in my dreams but not my torso and legs. The experience I give below is an example of what happens to me all the time

I woke up at 4 a.m and I was really tired and sleept so I slept at 6:52 a.m to make up for it. Then I slept at my living room alone with the lights on, I woke up in my dream and I was just in the same position I slept in, Sleep paralysis again. Just like usually I do I’m aware of my situation, I try to move my arms and head and try to slap myself or touch any part of my body. 

For some reason I do feel texture of my body like clothing and skin but if i go deeper than the skin it feels empty. I only moved my head around and I saw my table placed very near me. Just like real life and I even tried touching it, I felt the wood but when I pushed inside it, feels empty again. Then comes doing deep breaths to calm myself, I might have took an advice given to me too seriously “masturbate to it to forget the fear” 

Well truth to be told I did try. I felt my clothing but I couldn’t feel any stimulations so I gave up, I swear I’ve been stuck in that dream for 30 minutes trying to slap my imaginary skin to wake myself but failing repeatedly! and then I just gave up and waited it out. 

So I successfully was able to open my real eyes after an almost 30 minutes adventure in my dream trying to wake myself up. I woke up in the literal exact position I slept in, the arm and head I moved in my dream was reversed back. So that’s a conclusion that I never actually touched the table nor touched any part of my body. I checked my phone and I was only asleep for exactly 10 MINUTES! 7:52 a.m. I felt like I was a clown when that happened.

It’s been an ongoing problem for me for almost a year and it’s really annoying. Maybe if I was lucid dreaming I won’t complain but sleep paralysis is a different story. I really need this to stop, any ideas??? Can anyone help me solve this and what I can do to prevent these type of dreams.",20Jul2019,1

ive been, i guess you could say that, misbehaving a lot recently too because of the way he treats me and ive been stressed because of merely his presence and god im still crying but he just keeps hitting me and me over the smallest things i really dont know if this is actually supposed to happen or not

i was going to type more but i started crying so much again so ill edit this post with a lot more later on, but i politely asked him to give me my internet back (ive been grounded for a while) and he hit me again and i have a mark... i always get them but they fade after like a hour like yeah theyre there in the first place but idk

719,"I went outside with one of my staff members today who was having a panic attack and she confided in me all of the shit she's got going on at home.
Her stepdad is abusive towards her mum, her and her 7 year old sister. Her mum works all the time and she looks after her autistic sister. Her mum and stepdad have been together 10 years and she is too scared to leave him. He owns the house they live in, her mum is in £20k of debt. 

He has hit her and her sister before but a lot of the abusive is verbal, he throws things and calls them names and it's always been the same, she broke down and told me everything which she never has told anyone beforehand. I won't include all the details but it broke my heart and she's told me how she's suicidal and can't cope in that house anymore but won't move out because of her sister. She won't go to the police because she doesn't have proof and thinks it will be their word against his and it will make things worse.

I'm at a loss with how to help her, she's only 18 and although I'm her boss she's like a little sister to me. I don't know what I can suggest for her or what options she has because she feels like there's absolutely no way out and I'm worried she will do something stupid",20Jul2019,1
720,"i love my brother because, well, hes my brother. But lately hes honestly prettu scary. Hes in JROTC and as a result, idolizes the military and poliece. This in itsself is enough to make my skin crawl. But lately its been getting...worse. He is OBSESSED with war history, makes constent ""jokes"" every time i talk about anything serious (ex. One time my mother was talking about queer bashing and he said it was ""cool"" some people think like that. He later said he just meant interesting) and every time i mention anything im going through/dealing with he just says ""its not a big deal"" "" that's just what the world is like"" and things like that. Its getting to the point where i feel genuinely uncomfortable and upset around him. Should i cope? Is it worth trying to talk to him? How do i cut him off without pissing off mt mother (whom i dont want to cut off) when she's the one who houses, feeds, and clothes him?",20Jul2019,8
