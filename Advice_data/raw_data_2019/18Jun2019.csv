0,"just to start off, i have absolutely no problems with trans people, and i’m openly bisexual. we have been long distance dating for almost a year, and they’re moving here for college. lately they have been contemplating being transgender or not. i want to help them find out more in any way that i possibly can, but i just have no idea how to. i want to be there for them but i just don’t know how to either, i’m not educated enough on the topic. i’ve tried to do research and help them find out more as much as i can, but there’s also just no resources online. 

i’m also nervous how they’re going to change physically and mentally, and how our relationship will change as a result of that. i love them very deeply, and i want the best for them, i just don’t know how to help them figure out what they’re feeling (note: they don’t really know what’s going through their head, that’s why i want to know more resources to help, i’m not trying to “make them cis”). should i just stay back and try to talk about it less? am i worrying too much about this?",18Jun2019,1
1,"Hello,  this is a rather long post so scroll to bottom for TL;DR

I am just about to graduate from university with (not given grade yet as I’ve still to finish off my Honours project but likely a 2:1) a Bsc in Biomedical science with honours. However, my attendance was very poor, not sure if this matters? I live in Scotland so the NHS, I believe, is the biggest employer. I will be graduating in November whereas most of my class will graduate in July. 

As I’m graduating late I didn’t apply for jobs months ago as I thought I had absolutely no chance. I know that was a stupid decision. I am not accredited and so I cannot be a biomedical scientist but I must be a trainee for 1 year first and not many hospitals seem to take people in this situation. I am currently applying for every in-lab job I can find to get some experience as my only real job has been pharmacy dispenser for the past 3 years. 

My current ideas are to phone around local hospitals to see if they would allow me to shadow someone in a lab as I believe that would improve my CV, get into the NHS in any capacity because I’ve heard that once you’re in you have a much higher chance of getting other NHS jobs. I have also considered taking the masters course but it is expensive, focuses on quality assurance and I would have to wait a year to apply as I have left it too late I think. I don’t mind taking a year out or even jumping into 2nd or 3rd year of another course.

I have been putting off career path thinking as I was finishing off my delayed courses. I haven’t failed a single aspect during my time, I am late due to extenuating circumstances.

TL;DR: Looking for suggestions to improve lab-based job employability for someone who has put no thought into post university prospects until now.

Any suggestions on how to improve my lab position employability would very much be appreciated. Thanks!",18Jun2019,1
2,"18y/o female here. I know this is a lot to read but...

Last semester I got a part-time job at the dining hall at my university to make some money on the side to help with school. I know most college student part-time, minimum wage jobs are not the greatest by any means, however I really feel like mine is worse than a lot (so this is kind of a 2 part question, as I'm also kind of wondering if this is just how all food-industry jobs are or if my job is as bad as I think it is) I'm sure you're wondering why I'm even asking this, as if I dislike it this much then surely I should quit. However, there are SOME benefits that make me hesitant. But first I would like to rant a little bit lol

So for starters, the management at my job is a complete wreck. While supervisors sit on their phones at a table and do absolutely nothing 90% of the time, my co-workers and I have to basically run things ourselves (I work the opening shifts and we often arrive well before any managers or supervisors show up). When we finally get things up &amp; going only then do the supervisors get up from their tables or show up to work just to walk around and micromanage and bitch for 20 minutes, only to sit down and do nothing again. The managers are not any better. My co-workers and I, who work anywhere from 10-12 hours, and sometimes and even longer shifts are required to receive a break, yet oftentimes the supervisors never break us and we either have to break ourselves without permission (as somehow management is nowhere to be found during the peak of the day) or we just don't get a break. Keep in mind, this job is pretty physically exhausting and I worked the entire bakery by myself nearly every single shift.

As I mentioned earlier, I was the opening shift, so I had to come in a few hours early just to prep &amp; make enough food to last for breakfast and lunch before we opened our doors. Somehow my management always failed to tell me when the person who was supposed take after my shift in the evening called out/didn't show up to work/etc. until I found out myself (since I worked the bakery entirely by myself that meant it was my problem). While I'm nearing the end of my shift, someone else is supposed to be prepping for the next, and when that other said person isn't coming in without me knowing ahead of time, that meant I had to frantically make enough food for at least a THOUSAND people with ZERO prep time that was already supposed to be out and serving. Oh yeah, there was also those several occasions where I was almost 3 hours past my shift since not a single manager/supervisor/coworker showed up to take over my shift, and I couldn't just leave as it was incredibly busy and I had to constantly restock food items as they went.

I also just hate my shift times as I have to work at the crack of dawn every weekend until anywhere between 5-7pm, which makes it very difficult to balance school, work, and a social life, but I know the shift manager would refuse (as she's done to others) to change my schedule since nobody else wants to work mine :)


So why am I still employed there? Well since it's an on-campus job, I am not liable to work whenever my school is closed (aka winter break, summer, etc.) which is honestly great. I do have the option to work at any other food service place on campus as they're all run by the same company, which is good however I'm questioning if it's even worth transferring anywhere else. In addition, they kind of have to be somewhat more lienant on student workers when it comes to taking off for exams and what not as there are more rules set in place as an on-campus facility. I think most of all I'm simply just worried about quitting and not being able to get a job somewhere else. 

P.s: It's currently summer so I'm back home and not working there at the moment, however a voicemail (which I have still not answered...oops) from a manager asking me when I'm returning made me decide to ask for any and all advice on what I should do.",18Jun2019,1
3,"so i made a post a few weeks ago about this situation where my brothers best friend was being really creepy toward me whilst i was drunk (im 16, he’s 18). everyone said tell my brother and i was going to but then he wasn’t in for a few days and the timing just didn’t feel right anymore. 

yesterday, my brothers friend came back to my house so i facetimed my friend bc i was scared and she came round. we went to get food when she got to mine, which was like 11pm, and when we came back, my brothers friend was staring at me and it just gave me a really weird feeling idk. 

she left the next morning and i thought my brothers friend had left too but when i came back he was also back and i saw him whilst we were both alone and idk if i’m overreacting because im paranoid but he gave me the creepiest look. 

i spend the rest of the day by myself and then get a text from my brother which says “*insert name* wants to know if you have any pals round tonight?” so i replied “why?” and then i got the response “because he fancies a shag.”

this literally terrified me so much that i started panicking and crying and i literally never cry or stress. i was texting all my friends to see if i could stay over but i couldn’t so i ended up walking to my grandmas house because i’m too scared to stay in my own. idk what to do and it’s making me really anxious. 

also writing this down and reading it back really makes me feel like i’m overreacting but im genuinely so scared.",18Jun2019,3
4,"People fighting over politics, wishing the death of another for being themselves. People abusing one another for their own pleasure and gain. 

I'm honestly very scared to be myself. Seeing how there are so many people that are toxic, rude, and very hurtful. 

Scrolling through pages like r//the\_donald make me nervous as an LGBT person. Knowing that child trafficking sites exist on the deep/dark web makes my skin crawl. The fact that people out there are derogatory to people because of their sex/gender is frustrating. 

I don't know how to just stop caring what others think. 

When it comes to me, I have seen death threats being made and people *agreeing* with them online. I have seen people saying they thing that trans people should be killed. That gay people are disgusting members of society. And I know that they're wrong, but it still hurts and leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

6,"I’ve had the same group of friends for almost my whole life now (S,M,J,C,D) We’ve grown up together and always been real close. Recently I’ve noticed we haven’t been hanging around as much. I thought it must just be us growing up but I’ve actually found out they have been hanging out, just without me. 
I’m lucky to have more friends, who I haven’t know for as long, so I still have people to talk to but this saddens me. I’ve grown up with them and share so many memories with them. 
One of my new friends (R) asked me if I saw what was on S’s private story. It turns out I wasn’t included in the private story. When I asked him about it he said it was an honest mistake but then lashed out at R. R has also informed me that they have another group chat without me (R isn’t in it) that is active everyday, our old one is deserted. I’ve left that group chat 3 times now. Ye first 2 I was added back but now I haven’t been added back. I’ll still talk to them sometimes but I don’t initiate the conversation anymore. 

I honestly don’t know what to do. I’d say they don’t include me cause I’m not fond on drinking, which they’ve taken up. I couldn’t bring myself to drink to be included, it goes against my morals. I’m going on a school trip next year and if I’m not friendly with them, there’ll be nearly no one I know on it. 
What do I do??

7,"I'm not sure what to do.

So essentially, I'm a slightly overweight white guy, pretty normal, though I'm somewhat of an introvert and not sure how to talk to women to get a girlfriend.

I work online on a gambling site and have had a regular player chatting to me for over a year.  I made the terrible terrible mistake of meeting her and now she's convinced that we're meant to be together forever and all this crazy stuff.

Problem is, I'm just not all that interested, I don't think we have much in common and although I'm not sure if I want kids yet, she definitely doesn't and is 39 years old, 40 this year.  I'm just not sure how to go about this, as I tried to end it with her and she literally came to my house and talked to my mother about how upset she was, she was crying for three days, before she came over, how she can't live without me, etc.

So I'm basically feeling pretty trapped in this relationship that I just don't want and my mother is taking her side somewhat, with things like ""Just talk to her, take it one day at a time"" and other pearls of wisdom like this.

I'm tempted to move and not tell anybody lol.  But I live at home with my mother and don't really earn enough to move out.

Any advice guys?  I realise it's probably going to be something like ""man up, tell her you're not interested and move on"", but I'm really not even a beta, more like a zulu, I don't like to upset people.  It took me over a year to tell her I wasn't interested, since she just kept emailing me what felt like 50 times a day and I just couldn't take it anymore.

Well, I guess I'll post this now and see what people think, if anything.",18Jun2019,0

&amp;#x200B;

I need some tips or advice on how to overcome my very bad self consciousness and body image issues.  I often feel as I have an attractive head stuck on a terrible body. I go to the gym often but don't see results. Anyway, I have a new gf and she wants to -do the deed-, but 

1. I haven't done anything with a girl, (virgin) only ever kissed. 

2. I have these body image issues and really don't want her to be disgusted by me when I take my shit off

 3. I have a slightly below average member and feel like that will be awkward. Not like 4 inches small but still small. I feel really bad anxiety about that as I am a virgin and she is not.

So I carpool with 5 coworkers to work, there are total of 4 males and 2 females, I'm one of the male's. On this particular day there was another male coworker that joined us on this car pool. So here we are all 5 males sitting inside the van, waiting for the other 2 girls to arrive so we can head off to work. Now the Van seats 6 people comfortably but it can accommodate a total of 8 passengers as there are that many seat belts. So i'm sitting in the middle row all by myself and the 2 girls arrive and they see that their original sitting area is occupied one seat by me. One of the girls decides it's best if she just drives herself to work and the other girl joins her. At this point we are befuddled at what is going on, as there is enough room for both of them. I offer to sit in the rear in the cargo area so they can have the bench seat to themselves as they usually do. My boss who's sitting in the front passengers seat offers his seat and he'll sit in the back. But no, they decide it's best for them to drive on their own. It was an early morning awkward scene, we figured they didn't want to sit next to a man in tight quarters. But we are all coworkers, and it just made me feel insecure.

12,"So after recently turning 18 and a string of few family issues (excessive arguments etc.) my mum kicked me out of the home . Sadly I had nowhere to go, but It's a blessing and a curse that my parents are separated, because It meant that my dad has taken me in. 

But the main issue is that my dad lives in a small city in scotland and my mum lives in London. This means everything is new to me in terms or people and lifestyle and I barely know anyone. So I have left everything behind, my education, my part time work and my social life and friends down in London.I do intend on retaking a year of education and also finding another part time work, but it may take some time.

So I have a few questions and some advice I need thanks

1)  How do I adjust from such a fast paced city life style to much more of a small city/town one?

2) How and what way are the best way way to make new friends or meet new people in a small city?

Once I meet new people, the first question I get asked a lot is Why did you move up here, especially if you've come up from London? It's on an initial meeting and I want to have a good first impression so I really don't want to delve into my family problems and such so... 

3) How do I make up another excuse or a subtle/white lie of 'getting kicked out' or moving away?

And this works the other way round too as in,
4) how do I let my friends and those who are close to me in London know that my mum has kicked me out and I have moved to scotland without being made to sound like a person with family issues?

Thanks, very much appreciated

14,"Ill try to provide only relevant details. Im a mobile user, english is my first language im just an idiot so grammar and spelling issues ahead most likely. Tl;Dr at bottom

I used to know this girl who literally lives up the road from me who was a rather.. wild child growing up. Looking back she was either abused or not cared for by her parents ( she came over and would eat us out of house and home, always dirty, talked constantly of running away, random bruises that she didnt/refused to explain ect.). We had a falling out because my mom always got... weird vibes from her and her family, and didn't want me being around her.

Here recently we got back into contact because I'm pregnant with a girl and she has a whole bunch of newborn stuff from when she had her little girl almost two years ago. She said she wanted to throw them away anyway and me taking them would be much easier, but has since dodged that subject entirely.. And only messages me about one thing. 

Money. 

The first time she asked it was 30$ for basic stuff for her child (juice, diapers, rash cream, ect) and she would pay me back. 

She kinda pulled the struggling mom card and I reluctantly obliged. I made it as clear as I could without being an ass that I typically don't do this, I'm not a bank, and I'm only helping because I hope she would do the same if I ever needed it.

 (Quick note I didn't and still don't expect the money back. It's not that big of a deal at this point) I ended up pulling 40$ from my bank with this dread in my gut and headed to her house.

When I got there the house.. looked rough at best. There was some dude in a car that I had never seen before rolling up and smoking a joint which STILL isn't weird, but doing it with her kids car seat in the back didn't give me the best feelings. 

The worst part was when she stepped out and was nothing but skin and bones. She was always thin but...shes hauntingly thin now. 85 pounds soaking wet on a good day maybe.. She takes the money thanks me, gives me a hug and I haven't seen her or that car since. (Quick note It was dark so I could not see her very well, but I could feel all her bones.)

Now she has messaged me MANY more times... asking about places that do loans, asking if i can help with a bill, complaining that payday is too far away (she cleans a house one day a week for a job) asking if i know anyone who wants to buy a phone and today she asked me to cosign a LOAN with her, which was the last straw and final huge red flag.

 I've tried directing conversations towards helping her get a job, finding a cheaper place to live,offering candles when the lights would go out (She instead stayed with her sister) and that loan sharks are still a thing and financially not good or helpful in the long run to take out a loan, but she always got irritated with me or stopped texting me until she found something else to ask about.

I haven't replied to this most recent message and I'm not sure I want to. Something just doesn't sit right with me and I'm worried about her kid. I thought about putting in a report to CPS about it but I dont want to over react, but I've known drug addicts and this is to the T how they act once you've helped them out once, and how they act about money. 

 I've cut those shitty people out obviously (some easier then most. Them going to jail or being on the run makes it pretty easy) but none of them had a KID or lived right down the road from me.. And That scares me. 

I know i would do anything to provide for my child, and if the money is to fuel a drug addiction that's an even MORE worrisome thought. We aren't close enough to offer serious help or to ask, and even if I did it would be EASY to deflect. 

If I call CPS and they find nothing then there's nothing to find, I'm an asshole for not minding my own business, fine cool. But if they do then I'm the dick who got into something that's none of my business and got a mother and daughter seperated. 

Maybe it's a jump to assume drugs. Maybe I'm being a worrisome hormonaly unstable preggo woman. But guess that's why I'm here.

19,"**Don’t sacrifice, live**

Davis, a premier sniper instructor in the U.S. military, believes guys today are miserable because they only focus on work and “sacrifice” to make money and provide for their families.

“Their health, fun, friends, fitness, and more have been burned at the altar in the name of their children,” [writes](https://www.theepochtimes.com/edition/parenting-family_2884139/2778912) the “Raising Men: Lessons Navy SEALs Learned From Their Training and Taught to Their Sons” author. “They tell themselves that sacrifice is a noble pursuit when, in reality, they are no longer living, or never have lived, a life worth following.”

**Don’t give up on your dreams**

By the time Mr. Davis had a job in the insurance agency, bouncing from one agency to another, he too was living a life of sacrifice and not intent. But, he had an epiphany.

“Man, one of the first things I’m showing my children how to do is to give up on their dreams,” he realized. “Right then, I determined that was an unacceptable example, so I re-joined the Navy, reapplied for SEAL training, graduated, and served as a Navy SEAL for 10 years.”

**Strive for more than retirement**

He calls “retirement” as a goal “the weakest mission possible.”

As he puts it, “The purpose of their work is to not have to work. Your son is watching you work for the sole purpose of not working.”

**Have fun. Be adventurous**

Davis also underscores the importance of play. ”Fun and adventure have a very pragmatic purpose.” Play allows our brains to reset and more, he says.

“…\[I\]t puts us in a state of creativity that allows us to better formulate the thinking, strategies, and tactics that we need to design and execute to complete our missions,” he says. “Without it, we fail to compete, and if we fail to compete, we lose.”

So I have this drawer filled with a bunch of stuff from when I first graduated from college. During this time I suffered with not being able to find/get a job, suffered from not being able to focus on studying for the mcat, and it was just a really dark time in my life. So naturally, I’ve associated this drawer of stuff to my life during that time, and it’s basically just a drawer of ‘negative/rejecting’ thoughts. Fast forward to a year, I now have a job, I’m working on a master’s, and I’m doing pretty well compared to 1 year ago, I’m even scheduled to take the mcat next month and I’ve felt pretty ready for that, and I recently got a raise at work! Now, my buddy needed a place to crash for a couple of days. Against everyone’s advice and my gut conscience, I let him stay with me. During this time, I lost an adapter to one of my keyboard chargers, so he searched my apt with me. Of course, he went through my “drawer of negativity” and contaminated his hands with the stuff inside, then began to search through my desk, sifting through all of my notes for the mcat, my computer stuff, and some paperwork for work. I couldn’t just yell out “Hey go wash your hands!” without freaking out so I just stopped him by telling him I remembered leaving ti at work. Except now, I feel as if he’s contaminated all of my stuff now with this “rejection” energy- my bed, my desk, my notes, and everything else important to me. And to make matters worse, **the next day** at work, my boss gave me an unsatisfactory review and put me on a performance review, which has never happened in the 5 months ive been there, she’s always called me a good worker, the raise I got should speak for itself. Now I’m terrified that this “contamination”  as doomed me to fail my mcat later next month, and doomed me to get fired.",18Jun2019,1

I don't usually post on here, one of the soldiers who dont post but upvote. Today is rare, but I just can't take it anymore. I can't get this thought out of my head, it seems that no matter how much i care for all of my friends, in my life, no matter who i've put as number 1 at any point in time, it was never mutual.

I am always giving more than i receive, and if I bring this topic up I end up looking like an attention seeker, and on occasions I'll get an explanation as to how ""but no we do care about you"", a phrase often said and never reflected in their behavior. I feel disconnected from everyone and everything, I am functioning in the background of everyone's lives, and will never get to play a big role no matter how much I give. 

It's really hard to convince myself to leave some people behind too, because that will only add to my already crushing loneliness. 

I'm not asking for much, just for someone to appreciate me as much as I appreciate them. I'll travel across cities multiple times a year to visit friends, who in turn will never even suggest coming over to my city, and whenever I invite them to do so, get given a lame excuse. I was never anyone's priority, not even my girlfriend's at the time.

26,"In April I started welding school. It was kind of in the moment decision. The story is I've been working in sales for a major cell phone company and after 3 years I decided I wanted to move on from the company. Around this time I had to move back in with my parents. I was living with my cousin in his apartment but his mom needed a place to live so I obviously got the boot. I had two options either look to move on to a better sales job and look for a new apartment for myself or continue to live with my parents and go back to school for something else at 24. I decided without much thinking that I'd like to back to school for welding and enrolled in a nine month program. I had to leave my job at the cell phone store because there were no part time positions available. Things with welding started off good but now I'm not sure I want to be a welder. The more I learn about this career, the less I want to do it. The school has representatives come in from companies and they talk about what it's like to work there and it doesn't sound like something I want to do. Also I am currently struggling right now. I've been in the same welding position for 4 weeks now and I can't seem to get it.  I was even called into the owners office and he asked if I thought I was going to make it through the program and whether I still want to to this or not, of course I told him yes. I am thinking about going back to sales but I worried of what my parents think. I never completed college and they always wanted me to complete some form of postsecondary education. They were so happy when I told them I was going to welding school. Am I giving up too soon? Should I give it a bit longer? I've applied to sales jobs this past weekend and today I received some call for interviews. My gut says to leave school but my head says to stay.",18Jun2019,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

29,"Hello all
This is my first post. Ever. So a bit of background first. I’m a married medical professional with four kids between 5-13. My wife left her career to raise our kids about 4 years back( we had a nanny for about 2.5 years). The kids are now in school full time and my wife does help out at our office organizing payroll and benefits. This works out to about 3-4 hours per week. She maintains our household (although I am fairly hands on with a lot of cooking and cleaning and home repair type issues) and kids sports and school schedules. 
So last fall she started up masters track and field locally as she did track at university. She really enjoys it and now that’s its summer she’s doing her track practices Monday-Thursday for several hours around suppertime and has left for a few out of town meets and has another upcoming. These aren’t inexpensive to partake in, once hotel and transportation are considered. I work a fairly stressful job and am on call with a hospital as well. We have zero debt and take the odd nice family vacay. We live in a great neighbourhood in a very nice home. This past winter, my recreation league hockey team that I had played on for the last ten years now and then, I was told by her was a no go as the kids play their sports. I don’t golf as it takes too much time (and I’m terrible) and I have to walk on eggshells to even attend professional conferences , sometimes even when I’m the keynote speaker !
So now I come home during the week to eat a quick supper (which is not uncommonly one I’ve prepared on the weekend and these are leftovers with a new salad made) and basically take care of our kids while she’s at track. To recap , I work a 8-9 hour day and then come home to take parent our children on my own. When I’ve brought up my concerns , she generally gets emotional quite quickly and typically threatens divorce. With a few F bombs thrown in. 
 We are both considered good looking athletic people, pillars of the community and a stable family. We are both in our mid forties. I don’t believe there is any infidelity on her part, she just really loves her Masters track. And she’s good at it. 
So my question to you all is a multi part question :
Am I wrong to be getting more and more irritated with this arrangement?
What might I expect from a typical nuclear family configuration?
Is divorce imminent and I just don’t see it?
Why do I feel like I now have basically no outside life (which I get it, she felt for the years when the kids were young) and no end in sight ?

Okay I’m ranting now. Please give your opinion and I’ll try to answer any questions. Still learning how the subs work in this forum
Thanks all!🙏 (this is actually a thank you hi five in advance)",18Jun2019,1
30,"Context: I’m not humble bragging, just laying out the context. I have a privileged life. I went to University fully paid for by my parents, got a well paying job right out of Uni, and have a healthy long term relationship with my boyfriend of 5 years. I have healthy savings and long term investments. I have a few good friends. I have holidays planned ahead of me. 

Logically, I have nothing wrong going on in my life. 

But sometimes I feel like life is just passing me by and everyday feels a bit monotonous. I guess it’s a good thing that there is no drama?

I live in Australia and my family lives in Asia, so I guess this is a factor because I miss out on a lot of family gatherings. I try to visit more now that I have full time income but it isn’t the same as living with them in the same city or country. 

I don’t want to have children. So I guess my entire adult life would just be me, my SO and friends, and occasionally extended family. And I keep finding myself thinking of how things would be like when I get old and people around me die and it makes me feel all down for no reason. 

How do I get out of this mindset? I can’t find anything to fix in my life except literally moving to be closer to family which is NOT an option I would like, because my career, friendships and my partner are all here.

32,"Hey redditors, 

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished my first year of grad school, and it was rough. I'm at an Ivy league institution in an environmental statistics field. I chose to go because of the opportunity the program offered ( I hope to use this degree to gain admission into a phd program in a related field), and because, for me at least, my school falls into the ""if you get in, you go"" category.  My story is interesting, and was likely what ultimately got me the nod, rather than my academic credentials, which are mediocre.

My program requires several prerequisites, and I was able to complete all but one of them. We're allowed to matriculate missing a maximum of one, so this wasn't a problem administratively, but constituted one of the many ways I arrived totally unprepared. Tasked with satisfying the other courses I needed, I didn't fully appreciate how much work would be required to finish them in a meaningful way (read: I retained very little), and I was struggling as soon as I arrived. My peers were miles ahead of me in terms of their relevant experiences and knowledge of programs required to do the kind of work we're expected to do. While they were learning advanced statistical analysis, for example, I hadn't opened excel in over a decade, and struggled to complete basic assignments. 

Ultimately, a year passed in which I frequently came off as incompetent and uninterested in participating in the program in the same way that my peers were. I'm a textbook introvert, which reinforced the kind of unfriendly, uninterested vibe I unintentionally put out. 

My question is, how can someone who behaved regrettably in a professional setting redeem herself? I'm not exaggerating when I say many think that I am actually incompetent. Several of my peers have declined social network invitations I've sent out. Looking at the data, I'm not respected, am perceived as doing the program for the wrong reasons, and am not fun to be around. 

I'm dedicating the my time off this summer to bringing myself up to speed, and am determined to gain momentum academically, but worry that the damage I've done to my professional/peer relationships is permanent.",18Jun2019,1

37,"Hello everyone!

A couple things to preface: I (20F) am moving in with my boyfriend (20M)  in about a month. We’ve been together for a little over a year now; My parents (51F, 50M) fight. a LOT. and they’ve been together for almost 25 years.  (married for 22)


Like I said, my parents fight ALL the time. sometimes it’s just bickering, but a lot of the time (probably 2-3 times a week) they get into big screaming matches over (imo) really stupidly small things. Right now they’re fighting because my mom gifted away one of our extra porch swings. Now, when my parents get into bigger fights, they scream up and down the house at each other and call names and say stuff like “shut the f*** up!!”. I know that part is not normal and that is chalked up to their terrible communication skills. 

I honestly could never imagine angrily telling my boyfriend to stfu or stuff like that. But what I want to know, is the constant fighting (on a smaller scale) normal? This is the first serious relationship i’ve been in and we a working towards building a future together and are taking the first steps to doing that. I just am concerned because this is all i’ve ever witnessed and I don’t want us to end up like this. Whenever I bring it up to my mom she just says “well we’ve been together for 25 years we get on each others’ nerves sometimes lol!!” and that i don’t understand cuz I don’t live with my boyfriend/we haven’t been together long enough to be like that. We’ve gotten on each other’s nerves and such, but we’ve never had a real fight, or really anything close to what i would call a fight. 

This may sound like a stupid question, but it’s genuine. I think I’m mostly asking because I want some validation here. So, to all of you who have been in long term relationships and/or marriages, is this what my future holds? or do i just have bad examples?",18Jun2019,2

We were charged for a brand new sink. 
Charged to replace all smoke detectors 
Charged for new shower heads(we never used theirs, we had our own. We replaced theirs when we left) 
Charged for all new hoses for the washer and dryer(??)
Charged for all new ceiling vents in the bathrooms and laundry room(once again???)
Fan motors in all bathrooms/laundry room 
Fan covers in all bathrooms/laundry room
Sink shut off valve (had previously made work order to repair leaky sink that was never done...now were being charged for it) 
New toilet seats(which I replaced upon move in one year ago... so they definitely didn’t need to be replaced)

We are heading away on holiday tomorrow to see my family in another state. My close friends will also happen to be there at the same time, so there is going to be a lot of socializing. He packed yesterday while I was at work and even from what I could see at the top of his suitcase I became worried. I tried to ask multiple times if I could go through what he packed and finally this morning he got very angry. I know most people wouldn't look twice at what he was wearing but to me I really want him to look nice. I know I'm too controlling about it all. I need to sort myself out. He now isn't speaking to me, and we leave tomorrow first thing.

60,"2 years ago, my dad loaned my husband and I 60k as a down payment for our house. We bought the house for 300k. 

Our first mistake was to not have a plan of repayment discussed ahead of time. Since then, whenever we talked about buying something, we get random messages from him about ""Oh by this date I need you to up your monthly payment to $400. Then by this date it needs to be $500.""

So essentially we are now in the market to buy a new car, and when I mentioned it, he replied with the usual comments. 

It sends me into an automatic panic. And I feel like I have a mega huge rain cloud weighing over me because we owe him such a big amount. 

Our mortgage is up for renewal in 3 years. Does it make sense to sell our house (worst case scenario we sell for what we bought it for - 300k), by then we will have our mortgage down to $200k. If we sell we would not $100k, we could repay his amount fully and still have enough of a down payment for a new house. 

Thoughts? 

TLDR: owe my dad 60k for down payment on our house. I hate owing this much money. Money and family stuff gets weird. Does it make sense to sell our house in 3 years, repay him and move to a cheaper else somewhere with the remainder from the profit we would make as the down payment?",18Jun2019,1

62,"I recently moved to one of the largest cities in the US About a year ago, and while I’ve enjoyed it so far, I feel like I’ve really lost my softness over the last few months. I like to think of myself as more down to earth and easy going. I cry happy tears when I see a puppy, I give to homeless. I’m the first person people go to for advice or need an ear to listen. I have always been very empathetic and “emotional” and though I did struggle with that, I’ve grown to accept it and I started to like those soft qualities of myself. Within the last 2 months or so though, I feel like I’ve lost that part of myself. I’m not phased by the sight of homeless people as much, I feel like I’ve become more materialistic. I find it harder to give advice and care. I feel like I’m losing touch with myself. I’m not sure if this is because I’m so emerged in the “dog eat dog environment” or if it’s other factors I’m facing (i.e. my best friend died 3 months ago) and if this is a side effect (because it has been so hard to try and overcome) of it. I feel it may be a combination, but regardless: advice on getting back in touch with what makes you, you? I feel so disconnected with myself and others anymore.

64,"Hello all,

I am in dire need of some advice. I’m 25 years old and I’m currently taking online college classes. I have a part time job working at a gym. However, today I started a second, full time job as a receptionist at an optometrist office and I think I really underestimated what I would be doing. I’ve never had any receptionist experience before so my first day was overwhelming to say the least. To be honest, the only reason why I accepted this job is because the pay is good and I wanted to broaden my work experience. However, it’s like learning another language - the software, terminology, procedures etc. My plan was to work this job as well as the gym job on Fridays and Saturday’s. But now I’m worried that this full time job will leave me feeling stressed and emotionally exhausted like I am feeling today that I won’t even want to do my school work on my free time. Another girl who has been there two months is still learning the software and unsure how to do certain things because it takes so long to learn. 

My question is: should I quit this full time job and just work part time and focus on finishing my school work asap? Or should I keep my two jobs, and do school on the weekend?

69,"  

I am currently stuck in the middle of a weird social workplace situation. Here’s the history of what has happened so far (btw I’m really sorry but the “story” gets very disorganized in the second half. I don’t know how to organize this cuz it’s all blended together and I have to rant): 

&amp;#x200B;

I began working at a place on Tuesday June 4th. This is my second year coming back and I know three other friends there who were also present from last year. Us four always sit together because we are well acquainted with each other, and it just became the norm for us, and we enjoy each other’s company. So from last year, it was normal for us to sit together: in the mornings while waiting for work to actually start (cuz we always arrive early), when we have a 15 minute break, and during lunch time. We continue to do this this year. 

Except things kind of broke down when a random dude (henceforth called RD) suddenly decided to sit with us. He/RD is a new worker and was not at the job last year. On the second day of work, one of my friends was wearing an anime t-shirt and RD approached my friend being like, “Oh do you watch anime? What shows are you interested in?” etc etc. I kind of thought that RD would go away after this conversation but to my big dismay, he stuck around. 

At first impression, I didn’t think much of RD, but as he continued to show his personality by trying to make conversation, I had a growing dislike for him. For example, from the first encounter with him talking about anime, he would talk about things that made me uncomfortable like h3ntai, or other anime genres/topics I was simply NOT into at all. But it gets complicated from here because 2 of my friends in the group are the type of people that don’t like hurting people. They are totally humble and sensitive people that always reply in a conversation and show interest in an effort to not hurt a person by ignoring them. So these 2 continued to make small conversation to RD (I guess he felt welcomed by this?), but I and the fourth group member kept to ourselves…

Day 3: I decided to bring in my Nintendo Switch cause I had Smash Ultimate and thought it’d be a great way to pass time and play the game on our breaks. At this point, I didn’t have the thought of RD in my head and what might happen with him, but I only intended my Switch to be played by my 3 friends. On the 15-minute break, he didn’t immediately sit with us 4, I don’t know where he was, but 2 minutes into me stupidly whipping out my Switch, he suddenly appears out of nowhere and goes like “WOooahah! Lemme play!!” Ok like first of all. I had never met a person like this. Someone like RD who just declares the things he wants and expects it to happen. He didn’t even ASK me. He wasn’t polite AT ALL. So this is when things started to take off.. I guess I was kind of in shock that this random someone straight-up commanded “Pass me a controller” (I only had 2, from my 1 switch console. No extra controllers) so I blankly gave him one. And I am the type of person who does not take action immediately. I did not have it in my heart to straight up tell him NO ( I know. This sounds bad. ). So he possessed the controller. RD was kind of dumb and it was clear that he had never played Smash before, but he was being annoying about it. He would go like “I need to know what X character does” and waste time by making his character run away. How boring! … So after the pointless match ended, I would tell him to pass the controllers on , but he would act super reluctant to give it up. And that first time I had to take it from his hands and give my other friends a try.  

This basically continues for a good few days. One of the group members who saw my switch said that she actually had extra switch controllers (seeing as how there were only 2 available) so she brought in a red, a blue, and a pro controller. Although there were battery issues so after she only brought 2 extras (the pro controller and a red one) . As soon as he saw the pro controller, RD was like “I NEED to use THAT one.” Again with the disgusting demands. On top of that, for some weird reason, he was like “I want to be Player One”. I’m failing to understand why he needed that. Its all the same in the end. Who gives a care if you’re player 1 or player 20? But yeah, he somehow ended up with the things he wanted. -\_-

So I keep bringing my Switch in because I have a lot of fun playing against my friends, and watching my friends play with each other, but when RD comes into the picture, it’s the absolute opposite. I would try to drop him subtle hints by trying to look reluctant pulling out the switch whenever he says “SO let’s set up this Switch” when we all finish eating. And when I see him play I cringe so hard on the inside. I never feel such strong emotions within me. I recall one time he said “Hey did you know the guy from dragon ball Z is in here?” ……….. no. 

 On top of the Switch situation, he continues to talk about topics I have no interest in whatsoever, things that make me uncomfortable, or if he directs a question at me, I feel very forced to answer them (ex. “hey what country are you from?). The other day, RD actually tried to get our social media/numbers so he could communicate with us. But we all evaded it and no contact info was exchanged. And actually the next day, RD tried again and failed. Like what?? How do you not see this as a hard rejection? I don’t understand how he still thinks he can sit with us. 

One other thing to add to the list of why I need him out of my group - I lent him a dollar. The workplace cafeteria has a vending machine and he wanted to buy chips one day. He asked the group around and they said no. But I couldn’t say “no” in the moment so I gave him a dollar. He hasn’t returned it to me yet. I keep telling myself its only ONE dollar. But I was kind enough to lend it to him and its been a good few days. He always says “I’ll bring it in the next day”. …

I keep telling myself that he’ll one day go away but no. So I was talking with one of my group friends who I’m super close with, that I was gonna give him a whole speech about how he inserted himself into the group with no context and we feel really awkward around him (because I came to the conclusion that he will never know unless he is told). I also said to this friend that I was going to tell RD that I will not let him play on my switch for these reasons: 1) He is still a stranger to me. I have probably ""talked"" with him for a combined total of less than 30 minutes. The fact that a stranger is playing on my switch is nerve-wracking and extremely annoying. 2) I legit feel like I’m being used. It feels like RD is only sitting with us so he gets the chance to play on the switch. 3) His language. I understand that Smash can have unexpected surprises, but it gives no grounds for blatant and LOUD swearing. (he did this twice in the workplace cafeteria, and I was actually worried that a supervisor might not tolerate this and not allow the Switch into the workplace anymore because of his foul mouth. And I did point this out to him once, but he still does it. The swearing is just ingrained into him…) 4) He has NO RESPECT or idea of SHARING. I always have to intervene to give my other friends a try. It’s honestly so annoying because it should be common sense to give other people a try. And it’s always I want this, I want that. ME ME ME. I must say, RD one time asked if I had any other multiplayer games like Mario Kart or Mario party. But I don’t play with many people often, I only have games like breath of the wild, Mario odyssey, and monster hunter. When I told him this, he just went like “wow”. As if it was expected of me to have an abundant supply of multiplayer games for him and my group to play altogether.. 

So you can see how everything together is making me pissed off. The main thing is, I don’t know what to do. How to do it. I told myself that I was gonna tell him today at lunch that he’s not allowed to play on my switch but I couldn’t bring myself to do it (side note: i decided to not bring it to work today). Maybe cuz I’m scared of how he’ll react? Maybe cuz I don’t want to hurt his feelings? I really need advice and help pls. This needs to stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR – I have a group of well established friends from last year at work. Random dude (RD) suddenly inserts himself into the middle and we all feel awkward and uncomfortable about him, yet he feels like he is fine where he is. I am very annoyed and pissed off at him because when I bring my Switch into the workplace for my friends to play, he acts like a hogger and has no respect. It has already been almost 2 weeks into the first day of work and he is still in my group of friends despite some very obvious hints that he doesn’t quite fit in with us. 3 of 4 group members (including myself) have confirmed that we find him very annoying. We don’t know what to do. Help us.",18Jun2019,1

72,"I just finished up my senior year of college and unfortunately, for reasons I won't get into, I don't have the sufficient credits to graduate and I'm gonna have to take classes online this Fall to finish my degree. I had already planned to take online summer classes but now I'm finding out I have to take some additional classes in the fall. Clearly, this is awful news for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my best friend/roommate from school have had plans to move to a new city together after graduation for months.  Our current lease is up in August, and we were hoping to move into a new place by September. We both talked to our parents about this plan for months and decided it was a great idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

We haven't signed any leases or officially toured any places yet but we have discussed this plan since the beginning of the semester. This is around the time when we were planning on touring and signing a lease. However, because I have to take another semester, I'm realizing I just can't afford the move. I have to move back to my hometown in a different state for the Fall and work while I finish my degree online.

&amp;#x200B;

This ruins all of our plans and I just feel such guilt about how it's gonna affect her. Obviously, I'm already beating myself up about how this is affecting me and my life, but on top of that, I just feel horrible about how it's going to affect her plans. None of our other friends are moving to the city, and I know for a fact she doesn't want to move back in with her parents. Our life plans are changing and it's my fault. I'm just having such intense anxiety about the entire situation.

&amp;#x200B;

As a deeply codependent person, this is eating me alive with guilt and I just don't know how to go about telling her.

81,"I just recently got a job through gracious word-of-mouth referral from one of my spouse's relatives (a great guy who noticed I was unhappy with my retail job and took the initiative of helping)

I did one interview with the manager, met a few contractors helping with building renovations, and start later this week.

Unfortunately, I've spent four years working retail and have literally no experience in any clerical work.

The job itself sounds simple enough, I'll be a secretary/front desk attendant for a high-security apartment complex.

The duties listed are checking ids &amp; managing/logging ins/outs, putting in any maintenance requests, hourly rounds to ensure everything's okay with renovation workers, taking calls, and ""filing, copying, documenting as necessary or assigned""

all of which sounds pretty run-of-the-mill for the position but is also very vague and sounds deceptively easy, especially since my manager is intending to be very hands-off

So! Is there an obvious job duty im missing or that generally goes without saying?
What makes a good/effective secretary?
Are there any protocols in place for figuring out what tasks need to be done in a shift, or do I rely on instructions from management?

I’ve tried giving her advice on what to do with him but now she’s just stopped talking to me in general. I don’t wanna pry but I don’t know what to do.",18Jun2019,1
88,"So for the last few months I’ve been involved in a theater group and made a lot of friends there. We got really close and we have a Messenger chat group where we talk to each other pretty much constantly.

One of the people I met is an amazing girl. I fell pretty much instantly and asked her out, but she had just gone through a bad breakup and was still dealing with that. She was still in love with him and every once in a while they would hook up which would open up that wound again and she would break down all over again. My friends and I kept telling her to stop seeing him and to move on, but she was having trouble moving on. I’ve been doing my best to support her and if she got to a point where she felt ready to date again I was going to try asking her out again.

Fast forward to this last weekend. We were doing our show ( I was running tech so I was very busy), and then at the end of the night when we were going to go to a local diner like we usually do I noticed that she wasn’t there. I checked our chat and found out that she had met a guy that night and they had left the show together to hook up. I was pretty upset and excused myself to go home. 

All this weekend she has been sending messages in the chat about this guy and, frankly, she is the more excited about this guy than I have ever seen her be before. Logically, I know that this is a good thing. If this goes well then she can get over her ex and that would be the best thing for her. I want to be happy for her, but hearing her talk about how happy she is with guy is emotionally devastating to me. I also found out that some of my other friends acted as wing women for her with this guy and I felt betrayed. I know I should feel that way, they’re just doing what good friends should do, but I can’t help feeling that way.

Eventually it got to painful so I messaged one of my friends who is on the leadership for the cast and told him that I was going to be taking a break from the cast and the Messenger group for a while to deal with some personal issues. He said that he understood and that I could come back when I have my shit sorted out. I didn’t tell him the actual reason but I know that he knows that I like her.

I removed myself from the chat because it’s still painful to hear about her. I’ve also made an appointment with a mental health professional. I want to get my head sorted out. To get to a place where I can be happy for her because this is a good thing for her. But I think I need some space in order to do that.

Am I making the right decision here? Am I being a shitty friend?",18Jun2019,2
89,"I'm a student doing a brief summer internship 1000+ miles from home. I'll be living at an air bnb (supplied by the employer) 4.5 miles from work. I need to obtain a method of getting to work and back (and trips to the airport) on my own dime. 

Car rental is an option, but I'm 23, so there would be a substantial insurance charge. I don't see any way of getting the cost much under $2,000. I ride motorcycle, but rental for those is even more than for cars. 

I see my other two options as buying a bike or getting a bus pass. Bus rides would be 40 minutes one way, and biking I would have to bring a change of clothes for the office (business casual). 

Anyone find themselves in a similar situation and stumble on a great option? I realize this post is pretty uncommon... Just kind of throwing it out there as a last ditch effort before forking out cash for a rental.",18Jun2019,1

\#1-

I'm friends with a woman who is mentally handicapped. She understands ""Doing the Nasty"" and was physical with her late girlfriend, and is physical with her current boyfriend. But she doesn't seem to understand why I'm not into her (She and her boyfriend are in an open relationship). She flirts with me a lot, I try to explain to her that I'm gay but she doesn't get it. I tell her I don't find women attractive, and she is a woman, so I don't find her attractive, and she insists that I'm just calling her ugly or am being mean to her. She doesn't understand that it's not personal, that it's women as a whole that don't do it for me, and that she just happens to be in that ""women as a whole"", she thinks that I personally find her ugly or something. Does anyone have an analogy that I could use to explain how someone could be attracted to one sex, and a different person, like her, could be attracted to both?

&amp;#x200B;

\#2- She's also into my mom (58F). My mom, me, my very young sister, and my boyfriend live together, and she lives with us when she isn't staying with her boyfriend. She shares a room with my mom (It's actually two rooms, but her room is connected to my mom's by a doorway and she has to pass through my mom's to get to the hallway). She follows my mom like a puppy. She has a big crush on my mom and my mom thinks it's cute and ignores it unless my friend is too flirty, which makes my mother uncomfortable, but due to the friend's disability, my mom can't bring herself to talk to my friend about it. My friend thinks the only reason my mom isn't dating her is because I have asked my mom not to, so she blames me. How exactly do I explain to her that flirting with my mom is weird and inappropriate and my mom isn't interested either? Again, maybe some kind of analogy, because just saying ""She's not into you"" doesn't work.",18Jun2019,27
91,"I don’t usually post to these but I really need some good advice and maybe help thinking up a rough draft of a resignation letter type thing!

Basically I started babysitting for this family a couple weeks ago and they can’t afford much, I knew that going into the job. I just got out fo high school and basically found the first babysitting job I could since I knew it’d be easier. 

It’s a 7:30-5 Monday through Friday deal and the kids are 9 and 11. Nothing I can’t handle. But the pay is $25 a day, $125 a week, which at that rate, is about $2.75 an hour. Minimum wage is around $12 an hour here. Since I just got out of high school, I was really hoping for more pay so I can make more money for college. I have grown attached to these kids and them to me. I don’t know how to tell them that I’m quitting. I have a week of the beginning of July and would like to have quit by then, HELP?! 

Basically: I babysit 7:30-5pm at a rate of $2.75 an hour. The family is less fortunate and I don’t know how to quit without telling them I need more money to save up for college. 

I’d like for someone to maybe help me write out a good resignation without making me sound stingy or ungrateful. Thank you!!",18Jun2019,2
92,"I'm having a hard time truly feeling happy in my two year long relationship. I'm 22F and my boyfriend is 25. We just had our first baby and I feel unhappy. I've felt this way before I even became pregnant. But now I feel it at a whole new level. Firstly, after having the baby my stomach and thighs are all marked up and gross looking. I feel so unattractive and ugly no matter what I wear. I'm constantly looking at myself and I don't even see me anymore. My boyfriend never compliments me anymore and he barely hugs or kisses me. I don't know if it's because he lost interest, or if he thinks I'm gross. We don't laugh or joke around, he doesn't seem happy with me ever. I've tried so hard for us and I feel like he hasn't. I don't want to leave because now we have a baby-I know everyone says that, but until you have a baby you'll understand on why people don't wanna leave. I don't think he loves me anymore, I'm not sure if he did anyways but now I know he doesn't. You can tell when people love someone because it shows so effortlessly. I just wish I had a guy who loved me and treated me like a gem. I see a bunch of guys post about how lucky they are to have their girlfriend, I see couples holding hands in public, I wish I had that.

95,"My dad and his ex didn’t break up on the worst terms, but I don’t think they really talk anymore. My dad was cheating on her with his current girlfriend (who I think he might be cheating on), but I don’t think she knew about that. 

I got on really well with her and I’m sad that I don’t get to see her anymore because they broke up. 

She told my dad that I could have her number but I never texted as I was really depressed at the time and was struggling getting the motivation to text my friends and didn’t think I could handle another person. I also had very low self-esteem so I felt like a very, very boring person and didn’t think I’d be able to keep up a conversation (+ was already feeling very guilty for not replying to my friends straight away). 

Anyway, I’m feeling a bit better on all of that now but I also feel guilty and weird that I’m just messaging her now so many months later. I really don’t want to have hurt her by taking so long to message her, and if I did I want to apologise but I don’t know how to go about that if she doesn’t tell me. I also don’t know if my getting in touch with her would just be really weird, hurtful and an inconvenience for her as, you know, her ex is my dad and I don’t want to hurt her. 

I’ve been wanting to message her for a long time, but that’s been holding me back. 

I also think I was still pretty awkward and shy around her (but definitely less so when we first met), so I don’t really know if she enjoyed our hanging out as much as I did. I feel like she did as she even invited me to stay at her house by myself, and she did say I could have her number, but I’m not sure. 

Info: I’m a 21 year old female (I met her when I was 19) and she’s 54. She has a daughter who doesn’t speak to her (for reasons that are not my dads ex’s fault), and my mum is pretty shit. I wouldn’t say my dad’s ex became my ‘new mum’, but she was really nice and I really liked hanging out with her. She sort of filled the hole that was missing for me of a female role model I could look up to and rely on. 

Anyway, sorry this is long. Thank you for taking the time to read it.

96,"Ok so I posted a picture of some face paint I did for my first pride parade after I came out as bisexual.

97,"   I am a 14 year old male, living in my house with 2 brothers and both my parents. I have a very severe form of a condition known as misophonia. For those who have not heard of this horrid thing, misophonia means “hatred of sound”. Specific sounds cause me to go into a fight or flight state, even though no emergency is occurring, a bit like PTSD, but worse. Now, imagine all that, but where it makes you so incredibly enraged that you can relate to some criminals on Criminal Minds. And also imagine it being so bad that you are even sometimes caused actual physical pain. 
   As I mentioned earlier, I only feel this during certain “trigger sounds”. Well, some of these sounds are the crying of my very vocal, less than two year old, baby brother, and my stubborn 5 year old brother’s whistling (which he never stops), along with general chewing, nasal congestion sounds, and a few others.
   Due to all of this, I have panic attacks, almost uncontrollable angry outbursts, anxiety, and have developed mild PTSD from this disorder which causes feelings of PTSD (it would be funny if it didn’t hurt so much), and much more on a hourly basis.
   My parents are aware of my condition, but do not believe that it hurts me this badly, even though they have tried to be relatively supportive. I tried noise canceling headphones, but that technology is not sophisticated enough to block the quick changing tones of whistles and screeches.
   Seeing as I have to live with them every day, and go to school with some people who I even have the same reaction to, simply because of their voice, I am unsure about how to cope with this. I feel like I am tortured every day of my life, and there is little I can do to change that. I occasionally get chances to visit relatives, and get away from the noise (I also generally dislike loud noise and places with it, but not nearly as severely as the specific sounds) but I can find little other escape from it, as even the walls of the house are quite thin, and you can hear almost everything from anywhere in the house.
   Some answers to questions not yet asked about my situation, but likely soon to come up:
  Yes, I do love my brothers, but I can never bear to be near them long. However, I am often asked to help take care of them, as my parents both are quite busy. This has only worsened my condition.
  No, I can not simply “calm down”. From my perspective, it would be equal to being stabbed with a dull blade, and someone nearby walking up and saying, “Just stop bleeding and being in pain!” It doesn’t work like that.
  For clarification, I don’t approve of what the villains do in Criminal Minds, it’s just that, during the trigger, I feel so much hate and so murderous that I would likely be a famous serial killer if I was born with less than my seemingly superhuman levels of patience.
   Anyways, I need some advice. What should I do? Would this fall under the classification of unintentional psychological torture (‘cause it sure feels like it)? Does anyone know of ways to handle this so I don’t get other stress induced illnesses? How should I proceed in life? Any advice is much appreciated, including any other ways to help me you can think of.
        Thank you for listening. Err, reading. Whatever.",18Jun2019,1
98,"First of all, I'm quoting addiction cause it's not really something I've seen as an addiction per se, but I suppose that's part of the problem right?

100,"I'll try to keep this short.

I'm currently one year into a new field of work (I work in the wine and spirits industry) and in my tenure so far, I've become accredited in my field by one of the biggest organizations, been given the chance to share my writing on the field  through reviews and will even be doing wine harvest later on this year in California (From NYC). All things that make me so excited for someone who had no real depth or prior knowledge about wine or spirits.

That being said, my family albeit a small one have shown me great love and joy for what my life is leading up to but my friends have not at all. I posted about all these things on social media, no likes/messages/calls/etc. When I broke up with my ex-girlfriend who I dearly loved, I got no emotional support from them. My birthday last month was more of the same though they did view my social media posts there as well.

One of my friends (one of the two friends I would consider good people) approached me and basically told me the way I distanced myself from them was wrong and that we needed to come collectively as a bunch and be better to one another. At the time, I cried and felt bad because he was right but this would never change how the others treated me and I continued to feel lonely and less happy than I could be because I couldn't share in my passion and my accomplishments with any of them besides the one exception. 

I don't have many friends and I'm unable to make friends very easily. I would share my feelings with them but I've done that with other topics and it didn't change anything in those issues so I see no difference in this. I just feel lost as I want to share my happiness with others but it seems like my friends aren't the ones to do it with and it has affected me just a little bit to the point I posted on social media though it is very generalized. If I stop speaking to them, I would literally only have the two friends... Just confused.",18Jun2019,1
101,"Now my problem is probably not the most interesting or the most urgent. But I could use a bit of advice on what to do about my moms recent actions. This may be a little long so buckle in.

Around December 2017 my mom called me into her room and told me I had to pack my stuff as I would be leaving to be with my aunt for a bit. Now we should clear this up quickly. I have heard from my mom and others that she has depression. During this time she was also not doing well mentally and for the next week I spent it living with my aunt. After the week I came back and thought all would be fine. Well at least for a while it was...

Oh we should probably get this out of the way too. Around this time I really had missed my dad. I hadn’t spoken with him for almost 2 years because we had a big fight! No physical actions just words. I really wanted to see him again so when January came around I did. This is important as he has since become my ideal parent.

Now it’s like January this year and stuff starts to get bad! My mom and I barely see each other an hour a day and our house is a disorganized mess! Our schedule was like this: I get up at 7:30 A.M and wake up my mom. I leave for school at 8:30 A.M and come back at 3:30 P.M. every day I make sure to text my mom and ask why she isn’t home. She comes back at around 4:00/4:30 and leaves an hour later to go hang out with her friends she already saw. She comes home around 11:00 P.M and we’d go to bed at 1:00 A.M. it’s basically the same for weekends but without school. 

She’d always hang out with these friends I never knew and it felt like she put them above me. The same started to happen with herself too like she was her number 1 priority with friends coming 2nd and me in 3rd. I barely saw her or knew who the people she hung out with more than me were.

She didn’t just not talk to me about her friends but herself either. I told her everything about my day well hers was just always ok. Me and my mom are also big procrastinators. For example the dishes. We wait till it’s filled up and only do SOME. It got so bad there were fruit flys in our faces 24/7. 

She also stopped work. She wasn’t fired nor did she quit. She just stopped. We were barely making enough to get from month to month.

I missed tons of school cause of this. I almost failed the grade! Thankfully I didn’t and made it through to graduation. She then told me we’d be moving which got me very excited. When it came time to pack we decided I should spend the rest of the week with my dad. I spent almost 2 weeks there. It would’ve been longer if I hadn’t convinced her for us to stay there while they finished.

Now there was no food, no furniture, no dishes and still fruit flys everywhere! This part was obviously my fault but it was still disgusting. 

This part just sucks. I had been hoping to see the movie Avengers Endgame for my birthday that year but had been spoiled of it. I’m not just a fan of the movies but I love the comics too. So the day before my birthday she told me she never got the apartment which made me think there was never one because why would we pack our stuff to move to a place we didn’t get? I would have to go live with my dad or aunt for a while. My dad told me he’d would be coming the next day. Once he arrived we went out for dinner (which his friend payed for) because it was my BIRTHDAY!! My mom changed my life on my birthday. 

Since then it’s been about a month and I am doing fine I guess. I’ve seen my mom once after it happened and haven’t spoken to her since. She won’t respond to me. She lives with her friend with no wifi but goes to the mc Donald’s down the street multiple times to use the wifi so idk. Some people have told me I shouldn’t have to deal with that but others have said I need to help her with or talk to her about her depression. Which I would if she’d respond. Maybe I did something wrong? I have never been on this situation before so I can’t relate. Should I stay out of the way? I know this was long but please help me out? What do I do?",18Jun2019,1

104,"So, a little background. I have social anxiety and mental health issues. I been doing better than before now, but still struggling with them.  Overthinking everything is part of it, unfortunately...

I am in a business that is sales/marketing related, which requires social skills and making connections with people. It is my passion, and in certain aspects of it, I am great at it (according to multiple supervisors). What I am lacking right now, is confidence, and social skills.  

Part of my job is meeting with potential clients, and to make friends with them so that we can developing a lasting working relationship, or even friendship with them.  

I don't want to give too much details, but please bear with me that this next part makes sense. 

I have started at a new organization, which itself is in a new area and at the beginning stage of building an operation, and we have quotas of how many potential clients we have to meet each week.  The quota increases as our network grows and our capacity grows. 

So, both being excited to do what I love and wanting to impress, I doubled the meetings I am supposed to have. 

&amp;#x200B;

And here, cue the review: 

\----My supervisor said he knew I work very hard and heard great things about me, but he also heard things that he needs to talk to me about. 

\----The quantity of my meetings is good, but the quality is not good. I am advised to slow down so I can have better quality meetings that develop deeper connections and a more lasting relationship. 

\----I need to follow up with meetings more often, so they don't go to waste. 

\----Because I have so many meetings, I seem to be rushing through the meeting and presentation as though I am in a hurry. This, plus my tendency to interrupt people (bad trait from family I been working on) and my tendency to multitask (seem distracted) makes me seem unprofessional.  

\----A necessary aspect of the meetings is to develop connections and friendships, with the quotas come next. I am not doing the first part. 

\----He said his organization has been attracting already talented people because they don't have time to train and develop people as much. He knew I am talented so he wants to help me. 

\----He hopes he sees improvements in the coming weeks.

Last two points: does it mean, if you don't improve and catch up in a couple weeks you are (in danger of being) fired?

105,"I was walking my dogs earlier about a block from my house and heard a screen door swing closed off in the distance from a house behind me. I thought nothing of it until about a minute later I heard quick moving foot steps coming up behind me. I turned and saw a woman in her mid-twenties running barefoot down the road towards me, looking somewhat disheveled, and wearing a night gown. This was around 7 pm, and the sun was still out. I stood my ground as she ran towards me staring right at me, not knowing what to expect, and just as she got close enough that I thought I might have to defend myself she stopped. After a brief awkward pause she asked if she could walk with me. I asked why, and got nothing but nonsense in response. I can't for the life of me remember what she said, but it was something like, ""they are basked in delirium."" I immediately thought drugs or mental illness. I said I don't understand and she just repeated herself, so I said I still don't understand but would like to walk on on my own, and she said ""OK."" 

&amp;#x200B;

So I walked about 20 yards and she was still just standing there, staring at me, looking very confused. At that point I thought she may really need help, so I asked if she needed help, or if there was someone I could call. She said ""yes, do you have a phone?"" Not wanting to give her my phone I said I could call 911, and asked if she needed medical attention. She asked if I was a paramedic and I said no, but 911 can send one. She said ""yes, call them."" I then thought back to several stories I've seen where folks call 911 on the mentally ill and the cops show up and end up shooting someone (in retrospect, a totally stupid reason not to call) so I asked if she was sure she needed 911, or if she needed to call a friend or family member, or go to a hospital. She then said, ""I need someone to help me understand reality."" So I asked again, who would you like me to call, and she just turned and started walking the opposite direction of where she'd come from and never looked back. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided not to follow her and walked back past the house where I thought she came from and noticed three cars in the driveway, making me think someone was there, and that if she had mental issues someone would have been looking for her, but no one was in sight. I thought about going after her to make sure I sorted the situation out, but thought I really don't want to put myself in the midst of a cluster fuck where I can't do any good, so I just headed back home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm wondering if I should call the police, or some other resource I'm unaware of, but would guess that they won't be able to do anything, especially considering I didn't actually see where she came from. The screen door I heard could have been coincidence, and even if they went to the house I *think* she came from, they can't just invite themselves in. I'm also thinking I should go knock on the door of that house and ask about it, but don't want to get involved with a bunch of meth heads or something, but am also kind of concerned I may have missed a chance to help someone who really needed it.  Or, maybe it was best to have left it alone?",18Jun2019,1

111,"I’m from the Seattle area, homes here are incredibly over priced. I make $60k a year with a government job and great beni’s, the other half makes about $40k and same benefits, we have a 3 year old daughter. 

I’m considering a move to the east side, Spokane area, homes are much more affordable but pay is less. We visited this past weekend and liked the area very much. My equivalent job over there (same benefits) starts at about $20k less a year than what I make now. Her position starts about $5-10k less.  Combined income now ~$100k with houses $300k+, or move to $70k combined income with houses in the $200k range.

I left that job for the specific purpose of getting out of those long hours. I joined a company that is commonly listed in the Fortune 500 list. While everyone else in my company works 9 to 6, My direct boss feels that it is appropriate to call me at 8 PM or even 11 PM for non-emergency situations. He also feels like he can call me on the weekends. Our assistant has had to straight up tell him that she does not work on weekends. She however, is an hourly employee, while I am a salaried employee.

So far nothing that he has called me for after work hours was actually urgent and needed to be Done before the next workday. When I try to not respond to him for the things that I did not think were particularly urgent, he told me that he does not want me to be using my own discretion. I found this to be particularly in Infantilizing. Because the job I have now is technically a step down from where I was a year before. I also don’t feel like he would have told a man to not use his sense of discretion.

123,"- Throw away account -

I (M24) currently flying back to my hometown on business for almost 2 weeks. Ive known this girl since middle school, we met on the bus and she lived (still lives) about 2 miles from the house I grew up in. I had a short repationship in highschool and we had a few hookups in college and after. I havent seen her in a year and a half but ive recently been thinking about her a lot, and to be honest ive never stopped thinking about her since highschool. There is a lot of history.. Maybe its a first love kind of thing... i dont really know but im feeling anxoius and getting butter flies typing this out and thinking about it. Its also been a decent time since ive been in a relationship so maybe thats causing these feelings as well. 

I feel like we have a connection and always had one but everytime we get close, I feel like i either ruin it or she fades interest after showing that she does have feelings for me.. Once i get the hint of this i get angry, depressed and every feeling you could imagine with a person you think you love. My anger causes me to want to cut things off and my ego prevents me from telling her how i feel once i feel like she has chosen a different guy to be with. or at least thats how it feels but idk if there has been concrete closure. So it usually ends with us just not talking for months until the yearly happy birthday texts she sends me.

to wrap things up, i moved across the country to Denver a few years back (for work and slightly because of her) while she still lives in CT but she recently graduated college. i have a lot of great things going for me atm compared to highschool and college, maybe that will help? I dont really know what i expect to happen and i doubt i would convince her to drop everything and start a life with me in Denver (dreaming...). she could even currently be in a relationship, I have no idea. But i need advice on if i should text her, tell her how i really feel and see where that goes, or drop the whole thing and keep trying to move on like i have since highschool?

please provide your opinion. im currently waiting for my connecting flight so i might be slow to respond but feel free to ask questions.

TL:DR - Questioning whether I should text the girl I've known and haven't been able to stop thinking since middle school or move on with my life and accept it's never going to happen.",18Jun2019,1
124,"So recently my parked car was hit while I was working. My insurance company said I needed to pay my $1000 deductible and they will pay the difference for damages and mailed me a $300 check. I could not fix anything with $300 so I called the insurance company of the truck that hit me (didn’t know I could go thru them in the first place) and the guy was super helpful and immediately just told me he’d take it upon himself to fix the car bc it’d be quicker than going thru my insurance. So fast forward to now, my car is fixed at no cost to myself but now I have a $300 check made out to myself and the bank i am paying my car off to. Can I cash this check?

134,"So I'm nearing the end of my pregnancy (31 weeks), and I have had problems with my doctors. It took me 3 different doctors to find a general ob that I liked, she was great for that once a year visit. But being pregnant I've had to see all the doctors in the office and I've had a few general problems on communication &amp; a few other things. Now they're telling me to schedule a viewing for the hospital they practice at. Problem is their office is 10 min away from my home, their hospital however is 40min. At midnight. With no traffic. Its in the middle of the city &amp; not the best area. Now, I have a great hospital just 15-20 min down the road from me that accepts my insurance, it's private, &amp; I've heard from several friends that it's a great place for birthing. 

I brought it up with one of my doctors when they asked if I'd looked at their hospital schedule that ""yeah I was going to look at that but if there is a chance I may panic &amp; just go to the closer hospital, wanna make sure I get the good drugs before it's too late since knowing my genes this child will want to come during 5pm traffic haha"" 

Automatically the doctor told me how bad of an idea that is and how I shouldn't do it because the hospital won't know my procedures &amp; problems. My procedures are preferably c section due to the baby being big &amp; my problems are high blood pressure in a doctor's office (normal at home or during the day). I figure they're easy things to tell a hospital. 

Am I being weird or crazy for kinda wanting to just go to the closer hospital? My father prefers the closer one too since he'd be the one to drive me and it's easier for the father of the child to get to. I figure the doctors just want their cut of the profits after dealing with me for 9 months, that's why they want me at their hospital but am I completely wrong?

135,"I know this topic might come up a lot (I just joined this community, and this is actually my first post) but I would like some insight to my personal experience. 

So I have never been with a girl. The thought of it never disturbed or disgusted me, it was overwhelming. I never knew what that meant to me until now. I've always been too scared to talk to or touch other girls even though I've had chances. I had always assumed that I was bisexual who just happened to like guys more, but to be fair, I don't really think I truly liked any of the guys I've been with. 

All, even the super sweet ones, made me wince on the inside. I never knew why. I thought maybe it was trust issues but it's been so long since my last bad relationship and I'm confident that I can't keep using that as an excuse. I could never fully connect with guys. Sex has always been a great struggle. I can't come unless I close my eyes or look away and think of a scenario outside of the room. I've been with 7 sexual partners, all guys, and I always pretend I'm into it and I never am.

I think coming to terms with the fact I like girls has been so terrifying is because my whole life, I'd set myself up in a fantasy-esque manner that I will find the one who I will connect my entire heart and soul with - and I always pictured it as a man. That's what movies and TV shows have always told me. Ironically, I have found myself watching modern movies where the side character is gay (either woman or man) and I root for them more than anyone else in the room with me. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE seeing gay people come together despite probable judgement and backlash, haha.

What opened me up to this sudden realization is when one of my coworkers had told me she was bisexual. We were hired literally side by side together when we first met. And I blurted out, ""Oh, well just date me!"" In a jokingly tone. But I thought about it. 

And I not only realized I was never into the guys I dated. But there were some girlfriends I had been secretly really into but never even gave the idea the light of day. I might like girls period. 

Please give me your advice of how to approach this. If you have experience of finding out you were gay MUCH later in life, let me know and tell me your experience if you feel comfortable. I feel like a phony because I never seriously considered it until now.",18Jun2019,1
136,"Hello All, 

I currently had to move into a new place for my partner's job. Her job placement requires us to live on-site for a plethora of reasons. While we are very thankful for such a sweet gig (minimal living expenses, decent location, rather large square footage, etc.) the internet is horrendous. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am fairly tech literate and can fix most issues as they pertain to connectivity however, our new location requires us to use the internet provided on site and it is horrendous. To give some context, we are not the only ones to have these issues and nor are we the only people to live on site as it is a residence. On a good day (mid afternoon, early mornings) I can get a maximum of 5 mb/s download and upload of around 7 mb/s, typically however typically I can get between 2 mb/s download and 5 mb/s upload. This is the speed directly from the router with a wired connection. We are supposed to recieve 30 mb/s download and 50 mb/s upload. 

We have aired our grievances (all of those who work and live on site) to our IST team about this issue \[context we cannot add additional routers nor any other bridging hardware per our IST regulations\] numerous times to no avail. They will conduct ""fixes"" but no serious hardware updates nor wiring to help disperse the WIFI to other areas of the house (we have serious deadspots for cell reception and other connections). It has gotten quite frustrating as many of us pursue other items outside of our work lives (on-line courses, streaming, emails, etc) with very shoddy internet. For context I tried to watch a 7 minute 280p video on Youtube today while home for a course and it was a nightmare of buffering and crashing. These issues now affect work-life as we cannot access various web related apps, emails, documents, etc. as the internet is either unreliable or very slow (and I grew up on dial up in rural country). Maybe this is more of a first world problem but regardless it is frustrating.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you recommend we do in this situation as we are very limited with what we can do?

Thanks in advance!",18Jun2019,1

151,"hi, me again! i recently discovered this subreddit exists and it seems everyone on reddit is about 10x more helpful than my friends and family, lol. anywho, i’ve been single for a looooong time. i’ve actually never had a boyfriend; sometimes i feel like something is wrong with me. i’ve had things and flings before, so that is not a problem, but i’ve been ghosted at least 7-8 times (makes me think something’s wrong with me but that’s a different story). nonetheless, i’m mostly content within myself. i’m a waitress and a college student, i have friends who i love dearly, and family right down the road. as you can see, i’m missing one thing, and that’s romance. a connection with someone that no friend or family member could provide for me. i’m doing better now than ever, but i’m still trying to figure out how to live being single. i was bullied a lot as a child by people claiming to be my friends who pointed out my flaws every day for about 8 years, which, really destroyed my self-esteem, so validation is never unwelcome here, lololol. i’m pretty outgoing; i’m generally a kind and loving person, the type of person who wants to spread their love as much as possible. naturally, i want someone to share that love with! like i said, i’m content with myself and my life where i am right now, but the best way i can describe it is being bored. i want a new challenge, learning to accept myself and find myself within a relationship since that particular situation has not yet been presented to me, so in a sense, i want to solve that puzzle. i’m trying to date and meet new people, at this point i’m just ready to commit to one person. clearly i haven’t found that person yet. how can i be content with myself while i wait for someone to come along? it might be at least until the fall until i’m exposed to a large amount of new people when i go back to school. i just want to have fun and date someone and do cute things.",18Jun2019,1

I'm a 24F and I'm ready to leave my boyfriend 27M. I need too. We've been together for 3.5 years. 

He has always been an alcoholic and I made excuses at first because he was my first serious relationship, the first to ever say they love me. It's gotten worse, his drinking. He went to rehab for a month and came home on May 15th and he started again tonight and I have HAD IT I WANT TO LEAVE. 

I don't know how though, I'm scared because he gets angry easy and I have three cats and I'm VERY afraid of him doing something to them or taking one of them out of spite to me... All three are in MY NAME though. The lease is only in my name too so I know I can call the police if he won't leave or gets violent, right? He has thrown things and smashed walls before so I'm afraid of making him too angry if alone.

I'm so scared. I don't know what to do. I want to do it tomorrow when I get home from work. I'm going to open a new bank account in my name first? Is that a good idea? We have a joint one right now and I get a paycheck on Friday....

155,"My friend is a narcissist. The reason we fought was because he wanted to argue with me at his girlfriend’s house about some nonsense.

I’m pissed they are just telling us because I haven’t had a chance to talk about it with them, he hasn’t spoke to me about any details, i don’t know if getting married will be the best thing for them right now.

plan: i will make a word document with a couple of unrelated questions and then at the end will be a space asking for her phone number with a heart at the end so she doesn't get the wrong idea if she does then I will have my phone out and ready with the contact already made to get it.  After that I will chat a little and ask where she would like to go and pick her up via bike since i think she lives nearby me and has one.

158,"So I often see guys on reddit my age or older stressing out about going bald which I’ve never really understood. Mainly because I actually want to go bald. 

I’ve never told anyone in my life about this, and even currently have a man bun. However, from a young age I’ve always liked the bald look, but mostly I want to know what a bald head feels like. I want to feel the wind, rain and sun on my scalp. The feeling of rubbing my head and it being frictionless or the feeling of a soft pillow on my bare noggin. 

The reason I don’t go bald is because I’m scared about the reactions from friends and family. It would be really odd for me to just go bald one day. My family would be really confused. Also I have some social anxiety, so arriving to college one day with no hair seems utterly terrifying. 

I guess I’m asking for advice on what I should do. I don’t want to just cut my hair shorter, as I feel I’ll only like the feeling of a totally smooth head... but at the same time I feel like that’s kind of socially unacceptable when you naturally gave heir and are only 20 years of age.",18Jun2019,1

160,"Throwaway account because I'm paranoid

Today I found out my 75 year old grandma adopted an 8 week old kitten behind our family's back. The problem? My grandma is starting to lose her memory, she can't bend over to scoop the litter box, she detests taking animals to the vet, and she's also tried to feed my own cat things like chocolate in the past without seeing the problem with it. Another reason I'm concerned is because her house is sort of messy and I fear a tiny kitten could easily get lost, and she might not hear him cry for help.

I love my grandma and I want her to have a companion, but a baby animal who doesn't have a voice terrifies the living hell out of me. I'm going to see if she'll visit with a dog at a shelter, which would be better because if something happened she would hear him/her barking. It would also be a lot easier to hire a dog walker rather than a cat assistant as she doesn't like people in her home.

Also, unless someone can really convince me otherwise, I'm planning on either taking the kitten and keeping the him at my house or putting him up for adoption so he'll find a home with other people who can really dedicate themselves to him. It's hard to see the latter happening as I have a soft spot for cats and I'd hate to put him back in a shelter. I know this will crush my grandma, and she might not talk to me again if I do this but I cannot live with myself if something happens to this poor baby.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance",18Jun2019,12
161,"He (22M) was my first and only. I (F22) was his first but he was a player in high school but once high school ended we started to date for about 2 years. I was heavily involved with his family. I would’ve done any/everything for him but he was focused on friends and partying. Eventually he met someone who was pretty and rich (at 20 years old). I was a mess when he did but we still talked often on the phone. He’d call me when no one was around for advice and just someone to talk to in general. We were best friends and I can tell he missed having me as his friend around. A few months in she was pregnant and kept it as a tactic for him to not leave her. I slept with him during and even after the pregnancy up to now because I can’t let go of him. It’s been 2 years now and still in my heart I want to believe we were supposed to be but I also feel like I’m an awful person because he has a child now with this person and he certainly wouldn’t leave her for me because his life is perfect.

163,"**TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM, I'M SO SORRY FOR RAMBLING I'M VERY STRESSED LOL**

\------------------------------------------------------------

I've talked to friends, family, girlfriend, etc., and I'm very conflicted, so I thought I’d ask some unbiased strangers on the Internet.

**Some background info:**

**&gt;18 years old**

**&gt;First job**

**&gt;College student working over summer; when I go back in the fall, I could transfer to a store there and pick up 1-2 shifts a week if I ever want some extra spending money, which is a small thing holding me back a little**

**&gt;I know not every job is going to be perfect and I'm very willing to put up with a lot of BS, especially as a VERY shy individual who lets people walk all over them often**

This might be sort of a long read but I'll put a TL;DR, and I really appreciate any advice y'all might have.

\------------------------------------------------------------

So.

I've been working at \[unnamed non-sit-down restaurant that stays open pretty late\] as a driver, for about a month and a half now. Told them I’m basically free any time, but I assumed they wouldn't actually have me working almost every day. Had no idea how many hours I should be working (what with this being my first job), assumed I'd be working maybe 25/wk, maaaybe 30. I was wrong. I say all this because I want y'all to know I'm very aware I've put myself in this situation and that I’m responsible for doing the job I signed up for.

I got home from college in the first week of May, and a week later I had the job, so I had like 6 days to relax and put off unpacking a little, assuming I'd have the time to do it in the coming weeks whenever I wasn’t working (big mistake, buddy; that shit remains unpacked all the way in the middle of June). The first week I clocked 40 hours. We're open til 12:30am Su-Th, 1:30am Fr/Sa. I learned how to close and got home around 2:30 or 3 every time I closed. This went on for 2 weeks and I assumed it was just to get me accustomed, to just immerse me in how things worked, then they'd back off the hours a bit. Plus, I figured once I was in the swing of things, I could start out-duties early and we’d be able to leave earlier when I closed. This has only semi-worked.

Week 3 hit and I was still working a ton. I talked to one of my three managers, the one who works on the schedule. Let's call him Dave b/c I obviously don't wanna use his real name. I basically just said I was getting kinda burnt out and wanna be able to see my family and other people (spoiler alert: first time I saw friends all summer was TWO DAYS AGO). I was as nice as I could be and I just crossed my fingers. Week 4 came and he had forgotten so I spoke with another manager who Ive gotten pretty close with and feel super comfortable talking to (we’ll say Amy for this post's purposes). She nudged him a little and reminded him, and the next day he apologized and got on it. It wasn't a huge deal, I said it was all good, and week 5 I only worked 4 days and only 2 of them were closing. I made sure to text ""Dave"" to thank him and let him know how much I appreciated it, but by week 7 Im back to 5 days a week. The general manager (let's call him Mark) makes the final schedule so I know ""Dave"" spoke with him about me working less. Let's talk about ""Mark"" for a second; I promise it’s relevant.

He's the type of boss that sees only what employees do wrong, or at least he rarely comments on the positive if he does notice it. I'm sure he's a perfectly nice dude outside of work, but after managing this place for like 15 years he's got his method and I don't want to mess with that, he's clearly doing something right as it's a very successful store in the franchise. However, it seems like he really just doesn't like me and it feels like I'm one of the only ones he ever really says anything to. At first it felt like he's just doing it because I’m new and he wants to make sure I’m cut out for the job or some shit, but he's often condescending and makes his thoughts very unclear and treats me like a dumbass and talks to me like a 5 year old if I can't immediately read his thoughts (I can provide examples in the comments). He definitely doesn’t treat the other two new hires like that. I know I have to deal with not-so-good bosses in life, but at the same time it feels pretty shitty to be talked to like that when Im a fairly efficient employee (I’ve been listed as one of the top 5 drivers just about every week out of the like 15-20 drivers). I hope this doesn’t come off as me being like, “I’m a great worker and I know everything, I’m better than you, blah blah blah, but every single one of the three managers has told me I’ve been doing a great job, above what most of the other drivers do, and not to toot my own horn, but that makes me feel really proud of myself and the work I put in there. So it bothers me a lot that I’m targeted when the other two new drivers don’t get talked to like that, and rarely close or do the same amount of work. Sorry, he just pisses me off a little sometimes ahah.

Anyway, I’m back to 5 days this week and I’m pretty sure I'd be working 6 if I didnt request Fri/Sat off because I'll be out of town.

It feels like there have been a lot of signs that this just isn't right for me.

\&gt;I start around 5pm most days, and when I close I usually don’t fall asleep until about 4am, so it's a vicious cycle of waking up at noon, leaving at 4:30pm, going to bed at 4am, and repeating. It’s very hard for me, an already depressed, anxious individual, to get anything done in those 4-5 hours besides just wait to work, because my battery just needs to recharge for the little amount of time I’m actually home. My mental health has suffered because I can't spend quality time with anyone but myself in a car for 8 and a half hours.

\&gt;I got a flat tire not even a week in for no reason, I was on a relatively newly-paved road, just dumb luck running over a nail or glass or something.

\&gt;Ive injured my back and hands more times than I can count at this point, doing dishes or sweeping then mopping the entire store, when I close. And sitting in a car for 3/4 of my shifts doesn't help my body either.

\&gt;I eat like shit because it's either pizza in the store (it’s a pizza place; I guess it’s not too much to say that haha, it could only be a handful of things if I’m a driver lol), or McDonalds/Taco Bell (because those’re the only quick fast food places close to the delivery routes) because I cant stop for more than a few minutes during a run if I need to eat, so I haven’t lost any of the weight I gained this year which takes a toll mentally as well.

\&gt;Not to mention Ive got a 2007 car that gets barely 15mi/gal, so its really just unnecessary wear-and-tear on my car.

And just so many other little things every now and then that make me feel like somebody's trying to tell me something (that I just need to move on from this job).

I've talked to my parents and sister, as well as my girlfriend and a few friends, and there have been many, MANY times when I was ready to just quit, and when those people were 100% behind my decision. I’ve considered leaving for a delivery and just not coming back many times (however I know that is very uncool and I would never actually do that; I intend to give them the usual two-weeks if I do quit).

I'm not gonna lie, for an 18 year old getting a first job, I make bank and I know I’m very fortunate to have a job that pays this well (w/ tips and such). But I can find another job if I absolutely need to. I've saved most of the money I've made and I can make it last, because I’m very fortunate to have parents that can support me financially if I’m not working (I’ve talked with them about it and they’re 100% understanding and willing to do so).

Don't get me wrong; 95% of the people I work with are the BEST. I've formed a lot of great work-friendships and I'd definitely stop in to say hey every now and then because they're awesome people, and the customers I deliver to are rarely rude.

\------------------------------------------------------------

I think Im understanding why 2 people had just left when I was hired, and two more before them lmao.

**TL;DR: Working crazy hours driving pizzas at expense of mental, physical, and car health, with no end in sight. I was prepared for this summer to finally be the time where I take care of my mental and physical health for the firsr time but now my life's basically become work and sleep. Worried quitting will make me look like just some lazy good-for-nothing teenager, and people's view of me is important to me.**

**Had to condense this a lot so if you have any questions please don’t hesitate to ask, I can go into more detail in the comments. :)**

I just find it weird that he's regularly interested in girls who are 18/19 and will ask them out. I know they're of age but they're also younger and i don't see how they're even on the same wavelength. He's a pretty smart guy and has had some interesting life experiences so I just don't see what him and a teenager could relate to. Also like I said he's not looking for anything serious, and it seems like it would be easy to lead a younger girl on or give them a false idea of commitment or seriousness when that's not what he's looking for.

167,"I had a best friend for a few years. We were pretty close and she was my only friend at one point. Recently, we got into a argument which ended our friendship. I won’t go too much into it but basically she was hella emotionally abusive, gaslighted me, ruined opportunities for me, constantly pressured me into partying with her, and used me a lot. The fight was over a stupid boy in which I told her “don’t get involved with him cause he’ll hurt you” she told me I was being controlling and proceeded to attack every personal bit of me she knew, including my traumas and my difficulties opening up to people (I was getting better with this but then she called me “emotionally exhausting and unforgivable”, this obviously made me close up and keep things to myself again)  

She’s the type of person who doesn’t give a shit about me so even when I told her straight “you hurt me” she just kept denying it. I know she doesn’t give a shit about me and she’s having a good time on her own and being happy while I’m depressed and anxious because of this situation. So I just want to know how the fuck do I just forget it? Drop hard feelings, stop thinking about her and the situation, and everything. I’ve always been super caring so when this kind of shit happens it really cuts me deep and I’m tired of being like this. 

So just what do I do? How do I stop the pain and the overthinking relating to her? I have to see her in a week or two because of my boyfriend’s grad party and I’ll have to see her in class and shit so wtf do I do?",18Jun2019,0

171,"Rn i have a handful of summer projects that i want to do, such as getting into shape and fixing my overall mental state. But I recently decided to take an online summer school course. I thought it was going to be relatively easy but I have come across info that says the opposite.

I went to my guidence counselor today 100% sure that I was going to do it. He didnt give me much information about what it entailed but I thought I had time to research. Then he told me I had to sign up by the end of today then he would sign off tommorow.

I did my research and found very little on the course but I thought it fine. I have an 87 average I should be fine. So I did the first online sign up. The piece of information that stuck with me from my research was ""one day missed is equivalent to a week of school"" that scared me because due to a lifeguarding course (3 12hr days) and a trip to Boston that would take out 7 days.

I think I can do it but to what cost? My mental health will probably suffer. I'm so tired of school rn. I'm nervous about what my parents say when I tell them I want to quit.

I had found out that K had never been drunk. So for her first time I organized a small group and we got some alcohol. K and I ended up getting extremely drunk when the next thing I know we are hooking up. The rest of the night she was obsessed with me and my friends had to stop her from talking to me.

It was an awkward conversation in the morning but we agreed we had a good time, no regrets. We just decided to act like nothing never happened. I was feeling great (First kiss, big confidence boost). 

Just a few days ago we went up to my cottage for a weekend where we spent most of the time drunk or high. Everytime we were intoxicated we flirted with eachother but as soon as we were sober I lose my confidence and it was like nothing happened.

Life right now and I don’t know if I should tell them everything about me or look for other people who may provide me the support I need. I think I’m a mature guy so I would put in just as much as I receive out of any relationship but I think I’m putting way more into these ties than these guys. So one of them didn’t have the greatest life and hasn’t had close friends for twenty years of his life. For a good semesters worth of time I’ve given him advice and forced him into the gym a couple of times. He says he feels better when I’m buy him but I know that he goes to his roomate all the time about how I attack him and belittle his way of thinking when I give him advice. Tbh I honestly believe that this is just a mechanism he uses to validate his shortcomings without having to accept that he has to change his entire way for thinking before he can make positive changes in his life. I think he needs to change and I can understand it can be difficult but why not just come to me with grievances. He also acts dumb when I confront him about only to admit what he did ten minutes after eight pushing. This exact scenario played out maybe three or four times. This guys roomate is also someone I’m rooming with next year. He’s probably the best of the three as he is willing to listen to reason but he is a bit arrogant. We argue a lot, sometimes it’s just debates like normal people which I have fun in but sometimes he brings up things that really hurt m. This one time he was talking about how he thought that one of the RAs thought I was a weirdo. He doesn’t really know the RA that well and has never seen me and him interact. He kept pushing this even though I was bringing up how we have a nice relationship but I just hurt that he kept on. The base of this example is that he says a lot of stuff with absolutely no evidence  that really hurt me and lower my self esteem without thinking about it.  The other thing I have with this guy is that he keeps cancelling plans even though I may have confirmed them an hour before we were set to leave. This is just a clear toxic trait and his happens on a lot of occasions. I don’t have many people on my life that care for me so it means a lot when someone agrees to spend time with me. I got my hopes up and I was crushed. I talked to him about this and it seemed like he understand my frustration but that didn’t stop him from repeating this over and over again. The last guy I’m rooming with has a few things about him. He is just plain unempathetic. One time we were talking about applying for this job. I had never applied for a job and I was really nervous and I asked him to go with me and we agreed on a date to go get the application. I was already at the pharmacy one day so I decided to pick it up. I immediately let him know and he tells me that he applied a week earlier and he ended up getting the job. He later explains how he thought he did nothing wrong cuz he deserved it more than I did. He said he was sorry for not telling me but he wasn’t sorry for applying wtf!? Anyway that’s one thing. Another thing is I had a crush on this girl and he makes fun of it a lot. One time he was making jokes about how a bunch of people have her nudes and stuff and i started yelling “HEY SHUT UP PLEASE DONT MAKE THOSE KINDS IF JOKES” and he just kept going and kept asking to finish. I had to beg and scream for him to stop before I lost my shit. On April fools he thought it would be funny to tell me that she was pregnant with some guy! I mean is that really what a friend does!? He didn’t even just straight up tell me. He tried to say it with a joke!!!!! 

I just think these guys are really toxic and I don’t want to think I’m a narcissist and superior to them but I really don’t think I deserve this. Should I try to find new friends?",18Jun2019,1

176,"For some context, I’m 17(Male/Straight)

Recently I’ve been talking/texting a girl I’ve met online for a few days now, I set up the pre-plans for a date, and now I feel like backing off. I’ve done this too someone else too, but I feel I may have tricked myself with the notion that “I don’t have enough time to start a relationship” and that she was going away for a few months this summer. Honestly, they both were good looking girls that seemed to be interesting besides the looks, but I don’t know why I backed off. Too much porn? Too much hentai? Am I just being lazy? Have I hooked up with too many people to the point where I only crave a sexual relationship and not one of true connection? Even while I was texting her, I was thinking about hooking up with other women before I ‘started’ the relationship in order to get ‘one last go’, but If I’m feeling that, then do I really like her enough to warrant a possible relationship?

Maybe I’m going about relationships wrong? Should I just wait until I find someone irl that just clicks the moment I talk her?

178,"I need help.

My husband and I have been together for about 14 years. No kids, 3 dogs. He's worked at the same retail chain store for almost 20 years. He's turning 39 in about a month. He's been complaining about heel/foot pain that we thought was due to psoriatic arthritis (he got a blood test done and whatever inflammation level was within the normal range so it's not that) but now he thinks it might be planter fasciitis. He's been wearing compression socks to sleep and stretching and icing but it's still hurting him.

He's just started a 3 month stretch of graveyards at work. Last night was his first night and he's terrible at sleeping. We have an older dog with a degenerative disease that is taking a lot of energy and time that we're going to have to put to sleep soon.

So today he slept until about 5pm after coming home at 7am. I took care of the dogs and did a few chores since I had the day off today. We went to Costco, bought some stuff, all in all a pretty normal day. 

He went to go take a shower. I was playing some switch game when he gets out of the shower, gets dressed and comes downstairs to make his lunch. I wander over to see what's going in and see that he grabbed an applesauce. I joked and said something along the lines of ""hey that's my applesauce"" so he looks at me and throws it back in the fridge. I tell him I'm joking but he just goes to grab some chips. So me being me I then say ""oh those are my chips too"" so he pretends to put them back.

He then looks at me and bursts into tears (I can count on my hands how many times I've seen him cry) and says he's so fucking miserable. I immediately get super concerned because until this point I thought we were just playing around. I ask what's wrong and he says that he's miserable and so tired. I'm crying at this point and I ask what in particular is making him miserable. I tell him to call into work tonight but he says he can't because there's too much work to do. I ask if it's just work and he said it's everything. He said it's the house (it's not disgusting but it's not super clean either and we have been talking about selling after Zoey gets put to sleep), his job and he's just tired. 

He cried for a little then pulled himself together and gave me a hug and started putting the rest of his lunch together. I reiterated that he should stay home or fucking quit if it will make him happy but he said no. 

I don't know what to do. I want him to be happy. I don't know if it's the foot pain, the hating of his job, the fact that we have to put our dog down soon, the fact that he doesn't sleep well and is always tired or if it's something else (depression?) but I don't know how to help him or what to do to make him happy. Has anyone else been in this situation and how did you handle it? 
 
We didn't have time for an in-depth talk since he went to work right after but towards the end of the conversation we were both joking around a little. I'm scared and I don't know how to handle this.  What should I do to help him?",18Jun2019,1047

182,"I really need help figuring out how to manage   
For reference, I would say the three of us have common family conflict issues. Feelings are not discussed nor welcomed in my house, and this is how it has been for a long time. One of the worst things that happened is probably the time where my sister found one of my personal journals clearly hidden behind my clothing drawer and immediately went and exposed it to my mom. Both of them were (understandably) scared because I had written that I felt suicidal and that I wanted plastic surgery. I was made when my mother confronted me and I had told her that the things I wrote no long applied because they were written around a year before it was found. I thought my mom approaching me about was as far as it would go, but the next day/week ( I don't remember) in therapy I found out my mom had drove all the way to my therapists office to let her know about what she found and what should be done about it. My therapist handled things vert well and let my mom know that there were ways to go about treating suicidal ideation and that this was still a violation of privacy. And guys, I believe deep down that this was an invasion of privacy because the note was clearly hidden and I did not mean for it to be read, but my family's response to this was ""well if you didn't want anyone to read it you should've been more careful"".   
At this point, my therapist tells me about their little visit and tells me that I need to verbalize when things are inappropriate, even if I am dealing with extremely stubborn and narcissistic people who refuse to acknowledge the constant wrongdoings. This made me feel like shit, because I knew that now these two toxic people had a piece of me that I did not want to share with anyone. I knew that this information would be used against me in the future. I cursed them and I sincerely wish that my writing would be erased from their heads. 

  
Some time passes, and this slowly subsides. I begin to sort of ""mentally"" forgive both of them. About a month goes by as I am chatting with my mom about something, I ask to see her phone. This entire ""discovery"" of pictures taken of over 5 of my journals was very bizarre and coincidental, but had truly only asked to look for a picture that was taken of me. My heart just starts racing really fast as I see snapshots of shit from my journals and some loose paper I typed up and printed to bring into therapy with some really personal stuff. I quickly permanently delete as much as I can and as I am sitting there pretending to be looking for the picture, my mom stares at me and starts asking for her phone. I guess she noticed what was happening. This all took place after she was clearly told by literally everyone that it was invasion of privacy to go through this clearly private shit. The fact that she took pictures was even fucking worse. Now she has even more fragments and parts of me that were genuinely not meant to be shared by anyone and I know she will use it against me. She already has. I still to this day don't know whether she sent the shit to my sister who has always been completely intolerant, insensitive, abusive and violent. My mom has also been psychically abusive to me in the past and I personally feel like this is a huge contributor to my mental health and why I have certain conflicts and feelings as an emerging adult (im 18). My mom had also been diagnosed with cancer around 3 months ago and I remember writing about how I felt in the moment, mentioning my feelings and everything else. I remember writing about pity and how it was hard to come around. I wrote down very intimate and profound shit that I was feeling in the MOMENT. Now, I strongly feel like my mom just fucking sent it to my sister without ever thinking for a second that she was spreading completely private information around and now my sister likes to throw little comments around that resemble the shit I wrote in my journals. She will say shit like ""I can't handle the situation"" in a mocking voice, which is something I recall writing in one of my journals. I heard her say that earlier today and it had made me feel so terrible and shaky. I am not confrontational and It takes a fuck ton of will power to tell people off but I just don't know how to deal with shit like this anymore. I am still in therapy and being constantly reminded to validate myself is only mildly helpful because I can't even manage to do that properly yet. She has a fucking degree in psychology too. Someone who studied the human brain and how it works continues to mock and invalidate the feelings of others. There is so much more I want to tell but I really don't have anyone and I wish my worries were tended to quicker than an hour every week. I really want someone to talk to.",18Jun2019,2

189,Hey everyone! I’m 20 years old and I’ve kinda had a problem my whole life. My parents have been divorced since I was 6. It never really bothered me much or maybe it has subconsciously. I’ve always lived with my mom but me and my dad have a good relationship. We are more like friends I can talk to him about most things and joke around with him. However I think from the time of 15/16 I just have not got along with my mom and it’s not that she’s a bad person or is abusive I just find myself getting really annoyed with her. My mom is 53 works a lot to support us and is always there for me but I’ve never felt that mother daughter connection that I see others have. We don’t really talk much or go out together because she’s always tired. My mom loves to complain about a lot things which is annoying like things in the house being out of place (she’s a clean freak) or pains in her body but she refuses to go get help from a doctor or to go to phiso even though her insurance covers it. She’s also extremely dependent on others and always has been especially since she doesn’t drive. If someone wont take her somewhere even if it’s a 5 minute walk she will refuse to go. It makes me sad sometimes that I feel like I will never have a nice mother daughter relationship with her. At times I feel like I’m the one being a b**** or think there is something wrong with me because I can’t get along with her. I always stay at my boyfriends house because it’s like a sense of relief from everything. When I’m home alone I feel so happy I play my music and I feel good but as soon as my mom comes home it’s like all those good vibes just go out the window. I feel pretty depressed sometimes at home. I really don’t know how to fix this or if it ever will get fixed I have tried to do things with my mom like go out but she’s always working or tired. Very rarely do we go out together and I mean when we do it is a fairly ok time. I just don’t know what to do.

192,"Hello reddit!! First time posting so plz forgive me. 


So let's get on with the story. My mom met my father at a bar one night and they instantly hit it off(from what I've been told). After a few dates my father told her that he actually lived in Portugal and just had family here so he visits a few times a year. My mom was okay with that so they kept a long distance relationship and he would visit a a few times a year to see her. After a year or 2 they had me :) This may sound like a deadbeat father story but it's actually the complete opposite! My father loved me and would spend as much time as he could. He could not move to Canada to do work so he would visit a few times a head and give my mom large amounts of money to take care of me( like 5k a visit). My mom was not the wealthiest person do when I was 6 we got evicted from our apartment. During the eveuctuon process my mom tried to contact my father but only had one number and it was disconnected. We eventually moved and my mom did try to contact his relatives living here but that never worked out. So now I'm 18 years old and thinking should I try to reconnect. I would like some closure but I almost never think about him. He apparently has family in Portugal and I have step siblings that are in their 20s-30s( i think he was cheating on his wife with my mom but I'm not upset because I think my mother knew). All I know is the general area he was living in the last time they spoke. 

I do see some problems with trying to fund him though. I dont want to disrupt his life in Portugal. My mom always said he was a loving man so why would I want to possibly ruin his relationship with his family there just so I can have a bit of closure? Please give me any advice you have and if you think theres a better place I can post this please let me know. Also if you have ideas of how I could reach him that would be amazing!!! My job doesn't really allow me for any time off at the moment so I cant go to Portugal to find him. Thanks in advance if anybody actually sees this :)",18Jun2019,2
193," TL;DR at bottom

So I used to share an apartment with a guy I shared a room with freshman year of college a few years ago. Our beginnings were ok, and once we got our own place I thought we were actually really good, compatible friends. After a year in our place, things started to go downhill. 

He started getting more into partying and drinking. He would go out and get drunk every night, come home and make a mess of the entire place, yell on the phone till 4 in the morning, the whole nine yards. Things started to get really bad when he started being late on rent, not having the full amount, or just plain not paying forcing me to cover. He ruined a lot of my belongings and I had enough. 

So I told him I needed someone who could pay the rent just to get him out of here. I found him a new place, and got some time to relax. I wanted to eventually just phase him out of my life slowly, but today I was really busy and ignored a Snapchat message from him to find him removing me. This was the last platform that I still had him on. 

Now realistically I should feel relieved that I don’t have to deal with him anymore, but I just feel this emptiness in my stomach and feel really down. I don’t know why I am feeling this way, but I am, and I am confused and just depressed. Am I just in a rut? Do I actually feel sad for losing a “friend?” I don’t know anymore, just don’t want to feel like this anymore. 

TL;DR: Old roommate/friend treated my like shit, kicked him out and kept my distance. Now he’s out of my life and I feel really depressed.

Any help or advice will be appreciated, thanks!",18Jun2019,3
194,"Obvious throwaway because this is embarrassing and personal. 

He isn't a bad person when he is sober. You can have a really good time with him when he isn't drinking. I still love him but I hate what he is.

He stopped taking drugs over a year ago. He hit me once while he was on it. But me being drunk on nye hit him back. That is over and done with. 

He has his personal reasons for drinking everyday and I'd probably do the same. He had the worst upbringing I have ever heard of, dealing with mild  gore, drugs, criminal activity. I don't blame him, I blame his parents. They got involved with drugs, harbouring criminals and neglecting their kids. 

My dad thinking that stuff was normal because it's all he has ever known got involved with that too. He has come a long way from that. 

If he doesn't stop drinking now he will be dead within 3 years, he just doesn't know it. I don't want him to be dead in 3 years, I want him to be playing with his grandkids in 3 years when they can talk and run around. 

He has it hard but he won't listen. He tries his hardest to bottle his emotions. I don't know what to do, how to convince him to stop. I cut him off, told him I'll welcome him back when he sorts his shit out.

I don't want people to talk shit about him. He has had a shitty life and the only people he cares about won't be able to see him. I honestly want him sober for the decade he could have left. 
It scares the shit out of me, I don't wanna be that when I'm in my 40s.

202,"okay, so i’m gonna start from the beginning here. I (23 M) have been hanging out with my sister and her close friend a lot as of recently. For sake of privacy, we’ll call her friend V (18 F.) For the past three months we’ve seen each other at least a few times a week and things have progressed somewhat. 

She’s very flirty, her and my sister will visit my apartment and when my sister leaves the room she always says something that pushes bar. For example, once while my sister was showering she asked me to feel a scar she had directly next to her vagina, and then proceeded to show me the tan lines on her breasts. Or like today when i asked her to turn around so i can get my keys from her backpack she said “okay daddy” and later on I jokingly said something to her in spanish and she said “oh? you learned spanish for me?” and winked. When we watch movies or shows she always asks me to spoon her, or rubs my back and head. We go to the gym together and she complements me on my muscles etc etc. Point is, she’s very flirty.

Anyway, i haven’t made a move yet because she’s in a relationship. but... it’s complicated? According to my sister her boyfriend is very abusive, and has hit her on a few occasions leaving bruises. She actually wasn’t allowed to take him to her prom, because she once told a guidance counselor about how he hit her. They break up and get back together quite often, and she’s always complaining about him and how he’s always mad at her for something. My point is she seems like she’s very unhappy in the relationship, especially by the way she’s been acting around me. I talked to my sister about it, and she’s all for me and V. Her and all her friends HATE V’s boyfriend because they really don’t like the way he talks to her and treats her. 

I’ve given her a few hints that i like her. I left sunflowers on her doorstep anonymously because i know they’re her favorite. I left them with a little note that said something like “i smiled today and realized i was thinking of you — Not your boyfriend” She called my sister when she found them, talking about how much she loves sunflowers and wondered who left them. I’m pretty sure she knows it’s me because a day later i showed her a song i wrote called “sunflower girl” haha.

We text everyday, and she seems real comfortable around me. the flirting hasn’t stopped, but she’s still with her boyfriend. Honestly i’m really falling for her and i hate seeing her waste her time with someone like that. I don’t know if i should approach her with my feelings and risk losing her as friend, or not, but man it’s really festering inside of me. 

plus i kinda feel like a jerk just coming out like “hey i’m better than your boyfriend” idk, in the end of the day i really just want what’s best for her, even if it’s not with me. but it’s definitely not with HIM. 

So reddit, what’s your advice? Should i come clean with my feelings? or keep quiet till maybe they break up? but maybe they never will unless i step in??? idk idk",18Jun2019,1

204,"Sorry, this is probably going to be a long one, but anything, advice or just hugs, is appreciated. TLDR at bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have 4 siblings, T \[34F\] (who we suspect to be an alcoholic and may have NPD), K \[29F\], TJ \[23M\], myself \[19F\], and H \[13M\]. 

&amp;#x200B;

T has sent countless terrible messages to my Dad, who has supported her financially throughout her life because she has been sickly ever since she was a kid. When she was diagnosed with cancer, she laughed at his face when he started tearing up in shock, and continued to ignore him and my mom the rest of the stay (on my graduation weekend!) She is good to me, H, and K, but only because we go along with whatever she says. She doesn't talk to TJ because of opposing political views and is very snobbish whenever an excuse is brought up to  talk about it. Recently, she was visiting fro a cousin's wedding, and I called her and said I wouldn't stay the weekend in the hotel with her, she needed to come home and quit being a child. My dad genuinely doesn't know what he has done, and has been brought to tears because of the lack of disrespect. She said I was a appointment's and hung up on me. She has spread horrible rumors of abuse (not true!) to extended family, and overall has been terrible and won't listen to any opposition. 

K has always bounced around boyfriends since she was a kid, and after a particularly nasty breakup was engaged to a guy 4 months later, then married not long after for tax reasons, and held the actual ceremony a year later without telling my parents and saying it is none of their business and that she is happy. We expressed concern after he shouted at T once (literally shouted) for being too loud. K still has a grudge about this, and now has a stepdaughter. She preaches family, but after she got involved in an argument that wasn't any of her business, she came home looking for a fight, resulting in a screaming match and me taking care of my step-niece (7) and nephew (3). It was bad. K now says never to talk to her again to Dad. Won't listen to me trying to bridge the gap. She was staying with us over the wedding weekend as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

TJ and I have a super strong relationship after he got into hardcore drugs, was verbally abusive to me growing up, before he moved away, met his now-wife M, and got cleaned up, mostly, when M became pregnant. Later cousin J brings drugs into house again, TJ becomes abusive again, M and J start minor affair (she swears, even through therapy, that it was just kissing), that came to a head with J raping M on the basement floor. TJ and M go through therapy for 2 years, marry, and she is now pregnant again. I love them dearly. They take drug tests and are completely different people now, truly. The reason this is on here is because K and T refuse to see them and ignore any thoughts that they have changed. J tried to pop back into the picture, gets told to fuck off by M, now aunt and uncle are pissed (another long story). 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, no one will listen to anyone, and this has been brewing for years now and with this last get-together full of family, it has come to a boiling point and it has really taken a toll on me. How do I get this madness to stop? How do I get myself to not care that I can't fix it alone? My parents have always been good, and spoiled them even when they couldn't and haven't been anything but supportive and all this sent my mom into a nervous breakdown, and I am ashamed of T and K mostly. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR

&amp;#x200B;

T and K have sent horrible things to my parents because of differing opinions and views on life. They also are upset with TJ and his wife because of rough patch in their relationship. This all came to a head when we were all brought together for a cousin's wedding and a lot of shouting and  hurt ensued and I don't know how I can fix it. I hate being caught in the middle, but hate seeing my family hurt more. We were once all so close.

211,"I have been trying so hard to get my life together, make friends, network for a career, and enjoy life. But there are apparently mean-spirited people who have been interfering through idle gossip that crosses into slander, and other forms of indirect abuse.

People i am kind towards will become very nasty at the drop of a hat. I am excluded from social events, and if I try to attend. I get treated like I am unwelcome.

People routinely imply untrue and hurtful things about me, even when they’ve just met me. 

Strangers sometimes laugh at or look like they’re trying not to laugh when they pass by me. It’s as if they’ve seen someone from an internet meme. I don’t know exactly, but they seem to recognize me in a way that makes them laugh. 

Based on the things people imply, I can gather that there all kinds of stupid assumptions about me, about my intentions, about different aspects of my life, being thrown around, that makes people extremely negative towards me.

It is not constructive criticism made in good faith to try to help me or anyone. It’s just bullying. Worse, because they never say it to my face, I can’t even defend myself.

If i ever prove any of their assumptions are false, they just toss out something new. I know when this happens because all of a sudden, multiple people will make the same new implication about me, using similar or exactly the same language. It’s just like when everyone on the news gets a new talking point.

That’s how I know it isn’t just a bunch of coincidences. It isn’t just people responding normally to my flaws.

It isn’t exactly paranoid to think there could be a group chat or discord channel where they connect. Cyberbullying is a real thing, and I’m just describing my experience on what seems like one end of it. Nobody has told me if that’s the case, but it would explain all of the above points.

It isn’t being criticized that I have a problem with. That’s a part of life and I cherish hearing helpful advice, even when brutally honest. It’s the being singled out, criticized indirectly, not having a chance to correct the record, and being pre-judged by potential friends and employers. It puts me at a severe disadvantage, yet nobody seems to think it is wrong. 

I just want to convince anyone involved to open up about it. How can I?

PS - If I sound desperate, know that I am happier and healthier than ever, even in spite of these challenges. I will NEVER give up because I deeply love life. If I can figure out how to solve these social issues, I will have a truly great life ahead of me.",18Jun2019,0

So I recently got offered for 2 internships: one at a bank and another at a hotel, I start both on 7/1 for 4 hours at each place on every weekday until 8/1. Both are just simple front desk help, not complicated tasks.

But on top of this, I have to study for 2 SAT subject tests (probably an hour a day), take an online class (1-2 hours/day), work on college essays, practice piano and violin (like 1 hour combined), and try my best to stay fit lol. Honestly when I list it out it sounds like a definite not enough time, but combined it's not really THAT much, its just that I wont have much free time.

So basically it's like going to school regularly but requiring a bit more time, as theres stuff with transportation, meals, etc.

Next day word gets to me that an infamous gang member that lives near me had posted on a facebook group about ""finding"" a dog that looked alot like mine. Now apparently the post was with the intention of finding the owner, however, alot of people started offering money for the dog, since it's a purebreed boston terrier. A couple hours later he deleted the post but i managed to grab a screenshot. 
I asked around with people that know the person, and apparently most of them agree he's the type of person who would sell the dog. Some of them even claim to have had seen him take the dog outside and return empty handed.
Finally i went to confront him directly to his house, and he maintains that he released the dog because he couldn't take care of it.

However, given his reputation and that he threatened violence when I visited him, coupled with the fact that he knows where i live, Im scared to proceed.

Sometimes, I'll recognize they're grinding against a blanket between their legs when we are in bed and are sleeping. As soon as I recognize they're masturbating, I become uncomfortable. 

Not like minor discomfort where you can shrug it off or put in headphones to ignore. More like closing my eyes until it's over, unable to concentrate on anything, feeling gross all over my body and counting the seconds down to when they stop.

I come from a background of trauma and also have a hard time speaking up for myself. I hinted about my discomfort in a lighter setting and I figured they were being silly when they said, ""Well, it's my room!""

We both sleep in here the majority of nights and I have a nightstand in here and also use the bathroom in here on a daily basis. I know we were being silly and I understand it can be embarrassing for them to hear I know but it scared me. I'm scared that I'm wrong somehow and just need to deal with it.

They also zone out and idly touch themselves down there not sexually but that makes me viscerally uncomfortable as well. I have to look away and I feel queasy and unsafe. I also can smell their private parts in the air while they're doing it and it makes me feel even worse. I flinch away from their touch because I can smell it on their fingers and don't like where they've been. 

I asked them if it would be possible to have them cover themselves with a blanket when they do idly and that's helped majorly. But is that... was that an okay thing to ask them for compromise on?

my question is what is the right way to quit in this situation? I would like to quit over the phone and not show up to any of my shifts because he works everyday with me, but i don’t want to be unprofessional. is calling in to quit okay in this situation? if so what should i say?",18Jun2019,1
236,"I’ll keep it short, I’m a female, about to be a senior in college, and I’m a virgin. My practical side knows that someone right will come along eventually and I’ll have sex with them and I’ll think it was silly that I was ever so worried about it in the first place. But another part of me, probably my ego, can’t stop obsessing over it. So many people I know aren’t virgins anymore.  They’re so comfortable and open with having a sex life and I feel so behind, and sometimes even like I’m unappreciated by guys. And I’m not asking to fall in love or anything, just to find a cute guy I like hanging with and that I’m comfortable around. It really upsets me that I can’t even find that. 
I think I’m pretty and I’m very down to earth. I can be really shy and I’m just terrible at talking to guys, especially if I think they might be interested. I can also be kind of picky; I really don’t find guys attractive if I can’t get into their personality. But so many people I know who are shy or not good with guys have found both sex and loving relationships. 
Even my friends and family have asked me about guys (I’ve never brought one home). My female cousins are dumbfounded to know I’m still a virgin. I’m just sick of waiting. I know I should have patience, but I can’t just sit around doing nothing while I wait for this to happen to me. What should I do?",18Jun2019,2
237,"So today at school I spent my time studying but instead of what I usually do which is take my BOSE earphones with me, I left them in my bag. When I got home today I realised that they had gone missing except the iPhone audio jack adapter. 

There were three boys a few grades below who stood near my bag that were suspiciously looking at me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I'm planning on asking the librarians if they saw anything and if it is possible to see any camera footage.

My main question is that if I do see some kid wearing the same type of earphones, would it be okay to ask them to show me the serial code so I could compare it to mine?  I don't want to force them into anything but just quickly see if it matches.

238,"People here still heat their homes with crappy coal/wood furnaces. My parent's home is no different. The air is absolutely fucked here. The people are uneducated and unwilling to learn, therefore continuing the cycle of polluting the air, the rivers, and every piece of the land they can get their hands on. I don't know what it is about the mentality here, but the people are just *not* fans of health and cleanliness.

It's been gnawing at me recently, since I'm still stuck here and am in no position to do much about it at the moment. 

I live in a constant fear for my health and safety. My two oldies are switching to central heat next year, but that's not much better since they'll probably still use a furnace to power a steam/hot water system, which, in the hands of my spazzy mother, will sure as hell turn into a fiery death trap *very* fast. I don't know if I can convince them to opt for electric heating instead, probably not.

So, is there anything I can do while here to preserve my poor ol' lungs, or will I have to snort that sweet smoke until I get out of this place?",18Jun2019,2
239,"We have been living in our first apartment for just over a year now. The woman below us has been here longer. She's older and doesn't work.  She has always been kind to us, we've given her rides to the store and gifts here and there. 

The last couple months have been different. 

Haven't seen or spoken to her in a couple months and all of a sudden, right in the morning when I'm getting ready to leave my apartment, she LAYS on our doorbell. 

I open the door she goes: ""Come down here we need to have a chat"" 
I proceed to walk outside with her, she goes: ""I don't care what you guys do you there but its getting in my windows and I cannot breathe"" 

I do not smoke, neither does my girlfriend. 

I tell her I'm not sure what she's talking about she was upset and so I say ""okay"" and head back in. 

Couple of weeks pass by, 1:30 in the morning. I have a friend over;  we're playing video games, drinking a few beers and keeping to ourselves. LAYS on our buzzer again. 

We step out of our apartment onto our porch to see who it is, it's her saying ""I CAN SMELL THAT SHIT I CANNOT BREATHE!""  

Again: My girlfriend and I DO NOT smoke 

So, I come down stairs and try to tell her it's not us and we don't smell anything, I didn't smell anything in the hallway. She's IRATE. Says ""WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU'RE SMOKING I CANNOT BREATHE"" She calls the police and says ""YEAH HELLO MY NEIGHBORS ARE SMOKING CRACK IN THEIR APARTMENT UPSTAIRS AND IM REACHING 60 AND I CANNOT BREATHE"" 

Cops show up... 
Paramedics... 

They talk to her for a while and leave the police literally we're laughing as they walked away. 

Flashforward to tonight. I get off work early and hear banging downstairs while I'm making dinner.. I ignore it. It's 1am. 
 I hear it again and then the smoke alarm. Me, being neighborly and not wanting my home to catch fire, goes down and knocks: 

Her:""WHO IS IT"" 
Me: ""It's you're neighbor upstairs I heard alot of banging and your fire alarm, are you okay? 
Her:""ARE YOU OKAY? YOU'RE THE ONE SMOKING CRACK UP THERE"" 

I walk away and tell my girlfriend. No idea what to do. The alarm is off and she's been quiet since. 

Any advice? PLEASE.",18Jun2019,2
240,"I recently graduated from high school and am having trouble motivating myself to do the things that I used to enjoy. I figured this would happen and that it would just be a short period before I would get back into doing the things that I loved, but it has been a month now and my attitude hasn't changed; despite all of the free time I have, I haven't really done anything that feels meaningful to me.

This really bugs me because one of my hobbies throughout my junior year into my senior year was learning Arabic. I spent copious amounts of time studying and had a lot of fun with it but I eventually stopped due to school getting in the way and the dreaded ""senioritis."" 

In general, I want to get back into things like language learning, but I've lost the motivation to and the fatigue that I currently have 24/7 only magnifies the issue. It's much easier to hop on Xbox and play with friends than it is to study a textbook or start a conversation with a language native, but the games never feel entertaining or enriching and they almost act like a way to waste time until I start university in the fall. This is not how I want to feel in the coming months as a freshman.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if I was a bit all over the place with the explanation for my problem. Had I known the exact answer then it may have been more concise, but then again that's why I'm here: I need help getting the motivation to do what I find satisfying in life. All help is accepted.",18Jun2019,1
241,"This might be a bit of a long winded explanation, but here goes nothin’... My brother has never experimented with drugs beyond marijuana and now wants to try psychedelics for the first time. 

BACK STORY 
My brother (37M) &amp; I (35M) have recently lost our last immediate family member. I’ve taken the next year off from my corporate job in order to deal with my moms estate, and spend more time with my brother (the only real family I have left).


Mom died in March of this year (pulmonary fibrosis), and our dad died way back in 2001 (homicide). Brother definitely has PTSD from the dad thing, because I sure as hell did. Unlike him though, I received some cognitive behavioral therapy to unpack all the trauma. 


I’ll be glad to elaborate on any relevant details I may have glossed over. Just looking for some good suggestions, or sound advice. 

I know there have been some recent studies done on the effects of psilocybin with sufferers of PTSD.

Its also worth mention that she doesnt seem to like me and would treat other customers nicely telling them to have nice days and such but when i stand up to the till she screams for ID. If you knew me you would know I gotta be problematic at all costs so i just wanna make sure I am right before arguing.",18Jun2019,1
243,"Hi everyone. I don’t know where to begin...

...my dad used to be a workaholic. When he was emotionally present growing up he was THE best. I have few negative memories of him. When I was 22 he moved about 5 hours away for work and would come home on the weekends. By the time I was 24 he came home and was a different guy. Being away from family really shifted things for him. I remember him saying that he blinked and I was an adult and he felt like he missed it all. 

I’m 30 now. 3 years ago I moved away from home - my boyfriend needed to go back to school and I’d never moved away so it made sense. I live a 5 hour and $400 plane ride away. Suffice it so say that’s not affordable for me - I work in the social services field. I’ve been seeing my family every 5 months or so. 

Prior to leaving I had overwhelming fears of him and my mom dying. If they die - I’ve wasted 3+ years already of the time I could be spending with them. Having a strong relationship as adults has been the single most meaningful thing in my life. 

I’m home now for a visit and the worry of him dying and me missing out on these precious years makes it hard for me to even stay present - which is the literal antithesis of what needs to be happening. He’s healthy. My mom is healthy. But they’re both in their early 60s now and that somehow seems “old”. 

My heart is broken constantly - it aches so deeply. How do I get out of this?",18Jun2019,1
244,"So I've been trying to make a desicion between 2 jobs for a while and I'm hoping that reddit will have some insight.

The job I'm doing is a vsan engineer role, in IT. Very technical and interesting, and from a tech standpoint nothing can beat it, I work with all the latest tech etc.

My new job is an IT manager (head of IT)  it will mean a lot less tech, but with more money, and managerial experience, but also with the headache of dealing with non techies.

I work shifts atm doing 35 hrs a week, the offer I've had comes with a 40 hour week, but it's 8-5 (with flexibility)

247,"For some  context, I have been friends with this girl I’ll name V for many years. V and I met on the school bus in 4th grade and have sat together everyday for years and even in the present (8th grade going onto 9th). In those years that we’ve sat together she has expressed to me that I am her best friend and that she feels like she can confide with me about everything. I definitely do not feel this close to her, but I’ve never told her that because I’m a generally closed off person and don’t feel comfortable with confrontation. But as high school is coming up I feel like this my chance to finally move away from her as she is going in a direction I don’t want to follow. At the age of 13 she has had sex, drugs, and weed. She’s even tried getting me it into even though that’s where I drew the line and told her no. She is becoming friends with “bad” people who have a reputation for doing the things previously said. I just wanted to move away from her and I didn’t want to be pulled in. Because of my best friend status with V, she tries to include me into everything, often lying to me or not telling the full truth and then pushing me to confront people. But through the years I stuck with her because I was worried about her. About 2 and a half years ago she told me that she was always sad and depressed. The only time she sometimes didn’t feel lonely was when she was surrounded by everyone at school and a lot of the time she still felt separated. Then, only a few days later, she admitted that she would cut herself. At that point I was in panic mode and I was doing everything I could to help her and she said she was getting better. I told her to text or call me when she felt like she was going to do something. And she would do that for a while before dropping off the radar and popping back up saying she cut herself again. I still supported her because of course I didn’t want to make her even more sad because her “best friend” was mad at her for doing that. So over that summer helped her control her emotions more and when school came I thought I would let her fly into the world. So I backed up a bit, knowing that she wouldn’t feel as lonely because she told me that school helped. But then she relapsed, cut herself again and more severely, and told so many people. People who would spread the word because she’s friends with people who aren’t very nice. I rushed back in when I heard the rumors about her cutting herself for attention. Otherwise, she didn’t tell me anything. Then she told me she felt so horrible. She thought that I had left her and she was so used to telling me everything so she turned to others when I wasn’t right next to her. I was really confused at that point and told her she could tell me everything. But from that point on, it was like a cycle that got worse and worse. She would cut, come to me, stop, gossip/get into drama, get hurt, not tell me, and she would cut herself again. I know this is horrible to say, but I wanted her to stop coming to me with all her problems because I felt like it was breaking me down. So I actually started to pull away from her. I haven’t gotten far and it’s been almost 1 and a half years. Over that time, she’s gotten another decent person that she talks to when she needs to. But that girl is moving to a different school this year. I feel like I keep telling myself that I want to leave because I want her to learn what it’s like in the real world and I want her to be able to support herself, but I also feel like that’s a lie. When I watched [Jaiden Animations Relationships Video](https://youtu.be/4H9jTQKmR3Q) I thought I finally felt like it was ok to seriously get away. So currently I had my phone taken away by my mother for not winning an award and I’ve been ignoring V’s texts using that as an excuse when I got it back. I know she’ll call if it’s really serious. But it’s gotten to the point where I’m so worried about her doing something if I try to leave that I couldn’t sleep when she texted me if she did anything wrong, even with the excuse that I gave her (that’s what happened the night of me writing this). She might be cutting herself because of me and that would be horrible. I don’t know what to do right now...",18Jun2019,1
248,"First of my grammar is quite bad so I'm sorry about it. I really don't know how to write this either but since it's long I will but a short conclusion in the end.


My grandma was a genuebly nice person. She would talk about the books she read about medicine and her faith in crystals and angels, she would talk about boys and ""future boyfriends"" and joke about it. She would give me advice on my school choices and relationships. We would go walking on the beach and I would sometimes help her babysit my aunt's daughters. She was like a friend you could rely on and tell your secrets to. 

It all changed after we went on a trip. She was nice at first and we shared a room. (My family with my little sister  were also with us) and j know j can't just blame my actions on me being tired but indeed I was a bit lazy on the trip and didn't really help as much as asked. Still I played with my sis and helped to take the trash away. But she translated my actions to abuse? I just sat down and whined about moving because I'm lazy. Still I helped!

I kept my space clean sometimes a few clothes here and there and now that is walking over her? They weren't on her bed or on her stuff or anything like that. Just put away a little messy.

Fast forward a few months. I had to spend a week with her because she lives right next to my school and she was willing to let me live there. We had met before a few times and I guess she was just letting this stuff bubble inside her because she acted like my grandma. Yet true she was a little nasty but I guess j didn't see it. I somewhat blamed the stress of having to babysit my aunt's kid all the time. But right off the bat when j got there and my dad left she made me cry. 

I love soft animals and I had just gotten a soft fat cat plushie that I love. It was a gift what made it also more special to me. I showed it to her and she said something a long the lines of ""get that away from me I don't like it you should throw it away."" And with a horrific nasty tone to it. I don't know why but It hurt like hell. I started crying and eventually left the house sobbing. 

Mostly the reason I was sad was because I thought she judged me for being 13 and having a soft plushie. I luckly got to leave the house and go to my other grandma after a few more nasty comments about me.  

I thought that was it and it won't concern our family Any more that just my relationship was broken. And I admit j made mistakes but she was always the kind to accept people as they are. 

Fast forward a month or so to basicly today I found out my grandma had insulted my mother my aunts boyfriend and my uncle's wife. (Her kids family basicly other than her kids) She said we haven't been grown and teached well enough by my mother. Where the he'll did she get it from my mother is strict and me and my older sis are well behaved and we don't do drugs, we don't smoke not drink (my older sister is 19 but she never took alcohol when she was underage) (alcohol is allowed from age 18 here)  she is surrounded by people who do drugs but she never herself involved with them. 

We always have said where we are and when we come back. We have a schedule and our grades aren't bad either. She told it to our dad thus her son but he said we were more important and I'm thankful for my father he is the best I could imagine. My mom and my father have been together over 10 years and not once before was my mother a bad person. They got along. 

Now about my aunt. To me she said that her boyfriend is running away from the kids to work in another country. He was there before they started a family and she knew what she was getting involved with. He comes to his children every available time he can and supports his family no matter how far. He loves his kids and my aunt and he is  a good father. 

About my uncle and her wife. this is the part j don't get at all they are so perfect for eachother. They have a nice home and they are both teachers . They are both so nice and they care for eachother. The only minus in their relationship is that they can't have children that's all! And even tho my uncle wanted kids she meant so mutch to him he didn't care and stayed with her. They also have been in a so long relationship that I don't get why now? 

My aunt knows about my grandma but I have no idea what she thinks of it and I don't need to know other than I hope she won't leave a amazing person because of my grandma. Her kids are also well behaved and like any kids are a little dumb and messy. (A 5yr old and a 3 yr old)

&gt;short&gt; my grandma insulted people that her 2 sons and daughter have chosen to date/marry. They have been together a long time and she only now told her kids that. She before hand insulted my behaviour and my life routines which  makes me feel like I was the one whos fault it is that she now came out on my family. 

She was not like that before and I don't know what to do. I still care and live her and j want to make our relationship work . Yet the things she said about the loved ones are never going to be taken back. I want to make things right between our family and my aunt's and uncle's somehow. And j don't even know if I should.",18Jun2019,1

I told him I wanna work in Cali one day and he says “I think I can def pick up some legal work in Cali”. He Texts me daily. Changes behavior when I say I don’t like it. He says he only thinks of me when he masturbates and he did when we broke up last year. He also told me he would be there for me for forever whenever I had any issues I wanted to talk about. Lastly, he recently told me “Thanks again for coming with me to Visit my family. you are the best gal a guy could ever want 😍”

He never says he loves me but I also left him last year so he may be hesitant. We got back together three months ago. We dated for five months. I left him because of some issues. He resolved his and I resolved mine and now we have been seeing each other again for two months. Yet, he says he takes things super slow which I think Is code for “I have commitment issues but don’t wanna give up that vagina” he says he takes things slow so he doesn’t get wrapped up in infatuation and make poor decisions about someone since he is old and doesn’t have as much time.

253,"So I work in kohl’s over a year now and I’ve never had any issues with fellow employees working the same department as me. However, a girl I graduated HS with works with me. She just rejoined back in November and has been the most unhelpful coworker ever since and she’s the only one who consistently works the same shift as me. She radiates hate towards me because we had a “past” and that past is really her hating me because I was friends with her bf in HS that’s it!!!!  No hidden meaning no flirting NOTHING. we just had classes together pretty much 8 times a day every year for the most part so yeah we were friends. Anyways, the first incident was when I texted him after a year of literally no contact saying “hey” JUST “hey”. she went off on me (found my Instagram. I don’t even follow him there or her or even anyone she’s friends with so idk how she found it) for hitting him up but I told her the reason was that I was trying to get HER # for work reasons only but she thought I was going to make a move on him but I never even got to ask him anything just said “hey” it was left unread too. The second incident was when me and him lost our friend to suicide and I asked her on break at work after I was away for a week to try to get myself together. I only asked how he was. Side note: I kept check of everyone and everyone kept check on me. We were hit hard he was an amazing person. So I thought it was polite to ask if he was doing okay and BAM second time she went off but this time ran out our breakroom CRYING. I learned that she clearly has a problem with me even mentioning him but I’ve only done so twice i.e these two incidents so I stopped because why bother trying to get a convo out of her. I told her when this incident happened bc I wanted to know what I said wrong but I ended up saying that I wouldn’t talk to her about her personal life and only work that’s the only reason we should communicate since we work together in the same department and she said I was pretending to be the bigger person and I was acting like I was better than her???? But it’s been months and she’s still not putting aside her hate to the point where it affects our work SPECIFICALLY to me. The entire second floor would be a disaster and I run around everywhere i.e registers the floor customer service etc and you’d think because we work the same departments she’d help? No. I texted her one time through Instagram the same place she went off on me only bc I couldn’t find her and a customer needed translation and she blocked me. Anyways recently I’ve been getting more and more agitated because she just walks around talking to her friend NOT helping me clean our department. She avoids the same area I’d be in no matter if it looks like a disaster. Tonight the floor was a complete mess!!!!  We work home/kids and to note the home department takes such a short time to clean while kids could take your whole shift if you’re by yourself. So for 5-6 hours today, she spent tonight cleaning home department, doing no returns, talking away to her friend and I was rushing to clean kids which I didn’t even finish doing I was almost done but missed an entire side of the store. I had to call for a manager to get her to help me bc I couldn’t find her on the floor. She likes to hide from me btw. I told the manager what I wanted to ask her to do which was make sure toddlers was still fine as I just cleaned it half an hour ago AND it was untouched she just walked around. I went to check on it too to be sure she didn’t need fucking help and as she walked away I asked her since home was fine to help clean up the other side with me as it was messy. She side eyes me shrugs her shoulders and says walking away “well I was only told to do toddlers so” like???????? I told her I had asked the manager to tell you to do this because I know you wouldn’t do it if I asked then she said the same thing again and walked away. I got upset and said “Why is it physically impossible for you to help me huh? Why. You can’t work the same department as me? What did I do?” And just walked away bc it was closing time now as she still didn’t help me and I had a stolen item to report to LP. I have no problem being in the same area as her!!!! I don’t even hate her I would honestly like us to be friends or at least just not have any problems but I know that won’t happen. But I am tired of it now my other coworkers noticed it and idk if I should report to my manager.

255,"	I never really felt stressed out from school but when I entered my teen years and started highschool, I always feel constricted and pressured in school. It's like I need to do my best every day because of the expectation people are giving me. My friends and family always expect me to be good at everything and I'm tired of it, they always expect me to be the top of the class.They always think that everything is a competition.  I really am sick hearing people comparing me to others.
	I started relieving the stress by playing online games. At first it really effective but the more I play the more addicted I get. Then the time came when I can't balance my studies and addiction. I can't focus anymore and my studies got neglected. I missed  some projects and homeworks I need to keep up with my studies but I can't manage my time anymore. I got so stressed and started to get anxiety attacks. 
	I survived that environment for 3 whole years of school. I'm now on my senior highschool years and I wanted to escape that environment by transferring to a new school. I started school by being distant because I'm now afraid of making friends, but I made some acquaintances. I was okay with the school but as the time passes the stress is building up again, my anxiety got worse and I have been lacking sleep because of overthinking things. My anxiety attacks now occur more often and I am having suicidal thoughts. I'm still living with my parents so I'm having second thoughts of dropping out. But I also don't think I can live with a life like this. I don't know what to do anymore, I need help.

TLDR: I am so stressed out in school and I am thinking of dropping out.",18Jun2019,2
256,"I went to community college straight after high school back in 2013. I didn't know what I was doing with my life so I took all of these classes just for them to make my GPA plummet because I didn't care for them. I didn't have a goal, but was dumb enough to just want to stay in college. I ended up taking a year long break to decide I wanted to get into the radiography program in my community college. This happened when I had already been attending for 5 years. I got denied so now I am back to square one. I just turned 24 today and life seems to be flying by. I can't believe it's been this long since I graduated high school and I have no degree apart from a high school diploma. It is very sad. So instead of trying to join a highly competitive health program at my community college, I was thinking about transferring to a university. I want to be very clear and concrete about what my goals will be there. I don't want to wing it. I want to follow through with a plan and stick to it. But I hate that it's far away and Houston traffic is awful. It's one of the main reasons why I didn't want to attend a university straight after high school in the first place. But I feel incredibly stuck in this community college. I could try and apply for the program again, but I want something new. I just am not sure if this is the right route to take since I do know universities are far more expensive. I have roughly 58 credits under my belt. What should I do?",18Jun2019,1

261,"My dad will turn 48 this August. He has had 2 angioplasties in the last 4 months, the last 1 being yesterday. He has 4-5 stents in his body (as far as I know). I'm pretty sure he isn't aware of that, we didn't tell him.

262,"I was feeling really sick the other day. It was 2 AM, the Advils I took didn’t help so I was sent to the ER. I spent there the whole night till I got more medication and was finally sent home.

It was 5 am when I ordered a taxi. There must’ve been a bug in the app because, apparently, my request was accepted by 2 drivers instead of just one. Obviously, I waited for the one that popped on my screen.

When my driver arrived, so did another driver.
When I got inside MY taxi, the other driver arrived as well and he was going crazy. He started yelling at me, cursing, he was telling me horrible stuff- wishing terrible stuff to happen to me, a girl who just went out of the ER. He was trying to make me go inside his car, but my driver closed the door and we drove away.

I then blocked the other drivers number. My driver, who thanks god was sweet, was in shock himself, saying he is a driver for so many years and have never witnessed anything like that. I was just shaking the whole way home, while my driver was going on and on about how I should file a report, but I just couldn’t concentrate on anything. I was terrified the other driver would follow me home. 
When I finally got home, I was too scared to get out of the taxi, I was scared that he would wait there, as he already has my address and name.
The kind driver was waiting for me to get home safely before he drove off.
When I got home, I just cried it all out. I had a terrible day and it ended even worse.
I couldn’t sleep at night at all ever since, which means 4 nights of barley any sleep.

The only two friends I told were like, “that really sucks. But you should just forget about it.”
I wish it was that easy, but I’m actually really scared to even order a taxi right now. I’m just overall tired and anxious more than I was ever before.

Am I overreacting? I know nobody can judge but me, but I think maybe I’m just overthinking all of that? 

And, if anyone experienced anything like that, how did you manage to sleep at night? Because I don’t seem to manage.

Thank you for letting me get it off my chest 💕",18Jun2019,1

266,"Throwaway for obvious purposes. 

So I live in a pretty big family, I have 5 siblings and thankfully my parents have been able to provide for all of us in a satisfying way. We all get along together and it's a lot more fun than it sounds. 

I share a room with my brother and dad, it's a really big room but obviously I'd like my own privacy. Im an 18 year old male and I feel its time to have my own privacy. 

Ever since late February my dad has told me he'd make an effort to call builders to get started, he hasn't called a single person yet and every time I mention it to him, he seems to get annoyed or stressed about the situation. I always mention how they are gonna build it and finish it within a week and that waiting is futile, just get it over with and everyone is happy. 

How would I bring up the situation? Time and time again he told me he'd call someone this weekend, and everytime I ask him if he called someone he says no and if I persist, he starts getting annoyed. I truly dont know what to do anymore and it's getting really annoying being lied to over and over again.

Lastly, he recently told me “Thanks again for coming with me to Visit my family. you are the best gal a guy could ever want 😍”

He never says he loves me but I also left him last year so he may be hesitant. We got back together three months ago. We dated for five months. I left him because of some issues. He resolved his and I resolved mine and now we have been seeing each other again for two months. Yet, he says he takes things super slow which I think Is code for “I have commitment issues but don’t wanna give up that vagina” he says he takes things slow so he doesn’t get wrapped up in infatuation and make poor decisions about someone since he is old and doesn’t have as much time. I think he just wanted someone to pass the time with since this girl he thought he would marry left him two years ago for no reason except that she fell out of love.

276,"Hi everyone. I need some advice on my life. I feel that I am at a complete stop and have no fucking clue about the proper next step.

To start off, the biggest issue for me right now is my career. I am unemployed since I graduated last year(Summer of 18). I have gotten advice from other alumni and counselors to revamp my resume and interview skills. And yet, I still got denied by all the companies I interviewed for. Each and every time, I drove multiple hours in a single day to a different State, interviewing for places and acting like I am a good fit, only for them to reject me on the spot or send me an email later saying they found better suited candidates despite how well my interviews go. It's done a toll on me after a year, and I am no longer motivated to put myself out there. This is not even regarding the fact that I absolutely despise my major and the only reason why I did it is because when I selected the program, I was naive, chasing money, and heard my university has one of the best degrees for this program with a high employment rate. I wanted to explore other career options, but seeing as how I'm failing to get a job *related* to my degree, I'm having trouble imagining how I will get a job that is completely outside it. 

The next issue for me is a personal one, and one that has been eating me up inside since I was in high school. I have never dated anyone, kissed, or had any physical intimacy. I grew up fantasizing about romance, daydreaming about spending time with a girl that would like me back. I felt like all I needed in life was a gf to feel happy. It's the wrong mindset to have in life, but like I said earlier, I was naive and shaped by movies and mass media to feel like shit if I'm single and can't get in a relationship. This stirred up a lot of things in my life. One, I actually started to care about my life and became a self-improvement guru. *Whatever advice you have to offer regarding self-improvement and feeling good about yourself as a single person, I have done it(I guarantee it)*. Still, mastering my internal life had little impact on my external dating life, and I finished college without ever going far as holding someone's hand romantically. It's pretty sad and pathetic to think about it, and don't try to tell me it's not because everywhere you see nowadays, you see guys like me ridiculed and guys with relationships praised. So, in an attempt to numb this fucking cancer from eating me up inside, I resorted to venting on subs like depression/Forever alone, and browsing toxic subs like redpill/mgtow to tell myself that women are the problems and not me. It's a shameful tactic, but it was the band-aid fix that I needed in order to not completely break down every day, and give myself motivations to try. Needless to say, it didn't fix the issue and I realized my fault.

And now, I feel like I am at a complete dead-end. I no longer have surge of interviews coming in to give me hopes of getting employed, and I see no jobs ever doing so, if they just keep rejecting me one after another no matter how hard I try to be professional and sell myself well. People around me, the very little friends I have, are moving on with their lives. One has gotten a 2nd internship, the other who already has a solid job just started dating someone. And yet, here I am, sulking by myself at night because I can't sleep and want to cry but physically can't because I'm too soul-less to even do so. Within a span of 2 weeks, I got my final rejection letter, heard one friend landed an internship, and another a girlfriend. It's like the world just fucking hates me and refuses to give me a win no matter what I do and give wins to people around me just to put salt to the wound.

I have been pretty stressed out, anxious, lonely, and depressed. I'm just watching my life quickly go down the drain despite my genuine efforts to save it. And it's gotten to a point where I have to ask internet strangers for help because everyone in my life has given me the same answers over and over again that simply does not work for me. Staying positive, putting myself out there, praying to a non-existent God has absolutely done nothing for me in my life and only pushed me down further, almost as if to mock me for trying in first place.

I feel like a loser every day and can no longer keep this going. Something has to happen, right here and now. I'm losing motivations to continue to live and don't feel like I'll be mentally stable in the long run. What are some things I can do regarding my dead-end situation?",18Jun2019,0

Me and my girlfriend are officially together since August 2018, but we were on and off since November 2017.
I'm just going to spill the beans - we are toxic, I don't know who is in the wrong, but we definetly are.
I was passive-aggressive up to a breaking point in our relationship, when I did change to a calmer and more understanding me. She had her wrongs as well - being verbally abusive, physically abusive and she loves to share our personal lives out to the public, problem is - she still has the same wrongs, she still makes the same mistakes. Whenever now I try to reason, as she wanted me to do, she never does, she blocks me on social media, tells me ""If your say one more word X will happen (usually she is going to break up with me)"". She keeps calling me human garbage (which is a really strong thing to say in my language), she says she hates me during arguments, always tries to give me an ultimatum. She has hit me in the throat, tazed me, pushed me, etc. during arguments - not to say that I've always been good to her - but I have never, ever laid hands on her in an aggressive matter. To calm her down - sure, I'll grab her by the shoulders and tell her to calm down, but I've never done anything remotely close to being as physical as her, except causing myself harm - from pure anger and/or depressing thoughts I've broken both of my wrists several times, which is really fucked up, I know, I get it, I've stopped.
She spills all of our privacy and sex life out to her friends, my friends and it generally makes me more sad that it has to happen this way, than to make me angry.
My parents have always been on good terms with my girlfriends, even after we break up, but this time it's different. One time I was bawling my eyes out after another argument, another break up and told me ""I hope this time you're done for good"", which was shocking to hear from him.
We've talked a lot about her inability to speak and express herself and it always ends with a promise, that she can't and does not keep.
Contrary to all of the above - I love her more than anything and I'm willing to continue being with her, I'm just not sure if it's good for my well-being and mental health. I love the way she talks, walks, smiles, you get it.
What do I do, reddit? Do I fight for what I love or do I end it right here and now, as she blocked me again an hour ago and told me ""We're breaking up"" (for her not expressing a situation correctly, and me trying to get to understand, which led me to ""bother"" her).

282,"I [19 F] am the oldest of 5. My mother passed away from cancer a couple a months ago. I am currently helping my dad out with the kids which I only take care of 3, the youngest being 10. I put school on pause and my job to come help my dad out and be with them, it’s been really hard on all of us emotionally. My dad was by her side ever since she was in the hospital. He’s a great father and all but he wasn’t the best husband. There are many things I don’t know, but he told me he regrets not treating my mother better. 

I recently found a crack pipe and drugs in my dads truck which I use to take my younger sibling to school.  I looked at it and it had blackish residue and what looked like white powder on the edges.There also was an empty bag of coke in plain sight, it was a pinkish color, but had white residue as well, which is why I believe it was coke. He smokes it before he comes into the house sometimes, I can smell it on him, it’s not weed or tabaco it’s something else.  He also drinks everyday, but this isn’t new.

He acts normal, if I wouldn’t have found it I’d think everything was okay. He goes right to bed and sleeps for hours. So I don’t really know what drugs he’s using. 
He is self employed so he can be in bed for about 2 days and then leaves and doesn’t come back in days. This has been an issue as well because I am basically taking care of my siblings alone. 
We’re economically unstable, so the fact he’s wasting money on those things is frustrating. I was also mad by how careless he was with it. My moms side of the family already want to take the kids away from my dad as it is. If one of them found anything drug related they wouldn’t think twice.  Which is why I haven’t told anybody. The only reason they’re not all divided up is because I am here taking care of them. 
He has us right now to keep him from losing it. He cries with us and. I know it hurts him when we’re sad. If we were to leave him alone I don’t know what would happen to him. I also don’t know what he’s going through, we have a lot of problems and we’re all trying our best. Only he knows how to cope with my moms passing, but I don’t think drugs are the answer.  He saw her suffer. We love him very much and we don’t want to loose him. I need to tell him something before he becomes addicted. If he hasn’t already. I’m scared of how he may react.

285,"Hello everyone, my name is John (not really) I am 18 years old and I want to take a minute to tell my story. For those of you who read to the end you have my thanks, for those of you who don't.. no harm no foul, I haven't read anything of yours either.

This could get a bit long but I promise it will be interesting, final chance to back out.

I was born into a single parent home and remained relatively comfortable, all of my needs have been met, clothes, food, shelter, and I feel loved. I honestly believe that I have learned more from my absence of a father than I ever could have from him being around in retrospect. My mom is the most compassionate person I've ever met, but everyone says that about their mom right? The older I got the more she would clue me in on just what type of life she had led but we'll get to that later. Little blonde headed bouncing baby boy John didn't have a care in the world climbing everything and eating many many things that should never be ingested, I despised school despite having an incredible aptitude for learning, scoring well above average on many IQ tests/aptitude tests (all the good being a certified genius is doing me now huh?) And I don't mean to come across as cocky or arrogant but that's just a part of who I am. I hadn't yet realised that I was supposed to have a dad, it was simple (cliche) when I was about 5 my mom began training to become a Massage Therapist, for reasons unknown to me that quite frankly arent super important I would go to class with her. Growing up, her Anatomy and Physiology textbooks were my coloring books and I always enjoyed it. I quickly became desensitized to ""grossness"" or ""immodesty"" of the human body and grew to respect the intricacies of every system, it was fascinating. Even to a 5 year old. Following the completion of her training she got a job working for the nearest hospital in the rehabilitation and recovery center, to supplement the work of physical therapists and aid the injury/surgery recovery process. This led again to me tagging along and playing in the ""old person pool"" looking at models of the skeleton and hearing the lingo. I quickly decided at the age of 6 that i wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon, I was adorable, I could hardly pronounce it but I knew what I was talking about. I lived in a world where things appeared as they were needed just in time. With age came understanding of life, and around then my older brothers and sisters (2 of each) began to make their own decisions which included many things that displeased my mom, drinking smoking or partying, girls for my brothers and boys for my sisters. This ultimately led to them dropping out of highschool and starting families which I understand is quite the leap but I'm trying not to drag on too long. My second sister and I are the only ones that have a GED or equivalent. I hit the middle school years and really began to enjoy school, not the social aspect yet but at least I didn't hate going anymore. I could get good grades and pass tests. It was good, sometime during my 5th year I met a girl who would later be my first kiss, crazy I know, she was gross but all my siblings had a person so I went for it, big mistake, she accused me of performing various inappropriate actions with her and due to the gossip and constantly being in the principles office.. kissing her was the equivalent of social suicide. Or so I thought in 5th grade.
Regardless, I transferred schools, considered a name change, and a few other basics associated with wanting to fly under the radar. I had extremely cooperative teachers who understood me and really helped me to grow as a person two years would pass at this new school and life was good again. 
Along came Kasey, my mom met a guy online, he genuinely appeared to be a good guy but it was an elaborate 3 act play directed by him that the true plot of would only be revealed once we had sold our house and moved to Wyoming. Which I have to admit is lovely but for the shut in who enjoyed video games and overeating it wasn't my cup of tea. It grew on me though! It was here that I developed my love for the outdoors, hiking and camping, learned the importance of manual labor and work ethic and really started to think before putting something into my body. Puberty was passing, I enjoyed being outdoors, and this douche canoe Kasey really enjoyed making us work, before I continue he was a huge liar/manipulator who only wanted to find a wife for a tax write off and personal maid/chef.
Lovely man really.. kicked my mom, me and my older sister out of the house on Christmas eve LITERALLY. There was still something to be gained from it though, a fresh slate as a completely transformed person when I came back to my hometown following the divorce. (Hes been married 5 times since then but i still have hope that Kasey will find Mrs Right) 
Yet again in my life things were good, I enjoyed school and got good grades, started lifting weights,  joined the choir, and started ballroom dancing competitively on a team. 
I LOVED highschool 
Socially, academically, and emotionally things just felt right.
Then when I least expected it i met a girl who changed me forever, taught me that my self worth needs to come first, taught me to listen to red flags, taught me I have more value as a person than simply to please my ""partner"" and she did all of this by ""cheating"" on me. I use quotation marks simply because it wasn't cheating in the adult, caught in bed sense, but rather holding hands and kissing highschool relationship sense. It seems petty but trust me it's still a big deal especially when the whole relationship had been an emotional fist fight between me and any other boy for her attention. It was extremely unhealthy. So I ended things quite promptly and went on with my life, I hadn't realised though breaking it off with her meant losing my whole friend group.
Dont worry though, I have a pretty positive mental attitude and a charismatic personality. I moved on and made new friends quite quickly, then I met girl #2 who taught me you have to love a girls family too. Not just her. Her parents didn't like that I wasn't mr Religion so they ended things for her.
Deja vu..
Then girl #3 a college student who I gave my number to at a subway cause I thought she was cute.
Moral of this story, trust is key. I was so nice to her that i reminded her if an ex who was ""too nice"" but the only reason he was that way was to get into her pants. Yikes.  So we tried the whole just friends thing for a while which she didn't like at all and then it just fizzled out. 
Girl #4 was best friend of girl #1 and taught me if someone cares they will show you, AKA actions speak louder than words.

Now let me introduce you to Elayna, my current girlfriend of the past year and a half now that I have graduated who literally could not be more perfect, she is kind smart, and beautiful like I literally did a double take the first time I saw her BEAUTIFUL I do not deserve her. But she shows me off and is amazed that I looked her way which doesnt make sense but there's a whole story about her self esteem for another day. She babies me and makes me.feel like I matter, like really MATTER. I couldn't be happier. OH AND HER PARENTS ARE AMAZING

Backtrack a little bit, I figured I would not be able to afford med school on one two or even three minimum wage jobs so I started looking at entry level medical careers or at least careers that would teach me about the body and client care, record keeping and so on. It was at this point my mom very unsubtly reminded me about massage and how the schooling would be easy to get a loan on and that It was only 9 months of time for a job in a competitive market that pays well and allows me to set my own schedule. 
What I wouldn't learn until later is that it's hard to find clientele as a Male massage therapist because of various connotations associated with a man giving a professional massage
 I pride myself on my ethical clarity and boundaries when working with my clientele, because of my diligence I have a decent amount of clientele but not quite enough to make it on my own in an apartment or with a small home loan. I'm rapidly paying off my debt and building my credit through various means but its not.quite enough, definitey not where I would feel stable and secure.

So that's me, now my life is much more complicated than that due to various things but the biggest factor is my mom. She is diagnosed with Generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, stockholme syndrome, and a few other debilitating mental disorders from extreme traumas and abuse in her life, as well as being a cancer survivor, and now being diagnosed with lupus which is an autoimmune disease that causes her body to essentially attack varying types of connective tissue throughout her whole body. When she can work, great but mostly she cant, I salute her for being the amazing mom that she has been with all of that going on, its really inspiring.  But were broke.

She collects disability from the government monthly which helps.but is not enough and discourages her from working a regular job and anything else that isn't covered is picked up by me and our local churches help. 

I dont make enough money and everyone in my home is stressed to the max losing their minds. My oldest brother his wife and their four kids live in my basement, and my older sister stays in our living room with her fiance who has gotten her hooked on few different addictive things, drugs alcohol etc... 
Hes a pretty bad guy, lazy, all around kinda just dumb yknow? 

Which is cause for the church to stop helping us (I dont blame them) because there are 6 adults living in a decent home which costs around 1200 a month to keep running.

I realise maybe I missed a fair amount of details but I could really use some advice, what can I as an 18 year old in my circumstances do to ease the burden on everybody else? My mom especially. 

To make more money, something I might be missing, anything i can do legally

She means the world to me and sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who cares if one day the stress just killed her.

I felt so creeped out by this feeling, but I just tried to ignore it. It got so intense to the point where I couldn’t ignore it and had to turn on my lamp beside my bed.

300,"For two years, I've been struggling with an ""after high school life dilemma"" so I decided to post this. I'm really bad with English grammar, so I apologize in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Dream Dilemma:** 

My dream is to become a filmmaker (editor/cinematographer.) Why do you ask? Because I love watching movies and the work that goes into them. Also, I'm not really interested or not smart enough for other jobs. The only experiences I have in film making is from photography classes and self-taught editing. For years, I searched up ""Advice for rookie filmmakers"" and ""Is film school worth it?"" I usually got two similar responses, ""Work as a PA (Production Assistant) instead of going to film school!"" or ""You should at least go to a small film program to build connection and learn stuff."" They all had diverse and unique answers so I couldn't really choose a direct path for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My Lifestyle Dilemma:**

I am currently taking two required online courses that I couldn't finish in time when I was in high school. Long story short, I goofed around and didn't get stuff done during grade 11 to grade 12 because I played video games too much. Whenever I'm not doing the courses, I usually edit random videos or play video games. I live with my parents and I feel awful for not leaving because it's been two years since I ""graduated."" To truly show how pathetic I am, I can't work due to my VISA type. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before I give you my status on my courses, here's ""How to get into an Average Canadian's University in a Nutshell: 

\-It is necessary to have grade 12 English as your default course (You can't graduate high school without completion.)

\-You need at least an additional three academic courses, not including English 12.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Academic Dilemma:**

I'm not really a smart guy so here's my status on my grades, I have 0 grade 12 academic courses that is why I'm looking for an online course to do it. For my grade 12 courses,  I only took Photography 12, Cooking 12, and Programming 12 (I know it's really bad.) This means I need 3 additional academic courses to at least have a chance to get accepted to a decent university. But the problem is, I didn't even start on my English 12 course. So I'm currently struggling to pick which three additional courses I should take. To be honest, I just want an easy course to go through and get this over with.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR Questions:**

1. I want to become a filmmaker but I'm not sure if I should go to university or not. Should I go to college/university or not?
2. If I should go to university, which one do you have to recommend? I would prefer a college/university that is easy to get in or a good program for jobs)
3. If I shouldn't, what should I do? Remember, I can't really make a living due to my VISA.

302,"A little back story just so you can see where my heads at.

A few years ago I got with a girl I was completely head over heals with. The order went as follows. I moved in, we got together, we got a dog later that week. (we were friends for a long time before that week).

So everything is cool. Now. We both work and now have a spare room. We both have a friend who suffers from anxiety and doesn't work. So, I get on the phone to him and move dude into the spare room so he can be with my dog in the day times. Everything seems to work out fine.

Fast forward a year. Girl and I (mainly girl) decide, we dont work. Dogg, me and friend find a nice house not to far away and move. For the record girl was around last night. We were best friends beforehand and remain so now.

So now heres where I'm at. 

My buddy who doesn't work also doesn't do shit all else. I know a good few lazy people, I would actually consider myself lazy but this dude takes the cake. At first when i moved him in he used to have to take the puppy out every few hours (which was an amazing help as you can imagine) when we where in work. But that was when he was a puppy. Dogg's four next month. We have been in this house now for nearly two years and he has not hoovered once doesn clean up after himself nor put things back in the cupboard when hes done with whatever. He's cleaned the abthroom at least once that i know and that only because he ahad a girl coming around. The guy does NOTHING now for the Dogg. He doesn't even take him the shop with him if he need to go get mik, and then claims he loves the Dogg. If i'm in work the dog is most likely just staring out the window. And too be fair when im home he stares out the window if he's not been out. We live right next to a beautiful dog park too.

Now! I know i can't and shouldn't expect anyone to help me look after my Dogg. Thats not what i'm driving at. I work all day then go home to clean our house, walk the dog, cook for (used to be the three of us but now its just me and the dog, because he's too lazy) us. If no friends show up of an evening, I might get a an hour or so to relax. 

The whole rant about the dog is to illistrate i think how inconsiderate and selfish he is. 

We have a house inspection coming up in a few days that i told him about last week. He has done nothing to but anything straight in the house what so ever. I had to do it this weekend with my free time. The dude only cares about how he can make his life as easy as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

The point of this!!! The dude does suffer from anxiety (which he doesnt try and fix i might add) so it would be doing him a diservice if i were to just take off. But I shouldn't care right? the dude does nothing with me in consideration.

&amp;#x200B;

Il add a final thing. A couple easters ago i got the Dogg a bunny rabbit. The rabbit has good roam of the house. I get home after a long day in a job i dislike to then have to clean up after a rabbit, dog and lazy grown adult.

It lasted about 3 months and it would have lasted longer, except for a change in her work circumstances.  I left her with my details and told her if ever she wanted to look me up when she was down this way, I'd be happy to see her.  


On Saturday morning, she turned up for the first time in ages.  With an 8 year old boy in tow.   My first reaction after the hello was ""I didn't know you had kids.""  What she told me next, left me almost needing medical help.  


After the last time we'd made love, she told me, her periods stopped.  They didn't come back either. So a month later, she went to the chemists and bought a pregnancy test, and it flagged a positive.  She went to the doctors, who confirmed it.    She told me in no uncertain terms, that this little boy was my son.  Looking at him, it's possible.      


I've asked her a lot of questions, like ""why didn't you tell me sooner?"" and suchlike.  It's a difficult thing to come to terms with.  I want to ask for a paternity test, but I don't even know where to begin.

310,"Throwaway account because shit, this is a bad one. TL;DR - My husband's best friend killed himself and I feel like all I'm doing is making it worse. How do I do little things to make things easier/better for him?

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I have been together for six years, married for two. These two years have not been easy. At all. 

&amp;#x200B;

In December of last year, his best friend killed himself. They were like brothers. They had known each other since they were just six years old, and it felt like he knew my husband better than I did sometimes. He was supposed to be the best man at our wedding (we eloped and had the ceremony a while later after we saved money), the godfather to our future kids, etc. Losing him was the hardest thing my husband has ever had to go through. He drove back to his hometown on Christmas eve, and spent Christmas day with his best friend's family and fiancee, grieving and figuring out funeral stuff. When he came back home, he looked older, more jaded, dead inside, and scared all at once. It broke my heart.  I watched him hold his best friend's little brother in his arms as he gave a eulogy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never knew his best friend as well as I would have liked, but I knew he was a good man. He was engaged, and his fiancee and I had spent many a day together planning their wedding. She was completely star struck and in love. And now, her heart is destroyed, and her life is in shambles. She calls my husband a few times a week to talk, and it's soul crushing to hear those conversations. She moved in with us for a few months while she found herself again, and it was a strain, but she needed it and we understood that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway. My husband wasn't coping well. All of his time was spent either working, or helping his best friend's family. His hair started graying, then falling out in the shower. He was a constant mess, or he was shutting down. He never took a break from work, from helping the family, from supporting me and my endeavors, not even from his own creative projects. The stress piled up fast, and he ended up attempting to overdose on prescription medication. He failed, and was in the hospital for two days. I was there with him from the moment I got the call. I was worried, then I was mad, then I cried a lot while he slept, then I was mad again, then I went back to being worried. His mom and I convinced him to take some time off and go to therapy. 

It was all going okay, and things were getting back to normal, when I ruined it. I had left for work, and he had a panic attack I guess, and stayed in the corner of our bedroom all day crying, shaking, and according to the neighbors, screaming. I came home and saw that none of the chores were done, the bed was unmade, and I got mad. In my anger I said ""you haven't stopped looking afraid since he died!"" I hate myself for that. I hate myself so goddamn much for saying that. I went to my mom's house that night, and left him alone. I thank God every day now that he didn't kill himself then. Instead, he started packing my things, thinking I wanted out when I didn't come back that night. 

So we went to couples counseling, something he knew a bit about, since he used to be a counselor for at-risk teens. We went to someone he said had an amazing reputation, and it helped us a lot, but we stopped going because he felt guilty. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, at that point it had been four months since we had sex, and I was horny, for the lack of a better word. I got it in my head that maybe having sex would help him? I tried initiating, which isn't our norm, and it spooked him. He caught on to what I was doing, and started apologizing, which killed the mood, and I again got mad at him, saying that we couldn't just go without sex until he got his shit together. You see the pattern here? Of me being a shit wife? So, we eventually had sex later in the week, and it was an amazing release for me, and a stressful rollercoaster for him, because he did it because he felt bad, I think.  

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I felt like nothing was working right, and I actually got mad at his dead best friend for not only ruining his own marriage, but mine, too. I felt like I was a shitty friend to his fiancee, and a shitty wife. I wanted to be better, so I went to therapy myself, to see if an outside perspective would help me improve. My husband saw the visits' co-pays on our online bills, and put two and two together. He then apologized even more, thinking that his handling of his situation had driven me to the edge. After I explained, he understood, but I could tell it still weighed on him. I stopped going to therapy after that, which kinda' sucks because I feel like I still need it, but I don't want to upset my husband, so...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry this is long, but as I write, more comes spilling out and it feels so good to write it all down. 

&amp;#x200B;

You have to understand who my husband was. He was a hilarious stand-up comedian, a compassionate teen counselor, a brilliant freelance editor, a charming customer service rep, and a gifted poet. I loved that he wore so many hats so well. I told him last night that he was all of those things that I just described to you. I wrote those exact words down for him. He took the paper and began scribbling out my adjectives, and replacing them all with ""scared."" It breaks my heart to see my husband like this, and it makes me afraid, too, because I feel like I'm losing the man he was. He used to talk to me about football, and I don't care about football, but the way he talked about it made me care enough to be interested in what he was saying. I miss that. I miss hearing about football from my husband, and if someone could please help me, I just want to have the courage to ask him to play a game of Magic: the Gathering with me again. 

He's always saying to people, ""the best is yet to come,"" and I wish he could feel that in his own life again.

311,"Before I go into anything, I live in the U.K. so the school system is a little different. I left school at 16 and have had part time jobs but mainly haven’t done anything

I’m now 18 and it’s my final chance to go to college. I want to do musical theatre/acting but this means 2 years of full attention dedicated to my course. I won’t have much time to work but this career is very much what I want to do, it would be really exciting for me. 

However, my mum really wants me to move out, I’m always low on money it feels like I should really be in full time work now. I also would love to move out 

My boyfriend is also an actor and he works part time whilst looking for auditions so this is an option for me 

This is my last chance to go to college and get a degree in what I want to do so that hopefully I can go to university when I finish. 

I’ve been debating the options for nearly a year I’m so stuck on what to do, could I do dance in my spare time? Get a degree in dance in my spare time? Acting classes? College seems like the best route for the career I want but I’m just really not sure

However this week hasn’t been good to me with things going on in my life and I don’t think I’m able to handle an inspection right now, is there something I can tell them to say “I just need a few days to get things in my life in order” before I can deal with the inspection?

316,"So my pregnant sister is due around this week, probably this weekend, which is great. But i don’t know if i want to go- hear me out

So me and my sisters have never been entirely close, i mean when the breakup first happened with our parents and i was isolated from them, my oldest and pregnant sister fought hard to try and get me back, but now that i am back she dose not really care about me. At our last gathering i was literally the drag along because we have to guy

I’m the butt of my sisters’ jokes and my second oldest treats me like absolute shit and no doubt she’ll be there. They helped me a lot but at the cost of downplaying everything i care about and scorning me for liking what i do. I hide so damn much from my family to avoid scorn about my hobbies. Even now that i’ve finally landed a job and i’m trying my hardest at it- they shrug me off. Their boyfriends also see me as a joke, which hurts. Even at the wedding i was joked about. It just.. i don’t love them anymore like a sister should.

Everyone says “tell them to back off” but they don’t, when i tell a family member they say that i’m too sensitive or that my sisters mean well and i should be nice to them. I try to avoid my family as much as i can really, ever since i was isolated and brought back they’ve been infuriatingly obsessed with me to going back to normal, pretending i wasnt even there half the time. 

Hell, as a kid they would not let me hang out with them at school and i was so scared of been left alone with the second oldest as a kid that i would beg mum to take me with her anywhere. I got my parents numbers incase something went wrong but she always took them away from me to further push me around. I’m a very push over person to an extent, but my sisters i have seen to be very pushy and stubborn. They once got into an extreme physical fight over a tv remote in their teens! A legit beat up. It scared me because i was already secretly in an abusive household but to see them that way made me sick. They’re close minded and just in general every visit goes the same, i’m made out to be the stupid kid even though i’m 19. They played a part in my certain mental unwellness and i look to them for examples of how not to act.

I don’t think its worth it, i mean the baby will probably be cute and it’d be a great moment.. but i just don’t feel happy around them anymore. Whatever desperation my oldest had to get me back was beaten out of her and she gave up trying and now just shrugs me off. Last trip the two talked to everyone more than me, i attempted to make the small talk most of the time. I just.. don’t feel wanted by my own family. I’m the black sheep and it’s never going to change. 

Should i go and deal with the scorn just to maybe see the birth or should i stay home till after the birth and figure out when to meet the baby? Also i’m worried they’ll be angry at me and also block me from seeing the kid, i mean it’s upto her and it wouldn’t break my heart too severely but it would be awkward going to family gatherings from then on. I just.. eh.",18Jun2019,1
317,"I (20F) and my boyfriend (20M) have been dating over a year. We are both in the same college. During college, we live together, however over the summer we both live with our families (over 4 hours away) or at internships (over 8 hours apart).

Our first summer apart was really unhealthy. We had a lot of problems that we didn’t hash out and that took up a lot of time when we were apart. It was a real struggle and painful. We were dependent on each other and would get upset with each other when the other was busy. It was awful. 

We then went through a year of school and made some major life changes. We both grew as people and learned to calm down and let each other be. This summer has been nothing but healthy. We of course have occasional fights, but they aren’t anywhere near the severity of last summer, and we both have healthy lives outside of each other.


The problem is, I just feel happier with him. I know I’m still young, but is it crazy to try to find internships in the same city next year in an attempt to live either together or near each other??

318," 

Hey there.

&amp;#x200B;

As a little bit of background information: Her mom died in a car accident when she was 3 years old, after that it has only been me and her. I'm in a relationship, but just for the last 4 years and we aren't living together, so there is no motherly figure around to include.

&amp;#x200B;

I left work early last week and while approaching our door, I looked through our living room windows and saw her passionately making out with her best friend (15, female) on our sofa. Could've been just making out, could've been foreplay, either way I didn't want to walk into them and went to get groceries, I'm 99% sure they didn't see me.

I've known this friend of hers for about 8 years, they've always been glued together, cuddly, sleeping in the same bed etc., but I never thought anything about it.

I'm from a very conservative catholic family and while I'm still uncomfortable with it, I've been thinking about the topic a lot and made up my mind. I love my daughter more than anything in this world and I could never be like my parents who gave me hell for having premarital sex with my then girlfriend and tried to separate us. My first impulse was definitely to freak out, but what good would it do? I would end up accepting it at some point anyway and would risk damaging our relationship for nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm not sure how to go from here. My daughter obviously didn't want me to know (yet?) or she wouldn't have kept it a secret. I don't want to make her uncomfortable, but I just want her to know that I love her, support her and that she doesn't have to hide their relationship from me. If she doesn't want to share, because that's just how teenage girls are with their dads sometimes, that's cool with me - I just don't want her to be scared of opening up about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Another less urgent problem is going to be the extended family with special focus on my parents. There already is this one gay second degree cousin or something along those lines (I'm not good with family relations and we have a large family) (mid 20s, male) and about half of our family doesn't even acknowledge his existence anymore. My parents sadly are part of this.

As much as it would suck to be uninvited from extended family gatherings, we both never cared for most of them all that much anyway and could still keep contact with the 'good' part of our family, so the only big issue are my parents.

Now, my parents really are complete shits. Don't get me wrong, they are my parents and I love them, but objectively speaking they are terrible. We are talking being physically forced to learn the bible, spanking with the belt if not obedient, locking 17 year old me into my room to stop me from seeing my girlfriend, calling her a whore that's trying to mislead me etc.

My father is very vocal about his hatred of gay people when they are even mentioned on TV or (god forbid) he sees a gay couple on the street and has only very begrudgingly accepted the fact that I'm not teaching his family values to my daughter and for example don't force her to dress 'appropriately'. I guess you get the picture.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone here been in a similar situation?

&amp;#x200B;

My main questions are

\- How do I approach my daughter about this in the right way to let her know that I accept and love her?

\- How do I handle my family, especially my parents? She loves them and they love her in their own absurd way, but I really fear they might break ties with her over this. I want to try my best to prevent it from happening, because I know how much it would hurt her and myself. If they end up breaking with her, I definitely would break with them, as much as I don't want to. I don't think living a double life forever is going to be an option for my daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

but i would be thankful for any advice in general.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

319,"Hi Reddit,

I'm an old man, and I don't have any people I can talk to, but I'm in a bad situation.

A little backstory -
I (36m) and my wife (33f) have been together since 2010.  Last month, my daughter was born; and things have changed.

I know it's not about me, it's about the kid.  I try to keep that focus.  Weekdays I work 9 hours and then come home to give the wife 4 hours sleep.  Saturdays I take the whole night.  In addition I handle most of the cooking, cleaning, shopping, and care for our dog.

But lately, **EVERYTHING** is my fault.  If the baby is crying, I did something to cause it.  Baby is spitting up, I'm overfeeding her.  Baby is dirty, I should have changed her.  Baby is clean?  I'm wasting diapers.  She won't let me get the full four hours with the baby either, she'll get up early; or wake in the middle of the night.  It wastes the effort I'm putting in to help her sleep, and cheapens the time I should be having with my daughter.

It's a constant stream of judgement and blame out of her.  I'm to the point I'm losing sleep, and honestly a little pissed off at her.  I want to just say, ""hey, fine, deal with it on your own"", but it's my kid and I deserve time with her too.  

I've started looking into counselors.  But what else can I do here?",18Jun2019,4

322,"Hi there,

I have a problem that I am unable to solve. My mother constantly gets on my case about my weight through snide comments. Things like, ""you need to lose that"" in regards to my stomach, ""stop eating so much"" if I grab a snack (even if it's something light like crackers), etc.

I've recently been exercising and taking a more serious approach to weight loss. I told my mother about it and shames my methods, claiming cycling won't do anything. Most recently, she used it against me and told me to go exercise in a negative way on a rest day.

Beyond this, she often judges what I wear. If it's anything remotely form fitting, she suggests I change my clothes. She'll sometimes look over me with clear intentions to mock but say nothing. As a result, my actual wardrobe is rather limited. She tells me I always wear the same clothes too.

The other day, she told me to stop eating when I went for a snack and I didn't take it well. It's been building up and I went to my room to cry. The next day, I was very sad, perhaps depressed, and had to leave work only 10 minutes into my shift due to just breaking down into tears.

I do so much for my mom. I pay more than half her rent, I pay for her TV (which I don't watch), I pay for her cell phone and I pay for internet too.

I was so hurt and upset I stopped eating for almost 3 days. A friend convinced me to eat and I had a small bowl of curry. It's all I've eaten in 4 days.

I've tried taking to my mom about this, but she treats it as a joke or just denies doing it. She'll focus on the small stuff and dismiss the harm it does overtime.

I recently blocked her from the wifi out of spite, hoping it would give her time to reflect. She does not work.

A little back story, I left school at 16 and haven’t done anything for 2 years due to personal reasons, I’ve achieved nothing. I want to have a career in performing arts/dance/musical theatre and I have 2 options on going about this. 

Option 1 - Go to college and study performing arts 

Pros: 
• I will leave college in 2 years trained in all areas of performing arts 

• Meet people with the same interest in performing 

• Be able to go to university after my course is over 

Cons:
• It’s about an hour to get there everyday 

• I won’t be able to work with my performing commitments (and I’m already 18) 

• I won’t be able to move out/afford anything for that matter


Option 2 - Get a job and pay for adult drama/acting classes and go to auditions in my spare time 

Pros: 
• I will be able to afford to move out 

• I can pick which areas of performing I want to have a career in instead of following a curriculum 

• money ? 

Cons:
• I have literally 0 friends and I mean 0, will I find a good group of friends not going to uni and college? 

• I won’t have official training 

• I can’t go to university

327,"Okay so to start I'll say I tend to drink too much and am an extremely opinionated person, often against my better judgement, and tend to ""troll"" sometimes when I'm depressed or particularly upset about the state of the world.

Someone I lived and worked with for some time years ago, much older than me (24) btw, after becoming close friends, became indoctrinated by the alt-right pipeline and insane, deranged Q-anon and pizzagate conspiracies over the years since. He'd send me these videos that would shock me at how delusional they were, and eventually I started responding with actually reputable, intelligent articles and opinion pieces about why he was wrong about supporting the president and those conspiracies.

Over time I noticed that what he was sharing and sources he was sending came from increasingly legitimate crypto-fascist, alt-right, white nationalist sources. Nothing like the Stormer or anything, but obscure conspiracy websites referring to things like ""semetic"" conspiracies, Moloch worshipping baby blood drinking rituals, talk of ""identity"" and ""nationalism"" against ""globalism,"" etc.

So eventually our exchanges became more argumentative and testy, until I decided to send him a ContraPoints video about how to recognize crypto fascism, which he had been steadily, albeit I really think unknowingly, buying more and more in to.

He immediately responded by calling her, a transgender woman and someone I look up to a lot, ""it"" and a tranny and a faggot, and saying he would refuse to watch it, and while very drunk I lost it and blew up, said fuck him, that he was an idiot, a goddam dumbass, bigoted asshole piece of shit scumbag and etc and that we were done.

Although today, some time later, I sent him basically a copypasta eloquently detailing many of the fucked-up things the president has done, and he has responded by calling me a tranny and a faggot a bunch of times, saying he was going to make me the bitch I've always wanted to be for some weird, suppressed homosexual fucking reasons I think, and that he was going to find me, break my trolling fingers, and then kill me, ending with that he was coming.

To my knowledge he doesn't know exactly where I live currently, fortunately. He blocked me right after so I can't see his page, but I immediately screenshotted his threatening posts and sent them, his full name, and phone number to numerous people who know him and me.

I had my friend check his Facebook and it says he's going to a music festival at the end of the month across the country, so I should be safe until then, but then he made comments saying he'd be visiting the state I live in afterwards.

Now I'm thinking, should I file an initial police report to have it already on record today? My thing is, the absolute last thing I want to do tomorrow is spend it talking with state or federal police, and I really, really don't want to have to give up my phone for them to analyze if they can't simply log our chats, solely because I value privacy and distrust law enforcement to a degree.

Also, I would be concerned about getting him in serious trouble for something I'm not sure if he's really going to do, and then face retaliation for ""snitching"" later.

But I’m living with someone who will just not respect the house, who won’t clean up after themselves and when prompted to do so will just tell you to fuck off or somewhere along the lines. At the moment my biggest annoyance is that because we all live in a student house recycling is sometimes an issue on storing it until, the collection day. I made a box about 8m from the kitchen that sorts it out for you and is close to the door and not in any rooms so it doesn’t smell (it’s in a big porch we have), but the housemates refuse to use it because it’s out of the way or some other lame excuse, and allows theirs to build up in the corner of the kitchen till it grows mold . Which is obviously very annoying. I’m just wondering what I should do and can reddit help, at this point I’ve given up trying to make them clean and just wanna make it difficult for them to carry on being the house asshole .

340,"A friend in my friend group cheated on his long term girlfriend about last December. They're still together and I just found about this now as it's been kept quite secret.

As far as I know, he hasn't cheated again, and they're still together. I must admit that I do not know what has gone on between them since he cheated, I don't know if she knows or not.

A number of the people in the group are quite angry at him and are quietly excluding him from our group events, but nobody thusfar has confronted him or told his partner as far as I know.

Since we are close friends and have a lot of mutual respect for eachother, I am extremely disappointed in him and I want to do something about it, but I don't want to be a busy-body. I understand that people can make mistakes and become better people, but at the same time I think his partner has the right to know. I think these are my options:

- tell his girlfriend what I know [I think this is the silliest option, especially since I don't know what's gone on between them since he cheated]

- meet with him and tell him that I found out he cheated. Talk through what happened and tell him that I  think he has a responsibility to tell her he cheated if hasn't so far. I could also then tell him if you don't tell her I will (I am completely unsure of how I feel about giving him an ultimatum like that).

- Do nothing (I don't like this option either)

What should I do? Has anybody experienced a similar situation and how did you deal with it? Thanks.",18Jun2019,1
341,"Hey there! So, first things first. A couple months ago i finished my Masters degree in Advertising and PR, and after a few months I took an offer to work at a company, developing their social networks.

However, i didn't think a lot about it and immediately said ""yes"" (without signing the contract per se, but knowing the conditions"". It doesn't pay a lot (far from it, only 50€ more than what you get with the minimum wage where i live), i would be working alone 8h per day without having anyone to talk to (there's literally only one other person at the office).

So, once i arrived, and after a few days, i talked to my boss and told him i wasn't feeling really motivated to work there, that i wasn't sure if that was the right step to take and that maybe i would need to work at a different place with a different environment. So we decided to part ways at that moment and i told him that, maybe, I would be spending the next few days thinking about what i really want.

One week later (today), I feel like maybe i should have given it a go, even if it's not that big of a salary and the environment is not exactly motivating. Should I call him and try to talk it out with him?",18Jun2019,1

343,"I have this problem about what I did and about myself. The story is REALLY LONG.

I think I have a crush on my friend or I just enjoy being with him, still not sure but leaning towards crush. We're both guys. One night, we slept on the same bed. He was drunk and sleeping. I wasn't drunk, I don't drink. I woke up early and I had the urge to touch him in private part. No reaction whatsoever. I thought maybe I can make him hard. I was touching him for a while when I tried to put my hands inside his shorts and brief. I was now touching his dick and massaging it and masturbating it until it became hard. After a while it came to me that I was doing something wrong so I stopped. By this time he was almost fully hard and he wasn't snoring anymore. I felt guilty and scared because he might have noticed and woken up. I stopped.

The next day I was having a hard time because of the guilt. I tried to lie and tell partial truths. I told him I was experimenting if drunk guys don't feel anything while asleep so I was touching and poking his body and dick then it became hard. He was laughing at me and assured me it was alright and it was normal for it to become hard given that I stimulated it. I got some relief but not telling him everything was making me guilty even more. I decided to tell him the truth, every piece of it. I apologized. At first he didn't believe me but as I told him everything thru text, as he wanted, he just tolde that I was alright. It was already done and don't repeat it again. I was relieved and confused at the same time. I was expecting him to lash out, be angry with me. I was expecting so much worse but he took it quite well. Being the curious me and maybe hoping that somehow he might have liked it or me, I asked why he reacted that way. His response was he just don't want to think about it since we're also workmates who see each other everyday. And I should not open it up anymore.

With that response I was sad because it was not what I expected and I felt that he hated me. For some time after that conversation, we didn't talk. He won't reply to me. We kept our distance. I was really really sad. And what had happened was all I could think about. I was also afraid of reconnecting. But after several weeks we were starting to go back to normal. There are still some shyness but there is progress.

I want to know what you guys think.
I know I did something wrong but I want to know if there's still a chance for thing to go back to the way they were before? I really miss him and our friendship.
We're on speaking terms now, do you think I could joke about it even on subtle notes?
What can you say about his reaction? I think I'm still hoping that he enjoyed it maybe we can be more than friends.
What should I do?

Thanks and sorry for the long story. I'm just troubled.",18Jun2019,1
344,"I decided to ask to skip a grade because my few friends where in the grade above me and I didn't want to be alone when they went to grade 10 which is high school in my area. I am a great math student and I am a couple years ahead in math because I work on it online for fun with pretty good success. I knew i could handle the schoolwork so i said why not.

At first it was great but I soon relized that the age gap would be more of a problem than I thought. I tried to socialize with others but they where just so much older that the gap was too much. I am now very lonely. My few friends are still there but I really dont fit in well generally. 

This has taken a huge impact on my mental health. I have slowly become withdrawn anxious and quieter. I have problems remembering things. It's not ideal. And since I'm going to high school next year theres gonna be even more stress and I probably wont handle it that well.

Ok so yesterday I was at my girlfriends house. I had fed both of my cats before leaving, and they decided that they both wanted to be outside when I left. (We don't have a cat door) I'm home alone so they'd be on their own for a while. The plan was for me to be back home at around midnight, though that didn't happen. I stayed there for the night, mostly because I didn't want to take the subway to the ""poorer"" parts of town where I live in the middle of the night. I figured that the cats would be fine. They're a male and a female, sister and brother, about 10 months old. I got back a few hours ago and I put some food in a bowl and put it on the porch to see if they'd come back. So far, not a trace. I know that cats are independant and go wherever and whenever they so please, which can be far away and for a long time, however, my cats have never really done so. Should I be worried? I'm gonna go look for them in the area in a little while.

I feel so depressed looking in the mirror. I’m sexualized and objectified like a toy because I have curves, yet I’m somehow underweight. My thighs touch, I can’t wrap my hands around them, I can grab fat on my midsection. I want to look like them, I don’t want to look like me anymore.

But I don’t want to be ugly anymore. I want to be really skinny. That looks so ideal to me, even though I know they’re starving. I don’t know what to do... I can’t be healthy and look like them, but I can’t handle being like this anymore. I can’t.

Recently I’ve been talking/texting a girl I’ve met online for a few days now, I set up the pre-plans for a date, and now I feel like backing off. I’ve done this too someone else too, but I feel I may have tricked myself with the notion that “I don’t have enough time to start a relationship” and that she was going away for a few months this summer. Honestly, they both were good looking girls that seemed to be interesting besides the looks, but I don’t know why I backed off. Too much porn? Too much hentai? Am I just being lazy? Have I hooked up with too many people to the point where I only crave a sexual relationship and not one of true connection? Even while I was texting her, I was thinking about hooking up with other women before I ‘started’ the relationship in order to get ‘one last go’, but If I’m feeling that, then do I really like her enough to warrant a possible relationship?

Maybe I’m going about relationships wrong? Should I just wait until I find someone irl that just clicks the moment I talk her?

Today they got back to him that he is ineligible because they found an account under his name for a large amount of money. We've been searching the document it's a Bank/Firm March Balance Individual Information sheet. Payee information a company which he has no association with (never worked for them etc.), and Payer information is a bank he doesn't or never had an account with. The statement also says ""Trust Fund Ind"" with Acct type underneath it. 

He says this isn't his and is unsure of next steps. Could it be fraud/ a case of stolen identify. He now is also going to most likely get denied any assistance until this is sorted out. 

1) Is there anyway to identify if this is some fraud account someone opened in his name?

2) Or confirm it really does belong to him as perhaps a trust someone opened in his name? (he says he doesn't know anyone that would do that for him). 

3) If it is fraud how does one go about resolving/clearing this up? 

4) does he need a lawyer to resolve this or could he do it without one?

He’s given me a trillion mixed signals like...
- we were in science together and we were mucking around with each other and it was pretty fun and he stared in my eyes in a way that just felt so warm butttt I requested to follow him on ig a few days later and he left my request for 2 days and then declined it.
- whenever he comes to sit with my group, he comes and usually sits really close to me, like knees touching etc. and he usually steals my phone and food and stuff just to get a reaction out of me (and nobody else at the table) and he jokes around with me and stuff but a few weeks ago he went ahead and told a mutual friend that I annoy him.
- we were at another mutual friends birthday party and all night he was laughing way too much at all my shitty jokes and stuff like that but on the same night, when faced the prospect of kissing me (because I wouldn’t play truth or dare and we had the rule that if you didn’t play you’d be forced to kiss him, bc he was the only boy there) he said that he’d rather jump out of a top story window and then laughed about it (which kinda ruined my night ngl).
- lastly, a few weeks ago he got a girlfriend (in which this relationship only lasted a few days thankfully but that’s not the point), they were walking home, the same way I did, and he ran ahead of his girlfriend laughing, while she was tryna catch up, he looked straight into my eyes and gave me that same warm look.

I have no clue how he actually feels about me and any opinions would be amazing, someone just give me an opinion on what to do 

And I really hope he’s not on this sub because he would guaranteed know who I am and that he’s who I’m talking about but anyways, any suggestions?

Tbh, though, I really don’t like it here much. My grandma’s a bit demanding about when our chores are to be done- like immediately when I get home from work, no chance to eat or anything.

And while most of her cost-saving rules are fine, she will only let us shower once a week to save water. It’s... unpleasant.

The attic is in a way a “finished” attic, so not unbearable. But it is still an attic, so just not as nice as an actual house part of a house. Mainly any sort of temperature control is non-existent.

I have accumulated $8000 worth of debt this passed year. This is obviously an important factor here.

My current boyfriend and I have plans to move into his dad's second house in a new town, which will be rented to us for pretty cheap. $500/month plus utilities. I already have a job set up here and was looking forward to it until a couple days ago.

I had a total change of heart. I now want to move back home and live a completely self sufficient lifestyle, which I have always wanted to do, even as a little kid. This would be possible as my mom's partner owns a big plot of land and would be willing to let me live on it for very cheap or even free. I already own an rv, this is what I'd be living out of. I could have a huge garden, some chickens and even a goat, and live a quiet and modest life. The problem here is that it is really hard to find work in my hometown. The only a couple options I can think of here are contacting my old manager and asking for my old job back, and doing independent residential cleaning, which may not work out as this town is tiny and there may not be enough of a demand. I am also a ""retired"" cam model and actually had a big following so I could always go back to that too, although not ideally.

&amp;#x200B;

The only things holding me back from going home are my debt, my boyfriend, and the fact that the weather where I currently am is so much warmer than back home. I might also burn bridges job wise by leaving, so I might not be able to change my mind back.

I thought maybe whoever names it would have the requestor create a story line about its life with pics so they can watch what they named live its life (inanimate objects included).

373,I had worked at a casino for 7 years as a cage cashier and loved my job. One night I had taken a 50 dollar counterfeit bill.

376,"I work for a family owned business as a receptionist and I like the job because I can do school work when I'm not busy and it's a relaxing environment. I've been there almost 2 years and I've noticed my boss (who is the owner of the store) and her assistant (who is her best friend) are becoming really nasty towards me and others. Here are some comments they have made to me: you're gonna be a fat bride if you don't stop eating, you can get fat off of soup so you better watch how much you eat, do you know how many calories are in grapes?, if you keep eating bananas you're gonna be even fatter, you're so flat chested that shirts don't look good on you, is your mother a big woman like you? You actually look pretty when you wear makeup and when you don't you look horrible. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are some comments that have been made towards other employees: if you don't stop eating like that you're gonna die young like your dad (this employees dad had passed away a week before this comment was made), you gotta lose weight \*slaps belly\*, are your parents round like you?, you're gaining a lot of weight is your doctor okay with that? (this was said to a pregnant employee), maybe if you went for a walk you wouldn't be so fat. One day they bought us lunch and for 14 of us they got 1 pizza(8 slices) and said we don't need 1 slice each because we all need to cut back on our weight. 

&amp;#x200B;

Clearly my boss and her assistant are obsessed with weight and appearance. At first I used to tell them to go bother someone else but now I don't want to waste my energy. Usually I'll just ignore the comments or walk away but one comment made me cry so bad and I haven't forgiven them. My best friend had passed away and when I came to work 2 days after it happened they asked me how it felt having a friend die from suicide and how horrible I should feel for not saving my friend (for context my friend DID NOT commit suicide, they just wouldn't stop believing it was because it was an unexpected death of a 23 year old). 

&amp;#x200B;

The logical thing to do would be to go to HR but the HR person is the owners niece, when I've gone to her with problems before she hasn't listened and brushed it off and told me I was being a little dramatic. I'm getting to the point where I want to tell my boss how hurtful it is because I suffered with an eating disorder for almost 8 years and her comments just bring me back to a dark place but I  also don't want to give her the benefit of the doubt that she hurt me. Other employees have told me how hurtful their comments are and how degrading it is. The other owner isn't really present because he is a lawyer and I'm afraid he would try to sue me if I went to someone on a work board or hotline about all the things they do that is really not nice.

378,"So I’ll keel this fairly brief. This is the first time I have ever adapted a dog. I have another dog, but I got him when he was only a few months old from a breeder and he’s been (for the most part) great. My now wife had her own pup before we started dating, but now that we’ve been together for several years, I treat her dog as one of my own too. 

We decided to expand our home and ended up adopting a 1 year old dachshund/lab mix who’s pretty timid. We’ve had him for over a week and he’s really bonded with our other dogs and gets along with my wife perfectly fine. Follows her around and everything. 

Me on the other hand, he has has growled at me, always runs away from me and hides, barks at me if there are any “fast” movement, and generally doesn’t listen to me. I love love love dogs and love how great our other dogs are with me. But this dog..I haven’t done anything but try to be super nice and loving to him all the time, but he still doesn’t seem to like me. I’ve tried feeding him, giving him treats anytime I get him to come over to me, petting and being nice to him, sit down and have him come to me, etc... all to no avail. 

I feel horrible saying this, but I really feel like I don’t like this dog at all. He’s making me feel like I’m doing something wrong, but I am most certainly not. It feels like things just won’t get better and this dog will always have some unknown issue with me. 

I don’t know what to do, Reddit. I’m half tempted to call the foster we got him from, explain the situation, and ask them to take him back. I don’t want to give up on this dog, but it’s been awful. And between adoption fees, a vet visit, food, toys, bed, etc.. we’re already about $600 in on this new dog.

I eat healthy, I sleep from 10 pm to 7 am, I have friends and family that support me, I have two beautiful healthy children, and financially I can take care of myself and them. Still I find myself hating almost every minute of everyday.

I feel like I don't know how to cope with the crap that these two have put me through, and I can't get this nagging feeling out of my head that it was somehow my fault.

381,"I have been going to the gym after work with my co-worker for about 2 months now. We go 3-4 times a week and so far things have been going well. I'm starting to have an issue though. She writes up our workout plan everyday (which is fine) but she instists on increasing everything we do every day. For example, yesterday we did 85 crunches so today she wants to do 90.

I have no problem pushing us further and trying to do more, but we also need to be able to sustain the workout we are already doing and right now I feel like we are struggling.

I'm also worried about the next few weeks as those 90 crunches increase to 100 and 115. We are barely able to do 85 and yet she wants to be at 115 by the end of next week. It just seems like too much.

I don't know how to say something to her because she has a hard time taking criticism. But I feel like we are going to hurt ourselves if we keep going at this rate. 

I was always taught that when you exercise, you find a routine that will push you. You stick with that routine until it becomes a little easier and THEN you increase it. But she seems to think that if you aren't doing 5, 10, or 15 more than you did yesterday then you are failing...


*I'd also like to note that if we were ONLY doing crunches, I think that would be ok. But we are going crunches, leg raises, rear delts, overhead triceps, fire hydrants, planks, wall sits, and lunges (not necessarily in that order).

382,"Hi /r/advice,

I'm a 23 year old guy who is living in Sydney, Australia. I completed high school but I have no other completed qualifications, and I have no work experience.

Long story short, I've been sad for as long as I can remember. I'm gay (but no one knows yet), I'm asian, I'm short, I'm unattractive, I was poor, I was bullied in primary school, I was bullied in high school, and I came home to my family constantly criticising me so I think it goes without saying that I didn't do too well in high school but somehow I did get accepted into a university. I went to university for a year and passed 5 classes and failed 2 classes because I just couldn't focus due to how sad I was, I transferred to another university, went there for 1.5 years and I passed 1 class and failed 8 classes for the same reason - I just couldn't focus. Then I decided to drop out because I knew I was too sad to do anything but I didn't have the money to see a psychologist so for the past 2 years or so, this is what I've done on most days - I would sleep at 1-3AM due to my anxiety, wake up at 1PM due to being too sad to get out of bed, I would get ready in the bathroom, get something to eat, go on the computer for a few hours, eat dinner (if I'm really sad then I skip dinner), go on the computer for a few hours (or knit for a few hours), shower, go to bed - rinse and repeat.

I always thought that this would be my life but a few months ago, something changed. When I was in high school, there was this neighbour of mine who I used to always knit with. I know it might seem weird considering that we are two guys but we used to knit squares and he would stitch them together and we would donate completed blankets to a charity that donated the blankets to those in need (people in poverty, people experiencing natural disasters, etc). It was a win-win for me - I enjoyed knitting, I was quite good at it and he often praised me for doing some quite complex patterns, and when he moved out to move into a nursing home, I would still make the effort to see him once a week if I could just to say hello and sometimes even knit with him. Anyway, he passed away quite a while ago and of course I was really upset about it but I was sad anyway so I got through it and moved on but a few months ago I was informed that he gave me some money in his will and I won't say how much it was but it was more than enough for me to live on for the rest of my life. So as soon as I could, I saw an independent financial planner who is very well respected and I trust completely and she is investing it for me and I'm basically set for life (her words).

I know I want to move out of my parents' place (I'm not sure where to yet), I know I want to become independent and I know I want to focus on my physical/mental health which I have been neglecting for far too long but I don't really know what else to do because I don't know what I'm passionate about and I don't know what I'm good at. Should I volunteer and focus on studying and getting a job only when I feel ready? Or should I study anything as soon as I can to keep myself busy? I just don't know what to do right now so I would appreciate any advice. I apologise in advance for any late replies - it's quite late here in Sydney and my internet often cuts out (just add it to the list of bad things that have happened in my life...).",18Jun2019,4

396,"My little sister moved back in with my parents because she was dealing with depression, and a herniated disc in her lower back. She was also unemployed and had no money. She's 23.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving back to my parents seems to have taken her from functionality depressed to debilitatingly so. Although she goes to counselling every other week, and is seeing a specialist for her back, being in a town where she has no social circle, with my parents who I know from experience while happy to financially support us through our health difficulties (both mental and physical) generally become unwelcoming after spending too much time at home. My mom especially gets annoyed when she has to ""see us moping around"" despite having many mental health issues herself (one would think she would have more empathy), and responds very negatively to even the slightest suggestion she should back off a little. There is a reason my sister and I both moved out as soon as we went away to university and I haven't lived at home for a decade (I'm 28). They're both retired so basically it's the 3 of them at home a lot of the time, although my parents have hobbies and friends outside the house.   


I suggested, as my sister is now having trouble getting motivated to eat, shower or do anything other than sleep or spend all day on social media, that she make an appointment to see the doctor and ask to go on medication for her depression, even if temporarily, so she has more motivation to look for a job that will allow her to get out of my parent's house for the day. She has outright refused to do this since she moved back in with them, because as she wants to move back to the city she lived in before and doesn't want to make roots in my parent's city. She also doesn't want to get any work outside of her field (she works in the film industry) despite the fact that she is currently unable to work in this field due to her back (as her work in contract work, and she only started working last summer (barely worked 400 hours between June and December), she is not eligible for unemployment or disability benefits). Overall it's become a vicious cycle but the combination of depression and stubbornness has lead to her having nothing going on in her life besides occasional medical appointments, and thus her mental health declining.   


I'm trying to figure out, besides the tough love 'Call the doctor and ask for anti depressants' conversation I had with her on Sunday (which I normally don't do, but I think she needed), how can I support her from afar? I know my parents are not going to be emotionally supportive of her situation (but the financial support is appreciated), so she needs someone to help her in that way but I am unsure how.

Well A was strictly against drugs and threatened to leave multiple times, and I never paid much attention to her until she actually left me. 

I was a complete crying mess for two weeks at least, I slipped way further into drugs and I was destroying all my relationships. And being honest I can be a very toxic person and my pride gets in the way very much. That’s also why everyone left me. 

Let’s skip forward 4 months, randomly A calls me and says she wants to talk again. At the time I was trying to go sober so of course I agree cuz I thought we could fix what I broke. We hung out at her place and I took her to a parade, and right before I left she tried to kiss me. And Wow that really messed me up again. 

So she gets a new boyfriend Two hours after she tries to kiss me and then completely ghosts me, drops me like I didn’t mean shit to her. And it pissed me off but at that point I was back on drugs so nothing mattered but the drugs. 

Now here we are at the present time, last week I talked her 13 yro sister to drink and smoke with me. I’m 16. I basically was forced to tell A, and it turned into a shitshow. She was yelling and screaming at me, and banned me from seeing her or her sister.

He said something along the lines of: Oh, I thought you were Chinese because you look and dress Chinese, but I thought it was interesting because you don't have an accent. ??????????? I don't even know what ""dressing Chinese"" even means? I was definitely wearing a Gap sweater and Madewell denim jacket? Today, a pleasant customer told me how he liked our store and said that he would be leaving a nice yelp review. I was very thankful, but right after that, he asked me if I was Chinese or Korean. Honestly, I was okay with him asking me that, but I had a feeling this was going to head in a bad direction again. He asked me why I didn't have an accent. I told him I was born and raised in the states, but for some reason he kept thinking that I should have an accent? I was very succinct with him and might have come off as a bit rude in comparison to our first half of the conversation and other times he visited our store. I just need some advice on how to stay professional in these situations...... I want to make it known that they are being ignorant but at the same time be professional about it. What do you all think? Am I just overreacting and need to change my mindset?",18Jun2019,1
404,"Long post, need to vent a bit.

I just found a job, it's well paid, got a nice flat and own a car, have sufficient vacation.. Everything's outright perfect. Besides I absolutely despise my job, it was all I never wanted to do. I gave up college for this because my parents advised me to and I was stupid enough to listen. Now I'm stuck with a job that I need to work because I have to pay for my car what I need for work and my flat that I only got because I have this crap job. My parents don't understand how one can be so ungrateful if I have everything but.. I'd rather die than to work another 5 years at this job. I could go to college again but it's hard with finances and I'm not getting younger here. 

So today I came home, had a crap day and my mother told me to make a friendlier face. I said no, I feel terrible therefore I look terrible, leave me be, than I told her (in slightly other words) what I write now. 
""You're so ungrateful. You should think about this and be glad you have all this"" 
NO. I AM NOT. I HATE THIS LIFE. I HATE THAT I CHOSE THIS LIFE BECAUSE I LISTENED TO YOUR ADVICE. I HATE ME.

410,"She corrects everyone often about everything even the little things. She's unapologetically honest and provides her unsolicited opinion always. She's rather bold. As much as I envy and admire her for being this way, it can be hard for me to tell her what I think or provide criticism and correction because it will become an argument. She takes nothing personally, thereby she rarely thinks anything is her fault - meaning if she was rude to you, according to her you probably deserved it. It is very difficult to be as honest with her as she is with me. She's very closed off with her personal life, she's admitted she cannot stand people getting in her business or giving her advice YET she constantly provides unsolicited advice.

412,"I work at a nonprofit in the education field. When I started I absolutely loved going to work, I believed in the company mission and felt I was really making a difference in the world. 

About 5 months into my job, I started being reprimanded very frequently by my direct supervisor. It started with very reasonable complaints, but then I started getting reprimanded for very mundane things. Like wasting coworkers time because they come talk to me (me not initiating conversation) in the break room, being friends with my best friend at work makes people uncomfortable so I should terminate the friendship, and the craziest one to me being that I said goodbye to coworkers in a way that made people feel uncomfortable. For a while I became super paranoid because I didn’t know who was reporting me so frequently and I was very afraid of being fired. 

My best friend, we’ll call her Anne, she overheard a teammate, we’ll cal her Betty, report me to my boss for saying good morning to her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable. Though the boss promised I’d be reprimanded, she hasn’t done that and actually extended my employment instead. 

Now my boss is in an extended vacation and lately Betty has gone out of her way to befriend the project director (the head guy, basically is three levels higher than my boss), and his wife. Since then Betty has been given even more responsibilities and membership to more teams. Anne told me that one of her friends was in a meeting with the director and Betty.  Betty said that Betty told the director that there are weak links within the project that are holding us back, and she named me, Anne, and my boss, specifically saying she would do a better job managing than my boss currently does, and the director said that he would be in direct contact with my boss about next steps and possible termination of my teammates and boss.

This is Betty’s first real job, she is the sole worker of her family and has two children, so job security is super important to her, so she’s basically trying to eliminate her competition so that she can secure her future. 

I’m not sure what I should do. This situation makes me hate going to work now because I feel like anything I do will be twisted and reported to the director for evidence to use for my termination. Right now I’m actively searching for new work and am interviewing for different companies to try to get out as fast as possible.

And when we try to talk to her in a normal way it's like we are talking to the wall.

An aunt offers her nephew money, the nephew never asked for money and it’s around the nephew’s birthday. He could definitely use the money to help pay bills. (College-student living on his own- mid-twenties)

Aunt continues to text nephew and says she will send check, nephew says ‘Ok. Thank You!’ and then aunt asks (days later) if the check arrived and the nephew texts that he did receive the check. No further communication because they do not always stay in contact with one another.

Aunt then complains to a separate family member (her sister and nephew’s mother) that her nephew never even said ‘thank you’ for the money. WHAT? 

What advice do you give the nephew... and also break down the problematic communication in this dynamic...


TLDR- Aunt told nephew’s mother her never said thank you for random money sent to him that he never asked for... except that he did say thank you, apparently not the way the aunt expected. 

PS- the check was said to be ‘at least $200’ and upon arrival, the check was $250. A point was made that the check was ‘more than I said I was going to send’ during the conversation between aunt and sister/mother.

429,"Good evening, 

Sorry for the long enquiry. 

I dont really know what information you’d need but I was conceived through sperm donation. My donor number is accessible at Spring Hill QFG QLD. I only know my father was a sperm donor as my Mum had terminal cancer and told me in 2011 when I was 18. I was born 1993. My mother also had a previous sibling born 1990. They told her we were the same donor. The donor was chosen out of a catalogue to be the same characteristics as her husband at the time who was 5’9 olive skin and brown eyes. Her husband at that time and her divorced in 1996. 

I supplied an ancestry DNA test in 2018. I matched with female sibling 1 born December 1992 and male uncle at approximately 1700 centimorgans each. 

I have since worked out female sibling 1 was also a donor child and we are half siblings (we are now in regular contact) and male uncle is my biological uncle from my donor fathers side (he doesn’t want to keep in contact at all).

Female sibling 1 and I contacted the Spring Hill QFG and confirmed we are the same donor by asking for our donor number. We both live in Brisbane Australia and have done for most of our lives. We confirmed through Queensland Fertility Group there are 8 live children from our donation in Brisbane. So us 2 and 6 others. We traced our family history from male uncle  to know who our paternal grandfather is and paternal grandmother. They only conceived two offspring together - male uncle and  one other male. We know male uncle is our uncle and therefore second son is our father.

In a weeks span in May 2019 we got two more sibling matchups from ancestry. One being male sibling 1 from Sydney Australia and the other being male sibling 2 in London United Kingdom. The interesting thing is that male brother 1  has a sister 13 months older, Born March 1992. and male brother 2  has a twin sister both born, November 1992. 

So we all connected and tried to make sense of things. The fascination comes into play that all of female sibling 1 and I’s new siblings are all extremely international. One lives in London and grew up in Norway and Vietnam. His twin grew up in Norway and Vietnam the same as twin male and now lives in Melbourne. 

Female sibling 1 and I asked one male sibling  where he was conceived and he said Sydney. It is entirely possible that the sperm donation was sent interstate but the only information he said he got from the hospital was “ 3 conceptions”. No donor information and not any number of live children. 

Female sibling 1 and I  then enquired with QFG and asked about the birth information of our definite siblings from the Brisbane Spring Hill donation to which they replied; 

1) Male 1991
2) Female 1992 (Female sibling 1)
3)Unknown Male (possibly twin 1)
4) Unknown unknown (Possibly twin 2 female)
5) Female 1993 (Myself)
6) Female 1993
7) Male 1996 
8) Female 1996

Any insight to Australian regulation with this or where to go from here would be much appreciated

442,"Hi All, 

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that I need to get to a place of indifference, or you know, out of fucks to give in regards to a neighbor I've never actually met in person. Here is the situation and background: 

&amp;#x200B;

This neighbor's bedroom windows look directly into my backyard, back porch, and kitchen. I have backyard chickens, they are legal here, we are allowed up to 10 chickens, and I had 2. Quite a few people in my neighborhood do. About 6 months ago, this neighbor called the police and told them I had no food/water for chickens. This is untrue, I showed the policeman my chicken coop and the chickens (the chickens were free-ranging the backyard for bugs at the time), and told him how they free-range plus I feed them a mash in the mornings, so there isn't food in the coop at night for rodents. All was good. I forgot about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, about 4 months ago, my dog startled a skunk under our back porch and it sprayed. I posted in our local city FB group asking for advice on getting rid of the smell, and we found the access point and blocked it. This is when my neighbor commented on the post that my backyard was full of trash and weeds that attracted the skunk. I commented back that there is nothing wrong with the backyard, but that I had blocked the skunk's access, so the skunk was no longer living there, and offered to come over and talk to her so she could tell me specifically what she saw she wanted fixed. She ignored my reply. I did go out and weedeat and made sure that there weren't any other wildlife living in the sage or lavender, and that the backyard was in no way overgrown. There is a 20x20 unlandscaped portion directly below her bedroom windows, so I pulled everything out and put down weedcloth. I was embarrassed by her comments and worked to rectify them. The yard was fine. I have raised garden beds with tomato and zucchini plus thornless blackberry, sage, perennial marigold, lavender and rue in full bloom, so I was pretty pleased. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, about 2 months ago, a skunk sprayed her dog. I had no idea that happened, but a couple of weeks ago, she found my original post about the damn skunk and commented that it was my fault the skunk was in her yard because my yard is so ""crappy"" and drew in the skunk to her yard, and that because of me, she got bit and has to undergo rabies shots. I felt bad and commented that I was sorry that happened, that it must have been awful for her, and that I'd be willing to speak with her and address her grievances. She then said I was rude, and my yard is a nuisance and is drawing in rabid animals, she also made the same comments on other posts I'd made that had nothing to do with her. The admins in the FB group deleted her comments and I deleted mine. I ignored, but also checked the backyard, swept the walkways, did light maintenance. Last week, I was visited by code enforcement. She had measured from the corner of her house to the chicken coop in my yard and called code enforcement saying I was out of code. Turns out, the coop is within 6-12 inches of the 20 foot buffer zone required. However, in order for her to know where to measure, she had to really look into my yard through the fence because the coop is hidden behind a very full growth tree, sage, and rosemary. I'm not even sure how she could tell where my coop boundaries were. 

&amp;#x200B;

I actually ended up giving the chickens away, sadly. I'm upset about this because the chickens ate a ton of bugs and spiders and bugs off my veggies while free ranging, plus they provided fertilizer. I also put a privacy screen on top of the fence so she couldn't look into the yard from her window, since my yard vexes her so much. I also plan to put up additional privacy screening along the fence itself so she can't look through the slats, because: ew creepy.   


I realize I have a difficult neighbor, many of us do. I just want to stop thinking about it, I don't need to rent her space in my head. I figure all I can do is maintain my own yard and mind my own business, but every time I think about it, I become simultaneously angry and creeped out. I also don't want to reinforce her behavior using FB as a public platform to say bad things about me by doing things like getting rid of my pets or livestock because she blames me for something that is beyond everyone's control.

444,"I'm basically trying to figure out if the fact that I really hate my job is warranted, or if I'm just being stupid and just need to shut up and deal. 

I work in health insurance. Specifically, I'm a medical management specialist which nobody knows what we do. Not even our own bosses. 

We do the jobs nobody else wants to, we are the liaison between the other departments and the doctors who review cases, we do reports, check other peoples work, fix everybody's errors, check behind doctors,  make sure the doctors work looks good, do case managers work, thr list goes on. And of course everybody wants everything done not only perfectly but *yesterday*.  And Gods help us should someone else make a mistake and we dont catch it, it's our problem and it's a HIPAA violation on our record. 

Does this sound like its shitty to anyone else?

I have been trying to make a positive/negative list and the positives:

I work at home
I make enough to live off of being very very careful with budget. 

Do not outweigh the numerous negatives. Just the above outweigh it and it's not even all the negatives. I can't help shaking the feeling that I'm just being stupid and I need to grin and bear it. So I guess I'm kinda asking if AITA here for hating my job and wanting something else. 

My previous job was the same title but it was with another side of the company and it wasnt as bad as this one. I have been with this company for 4 going on 5 years.  They suddenly decided to move me because this side needed help and the market I handled closed. I started on this side April Fools Day and its felt like a sick joke ever since. All this time I havent felt like quitting until I got over here. Now it's a constant thought. I hate it so so much.",18Jun2019,1

448,"Sorry for the long story, I'm just looking for some advice on how to get out of an awkward situation with my parents.

About 12 years ago my parents took out a parent plus loan for myself to go to college. They didn't have the money and it was always intended that I'd pay it back. In order to have a lower interest rate for myself below the 7.8% rate (or whatever it was at the time), they took out equity on their home/and or took out a loan on part of a retirement account. They then paid the loan off and passed along a 2% interest rate to me with the loan in full. Starting in 1/2012 when I was out of undergrad they began asking for me to make payments, which I did. 

Fast forward to recent, I'm married and my wife and I are decently well off. In March 2019, in preparation of getting their finances together for purchasing a car with cash (as they always do to avoid debt - they're Dave Ramsey fans) my parents asked when we thought we'd be paying back the remaining amount of the personal student loan of $8500. I said that due to other expenses and loans, it didn't look like it would be this year.

Fast forward to mother's day, 5/2019... my wife and I were able to cut a check for the remainder of the balance of the loan for $8500, placed the check in the card, and mentioned upon my mom opening that the repayment was a gift to them so they can put it towards a car sooner. This was done in jest, but we didn't get my mom a gift due to the very high amount. The check was immediately cashed the next day.

Fast forward again, for Father's day we didn't get my dad a gift, which prompted them to mention how they didn't think a student loan repayment was a gift. They also said they weren't asking for a separate ""gift"" but wanted to just make it known repayment is not a gift and understand our thought process. This is the first part that I'm having trouble wrapping my head around.

I expressed to them that while I agree a repayment to a bank wasn't a gift, that having the repayment roughly 5 years ahead of schedule is the gift. Especially given the situation and on a personal loan. They didn't see the rationale. They mentioned a bank wouldn't see this early payment as a gift. I refuted that while true, the bank would be able to reinvest or lend out the money out to others. Further I stated, even if that were true, this situation is different. They are not a bank, the relationship is different. 

The conversation on explaining why it was or wasn't actually a gift was incredibly awkward. It felt somewhat condescending and pedantic which is when I lost my cool. My parents hugged both my wife and I, and said they don't want money to be an issue in our family. This is the second thing that messed with my head.

This situation created a bunch of emotional confusion as all my wife and I did was that we literally attempted to be nice and pay back a loan years early. 

Just looking for advice on the easiest way to turn the corner on this. Did my wife and I break an unspoken rule? Are my parents being pedantic?",18Jun2019,1

I don't not hang around with people my age or below - i just don't seem to enjoy it as much as everything seems a little put on.

My favourite person to have a pint with is 71 and i'm part of a pub quiz team with the youngest guy being mid 50s. It's not a choice i consciously made, i just seem drawn to them for better conversations, less bravado and an easier life. There's people i get on with my age and may enjoy speaking to but 9 times out of 10 i'd rather be somewhere else and whenever i try to get closer to one of them theres things i don't like or they aren't persuing the friendship as much as i might be/they already have a solid friendbase. This stuff doesn't hurt me in anyway, i just wonder if i'm abnormal.

Even my girlfriend has lots of friends her own age and i'm typically not fans of the majority of them either (although i really respect 2-3 of them and applaud them for all they do and her for building such a solid group).

Get invited to a wedding? Ah ****, so and so and so and so will be there.

I've met people i percieve as dejected about the whole thing as me but they seem happy enough to just still hang around with these people and accept it for what it is. I can't help but feel forlorn about it.

Am i a weirdo? Or just an asshole?

451," I need your help. Well actually my parents need your help. For several years they have been fighting with their neighbour to get her to clean up her yard. She's a hoarder, inside and outside. They've contacted bylaw enforcement, and even their city council representative, all to no avail. No one is doing anything, and it's getting worse. This is going to be long, but please bare with me. 

  
 For 28 years my parents have lived in their home. For years a sweet old lady lived next door. She had the most beautiful home inside and out. Eventually she sold her home, and that's where the problems began. Several years ago, a middle-aged woman who I'll call Sierra bought the house next door to my parents. She became a problem from the get go.   


 She has no sense of boundaries. There's over 60 acres of forest behind my parents' neighbourhood. It's private property, but people still use it to walk the various trails. The main entrance is located next to my parents' house, while the side entrance is actually on my parents' property. Because of that, my dad has taken on the role of gatekeeper for the owner. My dad gave her permission ONE TIME to cross their backyard to get to the trail with her dogs, and she took that as permission to enter my parents' backyard whenever she feels like it. She constantly lets her dogs poop in my parents' yard, and doesn't clean it up. It's not just at my parent's though, she trespasses on other people's property all the time. She'll walk right into your yard whenever she feels like it, we watch her do it all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

She's also a hoarder. She hoards everything. Her house, garage and workshop are all filled to the brim with stuff. That's not an understatement. If you look in the windows all you can see is junk, just piled high. One of our neighbours has actually been inside, and he said that the white carpet is now black from the dirt. The yard is no better. She has dozens of industrial sized paint cans, stacks of rotten old wood, old windows, leaves, garbage just heaped back there. She goes around collecting other people's garbage all the time. During yard waste week, she went around and collected EVERYONE'S bags of leaves and brought them home. She brought home a giant, dead stump someone dug up with the intent to plant it UPSIDE DOWN and grow the tree again. Two years ago she had her roof shingled, but she told the workers to leave the old shingles in a giant pile on her lawn. They sat there forever, before she decided to bury them in the ground. Honestly, I could go on and on and on about all the insane things she has done.   


Aside from her hoarding, she is a manipulative person. She always wants something in exchange for nothing. Countless times my dad and other neighbours have helped her and she's never done anything in return or even expressed appreciation. Her elderly father occasionally comes over to try to help tidy up her yard. Every time she just stands there and watches him, not once have I see her help him. The last time the poor man showed up she just got in her van and left to go play soccer.     


As a result, no one in the neighbourhood likes her. Here's the thing though, none of the neighbours across the street can call to complain because the dividing line for the township is the double yellow lines on the road. So even though she lives across the street, she lives in another township, and city reps won't do anything outside of their district. So the only people who have complained are my parents and the neighbours on the other side of her.     


My parents have called bylaw enforcement countless times. The first time they called, the officer informed them that they know her, already had a file on her for another property downtown, AND that she's very difficult to deal with. Over the years my parents have dealt with countless bylaw officers(because they keep changing), and nothing has ever really been done. They told my parents that because she has a purpose for every item in the yard they can't really do anything about it, regardless of how long it's been sitting there. My mom contacted the city council rep out of exasperation, and she was even less helpful. Her suggestion was that my parents just put up a wooden fence or something. It's a huge yard, even just to fence the one side would cost thousands, and that does nothing to hide the mess in her front yard. Yesterday another bylaw officer stopped by for a home inspection, and it turns out that she's friends with Sierra. Instead of doing her job, they spent the next couple hours chatting and laughing together. My parents are at their wits end, and don't know what to do. I desperately want to help them, but I also have no idea what to do.   


Some other info, we live in Canada. I'm not sure what resources, if any, the bylaw officers have offered her in terms of mental health, and her obvious hoarding issues. She seems unwilling or even unaware of the fact that she has an issue, so I doubt she's receiving any help. I've wondered if there's anything I could do in terms of contacting the fire department. Her house is most certainly a fire hazard due to the volume of junk. Does anyone have any suggestions, or words of encouragement??",18Jun2019,1

456,"Im getting blood drawn next week and Im really shaken up. Im getting anxiety just thinking about it. For a little context, when I was very young, I had gotten an pneumonia and had to be sticked multiple times. The woman taking my blood was frustrated because she couldnt fond a vein and was sticking and re-sticking me. When I got home, my entire arm was sore and throbbing with blue marks running up and down. And that is when my needle phobia began...

Each time I go in, Im scared that the nurse wont be able to find my vein and will have to keep poking me which has happened. Some ""digged"" around my arm for the vein and it hurts so bad and makes me feel uneasy that a thin pointy object is sashaying around my arm. It feels like the nurse pushing the needle in deeper and twisting. EIGHeUGHEUG!

My veins are tiny, each nurse that ive been to for blood work always says ""your veins are so tiny!"" which makes me anxious... the procedure is only a week away and im worrying day in and night. Its not necessarily a fear of the needle, just the fear that something terrible will go wrong like the nurse hand slips or she cant find a vein or I pass out... I dont know how to deal with thos, Ove tried music, closing my eyes distracting myself but the lingering fear of the procedure stays.

463,"Sorry this will be a bit long..

A little backstory: My grandfather and this woman were seeing each other about 10 years back and during that time my grandfather’s health started to decline rapidly and we noticed his money was disappearing. He was also getting paranoid of his own family saying that we were all using him and only out for money and when he passed away all his money will go to his then girlfriend. My grandfather didn’t hide the fact that this woman was telling him things about us, but it really hurt us that he was believing this woman who was taking his money. She would also bad mouth us and disrespect us in front of him. My grandfather has always been pretty lonely and always enjoyed the company of women so I think a lot of his behavior has to do with his loneliness but after a few years we were finally able to intervene and get her out of his life. He started thriving and his health started to improve and he was doing so much more and seemed happier and healthier overall. 

Well flash forward to today: my cousin is his live in caregiver while she prepares for medical school, staying with him and taking him to dr appointments, cooking, and making sure he has everything he needs. It’s been going well, but I get a call from my cousin saying that this woman is back in our lives and that she’s been visiting again and now she’s making snide comments to my cousin about how she’s “ignorant” and “stupid”, yet my cousin is far from it. My cousin also reports that now my grandfather is getting paranoid again and being more combative and calling her names and she’s stuck cleaning up after this woman because she comes over to ask for money and eats the food and leaves all her mess for my cousin to clean up. And she also tells us that his health is beginning to deteriorate again. 

My question I guess, is what can we do? I know my grandfather is a grown man, but I come from a very close family and last thing I want is for my grandfather to push us all away. I just want him to be healthy and it seems like whenever this woman is around his health just declines and she’s only after his money because she knows he’ll give it to her. 

Is there any legal action we can take if my grandfather has a Power Of Attorney? I’m so lost.",18Jun2019,1

465,"I have to make this quick since I have to make a decision soon. Basically, I had cripping health anxiety 3 months ago and had thought I had a whole lot of medical problems that needed to be evaluated or else I would die. I've gone through therapy and am currently doing a lot better (even though I still worry, but not as much as before).

I scheduled an eye doctor appointment because I was having migraines with aura, but without having the migraine. I just had the visual disturbances, otherwise known as ""ocular migraines"" or ""silent migraines"". I saw a doctor for it and she told me not to worry but said I could schedule an appointment with an eye doctor just to be safe. The doctors were heavily booked and I didn't get an appointment until 3 months after I called. However, I'm almost 100% sure now that it's not related to my eyesight because I've had this about 5 times in these 3 months. And the frequency is dropping immensely. I'm convinced that these are these silent migraines.

I don't want to go to that eye doctor because I think it would just make my health anxiety be worse if they find out that my eyesight isn't 20/20. If it came up to be 20/19 or something I would actually panic and start to check if I notice any differences in my eyes. I'm not sure if this appointment would do me any good.

Background;  2, 2 year degrees (assoc in science, and an industrial electricity and electronics degree.) Been doing industrial maintenance for 6 years now, started out green/bottom of totem pole, have positioned myself for promotions numerous times now. I’m currently as shift supervisor at a plant (bread baking industry) and I have a crew of 5 people below me. Gotten shaft a little when I moved from an hourly lead position to my salaries position (initial pay cut of $1500 on BASE pay, turn it down and ended up with $1250 raise onto my base, lost all OT though). Waited 16 months to be taken care of when raise/veal time come around, and got shafted again (4% when most got 2%, but didn’t not even come close to median, I’m missing our median range by about $7k).   Generally I like my job, and I do enjoy what I do, I know it well; where I’m at, not only do I have to know my machinery well, but I also have to understand my product and how it work, bread dough consistency and differences in each product and how to tell if maybe an operator added or didn’t add something, y’all get the drift.      

Well, due to circumstances and feeling that I have better options, I’ve interviewed, for an offer on the clock but it was he exact same thing I was making so I turned it down (solely bc of same pay rate and I’d move to rotating hours, I currently work 6a-2p,  offering place is 6-6 and rotate from am to pm on a monthly rotation) as of today, I received another from them, $8k/year raise for me.

What all would you consider when deciding about this. The money is a pay raise, but at the end of the day, isn’t life changing money. Any thoughts on my situation or ideas to consider? What are somethings to think about or so to help in the decision that I may not be considering?   My thoughts and considerations now are,  I end up with same amount of vacation,  I get more off days with the caveat of going to 12hr rotating shifts, I feel unappreciated where I am and we’ve have numerous people leave in the last 6 months (great people and employees, young guys with a skill set and desire to learn and better themselves), I feel my company is super tightwad on budget (which I halfway get, but there comes a point when it’s asinine to be as tight) [ex,  shop jigsaw is broken, maybe we should replace the foot rather than buy a new one; paper is expensive, let’s print on both sides (halfway understand but petty), we can not afford to buy numerous lockouts bc they’re expensive,] 


Any other questions or thoughts, I’m an open book and just want some other insights here.


I’d like to add too, that I’m currently in a bread baking plant/industry, it’s all I currently know, the new job is at another nicer/newer plant that makes dialysis filters.

476,"Hi, I’m a 22 year old guy from a small town. But recently I’ve been on vacation to a busier place. I’ve been observing the couples.

I’ve never had a girlfriend and consider myself unattractive to females. I’m short (5’8”) and slightly overweight. I’m not particularly good looking either.

Still, I’ve noticed lots of guys like me walking around with really cute girls. One guy about my height and more overweight than me was walking with a super pretty girl that had blonde hair and blue eyes. Does anybody else notice this? Does this actually happen often?",18Jun2019,0
477,"Hey yall. 

A few years ago i left my job paying $18 an hour to return to school because i felt my career options at the company were at a dead end without getting a degree. Two years go by and im getting a 4.0 when long story short i get sick mid semester and have to drop. Doctors still dont know what it is but it destroyed my life for about 6 months. I never mentioned being in school to any of the 10 specialists i saw so none are willing to write a letter to the school saying it would have caused me to drop out.  So in order for me to finish my degree which probably will take me 2.5 more years, i need to somehow save up $4000 to pay the school back and then find a way to somehpw pay for classes without private loans because my vredit score is shit. 

Since ive been out of school absolutely no decent employers want to even interview me. I have decent SQL and business analysis experience but the only offers i get are for cooking at pizza places or working on a factory floor because i have a 2 year employment gap from my studies. I have applied to over 300 jobs in the last two months and have yet to even get asked to interview by a single one. 

 These physically demanding jobs are not a good fit for me. I tire easily, im physically slow, and i get severely depressed if im not in a position where i can use my brain to creatively solve problems at least part of the time. My brain is like the one thing i have, im not good at anything else and nobody will let me use it. I went from creating automated processes with IT and trying to increase system efficiency, to double majoring in physics and chemistry, to literally running a tape rewinder on 3rd shift for 10 bucks an hour with an hour long commute. eventually i had a breakdown and got fired because i just couldnt do the repetitive mindless work all night and be happy knowing nobody in the department literally ever got a promotion in the last 10 years. 

Now people are just telling me to be a plumber or something. Thay kind of labor isnt an interest for me at all. I will be absolutely miserable.  And it makes me depressed as fuck that they may be right that its gonna be the only way i can ever make $20+ an hour. 

Tldr: owe school 4 grand so i cant go back, no job offers that pay anything newr what i made before i returned to school, no possibility of getting a career i would actually like and its making deoressed as fuck that im staring down the barrell of a life of working garbage unfulfilling jobs for the rest of my life.",18Jun2019,3
478,"So a few months ago my dad quit smoking after 30+ years. Really proud for him. He picks up vaping after a couple weeks. Ok, still better than smoking. The thing is, I found out about this nearly 2 months later. He had already told my sister. He asked us not to tell out mother. We didn't. 

He confesses to it freely a few weeks after that. Tells mom that we knew and he asked us to keep it secret. We went through a big conversation about how wrong it was of all of us and how guilty we felt. Pop breaks his JUUL and says he's really done this time. Cool. Parent start counselling. 

This past Sunday he busts out his new JUUL and tells me to keep it secret again and that sis already knows. I don't know what to do. My sis and I are both conflicted. Should we tell mom or not?

Pop has been a recovering alcoholic for years. He's convinced that he has control over it. Maybe once every 6 months he'll over do it. They are still in counselling, obviously don't know if counselor knows about the vaping or not.",18Jun2019,1

480,"Me and my coworker (we work in a leisure complex) get on very well, and I fancy him quite a lot. When we last worked together we were talking the whole day and it was borderline flirtatious (which I'm very fine with), at one point I said ""I was at a uni open day and I saw someone who looked identical to you"" and they said ""oh where they good looking?"" without thinking I said ""yeah they were"" and then I realised what I said and in my head I was like omg I can't believe I've just said that, but he looked quite pleased with what I said.

After work he went up to the gym and one of my friends (17F) went up there as well and she asked him ""what's going on with you and AdventurousWhereas0?"" he then went bright red and then she asked him ""I saw you talking to her all day"" then he said ""I like talking to AdventurousWhereas0"".

So I've got the vague impression there might be mutual feelings there. Now this isn't where the problem is, the problem is with my ex (we dated for a few months).

I broke up with my ex a couple of months ago because I just got bored with him, I was stressed with borderline depression and couldn't handle anything because I also had important exams going on, and probably the most important reason is he's a mushroom's dealer, I didn't mind that he's doing drugs (well I do but its not the thing that bothers me the most) but the fact that he didn't tell me and I had to find out from his ex. Anyways, he texted me a couple of weeks ago asking to meet up and I told him no super bluntly and I've just ignored him for the past couple of months.

So I broke up with my ex because I didn't want a relationship (the 'with him' is silent) and I can possibly see something happening between me and a coworker, but if I start dating my coworker my ex is gonna find out, and my ex is scary when he's angry.

My question is what do I do because I've no idea and I've spoken to some people but I don't want to keep talking about it to them, because that would get quite boring for them.

(P.S. this would also be my third relationship of 2019 and its almost July - and the last time that happened my mum (45F) basically sat me down and called me a slut but in nicer terms.)",18Jun2019,1
481,"So I've been living with my current roommate for about 4 months now.  We are both introverted and when we met to see if we'd be a good fit together, we both knew our hobbies and lifestyles.  I knew she spends her off time playing video games and watching Netflix, and I do much the same, with art added in as my side hustle when I'm not teaching.

What I didn't realize until we lived together was just how much of a recluse she is.  For the most part, this is not a problem, she wants to spend her free time alone in her room with the door shut, it's cool, that's how she recharges, but it's gotten to a point where I'm just anxious around her because we interact so rarely, that when we do, I'm afraid I'm forcing the interaction.  When she comes home from work, she doesn't even say hello if I'm in the same room, she just quietly puts her stuff away and beelines it for her room.  Am I crazy for finding this really awkward?  I feel like it's silly to expect someone to at least greet me, but now that I'm in a situation where that happens, I feel like I'm somehow an unwelcome intrusion somehow, and maybe I'm taking this far more personally than I should be.

Being in her room is understandable, but it does make things hard when I do need to communicate with her about important things, like rent being higher, or to ask that she try to get the dishes taken care of in less than a day so the sink isn't clogged.  Because of this, I end up telling her about these things on the rare moments she leaves her room for food, and as a result I ended up picking a poor time to remind her about the rent being a little higher on her birthday, which I didn't realize until she told me way later.

I feel like, if it's not be trying to catch her in a face-to-face interaction for basic communication, my options are texting or just telling her things through her door.  I don't like texting, I've had too many friendships strain because of textual misunderstandings that vocal inflection could have cleared up better.  I asked her what form of communication she felt comfortable with, after explaining my anxiety with texting, and she said talking to her through her door is fine.

I think I might just break down and text her, because I still would prefer that than talking to her through her door, that just feels like I'm nagging like a parent would.

What would you do in a situation like this?  Like, I get that not every roommate will be a friend, and when we do interact, it's never hostile, it's just very dismissive.  If she doesn't want to be friends cool, I'd just like to be able to communicate in a positive way on important roommate things, at least.  We both live here, I'd just like to live in my apartment and feel comfortable living in it.",18Jun2019,1

483,20 m currently in the coast guard. Training on my own to have a shot at passing rescue swimmer school. I'm a giant pussy. Always have been. Always quit when shit got a little difficult. Never gave a fuck about anything bc it was easier. Thought acting out in school would get me good friends. Chasing the rescue swimmer dream has drastically changed my life. It is the only thing I haven't quit on in my entire life and the thought of maybe passing gives me enough hope to push through all the bullshit life throws at me. I had no money no ambition and got in trouble alot before I started on this. My ex left me bc I was a loser who only smoked weed and played video games. I couldn't swim before I started training. I couldnt do more than 20 push ups. I wouldn't run even though I was good at it. Never pushed myself to break records even though my legs are good enough for it.  I can swim miles now and I'm comfortable in the water. I'm fast as hell running but my push ups still suck. Iv been having bad days lately. I'm supposed to go to a prep week soon my push ups just fucking suck. I'm miles behind where I should be. I worked out with someone also going to prep and he's legit as hell especially on land. He said I should do grinder workouts 3 times a week. I tried doing a grinder workout and I sucked so bad it just felt hopeless and that after all that work and moving 650 miles from home that I just came here to fucking fail and it mentally took my spirit and I left mid workout. I came back and tried to get a decent workout in but i was just winging it and it was super ineffective and I didn't do shit basically and I got so pissed off and frustrated at myself I just decided to call it and went to shoot baskets to get my head level again. iv got about a month before prep. I need to be able to push the earth for hours without breaking if im to have a shot. It's not as bad as I'm making it out to be right now but I do need to improve alot in this area in a short amount of time. The best tips I can get from this would be about overcoming frustration and not letting being anger at my self stop me. I know If I could just do these grinder workouts I would be fine. How do you deal with getting super frustrated? I'm probably working out again tn to try again.,18Jun2019,1

493,"This may be a little too long but please bear with me. I'm a seventeen year old girl. I belong to a Muslim family and live in India (very conservative society). So even talking to guys is off limits for me let alone getting into a relationship with one. I studied in a girls' school till grade ten after which most people choose to leave school and join a JEE/ NEET (it's something like the SAT) coaching institute. It's how the education system works here.  I think (I have a horrible memory btw) I had a lot of mood swings back in eighth grade and I kinda drifted apart from all of my friends. Only one of them stayed by my side (let's call her X). She had been my best friend (my only proper friend) for almost 9 years and we grew closer over that year. We knew each other inside out and would speak for hours. It was a perfect friendship with no drama whatsoever.
Shit got down when I developed feelings for her in ninth grade. I didn't really ponder over it and just told her. It started out as a joke but then she told me that she liked me back and we got into a relationship. Nothing really changed between us except that we made out and stuff. We shared our first kiss with each other. Nobody knew anything about this since relationships are considered a taboo here. It was an on and off relationship since I always felt really guilty (for multiple reasons, the main one being that it's a sin). This went on for ten months.
I think I lost interest in her by the end of that period. We were on a break when I went to Chicago for a month for my sister's wedding where I met a guy (let's call him Y). We were family friends and his family had come from Cali just to attend the wedding. Long story short, he hit on me a few times after which we started flirting with each other and I even kissed him once. It was the first time that i had gotten attention from a guy and I was super excited about it. I told X about it (all of this was very very selfish of me since she still had feelings for me and was under the assumption that we'd get back together) and she was super upset.
Now would be the right time to tell you that I'm oblivious as fuck at times.
After I returned to India, I got into a long distance relationship (which lasted for five months) with Y. I kept blabbering about him in front of X until she finally told me that I was being inconsiderate and she was hurt. I tried helping her get over me and we were still best friends. Y never had time for me and he'd disappear for weeks on end (didn't answer calls or texts). We rarely spoke to each other even after I told him to give me time and I felt miserable. I desperately wanted to move on. I ended up making out with one of my apartment friends a couple of times (over a span of one week) since I thought it would help me get over him (realllly stupid idea). Later (at the end of that week), when I finally got to speak to him after two months, I told him about it and we broke up. I left all of this crap and just focused on my studies. 
Also, I did extremely well in school. I always came first in class. Like always. I felt like it was expected of me and wanted to maintain my image of a topper. I procrastinated, studied last minute and still aced every single one of my tests. 
After tenth grade I joined a coaching institute and three months later when I tried wishing her on her birthday, I realised that X had blocked me everywhere. We rarely spoke after finishing school but i thought that we were still fine. I guess she got fed up of my shit. I was super upset but didn't want to bother her anymore so I let go. She once told me that she felt disgusted by what we had done too.
And here's another thing. I got used to being emotionally dependent on someone due to my friendship with X. So I spent all of last year (grade eleven) in relationships (or flings cuz they only lasted for a maximum of two months). I would revolve my whole life around them and talk to them 24/7. I dated three guys in class. I left the first one because there was too much drama and his parents wanted him to focus on his studies.
The second one I dated (let's call him Z) was very disgusting. I made out with him twice and he took things a little too far (he only wanted to get into my pants while I was desperate for someone to depend on). He even told everyone in class about it. 
It's only a class of fifty students and nobody does relationships over here like I've pointed out a billion times before. So I got judged very badly in class for dating this guy (he was unhygienic and wasn't good looking at all though I don't go on looks... Prolly one of the reasons I got judged), making out with him and now all of them think that I'm a slut or something (nobody knew that I was dating him). 
I've always been admired in school for studying and felt horrible for being looked down on like that. 
I was even struggling with my studies for the first time in life since JEE coaching is completely different and super tough as compared to the school syllabus.
I hated myself for dating random people and I wanted to change myself. I didn't want to hurt people.
There was a guy in class (the cutest guy I've ever met tbh but wayyyy too arrogant) who helped me get back on track, stop paying attention to all the gossip and just focus on my studies. He tried to help me stop being such a wreck. He liked me. I told him that I wasn't good at relationships and I didn't want to date anybody ever again after what happened with Z but he was persistent and believed that it would be different. We dated for two months before I messed up again. 
I'm going through a phase where I feel lonely but don't want to talk to friends and instead I get romantically involved with people. I like the flirting and the initial phase of getting to know the other but I dont want to deal with the drama that comes later. I guess Ive gotten better now.
So anyway, I haven't been with anyone for five months now and I'm focusing on studying seriously. I am under a lot of stress .One of the reasons I went after guys was also because I found coaching to be super tough and wanted a distraction. 
I have so many regrets. I regret losing my best friend like that. I miss her a lot even though I don't remember much. I'm super lonely and have nobody to talk to. I don't even trust anyone anymore because everyone in coaching just gossips way too much and nobody keeps secrets. Initially, I trusted people very easily due to my friendship with X. I still want to talk to the cute guy in class but I'm keeping my distance to avoid drama. I miss him too. I regret making out with Z and going along with whatever he was doing just because I didn't care about it at that moment, I didn't think it'd matter. It was the worst thing ever, very horrible and he treated me like a fucktoy... Constantly trying to grope me and stuff. I don't even like making out tbh. I feel disgusted by myself and constantly worry about how my classmates look down on me. Needless to say I have self confidence issues. I feel emotionally unstable. 
Im afraid that I'll never have stable friendships in the future and will have to be alone and miserable my whole life. I've lost weight and hair because of study stress and my parents are worried. I talk to a few friends from coaching but it's just small talk mostly about studies. I've distanced myself from friends to avoid any more drama. I'm in my senior year of highschool (grade twelve) and everybody expects me to do well like I always do but I doubt it. I don't know if I'll be able to get into a good university. I don't know what to do.",18Jun2019,1

503,"I love my apartment and have been living there for about 7 months. It’s a great location and affordable. It feels like home which is something that was very hard to find for me. Until yesterday, I thought my neighbors adjacent to me in my apartment building were very nice people. It’s a four family home, so we all share a front porch and a hallway to the basement, so this is not like a huge complex.

I will not go into details, but their unit was targeted yesterday by people who were accusing my adjacent neighbor of being a nazi. They inflicted some property damage. Nobody was hurt. This caused me to google the neighbor and I found some very disgusting things. He appears to align with neo nazi leanings and there are screen shots all over the internet of some really atrocious and racially charged statements that he was saying.

Now I know and I am uncomfortable. This group made flyers with our address printed on it and I feel unsafe, but I am mostly just disgusted with this person and the things he is saying. We talk often because they are outside smoking often and will catch me when I’m going in and out of my unit. As I said earlier, these are close quarters. I also don’t want anything to happen due to his leanings. I am white so it explains why they are so nice to me, but my boyfriend is not white and I feel like he can’t come over anymore. 

My advice request is how to handle this. He does not know that I know about the things I found on the internet, and after the property damage he told me he was not at all aligned with nazis. I feel like because we share parts of the home that I need to keep it civil for my own sake. But at the same time I am struggling to hide my disgust and anger. How would you navigate this?

I wasn't really ever taught how to get a relationship going or anything and have no interest in drinking or bars, which is what people always tell me to do but prefer to avoid alcohol at all costs. I have no idea where to go from here since I already play games in my local Hobby shop such as D&amp;D and all of the people I play with are straight guys which as you can guess isn't really my type.

505,"hey!

so this year was incredibly hard, because it was my junior year. I’ve had family stuff going on, on top of two houses because of divorced parents, on top of not being a great person myself. Recently, I switched to fully online half way through junior year. I thought it would help. Instead, I didn’t have motivation, I couldn’t bring myself to do anything, and I missed the ACT. I’m planning on taking the ACT in a few weeks, and I want to do it twice. Otherwise, my dog went to the hospital the two last days of school, and I didn’t log in. I didn’t take the finals, which means I failed three of the classes. I’m freaking out because now I need to take summer school most likely, on top of failing five classes throughout my highschool career. I really want to get into a good college, I work 30-40 hours a week at two really good jobs, on top of doing a lot of extra clubs. Am I going to be okay? Is any college going to want me now that I have a crappy GPA? I’m terrified and because I’m terrified I won’t do anything or try to help myself because I’m scared and focusing on it stresses me out. Thanks for answering and reading guys.",18Jun2019,1
506,"I have just, today received my final grades for my undergrad degree and will officially be graduating college in October!

Originally I am from Ireland and have been studying there, but this summer I am in Vancouver, Canada on a working holiday visa which I am LOVING

Before I arrived in Vancouver, I applied for a masters degree course back in Ireland that would last one academic year, would guarantee me a job after I finish, but which I would have to pay for in full by myself as well as paying for accommodation. 

I currently do not have this money handy, but I think if I worked incredibly hard i could scrape it together, though it may affect the quality of my time in Vancouver.

As of yesterday I have been accepted into this dream masters course based on high grades and only have a few days to decide whether to accept my place, use up all my money on it and go back to Ireland, decline it and try to apply again next year, or just continue working on a waitressing wage in Vancouver 

Any advice would be appreciated!!",18Jun2019,1
507,"Hello good people. So I have been the victim of a major skype scam through OkCupid. I know it is beyond stupid and apparently the skype sextortion is very common, but I wasn't aware of these and had a momentary lapse after an extremely bad day and started touching myself in Skype, I know.... incredibly incredibly moronic. I do not know what the hell I was thinking. They recorded it, and asked me for money, without which they would post it on my Facebook and to friends. They showed me the video and my FB, Insta and LinkedIn account in browser tabs through link-sharing. I had my FB friend-list private, but with a little bit of FB search they could obviously find my tagged photos.

&amp;#x200B;

I paid him more than $600 in two payments in 30 mins. First he asked me for an amount, that I negotiated down, and asked him to delete and show it on screen. He then asked more. I refused, and told him I would send it if he showed me he deleted it. He ended up showing me he deleted it, and I paid him $200 more. All through paypal. Leaking it is not an option, due to my background and I tried to gain somewhat of trust, which sounds extremely weird. I however believe 0% that he actually deleted all copies. Anyway, I told him I am blocking him from everywhere and am changing my phone number from that point onward. Since then it has been a day, and I don't plan on ever opening a channel of communication and plan on ignoring any future advances.

&amp;#x200B;

I have deactivated FB, my Insta is completely private, and basically shut off my whole LinkedIn from public view (you can still see some of it if you have an account though, I am betting on them not opening an account, and I never accept unknown there). I have a personal website where my research portfolio is set-up, but I have removed my emails from there. Should I take my website down for a while?

&amp;#x200B;

What next steps to I have? I want to mitigate the damage as much as possible, and want them to just forget me. I have now realized I might have made a mistake paying them, but they screen-shared almost posting the video, and I had to make a split second decision. I don't want the video out, but I will not pay a single more dime, I have paid enough. I plan on ignoring completely any future advances. Is there anything else you guys would suggest to mitigate it?? Is there any legal advice for me? I have already reported it to the police. Is there any other service that I can use to track down? Anything. Thanks

P.S. I now understand it was stupendously dumb, and cant really understand why I did it. I have never done anything like it before, guess I'm getting desperate. Anyways, Thanks in advance.",18Jun2019,0

510," (23 y/o F) I have a very millennial problem - I’ve put off getting a “real job”, and now I’m lost. I know this is common and silly, but I’m really struggling to figure out my next steps. 

I have a bachelors degree in Public Relations, a major I chose at the end of my sophomore year after feeling panicky that I didn’t know what to do still. It wasn’t the worst choice - I’m a good writer and I have excellent reading speed and comprehension. But I struggled my whole academic career with undiagnosed ADHD, which I won’t go into too much, but it severely inhibited my ability to commit/follow through on anything (internships, clubs, any resume boosters) and I graduated by the skin of my teeth. I also experienced a traumatic event that I think exacerbated my problems further. 

Fast forward to today - I’m diagnosed and dealing with my issues, but I still struggle with procrastination. I’ve never had a problem working, and I work very hard. I bartended all through college and paid all my own living expenses. I now bartend at a high-end restaurant, and I moved into a new apartment last month. I make decent money, but It’s been about a year and a half since I graduated, and I’m still not using my expensive degree.

I need advice on what I should do next and the kind of position I might be qualified for. I have some experience in content creation (writing articles, designing logos, putting together videos) and running social media accounts, but it feels like nothing compared to other women of my age with my background. I’m a bit terrified when asked to talk about myself and my accomplishments because I feel like I don’t have any. PR, marketing, etc. doesn’t really interest me. I love to draw and paint, and I’ve done a few commission works and have a small social media presence through that (clearly not sustainable). 

My parents and extended family are either getting impatient or have already written me off as the dud. I want to do something meaningful with my life but I’m unsure of where to begin. The idea of working for a big corporation or firm 1) scares me shitless, and 2) does not appeal to me at all.  Ideally I want to be able to help people, not tweet on behalf of Walmart or try to cover up the next big corporate scandal. I want to bring positivity into other people’s lives. Is nonprofit work an option? What positions in what kind of companies should I look for? What can I do in the meantime to better my chances in my job search? 

I’m sorry if this seems whiny, I’m just hoping someone out there has some advice for me going forward. I’m constantly feeling like I’m too late and I missed the boat by not searching for a job right out of college. Thank you to anyone who responds. :)",18Jun2019,1

I am really stressed out where I don't even want to wake up anymore in this house. 

I was in university for a year and moved out. I loved having my freedom and no stress on my mind, but dropped out because of my financial difficulties. I was scared of my debt and it caused me to become really anxious about continuing. I wish I could go back because it was so much better for me than living back at home where I have literally nothing going for me and my mental health is deteriating. 

I want to move out but don't know how. I don't have enough money to do it, I wish i could get a job but my motivation to do anything here has gone rock bottom. It would be so tough coming back home after a long days work with all the stress I have to endure here. I think living here sucks out all the energy I have. 

I want to find a partner but no girl seems interested in me. I'm also really shy and nervous to find a partner because I was abused in the past when I was a child.

518,"We’re in our low 20s and have a 1 year old. Honestly we’re at the best place in our lives so far. Our relationship is great, our son is ahead of most kids, our bills are smaller than usual, our friends have become more proactive about the friendships as they begin to settle down a little too, and we just got a new TV which makes the whole apartment feel fresh. Idk, everything was just so perfect until now. 

I’m in school for computer science so I can take over the working in our family and my husband can become a stay at home dad. He just had to work 3 more years before I could take over. 

Last week he had some sort of breakdown at work. I’m not 100% on all the details but the gist of it is he started to cry at work and made a scene and his boss sent him home and told him to take the week off for mental health, and also gave us the number to the inpatient facility his sister apparently went to. Husbands boss is a sort of friend of ours (we see movies together every so often) so he’s worried about husband. 

Well he stayed home a week and we had friends over and made healthy meals and stuff. We got outside more than usual and tried to stay in a good routine without going overboard so he actually had time to rest. 

Weekend was great except I kept finding him looking at other jobs on indeed...which is a problem because before our son was born he was a serial job hopper and I told him he needed to be more consistent when we had a kid. He has been at his current job for 1 month (it was an upgrade from his last one in every way and everything was going along the proper procedures so I let it slide). On the one hand, I’m pissed he’s doing this again, but on the other maybe this time it ACTUALLY is different because he’s having a crisis. 

Anyways, besides catching him on indeed a few times everything was fine. 

Then Monday morning he gets up to go to work, showers and gets dressed, and promptly vomits and has an episode of panic. We go to the ER and they say basically “I’m not a psychiatrist but you need to see one ASAP” and gave him a note to get out of work until Wednesday, his first therapy appointment. 

His boss texted him today and told him tl;dr husband will always have a job with them, but the work is backing up too much so husbands responsibilities are being spread out around the office. Friendship or not, lots of people rely on this business and we can’t let the whole thing crumble while he’s away. Come back when you’re ready and for now get the help you need. 

So basically husband no longer has a job. Even if he went back today right now, there’s no work for him. So. 

Now me, a sophomore in college and stay at home mom with no work experience, has to find a way to pay our bills.

&amp;#x200B;

So my family is in shambles right now. My d(dad) has been getting drunk for 12 years and he does not stop. He will say that he will stop, yet he only quits for a month or so. Whenever he gets drunk, although not abusive, he will be very rude. My m(mom) will be nice to him, do almost all of the household chores and ask him if he wants food and simple things like that. My d, however, will get very upset, after these kinds of questions, yelling and creating a drama, insulting my mom, saying that she has a hidden agenda. I have tried to reason with him, but he has his mind set, and does not respect her. If he keeps on drinking, my m goes crazy and starts threatening to commit suicide. I try to help her as much as I can, like comforting her, sometimes trying to help her relax by deep-breathing with her. I then ask her to ignore d for some time, however she always goes to my dad and asks him stupid questions like ""Do you want me to die?"" or ""Do you want me to suffer?"". Basically things like that. Now the problem would be solved if he literally answered no, but he never does it. He always ignores her or says that he wouldn't care. This leads to her almost commiting suicide with a rope or a knife. Then normally what happens is I run in, and I explain to her why this is a bad idea. Sometimes she goes out of control, but I somehow manage to stop her. I try to reason with my dad, but he says he has absolutely no respect for her.

I have tried to keep them together, I have endured the times when they took their anger out on me by insulting me, and I don't mind it because I can just tune them out, but unfortunately they can't. When my dad isn't drunk, he is a nice guy to me, but isn't always the kindest to my mom. My dad is also very manipulative. Last summer, both of my grandmas came to our house from India for a visit. My dad quit drinking during their one month stay and was all nice and stuff. As soon as they left he continued to drink.

527,"For the record, im fully supportive of gay pride parades. My intention is not to start a debate on that.

My coworker leans more conservatively, but still maintains a view of “to each their own”. 

The issue here is that it seems pretty inappropriate to have 15 yr old girls celebrate a girl scout ceremony at a gay pride event. This is in san diego, where of course these parades can be pretty explicit.

The troop mom’s reasoning is because their troop theme is rainbows, and gay pride involves a lot of rainbows. 

As much as I support the parade, and the idea of spreading openness, i cant help but agree with my coworker here. He is a great dad, extremely communicative and open with his daughters. He does not like the idea of his daughter being at a parade celebrating sexual diversity (i realize there is more to it than that) and possibly seeing things she is too young to see. I think he has every right to feel that way.

My advice to him was to start by having a conversation with his daughter. I told him not to make it about homosexuality view points, but to make the conversation about why this might not be an age appropriate event for her. I told him the best thing he can do is to explain *why* he holds certain views, and what kind of moral views he is trying to instill in her, so that she can understand his “lens” and come to her own conclusions.

530,"-when i was about ~12 years old, my mom started beating the fuck out of me when i got a single bad grade. every single time i walked home with a bad grade , i got hit either with her hands or with a small stick. I can remember having blue/yellow spots on my stomach, arms etc. This is when i grew i a hatetred for my mom and absolutley fucking hate her. 

Fast forward a couple of months, i was bullied in school, which also led to my bad grades. My brother who was about 17 at that time, was also on the same school as me. I was literally fucking strangeled and punched every single day from my class mates. Guess what my brother did about it? Jack shit. 2 years of bullying, and not ONCE has he helped in any way. No real talk with the teachers. Not helping me in anyway. If i remember correctly, he also used to make fun of me for getting bullied, but cant recall any memory of that happening.My parents always gave me ""the talk"" like it was my fucking fault for getting bad grades. Also my mother always used to leave me in the rain and wanted me to walk 30 minutes to home, in the rain. keep in mind that i was 12 at that time, so it was mental weight on me.

Mentally abusive part :

i don't know where to begin, so it will get a little bit complicated. also i am a horrible explainer.

- when i don't listen to my mother or father, they mentally abuse me by telling me that i have nobody else and if i keep going, i will be the one at a loss, not them. let me explain, a couple weeks ago, my father came into my room and kissed me on the mouth cheeck and touched my shoulders. I told him to stop kissing me and to stop touching me, he got really defensive and screamed at me ""why are you like this? you changed so much!!"" honestly i was creeped out because that is NOT normal. He went downstairs and when i approached him to tell him sorry, he told me ""okay, you wanna keep playing games like this? then you can do everything yourself. you have changed so much and you keep using me for everything."" i never understood this, because i never ask my parents for anything (unless he meant like me asking for food or something like that.) now he stops driving me to school, and never tries to talk to me. literally what the fuck. if i dont kiss him, he doesnt want to do nothing for me? this is not the only part. Now with this, they even refuse to let me see a doctor to vaccinate me, or help me with my uncontrollable allergy.

-some time in april/may, my mother wanted to go to a friend of theirs who lived about 150km away from us. She literally never ever told me this. So, i woke up one day,and she decided to tell me that they are going to their friends... and taking me with. So, all of my daily activitys and everything i wanted to do on that they, were shattered. why? because my fucking mother never tells me anything and waits onto the last second to tell me this. So, i, of course refused to come with them, and what did they do? they took away my PC, TV, PS4, My phone and any access to internet at all, so ""they can teach me a lesson."" what the actual fuck. this is actual mental abuse. if i dont follow their request, i basically get fucked. i am an introvert and suffer from social anxiety, and have zero hobbies. so of course them taking almost everything i ever had away felt horrible, since i was bored and was too lazy to do anything. 

- of course, everything that happened the past 3-5 years, has changed my mood significantly, and i have a hatetred towards anyone in my shitty familiy now. So i of course never want to talk to them, avoid them and try to never make a convo with them. 

fellow redditors from r/advice, please help me. i do not know what to do. if i don't say what my parents request, i get severly punished by my parents (by not letting me see a doctor, by taking away my personal belongings and so on.) But if i do follow their request, it makes me feel uncomfortable and makes me hate myself even more. my mother even says to me ""i am the boss here. my house. you need to follow MY requests. i don't need to follow yours. if you dont follow mine, then you are a at a loss.""

531,"Hello fellow redditors I hope you can give me a different view on my situation. 

Dad backstory: His Dad was very strict and would hit his Childern for any disobedience. He than died when my Dad was about 8 years old. My Dad when he talks about him it sound's like he hates him because he almost never said anything good about him. My Dad then grew up with his 3 older brothers and sister (10 years older,6 years older,5 years older, 6 years younger). My Dad, his brothers and their coach were on a boat drinking in the winter. When a wave  hit them and the flipped, his oldest brother froze to death and their coach drowned. that's about it

&amp;#x200B;

Mom Backstory: Not as dramatic youngest of 4 sisters. My Grandma ist very loving but also very mean even tho you can tell it's kinda like tough-Love. My Grandpa was just the best. Almost all my family members lived in the same town for the most part of growing up so he would visit all of us everyday on his bicycle and bring candy. My Grandpa was the nicest person ever. He would always make jokes and almost never was angry. But my grandma thread him very bad she would always insult him and humiliate him in front of everybody. He sadly passed away last year.  

&amp;#x200B;

So now the mainstory:

My Parents were very young when they got me about 20 years old. My Parents both would be working most of the time so spent a lot of time with my Aunt and Grandparents. We lived in a poor post soviet country so my parents worked a lot so we could afford nice things. My Parents always bought me the newest toys even tho we were very poor, so that I didn't even realise until I was older that we were poor. When I was about 5 years old we moved to a differnt country. We had to live in a Van for about a year until we got a flat. Since My Parents were very young they would meet a lot with all of our neighbours so I spent most of my time growing up with adult. So I was very mature for my age but still goofed around a lot. If my parents left for work and left me with a task and I didn't complet it I would get the belt, this happen very rarely but went on until I was about 13-14. I don't hold a grudge against them for this because the were yound and now know this was wrong. My Mom always but high pressure on me to be good at school but I hated it. When I got bad grades she would always get mad and call me stuff like useless and lazy. In general they rarely would say that I did good. My Dad didn't give a fuck about my grades or school he just wanted me to be a good person and to don't do stupid shit. But my Dad would get very agressive if you talked back or were some what ""disrespectful"", and would always try to force his opnion on others. I'm a person that always expresses his opinion and doesn't back down when they think they are right. So that led to many very heated arguments. He drank a lot when he was in his 20's and was out with his friends and would my miss big parts of my childhood. He's also lost his cool sometimes and would get violent but this only happend like 4 times in 20years (once slapped my mom).  My Parents always criticise everything that I do. I used to have bad posture so when we once walked over to my grandma they keep telling pull back your shoulders they just woudn't leave me alone so I got very angry and screamed in my dad's face ""I know !"" so he headbutted my right in the nose. I trained kickboxing for many years and could have kicked his ass but I didn't wanted to because I still had respect for him even tho he was a bad dad to me. I simply started running and cried. My Mum begged me to stop and talk about it but I keept running and screamed back ""He's not my father anymore!"". When my Mum caught up to me he wasn't even sorry he simply said ""I saw in your eye's that you were about to swing at me"" and I even think he actually believes that. I just said "" You are a bad father were never there for me and have no control over your emotions, You even slapped my mother once!"". He just responded something like I was talking nonsense and I didn't even acknowledge my points. So a day passed and he just acted like nothing happend and asked me if I wanted to visit my Uncle. He never really apologized for what happend to me but I could tell he was sorry so I forgave him. I'm 22 now and I got little sister now that is 2 now. Over the years my dad changed a lot he is very chill and rarely gets angry. He even tells me I did good and asks me for help and thanks me for it.He also shows me that he loves me. But still sometimes we get into big arguments. My mom was most of the time a very good mother and shows me lots of love but she is still very meticulous and criticizes me all the time. We get along pretty good like 90% of the time. But we still have arguments that almost get physical. They then always tell me you only sit around and don't help us. I always help them when they ask me and never tell them no. But they expect me to help without them even asking. I going to be honest I'm a lazy guy.  Don't wan't to do things if people are not even thankful. For example I used to mawn the lawn without them asking but insted of a thank you I got only complaints. Today we had a big argument again. Yesterday my Sister got attacked my our neighbours cat she got scratches on her face and chest. So my dad was pissed all day comes home from work. And tells me he got an idea lets put a net around on our fence so the cat can't get into our property. I told him that's a bad idea since the cat can easly get on our property because cats can climb and jump. I suggested he should talk to our neighbours first. and he just got pissed. ""Why are you arguing? Who's are you on ? You are useless. You don't care about your sister. You don't help us. bla bla bla"". I got really pissed because he's acting like a retard again and that comment that I don't care about my sister got me really mad.  Especially since I was right. He talked to our neighbours and they told him they will keep the cat inside from now on. My Parents both have a lot of pride and never wan't to give in. I talked to them multiple times and they know all this and just find excuses or talk their way out of this. I know I wasn't the perfect son but I'm still a good kid i have an good job in IT, I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I always take care of my little sister, I always very nice and never get into trouble. I have very thick skin because of all this but I'm just feed up always arguing having to defend my self. I love my Parents both the fullest but they are just to difficult to live with.

I think the best option would be just to move out and most of the problems would be solved.

I'm looking forward to your guys and girls advice.

532,"I have a ""friend"" who for the sake of  me not wanting to give out his name I'll just call him A. There is another person involved in this and they will be known as B. I've known A and B since I was about 7. And for most of the years that we've known each other B and I have agreed that A is kind of an narcissistic prick. I've been kind of mean to him a lot I acknowledge that but I feel like sometimes I just don't like him and paint him as some sort of sociopath with no empathy for anyone. It's kind of been worrying me since I don't like being that kind of person so I thought I would come to Reddit to ask for your advice. Im going to make a whole list of all the things he's done to all the people he's met, and all the things that we have done to him while also trying to be as unbiased as possible.

What we (my friend group that he is in) have done to him

I mostly just make fun of him a lot of the time and poke fun of his ""interest in cars"" which is just him pointing out that he wants a Lamborghini whatever it's called and telling us about his rc car that's waterproof and can go 40 mph and can moves at 15 gigahertz per second. At B's 13th birthday party he brought his tablet and he left it unlocked so we posted stupid stuff on his Snapchat story like ""my brain Doo Doo lol"" ""I'm gei"" yeah that was immature. I understand that I we shouldn't have done that. But how he reacted think was not ok at all. He completely flipped out, bitch slapped B's friend C, and just had a total meltdown calling everyone faggots and shoving people. Then he spent like half an hour begging B to have sleep over at his house. So basically we make light and yeah sometimes offensive jokes about him. He has asked me specifically to stop on multiple occasions and I haven't at all.

What he has done to other people

I went to you guys and not him because when I try to tell him these kinds of things like what happened at the birthday party, he tells me I'm making it all up and that that's not what happened at all. But everyone there remember what he did very vividly. This happens very regularly where we ask if he realizes what hes doing and then he completely denies what actually happened. For the entirety of 7th grade he continued to shit on this one kid who I have absolutely no idea what he did to A. He also thinks that you are racist if you say something like ""that person is black"" but also hangs out with the kid who thinks it's ok to say the n word because he is Mexican and still does to this day. He makes up complete and total lies and stories that we all know for a fact never happened and he knows we know that too and yet he still makes up lies about himself that don't even matter. He thinks that because he was on the wrestling team for 4 years (he wasn't he was on it for 2 weeks then quit.) That he can go around picking fights with people who have a muscle density that is larger than his weight. (He's pretty skinny and short, doesn't pretty much starves himself because his ADHD pills make him not hungry. Like you can literally see his ribcage through his shirt.) And has gotten the shit beaten out of him multiple times but goes around telling everybody that he can beat anyone up. He also is the most clingy person I have ever met. If he has any opportunity to be around B he will grab it. We were hanging out at my house and I was standing next to B and He pushes and shoves me going ""fuck you! fuck you!"" So he can stand next to B. He constantly begs him to come to his house and when A says he doesn't want to he goes ""ok."" Then asks him a little later. He also threw a glowstick into the school that we went to's lake started laughing at the ducks trying to eat it. that's all I know about. 

What do you guys think?

533,"I (F25) recently realised that I have romantic feelings for my best friend (F25) and I don't know how to proceed with this. Whenever we hang out, we laugh, cuddle and hug a lot, we've always done that. When I'm with her it's like the world stands still and all my troubles are gone. The last couple of times and especially last weekend, I've noticed this really strong urge to kiss her and I just can't get enough of her. I always miss her the second we part ways. I imagine living my life with her, growing old together and it would make me the happiest person in the world. She is amazing and means everything to me.

Now the thing is, I am asexual. She is a lesbian with a very high sex drive. So realistically, that wouldn't work out in the long run. She has different urges and needs and I wouldn't be able to give her that fulfillment. I know that sex is a very important part of a normal relationship but it's simply out of question for me and not up for debate.

The other thing is, I don't want to put our friendship in danger by making things weird. I'm pretty sure she doesn't feel the same way about me. I remember how around the time she realised she's into girls, she jokingly said ""You're perfect and all but I could never marry you, I mean you're my best friend, it would be weird. And you're...you. haha"". We were laughing about it but deep down it broke my heart.

How do I go about this now? Do I just suck it up and suppress my feelings and hope they go away again? Do I tell her, putting our friendship at risk?",18Jun2019,1
534,Im wanting to go into cyber security because it pays good and has a shortage of workers. My thought is i would go through this 2 year program at a local college and get straight into the workforce. Is having a bachelor's worth the money and effort? Or would a 2 year be sufficient?,18Jun2019,2
535,"So the backstory, it's my third day as a dishwasher - really good job actually, good pad and two of my best friends work there with me - and last night (I work 3 - 10) my back was hurting so bad that I almost couldn't hug my grandparent because it was so hard to lean, now it hurts to bend over.  


Anyway, I called in due to this because I don't want to risk injuring my back more or fear that I just can't actually do what's required of me.  


I fear that the chefs (basically my bosses) will think something of me because it's only my 3rd day. They're really nice, but I fear that this will impact my down the road, I mean they're extremely understaffed (and that's kind of the issue, the guy is all alone today, not particularly busy, but still) so I won't get fired, but I fear that it won't help me either.  


I just don't know things when it comes to this as I've had a checkered history with school attendance due to personal factors and my dad has called in a good amount in the past because is old job was so bad and because he has a bad medical history (diabetes since he was 10 and 3 transplants).   


My EQ (Emotional Quotient) is lower than most so reading people in a way that's not like freaking Dexter is sometimes difficult for me unless I recognize their body language and the way they're acting or I've known them for a while, but bosses are hard for me to read and I don't know the social norms when it comes to this stuff.  


So, I'm just looking for some advice on what to do from here on out to make sure that they know I'm not faking it and so this doesn't negatively affect me later on, but also some explanation on social norms/assumptions from employers side and employee's side when it comes to calling in and such.  


Anything is appreciated!",18Jun2019,2
536,"FYI I’m using an alt account in case I actually am just an ignorant douche.

I’m a young white man and I wore blackface as a young teenager. Here’s the context if it matters:

My friends and I lived in a rural town with a lot of hicks and we had a long running series of YouTube videos where we made fun of the crazy rural right wing culture of the town. Around that time the Walmart in town was selling “werewolf makeup” in large quantities for Halloween. It was clearly the skin tone of an average black man and that was obviously why it was selling so well (also on a side note you don't need that color to look like a fucking werewolf.) We constantly made fun of the makeup by making jokes about how old horror movies and teen wolf were ahead of their time by including werewolf American actors and other stuff like that (because we were cool edgy know-it-alls) and it became a running joke among our friends. We were making a video around that time and one of our actors dropped out. Somebody jokingly suggested one of us could dress up like a ""werewolf"" and play the part. Unfortunately I volunteered. 

Now, we knew the context of blackface at that time, but we ignored it because we were deluded into thinking we were comedy geniuses and that we would be the next south park. The part was written before we had ever thought of the makeup, and was not racist in any other way. The original audience for the film all understood the context and were not offended, however they were mostly white. 

Years later I'm embarrassed and constantly scared someone will find the video and judge me incorrectly based on it, but a part of me still says there's nothing wrong with it. Even though I was an idiot, I did originally do it because I thought I was making an anti-racist statement. I know many will not see it that way and I'm starting to count myself as one of them.

Should I delete the video?

I feel conflicted in smallest of decisions.

542,"I have two regular people who come in that ai am really struggling to deal with. Technically they do nothing ""wrong"" but the ammount of distress they cause warrants action.

The first one I have manager approval to kick out. He is an older guy who can make PG jokes sound slimy and turns PG kid shows into pedophilia.  His direct words and what he does is technically not crossing in lines, but they way in which he says them and the force in which he does definitely does. He is now bothering other coworkers besides me, and I need to get a spine and kick him out. But he is not all there and I have never kicked someone out. I dont know how to kick someone out, especially someone whose actions currently dont warrant calling the police.

The other one is (almost ) entirely personal, but partially because others walk away when they see her. She is a regular that has a hairline trigger of being offended. (saying I'm sorry, or saying Mam is condescending and results in a lecture) every time I work with her my anxiety level goes through the roof for days to follow. I am terrified of what I can possibly say to piss her off.  I dont want to interact with her at all, and I find her behavior to be downright bullying. But her words are TECHNICALLY appropriate.... but I can typically handle bully customers. (There is another that my boss has pretty much directed to other stores, and has threatened physical violence- but I can make him leave calm and ready for the next step) but the level of anxiety she provokes in me is off the charts, and half of it is that she leaves me little to work with. I cannot say I am sorry. I cannot talk, I cannot listen, she doesn't cross any lines that allow me to take action... she just sucks any power I have away. Maybe in this case it isnt me knowing what to do with her but learning to deal with me, and take back my own power.

548,"My roommate and I got a dog 12 years ago. In 12 days we are finally going to be separating. 2 years ago the heartbeat of our home suddenly got very sick from hemangiosarcoma. I bought him. But as a gift for my roommate. But we raised him together for over a decade. He was OURS. And I LOVED him. He was smart. SCARY smart. You wouldn't believe me if I told you. He could and would actively trick people. And he would plan on how he would do it and work an angle for HOURS until it worked. He would growl at me while I spoke on the phone, if I even jokingly said something mean about him. Even tho I was laughing. So it wasn't the tone he was picking up on. He was a child. A son. He was literally everything. My roommate first noticed something was off. Because they were always together. But I worked from home, so he was always with me every day all day long. When my roommate came home. Boo!!! He was gone. Ha. He noticed. Asked me. I as we his corpse white gums and ran him to the car. I raced - literally weaving in and out of traffic at 120 mph to get him to a special surgical vet practice. His stomach was full of blood. It was 3x its size. Hemangiosarcoma is cancer of be blood vessel system. He was a SMALL dog - a breed NEVER associated with this disease. The blood vessel system begins to grow eff'd up cancerous cells that don't know how to properly regenerate his vascular system. So they basically just make whatever nightmare out of his veins they want. Like, imagine a perfect vascular system. Now imagine someone grabbed a bunch of those veins and tangled the all up, like a giant knotted ball of yarn you cant unravel. The system stops making sense. Blood doesn't go where it's supposed to. Eventually that yarn knot of veins blows, spilling blood out all over the abdomen. It's a special and insidious cancer. There is no worse cancer a dog can get...but really for the owner. It's not painful for the dog. They know something is wrong. But it's not like bone cancer. Which I've dealt with too many times to count. That's ALL pain. With this type, once the yarn knot of veins bursts, anything the blood spilling out touches, leaves a seedling of itself in the tissue of anything in the chest or abdominal cavity.

We rushed him there. He was in surgery all night. We stayed together. They came out HOUR later and said he did well. Then an hour later they said his heart stopped beating and he was no longer breathing. This vet kept telling us shit like ""let him go in peace"". Blah blah. She put us in a god damn mourning room. My roommate panicked and ran out when he realized what it was.

When the doctor came back I was furious, I grabbed her and screamed in her face: ""HIS HEART STOPPED FUCKING BEATING, DID IT?! HE STOPPED FUCKING BREATHING, DID HE?! THEN WHAT THE F*** ARE YOU DOING HERE WITH US?!!!!! GET YOUR FUCKING ASS BACK THERE AND RESUCCITATE HIM?! SAVE HIS GODDAMN LIFE!! THATS YOUR FUCKING JOB, RIGHT?! SAVING LIVES?! NOT BEING A LAZY ASSHOLE AND SIMPLY TELLING US TO ACCEPT YOUR INCOMPETANCE!!! so get your ass back there and revive him. NOW. Because that dog WANTS to live. He has more life in his tiny little body at one moment than most people have their entire lives. Do it. NOW!""

(It was a terrifying and emotional time for us and my roommate is kind and couldn't handle it. So I took the mother effing wheel). 

And then she revived him. 

Hours later. It happened again. She came to tell us, and I saw her face and knew what she was going to say, before my roommate did. So I flew out of my seat, locked eyes with her, and stormed forward. Close enough that as I bore down on her and mouthed the words ""FIX IT! NOW!!!!"" She jumped and turned around and ran back.

He was revived again.

And he stayed revived. The following day we were told that he was officially cancer free. At least on a macroscopic level. 

They kept him for a week. We stayed the entire time. Sleeping on wooden benches in the waiting room. Our bill was $42,000. We would've paid 10x that amount. 

Then he came home. 

He bounced back quickly. 

Two weeks later, he went for his scan and first chemo treatment. ...where they found 4 new tumors had sprouted.  They sent him home with new meds. Two weeks later he went back for another scan and to gauge improvement. He now had too many tumors to count. And one was attached to his heart.

He died in our arms together 3 months after the race to the vet that very first night. 

He was dead before the hair, shaved during his initial surgery, had even grown back. That's how fast it grows.

There is no cure.

The night we took him...when that happens. Almost every single dog will be dead within hours. But not my Boy. He was a fighter. He lived it and breathed it.

I told my roommate early on after diagnosis not to Google hemangiosarcoma. He didn't. He knew how bad it must be for me to warn him off of it. The first link I clicked said ""this is the worst and most insidious cancer type any dog can get.  It comes out of nowhere and so quickly, it will ravage the body before you even realize anything was ever wrong at all."" My roommate knew MONTHS before that something was off. The way he held his tail, his ears. Still playing and being a little jerk and attacking the other dogs. Ha. But he saw it right away. And he did everything right. This feeling of something being off, it knawed at him. He couldn't sleep. So we spent $10k on every exam available to us at that time. We took him to one of the most well regarded veterinary oncology practices in the country. And at this point, it was for a simple extraction. They saw something on a scan that looked like a part of a toy and assumed that was the issue. He went it, the piece was removed. ....but then they saw something else on his follow-up scan. While awaiting exploratory surgery...came the night his gums went corpse white.

Losing him...IT KILLED US. We have 3 other dogs. He can't even bring himself 2 years later to be around them. He sleeps upside down on his bed. And has...for two years. Because he can't sleep the normal way without him curled up in his arm nook under the blankets. I've done everything for him. I didn't even get to grieve.

I've kept a candle lit 24/7 in his bedroom next to all these pictures of him, for years. I won't allow a candle to ever go out. 

We got his ashes back awhile ago. They're out of the box. But they're still ziptied into a thick plastic bag. I begged for him to open the bag. I don't like the idea of him trapped inside of a tight thick plastic bag. But he won't open it. 

In 12 days, after 12 years, we will finally be moving away from each other. I have to take our 3 other dogs. I don't even have a job. I didn't think he would leave yet...until I did. But he is. And he won't give me even a VIAL's worth of his ashes. Not even a small vial of my dogs ashes. He was our*** dog. I bought the dog for him over a decade ago - he was six weeks old. He chose my roommate. I kinda of made him. I wanted my roommate to have that bond with him, and I knew it would happen with me if I didn't push the dog away a bit at first. (I hate calling him the dog. But can't bring myself to write his name). It worked. He chose my roommate and my roommate worshipped him. He didn't date for a decade...because he wanted to spend every free moment with him for as long as he possibly could. But I was unemployed after graduation for a long time. I spent every day, all day, for years and years with him. I loved him JUST AS MUCH. 

He loved me too. Either of us would've died for him. And we both died when he did. The heart of our home just stopped beating when we lost him. It was like death to be there without him. Always seeing him around every corner. If make the dogs food bowls up - I cook for them. For a year I kept forgetting not to make his bowl up. 

It was the worst thing ever. 

I want to take a small vial amount of his ashes. I can do it and my roommate would never know. I have asked so many times and he refuses to open the bag and says he doesn't want to break him apart. I understand that. But I want, I NEED, to keep a piece of him with me for the rest of my life. I know what that dog meant to him. He doesn't really acknowledge what he meant to me tho. 

I just don't know what the right thing to do is. Is it totally messed up to take a miniscule amount of his ashes, to keep a piece of a dog who was like a son to me, with me? I don't know what's right anymore. I would normally just do it. But I do see his point. I can't see whats right.

Please offer any and all opinions.  I'm not a bad person. I loved him just as much as he did. It's not fair. I have no part of him, he has everything of his. His crate - which was actually my goldens travel crate - full of all of his old blankets and beds and toys. He has ALL of his toys and his hoard of stuff he would collect around the house that we found hidden behind an old couch. He has all his pictures. Picture I took and printed and framed. I can't even have a small vial of my own dogs ashes? Am I messed up for thinking I deserve that much? 

I don't know what to do. It's too hard to say goodbye and not have a part of him to take with me.",18Jun2019,1
549,"This is a case of overbearing parents and I need some advice.  I come from a very close, conservative family.  So my younger sibling (18) is a freshman in college and has been dating their SO since high school.  Sibling and SO live in the same town, and my parents recently discovered that they had been spending the night at each other's apartments some nights, as would be expected.  My parents got mad, but told my sibling they couldn't stop them from staying the night at SO's place.  When my sibling came home for summer and SO stayed in their college town, my sibling asked if it would be okay to go back to the college town and spend the weekend with SO (staying at their apartment).  Parents said no, it turned into a big fight and they threatened to take away my sibling's vehicle (my parents own the vehicle legally) if he stayed at SO's place.

Normally this wouldn't affect me.  But this is posing an issue for me because I (21F) am moving away from my boyfriend next fall and we are planning to do long distance.  Naturally I'd like to spend some nights at my boyfriend's place or have him spend some nights at mine.  I don't want to have to lie to my parents about where I am, but I'm not sure what they'd think about us spending the night together.  They could take my car away since it is legally theirs.  But my relationship with my boyfriend would suffer if I couldn't spend a few weekends with him.  The issue hasn't come up with my parents yet, but I'm anticipating it.

Bear in mind this wouldn't be an issue and I'd do whatever the hell I wanted if I wasn't financially dependent on my parents.  If I make them mad enough they'll cut me off.

BUT they haven’t messaged me again today, and i want to ask them if we’re ok to talk now, but i’m terrified they don’t want me to talk to them again or something. basically the last thing they properly said to me before last night’s conversation was 4 months ago and it was a nasty combination of things like “you’re dead to me” “do not ever talk to me again” “go away” “leave me the fuck alone” and ik this sounds dumb but i literally ,didn’t do anything to provoke such hostility. i just think they hate me. or hated me, bc from our conversation last night it seemed like none of it had ever happened and we were back to 2018 when things were perfect. i’ve missed them so much for so long. is it a good idea to message them today and ask them what’s going on?",18Jun2019,1
553,I’m taking a sociology class over summer session and it’s with a black male professor who is forcing us to write an essay on how to combat “white privilege”. I feel this is racist because I’m poor and have struggled my entire life and I’ve also not been racist or prejudiced to anyone. This professor seems to really hate white people and does things such as letting the black students talk first if they raise their hand.

554,"My girlfriend always has had self esteem and self worth issues, both stemming from mental health and slight trauma. I've been extremely patient in our year long relationship to do everything I can to support her and show her love, but recently I've hit a wall that I have no idea how to break through.

She's had issues where she refuses to let people(including me) close and to help her out, and thankfully we've worked past that although she still gets fussy. However last night she got high(weed) with friends, had a bad trip and left for home. She had this whole grand enlightened revelation(y'know how you think you're Enstein on weed) that she is not valid and while she'll let people love and care about her, she thinks they're wrong. It was really upsetting to listen to and it caused me to emotionally shut down just so I could continue the conversation. I tried pep talk, I looked up stuff on psyche articles, I tried everything I knew. And she found some little loophole each time. I worked through it because I thought it would stop in the morning, and she apologized when she woke up for how she acted but not what she said. 

I'm a really clingy person and I love her so much. I mean it when I say I'd go through hell for her, and I have and we've always come out better and stronger. But this is different, something about this isnt sitting right. We were supposed to get coffee but I dont even want to see her right now if I'm being honest. I've thought about giving her an ultimatum, something like ""I cant be with someone who thinks I'm wrong for wanting to care"", but I'm worried that's manipulative. We have a therapist that we see both together and separate, and I've thought about bringing it up in a together session. 

I dont know what to do. I love her but I'm so tired from supporting her through all of these things and having to bust my ass just to get her to try and get up.",18Jun2019,1

556," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence and I worried she hated me for it also she sometimes look at my hair funny sometimes :/",18Jun2019,0
557,"  

This might be an example of a first world problem and could make me seem ungrateful. I apologize in advance for that. I have been at the same company for over ten years. Way over. I do not have a degree but have been trying to improve my marketability in other ways. I am being vague to make it harder to identify me.

Over the many years I have had this job I have gotten periodic raises. The pay is nice and there are bonuses. My problem is that I want to work in a field in which I could experience more satisfaction. I get very little in my current role and the clock is ticking on my age. The general field I am interested in does not pay as well – at least not at first. The progress I have made towards that field are evidently not enough to offset this likely difference in pay.

We have a house payment, car payments, and most of the other expenses that generally go along with being an adult. I cannot afford a severe drop in income. I do not want to continue at my current job for another year, but I cannot seem to find any job in my desired field that can compete as far as compensation is concerned. I feel trapped and unhappy.

558,"It has always been my dream to get into one of the best universities in Russia. I have been studying hard for past 2 years both in school and out of school. However, today I learned that I got quite a low score in one of the exams that are required to get into that university. There are 4 exams overall, and the one I didn’t get a good mark on was supposed to be the easiest one. So i definitely won’t be able to get into that university for free, and it is quite expensive. My parents said that it’s okay and they could afford my education without any problems. But I don’t know what to do because, firstly, i think my parents are downplaying the cost of going to that university so I would calm down, and secondly, because I feel like my parents paying for my education would discredit all the hard work I put into it, like I’m going to buy my education instead of working for it. I could easily get into a second-tier university for free,but I still don’t know if that is the right thing for me.

568,"Hey all,

So as the title says, I just got my grades back after studying graphic design for three years and although I am happy with a 2.1 and feel that my work does reflect the grade, I was wondering whether there is any possible way to somehow make up that 0.65%.

In both my first and second year at university, I finished the years with a first and even managed to score 96% on one 60 credit module. In my final year however, I really struggled with my mental health which then impacted my work, so I feel as though the 2.1 reflects that. This means that a reassessment might not be the best way to go about things, even though I only need such a small improvement to my overall grade.

572,"Honestly I haven't made much of a decision yet for certain reasons.

1.I hate math, and had a terrible foundation in it back in high school. I took algebra 1 and was average, algebra 2 was a disaster because our teacher was pushing lesson after lesson everyday with little to no time to process things. So overall, my foundation in math makes me certain that I'd fuck up my GPA in my first year if I take anything related to calculus.

2.I want to pursue multiple things, but these multiple things that I'm mostly into are apperently impractical when applying for a job. I'm very methodical and organized, so I want a job that would help me learn about leading others.

3.I want to learn how to code and fix computers, but my lack of interest and skill in math prevents me from doing so.

4.I wanted to join the military, but my allergies disqualify me from doing so, so much for that.

My choices of a major/minor is:

1. Associates in Accounting/Finance, Bachelors in Computer Science.

2.Associates in Criminal Justice, Bachelor's in Accounting/Finance.

3.Associates in Psychology, Bachelors in Criminal justice.

4.Associates in Business Administration, Bachelors in Computer Science.


My Aspirations in life: To start an online shopping business as a side project, along with creating YouTube videos on Star Wars and Legos. Along with that, I wanted to work in Accounting/Finance. I want to be in a management position to learn to manage and delegate tasks, all while not interacting with people all that much. One thing about me to mention is that I HATE socializing, so anything customer service related is not for mr.

I'm overall working in a logistics company as a clerk, and I love it because I'm left alone to organizing and controlling everything in the background with little to no talking. So overall I enjoy working in the background, learning leadership skills, and be able to create things on the side. BTW I am most likely studying part time since I have a full time office job, so I'm not sure how that will play in.

Anyways, I am taking a short trip, less than 2 hrs travel, with my SO this weekend.

Had a few good conversations while on break, so I asked her to get coffee and she denied me..

fast forward a few months and I texted her asking how things are etc...
I didn’t know much about her life outside of work, and it turns out we have lots of things in common, like life goals and important/unique things in common..

we both seemed surprised and we began having these cool conversations over text; nothing long, but she seemed inspired by our texts...

a couple days later I asked if she has the same stance about coffee,
and she said she does because she wants to “focus on personal growth in this time and shouldn’t be getting coffee with guys right now”, that she’s very busy with a lot etc.

I’ve told her clearly that she could openly tell me she doesn’t want to talk in any way, and I’ll accept that and move on... because I’d rather her be blunt then be afraid to hurt my feelings and I get led on.

both times i said that she showed she wants to keep talking, and the second time she said that she doesn’t mind talking, i seem “really nice and cool” and that it’s interesting that we have stuff in common etc, but that she shouldn’t be getting coffee with guys during this time.

583,"As per norm, letting you guys know I'm using on mobile so formatting could be iffy. Also this could be kinda long so thanks in advance for reading. 

I (21m) have been struggling recently. I feel isolated and alone... for background, I am going to college for Education and absolutely love it. I also have a part time job working retail at the most off the wall shoe company around. Also, I'm in a relationship with my girlfriend (20f). However, school or work seem to be my only happy places besides the gym.

I feel boxed in for multiple reasons: 
1) I really love my friends, but we dont have any common interests anymore. I'm afraid to move on because I've know them for years now, but I feel as if we are all just growing further apart. It's quite a mess really, as my girlfriend and another one of my friends (22f) - who is how we know the rest of our group - aren't getting along. This is putting me in an awkward situation because I feel my girlfriend is in the right but I've been isolated from the group as a result. I have tried to talk to them separately about it, but my gf's anxiety is currently preventing her from speaking to our friend about what is going on and if I attempt to talk to my friend I feel like she's treating me like a child. I just don't get it because they were super close until recently and I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick because I'm not cut off due to their bs. 

2) My parents are going off the deep end stressing about my little sister. She enrolls for her first semester in college this upcoming fall. We're all really proud of her. Our mom is absolutely losing it, though. I'm afraid that my parents marriage isn't going to last at this rate... my dad has told me twice that he is having doubts, and at the rate mom is consuming tequila, I can't blame him. Additionally, I understand why mom is drowning her sorrows because my sister is the only thing keeping my dad financially responsible (he's an artist). Once she leaves home, more than likely my mom will have to pick up a second job to keep the lights on. My dad just doesn't give a shit and would rather invest more into his art studio than pay bills. 

3) Finally, I've been struggling to express myself recently. I dont feel comfortable in the clothes I like because they are so radically different from what my friends wear. My taste in music, which I will admit is pretty garbage sometimes, isn't liked my anyone I know. And I guess to top it all off, I've recently been getting into tattooing/body modification and literally everyone but my dad is against it... my mom even told me I wouldn't be allowed back home if I did anything of the sorts. It just sucks man because I feel like I have nowhere to go and nobody to turn to. This has never happened to me before.

So essentially all that is to say I no longer have a solid support system and I dont know what to do or where to go. I can rely on my girlfriend, of course, but there's only so much she can do... the people I turn to most in times of need are all either mentioned above or live across the country... I just dont know what to do. I don't want to sit idly by, but I feel helpless.",18Jun2019,0

585,"Hello, this will be a LONG post as I need to explain myself pretty in depth for any of this to make sense.

A while back, I made a post about losing weight for cosplay. I absolutely love to sew and create in general, so my initial thoughts went towards cosplay, but I wouldn't dare to with how my body looks now due to personal discomfort. I bought a sewing machine and everything after being inspired to lose weight and... I failed. For the millionth time, and with an 80 dollar sewing machine sitting in my room to remind me of that. I decided to give up on losing weight after that, because i'm not unhealthily obese and in fact in relatively good shape for being 50 pounds over. That and the fact that I have very little constitution for anything not involving money.

Looking at that impulsively purchased new machine makes me depressed, because I really do love creating, always have, and I have no reason to now, so I can't. I realize I could sew plushies or something as a hobby, but like I said, i'm very money minded and i'm not up for buying minky and stuffing and whatever else, which could easily amount to 50-100 bucks for something impractical and with no returns whatsoever. I also refuse to sell on etsy or related craft sites because of how flooded they are and after seeing my dad fail to make more than 5 sales in a year on his own tshirt store.

Then I remembered when I used to be a furry. Keyword USED to, I absolutely despise the community now. I understand that a good portion of the fandom are perfectly nice, decent, and creative individuals, but the extend to which the hyper political, vindictive, and at worst, criminal members overpower the decent ones is too much for me. In that community I constantly had on a happy and wholesome face outwardly because I was constantly in a mode where I had to be an example as to how awesome the community was and to avoid the dog and child fuckers in the corner. It became too much, and I made a goodbye post on my twitter, after which that account was put on blast anyways because I spoke out from the inside. And even though at that point I hated them, I was still devastated, guilty even. I had made friends, I had had some fun, I had established myself a little. I felt as if I let everyone down, but they were the ones hurting me in the end.

I promised that I would never return. And I don't plan to return to being fully invested, or even being invested beyond a business standpoint.

What I am considering is to start up a fursuit making business to not only support my desire to sew, but also to fulfill my dream of working from home and setting my own hours, two goals which are difficult if not impossible to avoid running into scams while chasing them unless you're in a home-business situation like this. I fully understand the risks and benefits of running such an operation, responsibility-wise, monetarily and socially. But I feel as if this is the best way to achieve the ideals I have for a job, albeit far, far, far from in a way that I would be proud of personally. Obviously I'm not going to jump the gun and do it immediately, but I do already have a blank promotion-only twitter account lying in wait, but I needed to ask an unbiased group for their opinion.

Is this unforgivably deceptive? Do they even deserve any more attention from me after what the community has done to me? Am I in the right or wrong, and should I go through with it or not?

Please don't be overly angry with me about this if I am wrong about this. I am only looking for a discussion of opinions and not a ragey rant. However, please let me know of any other way I can fulfill these ideals without coming back there. It seems like this is the only way I can achieve these things in the future, and i'm welcome to any way out.",18Jun2019,1

We started talking when we made a group chat with some friends and started video chatting and stuff. In a night I remained with her until 2 am. I helped her get over her break up because at that time I was struggling with one aswell. We ae talking daily since then. She lives in Belgium, she moved t there since second grade. She comes back in about 2 weeks.

So thats how me and F14 started talking daily. Now comes in play M15 - a kinda best friend, we get along very well and done so many things together but we got different friends and interests. While I am about a 6/10 he is a 10/10 (beauty wise). But he is pretty dumb and cocky, he likes to praise himself and he lies from time to time. So M15 talks with F14 aswell, and I feel wierd, as I think I am the one for her even though I know I am not. I think that she does not enjoy talking with me most of the time, even though she starts conversations most of the time. I love her and I am very attached with her and I dont want to loose this beautiful friendship. She is an amazing girl.


I know its a wierd story, I have no idea how to read girls, and if they are 1600 km away its even harder. I am scared that I will be replaced by M15, even though I know he is a dick and F14 pretty much hates him.

This is more like a place for me to tell this story, as not many people know it. I accept any time of advice. If you need more info I can provide.",18Jun2019,2

593,"Long story short... I moved from a city (midsized) to Central Pennsylvania to be with my now fiance about 5+ years ago. When we met and dated he told me he wanted to eventually move (he owns his house). At the time it felt like it would be difficult to sell and I was kinda ok with the rural/ suburban area (it was something new). But fast forward and I am absolutely miserable and he doesn't seem to have any intention to move. I don't like the area or even our neighborhood. I don't have any friends close by and I work from home so I feel pretty isolated. And as someone who is pretty liberal the conservative views can take a toll, it's not that I don't understand or empathize or can't be friends with someone with opposite political views...but the number of Confederate flags here are astounding. Anyways I know this is not the place for me, I feel like I've put in enough time, I just don't know what to do, I don't like the idea of ultimatums or breaking it off but I don't think he's really motivated to move. 

PS he makes a lot more money than I do so it feels like he's the one in control most of the time.

596,"Alright well not literally love, but you get the idea.
I’ve been working at my current job for about 3 years now and I love it. I have 2 bosses. An older one 50+ and another one, well call her Paula. Paula is 28 and I am 21. 

I know it sounds crazy, but I have literally been in love with this fucking girl for so long. But for whatever reason, I get so nervous around her. 

I do NOT have a hard time talking to girls at all. It’s super easy for me . Not to sound cocky in any way, but I’m a pretty attractive guy and I know I have a really good personality. I am a huge people person. So approaching a girl I like, spitting game is easy for me and I NEVER get nervous .

But when it comes to Paula, I get soooo nervous. Like I don’t know how to act around her. I get all up in my head. Maybe the age difference has something to do with it, but still.  I get really anxious and try to think of things to say. I don’t know how to present myself around her or anything. Like I want to try and present myself as older and more mature, but then again, I don’t want to try too hard. I know she must get a lot of guys trying to talk to her, so I don’t like to constantly try hard to talk to her. If she has a bunch of guys on her, I back off so I don’t come off as “another one of those guys”.

I also get the feeling that she lowkey f**ks with me. I notice that she treats me different from other coworkers. She’ll walk by me and like poke me and or like gently push me or punch me. So that’s obviously a good sign. Her tone also changes when she talks to me. There was also a point where, we wouldn’t like TEXT, but she would randomly send me songs and be like “listen to this” or “if you don’t know, now you know” and we would go back and forth. 
Maybe it’s just wishful thinking but I feel like she does kinda fuck with me. 

I highly believe in the law of attraction. When I met this girl when I was 18, I told myself and the universe, “One way or another, I will have a shot at Paula” and ever since then I’ve been very methodical in my approach to her. And like I said, I feel like she feels some type of way about me. Like maybe she would fuck with me. 

I just need some advice man, how do I go about this.",18Jun2019,1
597,"Okay this is kind of weird to write out but it's been bugging me for a few weeks now. I guess I do this thing, I never really have it much thought before this incident.

Just a bit of background I work in a retail job and we routinely move heavy stuff around tight spaces which is relevant in a minute. I've worked at this place for a few years and have known of all the people I work with but only actually worked with these people at this store for about 3 months ;

 I have this habit of touching peoples elbows, mostly to get their attention. So I'll be at work and come up behind a colleague who is busy and I'll sort of tickle their elbow and say ""hey when you got a sec"" or if I'm behind them in a tight space I do it and say ""just behind you"" just to do my best to not disrupt them dealing with a customer but let them know I need something or so they're aware I'm next to them.

 So a few weeks ago, a colleague was talking with a group of folk from another store and there was a fairly urgent phone call for them. So I approach him, touch his elbow and before I could say hey phones for you he whirls around and almost yells "" You need to STOP touching me."" I told him I was really sorry, handed him the phone and continued my day. I approached him a while later when we werent busy and held off on the elbow touching, I told him again that I wanted to let him know that I was genuinely sorry and I appreciate him telling me that I did something that made him uncomfortable.  He didnt even look at me and kind of just shrugged it off.

I do genuinely feel horrible, I never considered it was any different than tapping someone on the shoulder (which, I know it's odd but has always felt rude to me) I've asked a couple other coworkers who I'm pretty close with if it bothers them and they said they dont mind at all, but I'm so worried about making other people uncomfortable. 

How do I handle this ? Do I start asking everyone their preferred method of me getting their attention? I'm 22/f and have been the subject of workplace harassment and would never ever want to make somebody feel that way. I've wanted to ask the colleague that got offended why it bothered him so much, if its touching in general or just his elbow or what, but he pretty much wont talk to me since. 

I really appreciate anyone who reads this through and gives it some thought. Again I know it's a bit odd so thanks in advance.",18Jun2019,1

We've been together for seven years and we have a house (and therefore a mortgage) together, so we're already in it for the long haul. He knows that I'm ready to tie the knot, and I know that he does not want *me* to pop the question. It's a subject that often comes up as all of our friends often ask when we're gonna get married. I've promised him that I won't bring up the subject of proposal, as he says he'll do it eventually. We do, however, openly talk about what we would want for our wedding and stuff (you know how when you're at a wedding and go ""oh, I would do that differently at our wedding"").

So, I wait. But I've waited for years already, and I don't think I can wait forever. It makes me feel like he's either A) not sure that he wants to spend his life with me, or B) not in the same place as me and not ready to be married yet. Either way, I feel like if it doesn't happen soon, it's gonna be the end of us.

I don't know what to do. I obviously love him and want to spend my life with him, but if we're not on the same page about this, maybe we're just not a match. I don't wanna propose to him, 'cause he's made it clear he doesn't want that. And I promised I wouldn't bring up the subject of proposal so I don't feel like I can have a conversaton with him about my thoughts. Either way, I've already told him that I'm ready and that I'm not gonna wait forever.

605,"Hello, using a throwaway account before we begin.

I just finished university and has moved back home for a gap year before continuing education but have noticed a problem that has really gotten out of hand. My mother, who is in her mid 50’s, is a stay at home mom and doesn’t have many hobbies or activities. Now that me and my brothers are older she doesn’t need to take care of us so she has so much time on her hands. Instead of finding something beneficial to do she’s always on her phone. 

For example today I woke up and went downstairs to find her on her phone. I finished eating breakfast, still on her phone, took a shower, studied, video gamed, all while she’s still cycling through Facebook and Instagram. She makes statuses on Facebook, is constantly checking who likes her posts and who comments on her stuff, even looking back at old posts and their comments/likes. Idk why but I feel like it’s her way of getting attention but she’s hooked. Now when my father and her sit to watch tv and talk my dad needs to repeat a question a few times because she won’t pay attention the first time around as her eyes are stuck on the phone

612,"My friend found a 5 day old kitten a few weeks ago. He was on the side of the road and covered in ants. I got a call from him asking what to do because he was starting a new job and couldn't take care of the kitten. I had a broken foot and nothing else to do so I offered to take care of him until he was eating solid food and was litter box trained. My friend would get to see him every 2 -3 days.

I took care of him and helped him heal and get stronger. His eyes opened and even though he was blind in one it didn't stop him from waddling around and learning to walk. He just started to learn how to play at 3 weeks old, he learned his name and would come when you called it while tapping on the bed or floor, and he was healthy, nothing seemed wrong. The vet said he was doing well.

My foot healed and my gf has a little time off work so I asked if my mom if she could watch him for 3 or 4 days while I visit her in another state. She agreed and my friend was ok with it so I went.

Last night my mom took him over to visit my friend and he seemed normal like nothing was bothering him. This morning I got a call saying he was cold, refusing to eat, and his body was severely swollen. He was taken to the vet and she said that something inside of him didn't form right and he was too young to have surgery and he would die before he was old enough to have it so he had to be put down. 

My mom called me first and told me what happened. After I got off the phone with her my friend called me almost immediately. Hes understandably upset, I apologized over and over and over again. I was asked multiple times if I saw any sign of something wrong, did I notice anything unusual, was I paying attention to his health, and multiple other questions like this. 

I did everything I could, I was feeding him properly, I was making sure he was clean, I was up almost every night, I made sure he got all of my attention, he got plenty of exercise, I would make sure he was using the bathroom ok..... he acted like a normal kitten his age. He showed no signs that he had a problem or was in pain, he ate well, had no problems other than being half blind from ant bites when he was tiny.

## AITA? Am I an Imposter in dev-tech field ?

📷

Hello to all, i need a little bit of help. This is my current situation:

I'm having an interniship with a good webdev agency - they worked for rito games, wizard of the coast, and a lot of high brand of dress - today it's my second month of experience in this field and I haven't a science background (and they know it, I'm not a liar :) ) .

During the training of the first month we see redux saga, redux and a little bit of react native, only on little fake projects just to learn.

After the first month of training they sent me to another web agency, completely alone to make a solo project.

This project is about a money management tool, we are using react as tech stack. I said to my manager that this project was out of my possibility, because...i've a fuckin month of experience + at the beginning i didn't even know how to use git. But he said to me "" you will make it ""

After the first week, thanks to god, another front end join to help us.

During this second month i worked like the hell and i learnt how to use redux thunk, redux form, immutableJs, how to make a good login ( i made it ) and how to use git ( base commands + rebase + how to work in team).

Actually in one month of contribution of this project i made:

* login
* logout
* CustomAvatar ( like in google where you see your nickname and your initial )
* a modal
* the main redirect after the login based on your role
* the verify token
* the animated loader between a page and another
* animated loader on the login
* error handler for the login
* the header of login page
* the tooltips on every button
* a lateral search of four inputs
* i learnt git ( now i'm happy to use it, i also know how to rebase and resolve conflicts )
* i learnt redux thunk, redux saga, redux form, react css module.

I love what i do, i love to code and we have and hard deadline.

in these days they called another front end Developer, probably to replace me at the end of this month.

I have to say that this thought it's only a personal sensation. The starting contract between the two agencies is of one month, no one day more, nor less.

now the actual project manager is clearly bipolar, sometimes yell, sometimes is the best person of the world... Some days ago he just yelled and had a public verbal offense against this new senor developer. But i think that this is because of the hard deadline ( we had only month to sent this project to the customer.

He yelled at me because one night i took the decision to work 3 hours more ( without asking money, and no i'm not jooking )

What i've to think about it ? I'm feeling really sad, and every fuckin mistake that I made is a knife in my heart. I'm really feeling disappointed by my self.

I'm not demovating to quit this job, but really...how can i face this situation ? I'm strongly convinced that my web agency just oversells me ( without any fuckin good reason )",18Jun2019,3

624,"I'll spare the details, but long story short: my father's been an alcoholic since he was an early teenager, so in return he was abusive, creepily fond of ""having a daughter,"" (he doesn't know I'm transgender) and regularly drove around with me while drinking. He went into treatment about three years ago for a couple months, and we thought he was better. Spoiler alert: he's not. The last I saw of him was a few months ago when he had a seriously ugly fight with my family, screamed and yelled, and walked out the door. Then later I found out he's currently in another sober program in another state.

He texted all of my family saying as soon as he can, he's gonna start saving up for all of us to come visit him. My whole family seems to have forgiven him, but I just can't trust him anymore after the trauma he's put me through. (They don't know, by the way, and what they do know they've forgiven him for it because ""he's sick."") Anytime he tries to contact me, I have an anxiety attack.

I don't ever want to see him, and I don't want to be forced on this hypothetical visit, if it happens; it's very unlikely since we're kind of a large family and he's rather far away. Also worth mentioning I'm nearly 17 years old and am usually able to look after myself throughout the day, but still cannot drive (unimportant reasons, just haven't gotten to it.)

My mom (I'm 16 sorry) says everything's normal, but she's the type of person that doesn't care about appearance so I'm not sure if I can believe her. I think she just doesn't want to hurt me.
I don't have a clue what kind of advice do I need. Maybe exercise, maybe some kind of words to remind myself of, maybe you were in a similar situation and succeeded to escape this feeling. Sorry, if this is a weird story, and double sorry, if there's a better subreddit for this. Please, don't be harsh, I feel too sad to react properly.",18Jun2019,2

627,"I was contacted by a recruiter, went through the interview process and ended up being offered the job. I went through the background check and the recruiter is now waiting on me to return my offer letter. The problem is that I don't think I want the job. The job is low paying and the schedule is awful. This is my first post-college job and I was hoping not to make less in the same field that I worked in before I got my degree. For some reason that really doesn't make sense to me. In addition to the money I was hoping to get a better work/life balance out of my college degree.

Now, when the recruiter contacted me I wasn't even looking for employment. I'm unemployed while I finish school but my spouse has a good job. Aside from paying off student loans more aggressively I don't really need anything right now. So I really haven't even taken the opportunity to look for anything better than this yet and I really don't know what's out there. The hourly rate for the job is $4 less than my previous retail sales job and there's no shift differential (which my last job had). There's a commission structure that resembles the commission structure in my old job so overall I'll be making less money. In addition, the hours are even slightly worse than my old job so despite being in the same field it seems my degree really hasn't gotten me anywhere if I accept this position. Also, this position is in a call center and I don't thrive in call centers. I do, however, thrive in sales. 

I feel compelled to mention that this position does have room for advancement. It's just not going to happen as fast as I need it to. I mentioned that things are taken care of right now, but in a year my spouse's contract will end and I'll be needing to pull a lot more weight in order to help us get by. Which brings me to my next point.. I don't think it would look good on my resume to only accept this position for a short period of time. 

I've heard the advice that it's easiest to find jobs after Labor Day when hiring managers return from vacations and business is back in full swing. So I was actually waiting until early September to start searching and applying, which is why I haven't taken the chance to search for anything I might like better yet. I was hoping to explore positions that might pay better or have better hours, and perhaps work-from-home options as well.

At the same time I realize that my expectations may be unreasonable. Perhaps I'm expecting too much out of employment and I should just take this job? I don't know. I'm staying in the same field, money should be better, not worse. If I don't take this position I'll be looking for a full-time position right after Labor Day. In the mean time I can do side gigs such as delivering groceries (Shipt) or food from restaurants (Door Dash) and explore making money online. I'm not expecting side gigs or online work to add up to what this position is offering, but I will keep myself open to other opportunities should they arise. What should I do? If I should decline this offer, how do I decline? They've already completed the background check.",18Jun2019,1
628,"The most important parts of this are that I currently live over 8 hours away, that she has spent all night drinkings for 2 nights straight, started smoking, and she doesnt know how to handle the grief. She just wants to forget.

I have tried convicing her to stop but when I realized I cant do it I figured I can atleast support her as best as I can, I stay up with her to remind her to drink water and so she doesnt do anything stupid. I keep her busy so she doesnt walk down any stairs. Her parents leave her home alone so I feel like Im the only one who can be there for her at night.

To complicate things further, i reacted out to her as a friend but she has also fallen in love with me and has said I love you while drunk but she says she means it. I have feelings for her too but ik she is not ready to be in a relationship. I have considered leaving her alone but if I do she will have no one and I dont see anyone caring about her drinking all night or becoming addicted to smoking.

629,"So this is going to be a long one, I think. I have a father who has some mental health issues I suspect, but has never been diagnosed. Why hasn't he been diagnosed you ask? In his mind he is not the problem, it is everyone else's. Everyone around him is incompetent and if things were done his way the world would be a better place. I think he might have bipolar or borderline personality disorder but i'm no expert. Growing up with a dad like this has not been easy: I've seen him physically harm himself, he's thrown things at me and hit me, and worst of all ruined my self esteem as a teenager by saying fucked up things. In a nutshell he has severe mood swings and irrational anger (something as simple as too much clutter around the house can lead to a rage), seems to think everyone else is the problem and not him, and seems to have trouble maintaining relationships; his brothers don't like him, he has no friends, and from what I can tell very few people at work at like him. I recently moved back in with my family (mom, dad, and brother) and have realized that my dad has gotten much worse. My brother suffers from bipolar disorder and for some reason my dad thinks that my brother can just ""snap out of it"" and that ""if he really wanted to change he would do something about it."" This has led to many fights with my mom and many bouts of rage from my dad. I guess if there's any positive to this situation it's that no matter how mad and rageful my dad gets he he has never gotten physical with my mom. I know this post just seems like a clusterfuck of information but hopefully you were able to get a feel for how my dad is.

I really have no clue what to do. My mom in the past couple months has mentioned leaving my father, something I never thought she'd do. The only reason she hasn't left him is because she fears he would kill himself and she could never live with herself if that happened. The whole family has told my dad that he needs to get help and nothing has happened. He's seen a therapist a couple times but that's the extent of his treatment. I've tried having a heart to heart with him to express my concern and my true feelings only to be brushed off.

I guess the reason I'm posting this is because I don't know what the fuck to do. For some reason I still love my dad despite everything. I feel terribly for my mom- I just want her to feel happy. I don't think that's possible unless my dad changes. I feel for my brother. My dad isn't a good role model and isn't very supportive.

Any advice on how to deal with this situation would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone is doing well and enjoying themselves.",18Jun2019,1

631,"Hello,

My parents are great people, but after my graduation, they began to try to hold onto me more and more, treating me like a child and even talking down to me like I am younger than I am; more than they ever have. They are very controlling and attempt to control ridiculous things such as when I go to bed, when I can use my phone, etc. Recently, they also restricted me from doing anything fun until I pass a difficult online math exam which is not for some time now. I have studied a lot and even hired an online tutor to help me with difficult problems. However, this is not enough for them, and they are convinced that I won’t study unless they force me to. Now I feel stuck.

Thankfully, I will be able to move out this fall to college and really find out who I am. However, my parents say that I still need to follow all their rules, and I know that means continuing to succumb to their every whim, even after I move out.

I don't know what to do.  I need money.  I have a job and I'm working on getting another but I can't do it fast enough.  Even if I do, there's no way that I can pay their bills for them and pay for college.  People are going to say that it isn't my responsibility but I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't help them, especially my little brother, who's only thirteen years old.  Also, for context, my dad is not his dad, which is why he didn't move out with me.

The sister doesn't have a prescription for it and AFAIK, I told her that methadone is a controlled substance in nearly every country and so carrying it across an international border without any good reason is like smuggling heroin. She'll certainly faces prison time and/or hefty fines.

He and I went to school together for a little while, and he dated one of my ex friends for a while, but they ended up breaking up because she was at the time super mentally unstable (which is also the reason her and I stopped being friends).

This made me feel really... weird I guess, and kind of uncomfortable because he talks about how much better off he is without her, how glad he is that he’s with me instead of her, etc, and it just made me feel weird about it idk.

651,"So I'll give you as much of the TLDR as I can here.  Sunday evening my daughter was home alone as she had just gotten home from work and my wife and I were not home yet.  WE get a text from her that she is on the phone with 911 because our land lord was looking in the windows, yelled at our dogs to shut up (who were barking because someone is looking in the windows) then walked to his car, got a handgun, was waving it around.  At one point my daughter said it looked like he pointed it inside the house, then aimed at the ground and shot a round.

She called the police and we were told by another officer he was intoxicated and was found with a loaded gun on his front seat.  We were told he would be charged with multiple felonies and would be in jail that night at least. 

Fast forward about 3 hours and I was checking our county's jail roster site and I never saw him booked.  We called the local police department and they told us he was released and was now suddenly not intoxicated.  When my wife and daughter went to the police to ask why more wasnt done, why we weren't informed etc. they were essentially brushed off.  We think part of it is that our land lord is older and has some standing in the community basically because of his father.  Now he is free to come and go on his property (which of course he owns it) and knows we called the cops on him.  When I look for arrest records I see nothing.  

I have reached out to a lawyer already and waiting to hear back.  I am filling out a request for access to data from the PD but I think that will provide nothing.  Just seeing if the big brains at reddit can assist.  My daughter is terrified and refuses to stay at the house now.  When she came home last night to grab a couple of things she was shaking.

For years  doctors have been unable to give her a definitive diagnosis, but shortly after we met she was diagnosed with Raynaud’s and Lupus. Her kidney is failing and she has chronic migraines. She also has a type of arthritis called Ankylosing Spondylitis, which can lead to a total fusion of her spine. On top of all this, she also suffers from severe depression and PTSD from a long history of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. Needless to say, she is almost always in excruciating pain and has been been using pain killers to help with it. When you’re in that much physical and mental pain, it’s easy to become dependent on pain killers. She came to me about a month ago and asked me to start taking her to NA (Narcotics Anonymous) meetings without her parents knowing (addiction is a stigma everywhere, but it’s especially bad where we live). Of course I said yes, and I’ve been going with her to the open ones every day. We told her parents and she’ll be doing outpatient treatment soon. The problem is, she’s always in pain and she probably will be forever. Withdrawals are horrible, but her pain definitely doesn’t help. She’s been sick for a long time, and since America’s health system sucks ass, her family has always struggled to pay for her medical needs. Understandably, this has been hard for her because she thinks of herself as a  burden to her family and friends. I hate feeling like there’s nothing I can do, and I’ve never been good with words. I spend as much time as possible her but I wish I could do more.

So, my question is, what should I even say? Should I just give random facts about myself? Would that seem too self centric? Should I ask more questions about them? Would that be too forward? What should my opening line even be? Ugh.

660,"TLDR: When you’ve tried everything from defending yourself to speaking to the bullies’ parents, school authorities, law enforcement and nothing gets resolved, how do you put an end to extreme bullying? 



Some background:

My brother was severely bullied from ages 12-18+ years old and I can’t think of anything he or my parents didn’t do to try to stop it, except physically move from where we lived. 

It all started when my brother stopped hanging out with a group of disrespectful, little shit kids when we were young. They were just not nice boys — they vandalized cars and houses, made fun of other kids, etc — and my brother did not want to associate with them. 

They were (unfortunately) the popular kids at school. There was two or three main perpetrators who started the bullying and orchestrated it all. They got dozens of kids involved throughout the years since my brother eventually got restraining orders on the main kids. They would constantly persuade others to continue their harmful and humiliating acts when they couldn’t do it themselves. 

It was a never ending cycle of beating him up, vandalism, defamation, death threats, cyber bullying etc. for what seemed like our entire childhood. One time they chased him through a park with a knife, another time shot him up close with an air soft gun, and that doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface. Even the parents of one of these kids would harass him, flipping him off and calling him names as they drove by our house. 

My brother learned how to defend himself, and when he did, the school punished him and they eventually stopped taking his situation seriously altogether (if they ever really did in the first place). He had countless evidence of death threats and physical/verbal abuse and they did nothing. So much for a zero tolerance policy on bullying. 

There were kids from multiple schools involved as well, so moving schools would not have necessarily helped. The bullying would continue from school, to our home, to other public places in our community. My brother faced major depression, anxiety and suicidal tendencies because of this; I’m so grateful still to this day that he never took his life. I’m not sure I would have been that strong myself. 

This was before facebook blew up, so I’m curious if things would have gotten as bad as they did if we had today’s social media platforms to bring awareness to more students, parents, the community, etc. about what was happening to him. 

Anyway, I just still cannot wrap my head around what happened to my brother and what he or my parents could have done differently to stop it without resulting in violence themselves.

661,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I made this account just to talk about this. I am 14 (yes I know that’s young to be on reddit) and my mom is 40. I know this might seem like a whiny teenager being annoyed with their mother but I promise that’s not the case. I do love my mom and I know she loves me but she hasn’t been doing the best job of being a mom to me. Anytime I’m sad and I go to talk to her she always dismisses me and tells me to stop crying. Whenever she’s sad I always spend my time trying to cheer her up no matter how long it takes and she always expects me to do this for her but whenever I feel sad she doesn’t even try to comfort me. Recently my dad died and we are both sad yet she treats her pain as worse than mine. She never outwardly says it but she will say things like, “It feels different to lose a husband than to lose a dad because I chose him as my husband”. I understand that it’s hard on her and I will say that I get her sadness because I lost him too but she constantly acts like I’m suffering less. I always comfort her in these situations too while she doesn’t for me. She also has me doing all of the domestic work and puts me in situations that she knows makes me uncomfortable such as cleaning out areas with spiders even though i have severe arachnophobia and it gives me intense panic attacks (she knows this). To provide context about the domestic matters: I will make dinners for us but whenever she provides food it’s always fast food and I clean the whole house. My mom had a rough childhood and she had a bad mom so anytime I try and lightly mention how I feel like our family dynamic isn’t the best she gets mad at me and orders me to leave her alone even when I cry. Sometimes I’ll jokingly bring up how it’s like I’m her mom but she always thinks it’s funny and she agrees. My family has a really messed up history such as my dad having been a drug abuser for the past eight years and there has been so much that has happened but these are my recent feelings. I just don’t know what to do because I love my mom and there are times when she does nice things and I feel bad for thinking this way but it’s painful to have her be nice and then cold so often. I almost forgot to mention that she often implies that I should stay living with her forever and she gets offended when I mention one day having my own place.

664,"I should preface this by saying I don't know if anything actually criminal has happened here - and I genuinely don't know which subreddit this fits - so I'm posting it here.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 20, male, and in Ohio.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have always been abusive. The physical/violent abuse ended around four years ago, but the mental and emotional have continued. About a year ago, they separated and myself and my dad moved out of the old house (We're currently in an apartment), and it's continued. We're talking gaslighting, manipulation, abusive language, always acting like things are normal etc. As you might imagine, it's pretty hard not to be close to someone when you're in a two bedroom apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

Some examples:

\- Screamed that he's going to punch me/hurt me

\- Offered me things, then when it was time for them reveal all the extreme conditions to them

\- Refuse to see anyone for counsel, or otherwise get help for him/us (he ""agrees"" and then it never happens)

\- Invaded my room, reorganized everything, and read all my very personal notes and documents to myself. When I got back and saw all this, he responded by saying verbatim ""That's a you problem."" I even called the police when this happened (what else was I supposed to do?) and was told nothing criminal happened. Apparently he wove a story about how he did it out of concern as a 'worried father', and he quote ""didn't know when I would be back"".

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I would leave if I had a choice, but I'm completely financially dependent. I have no access to money, no transportation, no communication even. Everything goes through him. I'm posting this from a PC that's actually his.

There are no nearby relatives, and I don't know anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

This is bad for me, really bad. My mental health is deteriorating on the daily and I have a hard time now distinguishing reality. It's lead to two suicide gestures as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Some ways I've tried to get help from people:

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in contact with different police agencies multiple times, and was always told nothing 'criminal' happened. The only thing they did was offer a glorified taxi to a mental health ward at a hospital, or try to ""mediate"" and immediately believe his manipulative stories.

&amp;#x200B;

Said mental health wards always kicked me out after less than a day, telling me they didn't have any resources to help me. No one there seemed to listen to a word I said, and seemed to be biased against me the moment I explained the first thing about the situation. A couple times they even called him against my wishes. The one place even called my mother (huh?) despite her having nothing at all to do with anything now, and after me actually telling the nurse practitioner directly everything they did and how much it's taken to get this far.

Honestly, I'm sure there was some reason they did that as part of their jobs, but I think it's understandable why it looks like they actively worked against me when it went from ""Fine, call him and ask about insurance"" to ""We've called both your parents despite you explaining why we shouldn't, told them everything and asked for lots of information"". One guy in one of the two wards I've gone to actually threatened me when I responded to that.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I tried shelters. Since I was told at the second ward that abuse shelters ""needed documented police reports of physical violence"", I obviously couldn't do that, so I ended up using some of the very little cash I had to take a bus around to different homeless shelters.

I'm sure you can guess they were all overfilled. That turned out to be an incredibly uncomfortable experience with mentally ill homeless/'disadvantaged' and staff that either didn't believe a word I said or were fanatics that tried to convert me. Of course I'm atheist, so I already am blocked from half the possible ""shelters"" I could go.

One worker at a shelter I went to berated me and told me I was stupid and knew nothing because I was just a ""kid"", and actually told me, and I quote, ""unless he's f\*\*king you in the a\*\*, you should go back"". Yes, he actually said that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That brings us to what happened today. For a moment, it seemed like my dad would help me get a license and car. How could I be so stupid, right? Today, when I was supposed to take a lesson, I waited outside the apartment for around forty minutes. Turns out the lesson was ""rescheduled"". I wonder how many times that will happen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So that's where I am. I've exhausted all options that I know of, and I have no idea how to get people to believe me and understand what's happening. Help?",18Jun2019,1
665,"I went to therapy after already going through few shitty therapists. This one was different. She finally got me and I really liked her even though at first we got a bit of an argument. 

Despite this I was forced to leave her because she worked at a medical company in which I had bought a subscription and it turned out that meetings with psychologist were limited. I had no money so I had to take a break from her. When she heard that she said that she is sad about it and tried to persuade me to stay. I asked her if that was about the money to which she replied that she gets paid for sitting there no matter what. But I remember her saying that she could get a lot of money through occupational medicine which implies that she gets paid per patient. on the other hand she has a rich bf and probably doesn't have to worry about money. When I was leaving we hugged and stared at each other's eyes. She also told me to email her how my exams for uni turned out.

&amp;#x200B;

I went back to her after about 3 months. I noticed that she shook my hand at the beginning and end of the session (earlier we did that maybe one or two times. refused to hug though. said that it was a boundary crossing.) She said that she really likes me and it gives her to see me. I also noticed that during the session she revealed a very intimate part of information about her (maybe not fully deliberate. it was more like a suggestion) 

&amp;#x200B;

Is she trying to trick me into going more to her? I'm planning to anyway. It's cool that she likes me but is she honest?

670,"I am 21 yo female and live with my parents. I grew up in the same house my whole life then moved to this house about year and a half ago  I don't see myself living here long term, but do enjoy having friends over regularly. So, my issues with my neighbor need to stop. His main problem lately is cars parked on the curb in front of my house. 2-3 cars fit here, but 2 are in front of his house by the path leading to the front door. A couple nights ago, a female friend parked her Jeep in front of our mailboxes, which he also hates for some reason. He assumes my friend is a man for some reason, left a note starting ""Sir:"", then cites the ""housing association"", and threatened to call the police.

I know it's him. No one else in my neighborhood does weird stuff. They keep to themselves like me. But this old man stares at me sometimes. He walked by extremely slow looking at her through the crack in the door as I said bye to a friend dropping me off. It's just strange. It makes me uncomfortable and frustrated, especially because it makes my friends uncomfortable too. I want them to feel welcome. I love my home and ignore him the best I can. When I have friends over, he makes it difficult to ignore.

My parents don't have friends over, but we have a big family and they've left notes on my siblings cars when they come to visit too. Sometimes when they visit they take my driveway spot and I park on the street. On trash days, this means in front of the mailboxes. He always leaves his trash cans very far apart and close to my car so that I have to move them to pull away. Just a few things he does...

I want to knock on the door and talk to him or leave a note. Its absurd to have to deal with. Frankly, it seems childish. I was thinking to give my number and say call me if there's an issue rather than making my friends feel unwelcome. What should I do? Ignoring it hasn't been working out.",18Jun2019,2

672,"I know this is long, but can somebody please read this? I desperately need advice about this.

Context. My boyfriend (20M) and I (17F) have been together for a little over two years. We have a great relationship and always talk about the future together. One of the reasons why we get along so well is the fact that we both value the ""upper class life"", and have dreams to be very successful and wealthy. He always talks about starting his own business, investing in stocks, getting into real estate, etc. But here's where the problem comes in - After being with him for a while, I've become worried that that's all it is, TALK. The behavior he displays doesn't make me believe that he will be as successful as he claims. To me, it almost feels like he's waiting for that breakthrough moment where he will wake up one day and just start getting rich. It's so easy for him to talk, but so hard for him to do the work. He does have a part time job -early in the morning for 3-5 hours, which he realizes doesn't pay well. He constantly talks about getting a second job and how bad he wants it, yet it took him five months to even LOOK for something he'd be interested in. He finally applied for (2) jobs and unfortunately got turned down by them. So currently he's back to not looking for anything else &amp; laying in his bed playing video games all day &amp; blowing his paychecks. And I'm not exaggerating - this is literally his day. Everyday. All day. Also, every opportunity that comes up for him to make money he turns down. For example, his grandfather told him he would pay him to do yard work. He kept avoiding it and then never ended up doing it. My mom even tried to help him out once. She said she would pay him to stop by the house after work to let my dogs out while we weren't there. He didn't do it. His explanation was ""I didn't feel like it"". So yeah it might have been different two years ago because he was still young and finding his way. But he's now a young adult and hasn't even made any progress since I first met him.

Now, take this as you will, but my point in all of this is that I will not be with a man who doesn't have his shit together. I won't be the woman who takes care of a man who sits on a couch watching tv all day. I don't want to listen to ""I'll just to do it tomorrow"" every single day. 

I'm worried about our future. I really can see us being together for a very long time. But not with this behavior. I just really love this boy, and I don't want to give up on him. Even though it's a small amount I still have faith in him. I really want to help him grow and motivate him to do more with his life. He has so much potential. He just needs a push to actually do the work. Has anybody ever experienced a situation like this? What are some things I can do to motivate him and get over his lazy tendencies?

Lastly I want to point out that I run my own dog sitting business. I also clean houses and do filing for my aunt's business when there's an opportunity for it. My mom pays me every week to do chores and I've been attempting to grow my Youtube channel. I haven't pursued an official job yet because I have a disability that results in job possibilities being much smaller. I'm also 18 so there's a lot I'm restricted to do. So anyways, I don't just expect him to be the breadwinner while I'm sitting on my ass doing nothing. I also very much believe I'm a good 'role model' for him when it comes to work. It's just not enough though. I know he's young and has so much time, but it just doesn't seem like he's going in the right direction.

Any advice?

TL;DR || my boyfriend wants to be successful and wealthy but doesn't put in the work. he's super lazy and stays in bed all day. i'm worried for our future because i want my partner to work just as hard as i do and i don't want to put myself in a position where i have to take care of a man financially. need advice on how to push him to be more productive.",18Jun2019,1

I realized I loved him when he got really personal and vulnerable with me. While he shared his story with me, I felt so bad. I put myself in his position, and imagined all of it. I am convinced that I only felt a fraction. I couldn't sleep all night after that. I wept all night and prayed.

It's been nearly a year since that conversation. I haven't stopped thinking about the conversation since then. When I see him, it's all I think about. I just want to protect him from bad things like that. Even if I can't, I want to be a safe place for him to freely express his emotions and worries. 

We don't talk as much anymore, but we are still friends. We don't really hang out in person anymore, but it was always nice when we did!

683,"So long story short, I have been going through a consistent amount of events that keep kicking the utter shit out of me in life and I keep getting pushed around with those events by people I'm in contact with.

It started out with this year, I was at work and had a crash reversing into a car when I brought my own personal car back on site. Before this I had another accident with one of the cars some time last year when I first started because of poor guidance from someone. I was blamed for that ""crash"" even though our rule states that whoever is guiding you is almost entirely responsible if they say they are guiding you and you trust them to do so.

Anyways, I had a short string of events afterwards, including, throwing up in a limo on a Saturday night which cost me a dear soiling fee despite trying to use a bag, completely knocking a drink into my computer which was a costly fix because of high specs, then my car engine dying on a trip. I didn't even reach the next Saturday without all this happening. I managed to fix things apart from the car which I got a loan out for to get a new one. I got the new car, loved it and it was one I'd wanted for a while. I owned that car for just over 2 weeks and effectively wrote it off. I am of course devastated but I know I'm stronger and I've pushed through everything this shit year has thrown at me. I really got no sympathy from anyone except a couple people including my girlfriend and my mother who were glad I was okay and one or two other friends.

I have 2 separate friend groups and any time my 2nd group of friends have a chance, they'll pop a joke about how I crash stuff all the time despite it being only twice properly. I know they're doing it to joke around but it has extended onto them legitimately being insecure around me being near their cars to the jokey/pushy extent that I know is a real fear for them. It's always ""this is why he isn't allowed to work on cars"" even at the slightest inconvenience like me dropping a wrench near a car when we're working. 

It's to the point where I'm legitimately so distressed and constantly question ""wow am I really that stupid?"" or I am constantly feeling pushed away from my hobby of modifying cars which I LOVE doing, feeling like I should just drop everything after being in a group of people ganging up and being told ""Would've been cheaper if you just never learned to drive in the first place"". 

I feel like a stupid sack of shit that is incapable to do anything even if I love it to death and it's so disheartening knowing I can never do anything without doing something dumb. I really feel lost and every single day I'm being pushed away from my optimism I know I have even in the face of most things that people would break down at - I'm finding it hard to feel like it's worth me trying anything, I'm finding it hard to just laugh things off how I always have done, I'm finding it hard to keep going on in life like this.",18Jun2019,1

I personally don't like practicing soccer, and I'm essentially forced to play , but I'll play actual matches if my friends are playing and I'm around at the time. My argument is that it will help me with college and if I don't end up going to college then the money will help me with music production or game design since I am into both of those actvities right now. He just tells me that I will always have student debt no matter what. Which I don't believe for a second (Thanks Dave Ramsey). It's not like soccer takes up the whole day either, when practice starts it will be later in the day. His argument for having me play soccer is that I only get one run through highschool. I don't care much about my highschool experience because I know I'll be happy as long as I work hard end up doing what I love, but in order  to do that it might be good to get a job to earn some money to back that.

687,"Today it was my batteries, I know odd thing to steal but he took them out of my room. He didn't ask and used them, so now my mom is buying more which I do not want her to do. I am 19, and my youngest brother is 12. (Yb for him and B for younger brother)

I do not know what to do anymore, he denies it to the point of accepting any sort of punishment. We know it is him, it's the same thing every time. He gets mad at us, sometimes for just existing and hides our stuff. He even throws toothbrushes and paste away. He hid Yb video game from him for weeks because he didn't take it out of the xbox, my headphones have been missing since the beginning of June. 

My parents are so tired of it they've given up, literally letting him walk all over them. Since he's turned 17 he's done this, hes so rude to Yb and won't stop. We use to he close and now he's just as mean to me, I want him to cut this bullshit. He constantly does this and other things, he never cleans up unless he wants to do it, he uses our towels because he throws his on the floor. Yb has to hid his in his room and now so do I. Its disgusting and so rude. 

What can I do about this? I have thought of taking his shit but two wrongs don't make a right, but how is he going to learn? I'm to the point of tears because of this, he's turned into such a shitty person. The only thing that worked is when my dad threatened to take away the one thing that he loves, but I can't do that. My dad is done trying to do anything, so what can I do? Do I really have to hide everything I own? Keep own toothbrush and toiletries in my room like Yb?

So i'm a grad student, and a first gen college student at that, honestly i'm a very normal person and I did something fucked up that I want to confess, but i'm terrified it can get me kicked out of school if not worse.

So, I suffer from severe bouts of insomnia, and sometimes after a few days without sleep weird invasive thoughts enter my mind. I usually don't act on them, but this time I did. I was spending the night at a friends place and for some ungodly reason I decided to snoop into her shit. I found embarrassing stuff like condoms and what have you, but I especially got caught up looking through her underwear. For a moment I even pocketed a pair (which I did return, I didn't do anything with them for what its worth). I had never even remotely considered doing anything like this before. I feel so unbelievably shitty that I did this and I want to tell her, but i'm scared of this getting me kicked out of school or most definitely losing her as a friend.

She didn’t text me for 3 days, and on that day she sent me a text saying that I should be used to her being gone. I asked her why. She said that she will never forget me and that I was the closest friend she ever had. I called her and she was crying and told me that she took pills. She hung up.

We were so close to each other and best friends, since we’re both very shy and never really had any in real life friends. I face timed her every day. I don’t know what to do.

690,"So I’m supposed to start school for a master’s degree in social work in August. I was planning on working part time and going to school full time but I just got out of a two week stay in the hospital for trying to slit my wrists. I had a week in between the hospital and going back to work and I thought that would be enough but I come to work and feel like sobbing or am filled with so much anxiety that it’s almost impossible to tolerate. My job isn’t even hard, I just dislike it and I am working 30 hours a week which I think is too much for me. The source of my feeling suicidal is the same, I have severe depression and have since I was eight years old and current marital problems have made it worse. My husband wants to leave me if I can’t get my shit together and wake up in the morning and be somewhat productive. I have been getting up in the morning but doing that and then not going to work until 4pm is taking its toll on me. I’m exhausted and can’t function without taking a two hour nap in the afternoon. I am staying with my parents right now while I do transcranial magnetic stimulation in the mornings in the hope it will make me better. I want to quit my job and maybe try to get a job teaching English to Chinese kids online but I failed an interview when I tried that once and am now paranoid I don’t have the right personality for it. My mom wants to help support me financially when I go to school but I don’t think she was planning on helping me to such a large extent, or if she is it will be going towards my school bill. She wants me to work. I need the money and my husband doesn’t want to financially support me, at least not while I’m not helping him around the house and being depressed. I feel like I’m stuck and I’ll soon have another episode and try to kill myself. I don’t know how to explain to my mother and father and husband that I need their help financially, if just for a little while so I can get my shit together. I feel like a failure. All I do is stress out the people around me and leech on them. What should I do?

Today though I was laying on her shoulder half hugging her when she abruptly pulled her phone away and told me to hold on one second she had to text him real quick. I kinda laughed and asked her what I couldn’t see, trying to look, not really thinking anything of it when I realized she was being dead serious and wouldn’t let me. She did the same thing last night with the same person (my friend going back about 5 years). This time I asked her about it, asking why I couldn’t see. She said it was personal. I asked what was so personal that I couldn’t see but my friend could. (her only guy friend and I trust him). She just kept saying, “it’s just a conversation” but I kept telling her it’s obviously not because it’s something I specifically can’t see, and she always lets me read her conversations.

695," 

So long story short, I have been going through a consistent amount of events that keep kicking the utter shit out of me in life and I keep getting pushed around with those events by people I'm in contact with.

It started out with this year, I was at work and had a crash reversing into a car when I brought my own personal car back on site whilst my colleague was coming round the corner. Before this I had another accident with one of the cars some time last year when I first started because of poor guidance from someone. I was blamed for that ""crash"" even though our rule states that whoever is guiding you is almost entirely responsible if they say they are guiding you and you trust them to do so.

Anyways, I had a short string of events afterwards, including, throwing up in a limo on a Saturday night which cost me a dear soiling fee despite trying to use a bag, completely knocking a drink into my computer which was a costly fix because of high specs, then my car engine dying on a trip. I didn't even reach the next Saturday without all this happening. I managed to fix things apart from the car which I got a loan out to get a new one. I got the new car, loved it and it was one I'd wanted for a while. I owned that car for just over 2 weeks and effectively wrote it off. I am of course devastated but I know I'm stronger and I've pushed through everything this shit year has thrown at me. I really got no sympathy from anyone except a couple people including my girlfriend and my mother who were glad I was okay and one or two other friends.

I have 2 separate friend groups and any time my 2nd group of friends have a chance, they'll pop a joke about how I crash stuff all the time despite it being only twice properly. I know they're doing it to joke around but it has extended onto them legitimately being insecure around me being near their cars to the jokey/pushy extent that I know is a real fear for them. It's always ""this is why he isn't allowed to work on cars"" even at the slightest inconvenience like me dropping a wrench near a car when we're working.

It's to the point where I'm legitimately so distressed and constantly question ""wow I am really that stupid and clumsy."" or I am constantly feeling pushed away from my hobby of modifying cars which I LOVE doing, feeling like I should just drop everything after being in a group of people ganging up and being told ""Would've been cheaper if you just never learned to drive in the first place"".

I feel like a stupid sack of shit that is incapable to do anything even if I love it to death and it's so disheartening knowing I can never do anything without doing something dumb. I really feel lost and every single day I'm being pushed away from my optimism I know I have even in the face of most things that people would break down at - I'm finding it hard to feel like it's worth me trying anything, I'm finding it hard to just laugh things off how I always have done, I'm finding it hard to keep going on in life like this.",18Jun2019,1

I wish I can go back and fix everything because I’m not that person anymore, but I obviously can’t. I don’t know what to do.

700,"So I'm an adult and I can reasonably say that I can handle my shit except for this really weird and awkward friendship I am in right now with someone, for now we will call him Bob. I like to make friends with people, and one day I make friends with Bob without realizing that Bob has some major attachment issues. I have watched over the time I've known him people come and go because they see how attached he can get, they naturally recoil from that, and then Bob gets ghosted which feeds into his not so positive image of himself. This is clearly a cycle that feeds into itself, whats worse is that I have observed him clinging onto friendships with people who clearly dont value him. I know 100% that a normal person would break off, cut their losses and move on, not him though he stays and clings on for dear life. 

I simply cant handle being Bobs emotional support anymore, he requires support that is beyond the means of what people are able to normally provide. I know with 100% certainty that if I sit down with him and talk to Bob like an adult and tell him straight up ""I cant handle this, I want to leave"" he will not take it well and will ruminate over it for weeks because he cant help it. I also know that if I ghost him Bob will try to use our mutual friends to see if I did ghost him, which would also result in him ruminating over it for weeks.",18Jun2019,1
701,"Hey guys, I don't post much but I hope you can help me.

My best friend and I didn't like each other when I joined the class about 4 years ago (I went back to what is basically highschool in Austria after working for one year). Maybe because I started to get along very well with his best friend at the time. Since about 6 months we're really good with each other but he is often pretty rude calling me dumb or an idiot. It's not bc I am, I'm actually pretty smart. I thought at first he's joking or so, but when I say stuff like that he gets very angry. I talked to him about it and he said he isn't serious about that stuff and that he's joking. Also, it'd not that bad when we're alone.

But when we're with other people (especially with his ex best friend which I mentioned earlier or girls) this bad habit of him increases.

He once told me (we were both drunk) that he was very jealous of me when I joined the class and didn't like me bc I was smart and got good grades and stuff. I felt like he really meant it. 

I don't know what to do and how to describe my situation. I'm not a pussy or so and I can take stuff but I'm often feeling really bad about this and everytime I confront him he tries to change the subject as quick as possible. 
How can I explain this to him? He also often makes fun about things I care about.

705,"Hi guys, long time lurker + first time poster here. I apologize in advance for any weird formatting as I am on mobile! Please be kind!!

I am low-key embarrassed as hell to even be asking this but my stomach has not stopped hurting and I can’t even sleep from stressing out so badly about this for the last few weeks. I don’t know what else to do. 

A month or so ago, my (white) boyfriend’s lovey parents invited us on an all-expenses-paid trip to Maui for the end of this month. I was in shock and so grateful that they’d even consider inviting me. The whole family is going, making about 12 of us, which includes siblings and significant others. As happy and as excited as I was, it was short-lived because my mind began to race about how I’d approach my traditional Mexican-immigrant parents about this.

Some background info about my parents and our relationship: They both are really hard-working and pretty conservative as far as values go; that means that I was raised with the expectation that I wouldn’t have sex until marriage, that I’d follow a traditional college route, I’d be “normie”, etc etc. I am pretty much the opposite of their expectations since I grew up around my American peers, and I have had problems with constantly being torn between the expectations my parents have for me and assimilating to fit in with my friends. I’ve always been the black sheep in my family, I don’t at all look like what my mom would want me to, I took two years off from getting my 4-year degree to work and figure out what I even wanted to do in school, and my boyfriend is a tattooer. I’m not really living up to too many expectations. That being said, I don’t really think I’m a bad person either. I went back to school and am doing pretty okay, if I’m not in class I’m either at the gym or at work, and in my free time my boyfriend and I usually just hang out at his house and chill. I don’t over drink or do drugs anymore (it makes my anxiety even worse), and I help out around the house and fulfill my responsibilities. I’m still living at home since my university is only a 15-minute commute and my parents aren’t willing to let me move out until I’m done with college. That being said, everything I have is under their name because they have insisted on buying me everything despite my efforts to establish my own things. Honestly, I depend on them and they are constantly holding that over my head and pretty much use it to scare me out of doing things that I’d like to do aka anything they don’t approve of or they just plain don’t feel like letting me do. It’s exhausting and at 22, almost 23, I’m getting to the point where I feel like a rat in a cage. 

Anyway, I have spent the last month just thinking about how to approach them about the trip. I wrote out how I was going to ask so many times and I talked my therapist’s ear off about it to the point that I began to go through it in my dreams. It was honestly so terrifying but today I decided to bite the bullet and just fucking ask. It went just as I figured it would. 

My dad works from 6AM-7PM pretty much every day, so I approached my mom about it first. She pretty much told me no. She went on to tell me about how bad it’d look if I went with “that” family, and how she felt like my boyfriend “isn’t the right person” for me. It really hurt and having to open up about my anxiety, which is pretty much a taboo topic in my house was difficult. She was pretty much like “/I/ don’t really want you to go, but hey, ask your dad and see how that goes.” I feel pretty beaten down and stupid, but now I’m even *more* afraid because I have to talk to my dad. I haven’t stopped sweating and my stomach feels like it has holes in it. 

I know that my dad, who is my hero (despite how he enables my mom and is often pretty absent but that’s an entirely different topic) as well as my home’s bread-winner, is going to probably tell me that I can go, but if I do I can forget about my car (even though I pay my insurance), my phone (even though I pay my portion of the bill every month), and even having a dad. He does this literally any other time I want to do something/go somewhere that he doesn’t approve of. Not to sound cliche or something, but that literally always triggers a panic attack, which is something that my parents see as infantile and sick instead of something I have trouble controlling. 

I feel like this entire thing seems so stupid, but I am literally just so tired of having to miss out on opportunities to have fun and see the world and have unique experiences because of my parents and the fact that they dangle financial support over my head. I can’t express myself or be my true self around them and honestly it feels like I’m going to fucking explode. I know I’m only 22, but a lot of the time it feels like I might as well still be 14 and I am just about at my breaking point. My heart feels broken but if my parents really won’t budge, I’m considering just going on the trip regardless...

All of that being said, I need advice on what to do, or how I can convince my parents, as well as any resources that would be beneficial to me in case they don’t let me come back home. I have a small amount of savings and I know I have a place to stay with my boyfriend or some of my other friends’ houses, but I guess I wouldn’t really know how to get up on my feet after that. General advice is always appreciated. 

Sorry if things aren’t very concise or if I was too vague about some stuff... I’m kinda overwhelmed and in a weird state right now. I’d be more than happy to answer any questions or go a little more in depth about anything!!

Thank you all for reading and I appreciate your advice in advance :’)

TL;DR: I got asked to go on a free trip to Hawaii with my boyfriend and his entire family, my parents don’t want me to go and hold financial stability over my head. Considering going on the trip anyway, but need help as far as what to do if my parents don’t let me come back home and they take away my car and phone. I’ll technically be homeless but will have a place to stay, I want to know how I’d get my life together if that happens. 

Thanks again y’all!!",18Jun2019,2
707,"I live in a condo complex in a large city. I’m in a lower unit. My upstairs neighbor and I have had a good relationship since he moved in about 2 years ago. He recently got a dog and the dog barks and whimpers for hours on end when my neighbor’s not home. I’ve spoken to him in person and over text about it. I’ve been really polite and understanding up to this point. He’s told me he has never had a dog before and is learning the ropes. He said the dog has severe separation anxiety and so barks incessantly when my neighbor leaves him alone. I work from home at least once a week and am hanging out at home most nights after work. 

It’s been several months and the barking has not let up. One day last week, I set a timer when the barking started. It was almost constant for over four hours until I left the house because I couldn’t take it. My neighbor has said he’s “continuing to work on training” and will be ordering a pet camera to monitor things. 

I’ve also spoken to other people in surrounding condo units and they’ve had similar complaints. 

I’ve tried being really polite and accommodating  and patient. I haven’t taken any kind of action other than occasionally letting my neighbor know when the barking is particularly out of control. However, the issue doesn’t seem to be resolving. 

What are my options to resolve this issue? I fear my relationship with my neighbor has become strained over this and it’s not a good feeling. But, the loud, constant barking at all hours in becoming unbearable.",18Jun2019,1

709,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now. Last fall one day we were in a student lounge area together and a girl ran up and hugged my boyfriend.

Don't worry she's like that with everyone we don't talk outside of school or anything"" It seemed unusual that he didn't introduce me but I thought it was probably just because they weren't close. 

About a week later I see him tagged in a picture with her. I asked him about it and he said ""oh yeah, neither of us were doing anything so we spent the day together at the park"" so I asked, ""I thought you said you two never talked outside of class?"" And he said, ""oh we didn't but she asked for my number and then she asked me to hang out with her so I did"" he told me I was being crazy for worrying about it so I tried to let it go...

Since then they became best friends. They're constantly texting and hanging out. I have not once been invited along to hang out with them. I still don't know her at all which is weird because they're such good friends. I try not to be paranoid about it because I don't want to be a crazy girlfriend but honestly it just doesn't add up... 

In May I graduated and moved to a new city for a job so we're currently long distance. Today we were talking on the phone like usual and he casually said ""So (Girl) asked me to hang out tonight and apparently she booked a hotel for us to hang out in and then go explore the city tomorrow so that'll be fun"" I was in total shock and responded, ""you mean you're sleeping over with her? No that's not okay"" he told me I'm being crazy and that friends, boy or girl, have sleep overs all the time. I told him no girl would be comfortable with her boyfriend sleeping in a hotel room with another girl.. especially when they're so close. I asked him to see it from my point of view and how he'd feel if I did the same with a guy and he said, ""in that case I'd agree with you, but this is a special situation. I'd have to drive 20 minutes to get to the city in the morning it just makes sense for me to stay at the hotel. And we're just friends. She got this nice hotel room for us to hang out I'm not gonna ditch her"" 20 minutes is not that long of a drive.. it just doesn't add up, this whole situation is making me feel crazy. On the other hand, I don't get why he would tell me what he was doing if it was cheating. I just don't know what to believe. Either way, it's totally weird to me for my boyfriend to stay with another girl for a night.

Am I wrong? Is this normal? What should I do now?",18Jun2019,1

714,"Long story and maybe not the right place for it, but I really need some help here. 

My friend C, 22, went to Ecuador back in January to live with some relatives rent-free and work and save money. We told him that going to South America to make and save money is a terrible plan, but his mom convinced him otherwise. The last time any of my friends or I had heard from C until yesterday was before his connecting flight at the Fort Lauderdale airport, though his girlfriend received a text saying he touched down in Ecuador. 

After two weeks of not hearing from him, we contacted his dad, who said his mom (they're divorced) had checked him into a rehab facility against his will in Fort Lauderdale, where you can be held for 90 days. C is a big drinker and his mom often takes drastic measures to prevent his poor habits, but we were able to gather that his mom lied to his dad about his whereabouts. When someone asked his mom, she said he'd be out by July at the earliest.

Fast forward a few months. Yesterday a mutual friend of ours shares a letter with me from C, who says that his mother hired men to take him from the airport under false pretenses. He says he was kidnapped, had all of his belongings taken, and was checked into a rehab facility named Renacer near Cuenca and Paute against his will. The letter is dated March 3rd, which has ""Day 48"" next to it. In the letter C says that he's been told he will only be there for 70-90 days, and that he's just going to look at the bright side and make the most of it since he's already halfway done his self-described sentence, and not to worry about him or call the police on his mother. 

It's been 107 days since he wrote that letter, and in the letter he mentions his fear that it will be intercepted and additional days will be added to his sentence as punishment. The letter was given to an inmate as he was being released from the facility, who was able to mail it to our mutual friend.

In the last day I've called the FBI and the State Department about this, who have both done nothing. The FBI said it was a matter for the State Dept, and the State Dept has made me leave voicemails. Beyond simply calling the cops on his mom for kidnapping, something C wouldn't want, I don't know what to do. I previously called the police before the letter was received and they said it didn't sound like a crime had been committed. Now, there's a letter where C explicitly states his mother had him kidnapped and he's being held captive, and nobody I've called has taken this very seriously.

What can I do about this?",18Jun2019,1
715,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost a year now and care for him more than the world. He’s 15 and I just turned 17. He’s had a history of suicidal thoughts, self harm, anxiety, etc. and it got so bad that a month ago I asked the school for help. They told me that they would talk to the parents and him to help set up something. The only problem is the parents, especially the dad, doesn’t seem to want to help at all or is flat out denying his problems. All that they seem to care about is their own image so they know that his problems will make them look like bad parents. His dad has even used physical abuse to get his point across. One time when the family was at a restaurant, the waiter came and asked for orders. Bf said he wanted tea but the mother told him to speak up. He got frustrated and said it more firmly, which I guess startled her and the waitress. Later that night his dad took him into his room, pinned him down by the throat, and threatened him not to embarrass his mom like that again or he’d do worse. Apparently this isn’t the first time that his dad has done that and as a kid he would get beaten by him. When they went to the doctors and the doctor asked about his mental status, his parents practically breathed down his neck so he was too scared to tell the truth. They will do anything to keep this image of “Our family is perfectly healthy” even if it means hurting their own son. But it’s starting to get worse. He’s not even aloud to go out anymore and he’s too scared to ask why. A few days ago his parents told him he’s not aloud to see me anymore unless we are with friends. Even when we get the chance to hang out with friends (which is rare), his parents force him to come home after about 2 hours for no apparent reason at all. My boyfriend has tried to explain to his mom that being forced to stay inside and never being able to see us is making him feel worse but all she seems to do is blame everybody but herself. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I can do something to help but I don’t know what. All of this is also taking a toll on my own mental health but I love him and want to stay by his side. I’m desperate for advice. I’m terrified that he’s going to hurt himself soon or maybe worse.....",18Jun2019,1
716,"hi. first time asking online community for a serious matter. 

i’m 19 years old. i’m a third year university student and i really wanna drop out. the situation is stated below:

i received an email saying that i was kicked out so i stopped attending classes but then my parents called the dean’s office said there was no such thing and they are happy to take me back. i’m severely depressed just thinking about coming back. 

i’m studying international relations and i hate it so so much. my parents forced me into studying it. i’m so miserable because over the past three years i literally made one friend but he’s kinda a slow learner so he can’t help me with schoolwork. and not to mention i didn’t learn shit even the foreign languages they offer there.

the environment in that uni is so bad probably one of the worst. there’s no mental health department. it’s like metal health doesn’t exist there. and it’s considered one of the best uni in russia.
the professors are so bad they don’t even speak english properly even though it’s an english faculty. they are also biased towards foreigners. students go their to show off their new cars, clothes, iphone, how rich they are or some girls go there to find a rich husband. 
and the dean’s office don’t do shit. they literally told me “if u don’t know the uni’s rule or schedule that’s your own problem. is that my problem?” when i missed a week going back to school after a holiday and i didn’t know when they started classes.

i don’t wanna study in that environment. i wanna study an performing arts degree but my parents think i’m not talented enough. and they said i can never achieve my dreams because actor is not a real job even though it’s a multi million dollars business.
they want me to have a stable job like own my own company or hotel but i don’t wanna do any of that.
my parents literally tell me i’m useless everyday and i can’t do anything right. all i want is to do something that brings me joy n happiness why is it so hard to understand?
they think having money, power and kids is the key to happiness but what if i don’t want any of that but i just want a good career?
my parents never listen to me or consider my feelings. whenever i complain about uni stress they think i’m selfish only thinking about myself. i get that they work hard to pay for my tuition but why can’t they pay for me to learn something i enjoy so both parties can be happy?

i’m so depressed about going back to university.  i cry every night. i feel like the only way out is this situation is to go to the asylum or *s*u*i*c*i*d*e. what’s the point of studying when u wanna end yourself everyday on the process of getting a degree?

721,"So my husband and I just moved to a new city and started new jobs. He has been having a lot of trouble with his job, coworkers lying to try and get him fired, the director wanted to fire him because he got pneumonia and missed work last week, things like that. He would have been fired already if the supervisor didn’t stick up for him. 

But the big problem happened today - he had a minor accident (knocked over something with a machine) at work so they require a drug test any time something like that happens. Well the test came back positive, although he does not do any drugs. However he is currently taking breathing treatments, antibiotics, and Sudafed/mucinex for the pneumonia. And he always takes blood pressure medicine and acid reflux medicine. 

The odd thing is that they wouldn’t tell him what he tested positive for - only said that “one of the lines didn’t show up.” So they sent the sample to another lab for further testing, but in the meantime he got reamed by the director and is being made to do weekly drug tests until those results come back. 

What (if anything) can he do in this situation? I feel like something is not quite right about all of this. He’s been looking for a new job anyway, but needs this one in the meantime and it wouldn’t fare well for his next job if he got fired from this one for “drug use”...  we just want to make sure this doesn’t get any worse than it is now.",18Jun2019,1

She brings up the topic of dating one day. She told me she'll never never find a boyfriend, to which I replied by saying, ""I mean, you're talking to someone who could be a good boyfriend."" She replied by saying ""Anyways..."" and changed the subject. We don't talk as much as we did. We stopped talking as much after we went to a popular shopping center one day. My best friend (not my crush), another close friend, Erica, and I all went. While we're there, Erica asked for my phone. We aren't dating so I hand her my phone thinking nothing of it.

I never replied to the message because I honestly didn't know what to say, but I can tell Erica found it just by the upset look on her face. ""Who's this? Who's that? How did you meet this girl?"" she says about every girl on my phone she didn't recognize. I told her they were mutual friends and the girl that wanted me to move her to Beverly Hills was just a girl that likes me and I don't like her. Erica didn't believe me, but she pretended it never happened for the rest of the day.

725,"The thought of me being useless first came to me a few years back when I was still in school, when I was 15 or 16.

My problem  is that I can't find a single thing in my life that I am really good at!

I'm maybe descent at some things but not good. And every time I try to get better at something I get frustrated because I can't see myself to get better (not after days but weeks/months).  


Back in my teens I was talented in some things but never pursued any of those talents and now I'm stuck being mediocre at them seemingly unable to become better and it really really brings me down.

&amp;#x200B;

All these ""I don't excel at anything"" thoughts were minor and didn't bring me down for more than a few minutes and they occurred rarely.  


But over the last one and a half year this isn't something that is coming to my mind every now and than but on a regular basis. Probably once or twice a week at least.  
Right now all that it needs for me to think about how bad I am at basically everything is to F\*ck up even the tiniest of things like drop something, not because i was trying to catch or playing around but just because I somehow dropped it! Just writing about it makes me mad!  


Just an hour ago I wanted to restart learning Programming. I want to make a small game but the moment I have everything set up I said to myself: Why even try? I won't succeed. I will try and fail, as always.

I haven't told anybody about this because I don't want to bother them with something that seems so trivial and the best advice that they probably give me is ""just concentrate and try for longer""  


I'm even considering not posting this because I don't think my feeling about this is important enough to bother someone other than me. I can't find any motivation anymore for anything because I just know I won't succeed.

729,"To start off, this man is not my real grandfather. It's just the closest role he fits. He is truly my brother-in-law's father that I have just lived with since I was 2. To him, he says I'm like a daughter just because he was the only male figure in my life. 

Since before I could remember, he has always done pretty normal things like watch porn. It slowly started to turn into watching porn multiple times a day and making comments about my 15 y/o body at the time. The sexual comments weren't frequent enough to bother me to remember, but one I specifically can't forget is when I wore a strapless dress to military ball my sophomore year of high school and he asked me ""when my boobs got that big"". 

It then grew into him falling for porn bots and flirting with numerous females. He asked me how to download Skype and Whatsapp, then after getting used to those, random women would send him nudes for money. He now wakes up around 8 am and stays up until about 11 pm, only on his phone the whole day. He makes and watches TikToks, follows or added thousands of girls across a few different social media accounts, and that's literally everything he has done for the past year. He gets pissy when I ask him to take me to work because he's always trying to get nudes. My boyfriend even caught him buying a $50 Steam card for one of his ""lady friends"" online. 

The little amount of time I'm around him, I always hear at least one perverted comment a day. He also stares at my body quite often. Half of his facebook posts consist of something like ""pussy being a dessert"" and ""girls being delicious"". Every single thing he does has some type of sexual meaning behind it.

A woman (42f) who he has known since she was 10 moved in with us so she could escape an abusive marriage. Her goal was to find peace, his goal was to get laid. He basically jumped from my mom to my aunt and now to this other woman. Hilariously, he's living in a house with three women who rejected him multiple times. The fact that he even tried to get with my mom and aunt, who is also his daughter-in-law's mom and aunt, is even more disgusting. He tags our new roommate in sexual posts on Facebook, he gets jealous over guys commenting on her pictures and reads her mail, follows her around like a puppy, and told my cousins that he's going to marry her, when she has made it clear that she isn't interested. 

Every single woman in this house, especially me and our new roommate, is uncomfortable in some way. My friends don't even like coming inside the house because of him. I shouldn't have to worry about wearing a tank top and shorts in front of him because it's 92°F outside. I shouldn't have to hear sexual comments about me or another woman every single time I'm around him. I shouldn't be sexualized by a man that considers himself to be my father.

730,"A few weeks ago someone stole a deep cycle battery from my camper travel trailer. My trailer is not stored at my house, but that of a family members. The morning after it happened, the family member let me know that they though someone had messed with it over the previous night. I went over in the morning and I took a look. Someone had removed the lid from the box and cut the wires and stole the battery. So I cleaned it up, took off the other battery and went to work. 

A few days later I was able to review the security camera footage. It was not great quality at the distance, but I could see some of what happened. Around 0100 a vehicle pulled up, someone got out of the passenger side, walked onto the property, took the battery, get back in the vehicle and left.  I can't tell the color of the vehicle, but I can tell the make and model. I can't see the face or clothes of the person who took the battery, but could see their size, build, and how they walked. 

I didn't bother calling the police since I didn't think there would be much they could with what is on the camera footage. However, when I was driving home a few days ago, I say the vehicle form the footage and someone with a remarkably similar build to the person in the footage. The person who life in this house can see the camper from their backyard, and I am sure they saw me install the batteries a few weeks ago. 

The battery that they stole wasn't working well anymore and barley held a charge and needed replaced, so I don't miss the battery too much. But I don't really like the idea they they messed up my trailer taking the battery, and the fact that they stole from me. 

So between the fact that the battery didn't work, and the trailer isn't parked on my property, I am hesitant to do anything. 

 I don't see me actually going and talking to them as just writing about this and thinking about it is making me nervous. I don't want people to mess with my stuff, but I don't want to provoke them since it is parked at someone else house.

731,"I'm having trouble seeing a way to regain a relationship with my brothers three kids. Almost two years ago now, he came back from his Army deployment overseas and started the long process of divorce. 

The divorce was quite ugly. His wife was not cooperative and did her best to keep the kids away from him, and thus, away from the rest of my family. My brother did eventually get every other weekend and a couple weeks during the summer. I was with them a lot of that time, doing lots of fun things with them as their uncle.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother was recently murdered and so this means that I and my family no longer have any legal rights to seeing any of the kids. Because of the ugliness of the divorce (of which I personally tried to stay away) she doesn't seem to want anything to do with any of my family (I have three siblings and living parents). 

I never did anything hurtful towards her, I just spent time with my nieces and nephew and with my brother, but still I *can* understand why she's uncooperative with us (although I think it's not right). 

For the last two months of my brothers life, he had sole custody of the oldest daughter because she claimed she was being abused by her mother. Because of that court order, she has been living with my sister since my brother died. Because of that situation, we have had some contact with their mother but it has not been healthy nor productive. And eventually it seems like the oldest daughter will go back to living with her mother and at that point, we likely won't have any contact - much less relationship - with any of the three kids.

I am of the opinion that being loving and forgiving is the best way to be and I'd just like to have a relationship with my nieces and nephews; swimming, hiking, going to parks, enjoying time together - that's all that I want but don't know how to regain a relationship with their mother being hostile.

I took a heavy toll on me I would call often sick on school and got back in my depression routine. My schoolmates called me a coward, a loser and a pussy. They aren’t really open minded so I couldn’t just tell them. Even teachers would make easy jokes about me in front of the whole class because of my anxiety I skipped certain classes to not have see them wich obviously not helped my study progress. I have no clue to just ditch them and sitting a whole year alone in school and be an easy target or just push on like I do now.

Quite strangely I see that the HR person has attached to the email the job description for both the temporary AND the permanent roles I've applied for. At the time, I didn't ask them why they've sent me both job descriptions; in fact, now that I think about it, I should have.

So, I have my interview for the temporary position, and it felt to me that it went really well. They seemed to be pleased with my experience and background, etc. During the last minutes of my interview, they mentioned that if you end up doing well at your temporary position, we might consider you for a permanent position with us. So I had an impulse moment, and mentioned to them that I've also applied for a permanent position within their company, and the HR person has sent me job description for that too. I asked them if this interview was also meant to consider me for their permanent position as well? To which they replied that they are only interviewing me for the temporary position, and are not aware of the other position, because it's within a different department. They also told me that they can ask and see why I was sent that document and then they'll get back to me.

It has been a week since I interviewed with them, and I've started to panic a bit, that I might have messed up by bringing the other position up. My fear is that they'll pass me onto the HR for the permanent position, and won't consider me anymore for the temporary one (which I really would like because I don't want to be unemployed). Then maybe I'd never get an interview with the permanent position and this would end up burning both opportunities for me.

Did I mess this up? Do you think my honesty will play against me in this situation?",18Jun2019,1
742,"Hi

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in a long term relationship now for 5 years, my mental health isn't the greatest and I'm not in a good place with my relationship . I have 0 confidence in all honesty always been (too nice) never once thought about cheating or meeting others. The first 3 years were perfect, no arguments, no bickering, no controling behavior nothing, all gravy and smooth. So the last 2 years, well... Everyday I'm being told I don't love her, controlled to the point she is ringing me up 'threatening to commit suicide' I rush an hour in the car to just arrive and she's said it was all a ploy to just get me to come over (seriously not on.). Daily being told that I don't care her, that this relationship has been bullshit for 5 years and she wishes she never met me. Shit grades on you man and you start to question everything about yourself, really wouldn't wish it on anyone. The last 2 years have made me from this confident man to just a shell of my former self, my family can see a difference in me but this is part of the story. My GFs family and mine are so close that I can't escape it, her mom is my moms best friend and dad's vice versa. I have mentioned countless amounts of times to her about this behaviour to me but it just falls on deaf ears. 

&amp;#x200B;

Soooo...... I go on holiday with a friend, the night we are their I feel a weight lifted off my head and feel the happiest and contempt with life since the 3rd year of my relationship. We are chilling round the bar and 2 girls walk up to us just for a general chat (I normally can't even say hello to another female without getting some form of abuse). So we get chatting and she is in the same circumstance as me with her bf for 4 years but everything seems okay and are both just accepting of our situations. My other friend and the other girl are single so they arrange a dinner for later in the night. The dinner comes and the girl I was speaking to chats to me about anything and everything but for the first time I feel like someone cares about what I'm talking about, the conversation is flowing naturally and normally I can barely say a word to others without having a stutter. So we go back to our relevant hotels after and she says to me that she wants to go clubbing together. I feel awful for even saying yes but at this point nothing has happened. So we do, we go clubbing and we break off. She asks me is everything okay with my gf and I just say yeah, just puts her arm round me and whispers I know your hurt from something and I just break down, both just sat on a beach upset and she confesses that also for 2 years she's been in an abusive relationship. She understands what I'm feeling and I couldn't believe it, I got these weird feelings in my body I haven't got since first meeting my GF , I felt like a new man. She confessed to me about how she would love to get to know me tommow when we are both sober and not going to do anything we regret! So we went back to our hotels apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next day she turned up at my hotel door (never expected it). She asks me to go for a walk so I do, we get talking and have so many similar interests, shit that I would expect no one to know. She confesses to me that the night before clubbing was her happiest she had been for months hair was let down and she felt free. Walk continued and out of nowhere she just turned round and said to me 'would you be willing to see if we could maybe speak more? Obviously after we both sort some stuff out at home' so I said why not, for the first time in years I didn't have this weight on me that I was just nothingness, I felt like I was actually appreciated. We had not kissed, hugged or cuddled just simply talked.

&amp;#x200B;

The last day/night of our holidays comes, she adds me on Facebook (don't know how she found out all my shit but hey ho I know it's easy) she asked if me and my freind wanted to go to her hotel and chill out, so we did! She'd planned a meal for just me and her unexpectedly, I didn't feel great about this in all honesty, felt like this was the step above but said to her that nothing can happen before we sort our situations back home. Mid meal she started getting upset and said to me that I care about her situation more than mine, which I get in shit for normally not looking out for myself and putting others first. So the meal went nice, had a chat about life, her family, her relationship issues and mine. Both on the same page that we are in some strange controlling relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

So the meal is done, she says that she needed something from the room and to just wait outside so I did, she opened the door and said stop waiting outside like an idiot so I awakedly walk in. She just breaks down on me saying she hasn't felt this happy since she first met her bf, it was pretty soon in and took me abit by surprise but said to me that she's never had feelings for love at first sight but thinks she's got it with me. So I'm just took back and have this feeling of wanting, that all those comments about how I'm just a shit boyfriend, a horrible person, I should go and just stay away from my family gone. I hadn't felt this contempt with life since I was 18, actually had a smile on my face and told her that we need to sort our situations out and meet up when we get back.

&amp;#x200B;

So we are leaving our destination and she says she will Facebook me and hugs and gives me a peck on the cheek.

&amp;#x200B;

So we arrive back home late at night, I see a message on my phone, hands shaking in anticipation to open it...

&amp;#x200B;

'hi

&amp;#x200B;

Why did you even bother speaking back to me, you knew I was in a relationship and you are too. I watched you coach off on the way back to the airport and just looked at you, in pure disgust that I ever even spoke to someone as ugly as you. All the shit I said was just because I was on holiday'

&amp;#x200B;

I've never felt so crushed, I was the happiest I had been in years straight to the most stomach ripping vile feeling I have ever felt. Like my heart had just been ripped from my body and I'm just going back to my impeding shit doom life back home.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this Is long and I am sorry but I just need some help, how can I pick myself up after this? I just feel broken, not because I really egged on for anything to really come from this as we are both in a relationship but to read that with the frame of mind I was previously in and to have it all back and destroyed even worse Is just fucking dirt.

I've gotten to the point where I'm like I don't think any woman will ever like me for just who I am, will appreciate anything of me and just dosent want to fuck my health up.",18Jun2019,1
743,"The problem is she has two dogs and I don’t want dogs in the house right now. 

I plan to sell my house in about 3 years and I want it to be in as good of shape as possible for the market. I had an ex roommate I had to kick out because her dogs made bad stains on the carpet. These stains will need to be professionally cleaned or the carpet will need to be replaced in two bedrooms, hallway and stairs. Again, bad stains. 

Having animals in the house makes me worried about additional damages and pet odor. The dogs themselves are good tempered but one is prone to shedding and the other has an affinity for peeing on things like shoes and clothes. 

Housing wouldn’t be an issue for her and our son and since we’re both military, our son has all he needs and then some. 

Am I picking the wrong battle here? She’s upset as all hell with me right now because I did change my mind about the dogs. We’ve been on/off discussing them for about a week but we’re at an impasse; she won’t live anywhere without them and I don’t want them here.",18Jun2019,1
744,"Have you ever rejected or ignored a friend request on social media from a coworker? 

There's a guy at my job that's been acting very peculiar lately. He seemed friendly enough at first. We chatted briefly a few times over the course of a month. he was very helpful when I had questions. Then he caught me off guard by sending a friend request on Facebook. I've added other people from work and we have mutual work friends but I wasn't quite ready to add him. I kept the request pending for around 2 weeks and it appears that he canceled the request. 

How do you deal with the awkwardness and tension?",18Jun2019,2
745,"So back in 2015 I made one of the biggest mistakes of my life, I co-signed an apartment for friends (well, specifically one of them). I didn't think it'd be any trouble, I had been friends with them since middle school and they seemed to have a really solid to make sure things went right (and they were also adding a fourth to make things even more affordable later). 

After that went down, I slowly fell out of touch with them until I started getting calls about the one I co-signed for. She was constantly getting behind on payments. I told her about the calls and it'd seem like she'd get caught back up. Then their apartment situation fell apart, the fourth didn't move, their third got pregnant and moved out, etc etc etc. Towards the end of their lease I stopped getting calls about the one I co-signed for, so I assumed everything was hunky dory. Never really talked to any of them again, but whatever.

Earlier today I get a call from a debt collection agency, thinking it was for some reason about my student loans I picked up the phone. I asked about what the call is about and my world comes crashing down when they say the name of the the company that owned the apartment. They kinda make it sound like they've been trying to contact me for a while and eventually they tell me I owe $4000. I tell them I can't pay that. I've been unemployed and living at home while trying to get some health problems sorted out. I asked about any sort of plan or anything that could defer this until I can get things figured out, but all they said was I had until Friday to pay and in the mean time it'll be marked as refusal to pay.

I've been trying to get in touch with my old friend, but it's been a slow process. This seems so out of the blue. They mentioned previous addresses and numbers, but this is the first I've actually heard anything. I want to believe it's elaborate scam, why else would they take nearly four years to actually say anything to me. I looked up the agency, ProCollect (Dallas), and it seems like it's a legit place, although with very horrible reviews much like any debt collector agency.


Is there anything I can really do in this situation? I know legally I'm pretty much screwed, I'm the one that willingly co-signed, that bombshell is all on me. Is there any sort of action I can take since I was kept blind about this until now? No one from either party (apartment company or friend) informed me of the debt that was accrued by the end of the lease. Alternatively, what's the worst case in the event I can't pay? I'm at a loss of what to do.",18Jun2019,1
746,He hasn’t blocked me but he’s deleted me as a friend. Which means he can’t see the things I’ve sent. I tried to message him on Facebook to ask him why but he probably won’t see the message. I don’t know what to do as I have no other way to contact him. At first I thought it must have been an accident but then I noticed it wasn’t just on snapchat but Facebook. I met him online about 5 years ago and we’ve been friends ever since. I can’t think of anything I’ve done to upset him. He’s made no sings that he’s upset. We haven’t talked that much lately cause we’ve both been busy. But I maybe spoke to him a week ago. I guess he just doesn’t want to be my friend anymore but I want to know why. I hate not having any closure. Perhaps it was inevitable that we would slowly stop talking but for him to just unfriend me is upsetting. What would you do?,18Jun2019,1
747,"Hey guys, I have been struggling with paranoia, anxiety, and constant intrusive thoughts regarding terrible things happening in today's world. I read the news often, and all I see is reports of murder, injustice, child/sex trafficking, the latest updates to what's happening in Sudan, or women/ young girls getting brutally assaulted/raped. These headlines make me constantly panicked and I start having terrible thoughts over them happening to me, my younger siblings, or anyone I love. I am generally mentally very strong; I just do not know why these thoughts come to me more often now. Everytime I leave my house or see my brother and sister playing outside, I get nervous and fearful that any horrible thing can happen to them at any time.  I clearly can't live my life like this, so does anyone have any suggestions? How can I tell myself to stop worrying about these things and let these terrible thoughts and images exit my mind? I would love to be a badass person who these fears do not occur to me, but I am unfortunately not.",18Jun2019,1
748,"Me and this guy have been friends and roommates for about 2 years now. It started off rocky- he was kind of a jerk to me and just seemed very cold/distant/closed off at first. 

I guess after awhile he slowly warmed up to me, and soon we were relating on a lot of levels. We went out together a lot, listened to the same music, etc.

At one point there was something kind of romantic, but not really. We slept together a few times, and eventually we admitted we had both developed feelings for one another. He admitted that he didn't think we were compatible and didn't want to pursue it. I agreed. 

Now, it feels like we are constantly in this weird place of not wanting to show too much care for the other person. He is constantly saying things to me that makes me feel like he doesn't even like me, but that he just uses me for attention.

He will ask if I'm home, but later bring up that he just hates being alone. Implying that he doesn't actually care whether it's me or not.

When we used to cuddle, he would make comments that it felt nice, because he was an affectionate person that likes to cuddle. Never that he actually just liked to cuddle with me.

When he invites me to go see a show with him, he will always say it's because these things are more fun with friends, and that he doesn't like to go alone. I'm sure you can guess the implication.

If we are hanging out at home, the second that someone else comes home he goes and hangs out with them.

I'm constantly getting cut down in these little ways. Like I could be swapped with any person on the planet and he wouldn't care, so long as he wasn't alone.

He doesn't ask me questions about myself, usually just talks at me about his day.

I don't know if this friendship is even worth it. I have been considering taking some space because I can't stop focusing on these little comments, and the general feeling I get that our friendship is based on him not having anyone better. 

I can't tell if I'm just being insecure, or if he really just gives 0 shits about me.",18Jun2019,2

750,"I was at a political event sometime in the past few months. I took a lot of photos with my cell phone. Everything seemed fine at the time. 

Later on while reviewing my photos, one series of photos stood out in a bad way. 

A well known male politician is talking to a female supporter while holding her hand, initially with proper distance between him and her. By the last photo, his hand is touching her upper chest, between her shoulder and breast. 

I don’t know who the woman in the photo is or how she felt at that moment. Her hair is covering her face in my photo so I can’t see her reaction.

I’m having a moral dilemma about what to do with this photo. I haven’t shown it to anybody yet. I was initially going to hide it and pretend it never happened, but then at times I feel like I’m doing something wrong by hiding this. I almost anonymously sent it to a newspaper a few days ago, but then I stopped myself. 

I would like to find the woman in the photo to ask her how she felt in that moment and to let her decide what to do, but I don’t know how I would find her. 

What should I do?",18Jun2019,8

754,"Ok so, I've always personally kinda thought my dad has been emotionally abusive or manipulative (and a little bit my mom, but I wouldn't say it's bad). I don't want to be that stuck up baby who doesn't get her way once or twice so I'd like the help of some fellow redditors. 

I'm still a minor (I can't move out yet), and I have two cats I love very much at home, whom I take care of with my mom. Not quite relevant, but it's the thought of taking my cats from my mom that keeps me from making plans to move out when I'm of age.

My mom and dad have been high school sweethearts, and their 25th marriage anniversary was just this past may, and they're still head over heels for eachother. They never argue (genuinely) and my father hasn't hurt my mom in any way shape or form, so I will not be taking him to court (i know, it's a ridiculous idea) or whatever cause my mom loves him with her whole heart. 

Now on to the main point. My father has a very explosive temper, and he also has ADHD (and maybe slight depression) which he doesn't take meds for. When he does have meds to take, he only takes them when he sees fit and is in general kinda irresponsible with that kind of stuff.
I'm the youngest of me and my brother, and although we receive roughly the same treatment by him, it's been hinted several times that my brother's the favourite (nothing on him, I love him a ton) child. Since my childhood (the parts that I can remember) my father has frequently taken his anger out on me, (he's never resorted to violence btw) in ways such as shouting as loud as he can, slamming doors and cupboards at me, stomping up the stairs, yada yada. When I am at fault, the shouting is worse, the guilting is inevitable, and he also walks to my room (not his) and tears it apart. From throwing chairs, ripping my covers off my bed, swiping my desk, he's done it all. (I forgot to add, but when people make him angry, he blacks out, only coming to to realize he's holding someone by the collar of their shirt of whatnot.) One thing about that, is that he gets amgry when I tell him I'm scared he'll hurt me. He doesn't understand the way his eyes glaze over as he's shouting his thtoat raw and emptying me of my tears. He doesn't fucking understand.
Now. He's got his head in the right place, misinformed as shit but that's changeable. He's a damn good teacher and is vverry religious, but as I said before, he has anger issues. Once, a student blocked somebody's spot with their bag, and he flipped several tables in utter anger. (I'd say that's a little extreme)

As aforementioned, I don't wanna take him to court, I just want him to take a damned anger management course. That's all I ask.

Any idea if he's emotionally abusive? If so, how can I prove it to him, he's too entitled to hear that he's doing something wrong so it's a challenge.
Secondly, how the hell do I convince him to take an anger management course?",18Jun2019,3

So I live in a house with 3 other guys, all of us college students. One of my roommates went to the nearest large city to find work for the summer. Coincidentally, he left a couple days before the meter read date for our latest gas/electric bill. I'm in charge of calculating (lol, I just divide by 4) what everyone owes, collecting from my roommates, and paying the bill. So I have no qualms about charging him for this current bill, but when the next one comes around, he will not have lived in this house between the two dates on that future bill. I think the next next one will be like that as well.

He's still paying rent, and he's not subletting, the room is just empty. The landlord doesn't have anything to do with utilities, it's all up to us. When we moved in, there was a verbal agreement to split utilities 4 ways each time, and there haven't really been any problems.

Part of me thinks we should honor the agreement, while part of me says ""He's not using the utilities at all, so why should he be paying for them?"" I'm not really sure what to do.

I haven’t made myself sick or anything, but I have thought about it a few times. The idea of getting caught and the long term effects of making yourself sick scare me so that’s why I haven’t done it. My stupid brain has even thought “hey if you had anorexia maybe you wouldn’t have to deal with your weight” I’m absolutely aware of how bad and toxic that sounds and it sounds disgusting when I say it and that’s why I just want it to stop. I know eating disorders aren’t cute or quirky. They’re scary, isolating and damaging.

Dad was in an extremely minor car accident.He is not being truthful about the situation. But the young driver (license says 24 but looks younger) has taken the fault.

&amp;#x200B;

He drives a huge pickup truck, parked too close to her. He was over the line into her parking spot. He also admits to us when he got out of the vehicle he dented her door. But anyways, the girl attempted to back out of the spot and scratched his truck fender.

&amp;#x200B;

The scratched is minor but he after 2 weeks decided to go after the family for damages. He never admitted to the damage on her vehicle as ""it already had scratches on it"" and they never will know.

&amp;#x200B;

The young driver was driving her parents car, and her mother simply paid the balance after he provided 2 quotes and kept it out of insurance. 

&amp;#x200B;

My entire family knows that the amount paid to Dad was highway robbery and a win-win for him. More or less shut up money. He wants to trade the vehicle in however. 

&amp;#x200B;

He after 2 months is trying to get the fender replaced. The dealership is now stating the cost is about $100 more than the written quote. 

&amp;#x200B;

He is upset and wants this fixed. We are trying to not get him to go after the family for more money, they will certainly be calling insurance on this situation, also we do not know if they will in turn go after him for the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do you handle this dealer situation?",18Jun2019,1

768,"**TL;DR : I'm 24. Junior Copywriter (guy who comes up with advertising ideas) about to go back to university for Software Development.**  
**I work in esport - a field I really like. Now I have second thoughts about quitting and going back to university (already dropped out once)**  


  
I'm a 24-year old junior copywriter. I'm working in a great agency (top of my field)  
My specialization is esport-sponsoring -  a rapid growing field where not much advertising has been done yet.  
Being a Gamer as long as I can think this should be my dream job.   
I lurk reddit daily,  look at every esport out there and just love the overall gaming community.   
In my office I'm the go to person for my field and will probably have the chance to grow fast.  


My other passion are tech ideas.   
I consume pretty much everything about new technologies and a lot of my ideas involve the creative use of it. Many of my tech ideas also involve the solving of a problem which isn't normally something advertising agencies do (""Saving the world""-shit you name it). But my agency is actually open for it.  


Prior to advertising I studied economics but left without a degree. Something that bothers me a little since my family is full of degree holders.   
Also careers in advertising are normally not forever.   
Having a degree would make things easier later.

  
After about 2 years as a junior (1,5 in this agency) I have the chance to go back to university.  


It's a newly founded tech universit .  
They have pretty cool partners like facebook or Telekom. 

  
I don't have much prior coding experience. I find it cool but and could probably learn it there but let's face it: I won't be as good as the kid that started at twelve years old.   
Other studies there are Interaction Design and Product Management. The studies will cost me 30k €.  


I'm really good at my job but I probably wouldn't enjoy advertising as much if I wouldn't work on gaming/esport. (Tbf advertising for something you like is easy).

&amp;#x200B;

After I quit a few weeks ago I'm now thinking about that decision. 

  
**Upsides of going back to university:**

  
\-I would experience a new field with new kinds of people in it.  
\-I could work with talented people on actual solutions.

\-Maybe I can develop something that makes the world a bit better. (I know it's cheesy but well why not.)

\-I could learn a lot more about tech.

\-My job would be probably a lot more future proof.

\-I know something  about "" ideas"" which many tech people seem to struggle a bit (might be a myth)

\- I can get a network in tech.

&amp;#x200B;

**Downsides of going back to university:**

\- I would probably be not as good as a developeras I could be as a copywriter but being good or great at my field is something I personally want from a career.

\-Someone else will do all the cool ideas in esport advertising.

\- After I finished my study I probably won't come back.   
\- I can't just come up with ideas all day. It will be more corporate.

\- It's pretty unclear how the field will evolve.

\- It's pretty unclear how Ai will change ad agencies

\- I would probably be out of advertising by age 40 or 50 like most.

\- Without a degree I cannot get a corporate job in marketing

\- Without a degree I cannot climb up a corporate ladder outside ad agencies

. I will never learn to ""build"" things like digital products

\- If this study isn't for me I would have been dropped out twice

&amp;#x200B;

**Is it this important to get a degree for your life after advertising?**

769," 

He's finally sleeping for more than 3 hours in a row. I should be on top of the world but I sit and watch him and worry.

After 6 months my baby is finally sleeping. He never did when he was a newborn and i would pray for sleep, Little did i know, he was seriously ill. He was in hospital for 2 weeks after he was born. Pneumonia, sepsis and a hole in his bowels.

When he finally came home we were promised he was healthy and fine, yet he never slept,screamed when he had to sleep on his back and as a first time mum I had no idea what I was doing wrong. I thought maybe he preferred to sleep on me and I tried to push away negative thoughts.

We took him to A&amp;E when we thought he had a virus and didn't know how to make it better. 2 days later and a 4 hour surgery to remove 50% of his large bowels, he was finally getting better. Somehow it was missed during the daily scans that his appendix had burst when he was newborn and had been eating away at his bowels for nearly 2 months.

Now he finally sleeps and I don't. The guilt I feel for not knowing it was worse than I thought and the amount of pain he must have been in eats away at me. He was only 2 months old. Not old enough to tell anyone where it hurt.

People tell me that I could never have known and when a doctor tells you everything is ok you believe them but i don't think the guilty feeling will ever completely go.",18Jun2019,1

Okay so I met this girl online and she was a cutie. Since I met her online and she was too attractive to seem real, what do you do. You do a background check since you have access duh. This background check came back with some information about her, cool now what. So we were chatting it up for quite awhile and things were going great, over the 2 months we talked she told me about her losing her keys 4 or 5 times, I figured if we kept talking I would get her a tracker for her since she is a young single mother who lives at home still and can't afford to get one herself (I never told her I was thinking this). Well, we kept talking and I fucked up and broke her heart cause why not right. Now fast forwarding a couple weeks, I remember her background check came back with her address, which she never gave me. So I got to thinking, why not send her a tracker anonymously since I was a dick and the least I can do is send her a gift and give myself peace of mind that I did something to make her happy.

775,"Context: Currently 17 and my parents have been divorced since I was 9. Recently my dad went on a trip (by himself) for three weeks back to China and Taiwan. So fast forward to the present, he was supposed to come home tomorrow but ended up arriving late last night with his new girlfriend/wife from China without any notice. (He did make me move out of master bedroom prior to his trip but didn't make it clear whether she was coming or not) So she got everything situated last night and this afternoon my dad took me to lunch. He told me that she would be staying/visiting for a couple of months and told me that he screened through multiple women to make sure that they're not gold diggers and he told me she's ""okay"". The thing that disturbed me was the fact that he told me that she's a very motivated person and wants to make a living for herself while she's here (U.S) A lot of the things he told me were very vague, it seemed like he didn't really want to talk about it.

Moving on, I just want to say that I respect my dad's decision and relationship. My dad's retired, and I just want him to be happy, and if finding another woman in life does, then so be it. To be honest, I'm fine with her and I'm willing to be friends with her as long as she's willing to as well. 

Concern: my main concern is whether I can trust her or not. Yeah my dad ""screened"" her but is she really trustworthy? She could be trying to take my dad's assets (my inheritance)  or try to immigrate to America with her children. I'm really concerned about what her intentions are. After my parents divorced, my mom kept planting this idea in my head which was that my dad would bring a woman back and that woman and her children would take everything. My other concern is how do I progress my relationship with her? It just seems really weird to me as I've never met her before and the gap between son and stepmom seems really far especially when I've never even met her before.

So I cheated on a girl like 8 months ago. I like to think I’m really respectful to girlfriends I have and people in general, so this is something I thought I would absolutely never do. I was dating a girl who showed 0 emotion really, as she was shy. Im very outgoing and know how to spark convo/fun but this girl just did not speak much and it took a while to get her out of her shell. After this going on for a couple months I honestly just wanted out of the relationship as I felt I was talking to/dating a wall.

Throughout the relationship I was getting closer and closer with this one girl who was in my friend group. (my ex was not in my friend group). She is now my girlfriend and I think it’s safe to say we’re in love as we just connect really well and we can always just talk for however long (and other reasons but not the point). 

At a party we were both at that my ex wasn’t at, we drank and smoked and were pretty fucked up. We did makeout for a while but that was it, it didn’t get further. After this I had no idea what to do and felt like shit, I ended up deciding from others peoples advice that I wouldn’t tell her. It’s been several months and I really just don’t think my ex gives a fuck as she’s kinda just a party animal who doesn’t show emotion.

Before moving here I was a health inspector in another state. For restaurants that care about food safety, I feel this wouldn't be an issue and also speak to my ability to handle food safely and such, making it a benefit.

If this were a serious, long-term position I'd think ""Surely I should tell them, because I want to work for the type of restaurant that cares about this stuff! So if they don't hire me because of it, I probably didn't want to work there anyway!""

788," 

I just have some questions that I'd like some help answered from fellow redditors as I am frustrated with my current insurance situation. I am in NYC if that makes any difference. Thank you for any help in advance.

**Background**:

My wife and I will soon be dropped by our insurance company, citing frequency of medical claims as their reasoning. We've had about an accident a year over the past 3 years. The kicker is that none of them were our fault. Wife and I have been getting physical therapy following each accident, wife had surgery in both knees and one shoulder over the 3 accidents, and I am getting a LESI on my lower spine.

**Questions**:

* I didn't know insurance companies could do that. Even with the high insurance rates and majority of clients never claiming anything, if a single client makes enough claims for medical support, insurance companies can just drop you? They really play a no-lose game, huh?
* Now that we have been dropped, even with the accidents not being our fault, just due to the frequency of us making claims (that we need) to get better, premiums from other companies are sky freaking high. How long will it stay like this? They are basically saying that we should not drive with rates like this. Can I not get insurance for 6 months and ""ride out"" the high premium phase? I don't *have* to use my car, but with two kids, my wife will definitely need hers.
* And if rates are going to be this high anyway, why do they drop clients instead of just raising the premium? Can't they recup the cost instead of dumping us to give that money to a competitor?
* Any other recommendations / words of wisdom that will help my current situation?",18Jun2019,2

There seems to be no end to their shaking, despite the fact that I've tried different kinds of recommended stretches, as well as gloves that are meant to target symptoms caused by Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Honestly, it's getting me down because the tremors get in the way of doing things that I need to do/enjoy (lab work, practice surgery, drawing, etc.). Of course, it's also a little hard to ignore that my hands are shaking like the body of an anxious chihuahua, so people tend to point it out really often and it's a bit embarrassing.

796,"So my problem is that I've had an unusually dry throat for the last 14 years. It started in high school when I was using drugs and smoking a pack of cigarettes almost daily for 2 years straight. One day I noticed I was developing something that felt like a cold in the back of my throat, I knew all the abuse to my throat was catching up to me. Well it never improved and I never went to get it checked when I was younger. I just shut my self off from the world at 16 due to it and now at 29 I really want to get it diagnosed, or if by some miracle get it fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is I've been to two ENT doctors and both of them have said since the tissue in my throat looks fine, and because my vocal chords are completely fine, that there is no problem and thus nothing to fix. However I'm being 100% honest that there is something wrong with my throat. I've read of stories of people having to go from doctor to doctor before they get a proper diagnosis but I feel like if I have to go to another ENT doctor, tell my same story about how something is definitely wrong only to be told everything looks fine that I'm just going to give up on everything.

&amp;#x200B;

It's like gaslighting at this point. Being told that the small blood I wake up with in the back of my throat is due to common issues when I know it isn't is slowly driving me crazy. Am I not suppose to give up? 

&amp;#x200B;

I basically had to beg my current ENT doctor to consider an X-Ray option to see if anything comes up. He didn't think it'll show anything but for me it's like my final option before all hope of finding whatever is wrong with my throat goes. It's scary reaching that point where you're literally hopeless and you're that close to just ending it. I really would like to avoid that I just don't know how to continue if the X-Rays come back negative.

799,"So some context: I am 18 years old (female) and just about to leave college in the end of June. I’m currently looking for a full time job or anything and hope to have one by August. 

So my parents like to book holidays and tell me a month in advanced at the most. They booked one for July to go to a caravan place. I politely declined when they told me as I would be frantically trying to pull my life together that month. Obviously they understood (from what I know, my dad is quite grumpy normally). They gave me a while notice for this which has been the first time in years that I have been made aware of a holiday earlier than a month. 

However I hate camping, with a burning passion. I have a fear of thunderstorms and the idea of not being safe for a week in August scared the fuck out of me. Last year they did it and we pretty much spent most of the time in the tent as there was nothing to do, the nights were freezing and I’m surprised I didn’t loose any toes. We left a day early because of everything.

Yet my mother has just informed me that they have booked another camping trip. To the same place. For a week in August. The month I’ll most likely be starting a new job and will be too late to book days off for. They are saying I cannot back out of this one and I have no choice but to go. I have expressed that I will attend any other family holidays when I can but this one, camping I will not do.

However they won’t budge, have been calling me moody, laughing at my fear and hatred all night. Even my siblings have. I’m fed up. I have no idea what to do, my anxiety is through the roof. 

TL:DR: my parents don’t care to give me notice before holidays they know I don’t like.",18Jun2019,2
801,"I'm on mobile, apologies in advance for formatting issues. Let's get down to it:

I was walking my dog this morning when a very friendly young pitbull ran up to us and started loving all over my dog. He was wearing a collar, so I assume he's not feral. I have done the following so far:

-taken him to the police station to get scanned for a chip and file a ""found dog"" report. No chip.
- called local shelters and rescues. No space.
- posted his photo and info on my neighborhood forum. No hits.
- called my vet friends and family to see if they know anyone who would be willing to foster and/or rescue.

Here's where it gets sticky. My husband and I are leaving for the weekend to go to a wedding, so I dont have a ton of time to figure out what to do. The dog, despite clearly being familiar with humans, does not seem to be well looked after and I don't want to risk my other animals getting some infection. I have two cats who are already salty about the intrusion of our dog, and my large neutered dog has a fun habit of trying to mount un-neutered males. 

There's more. Pitbulls are banned in my county, so if I take him to the local animal services shelter or drop him off with the police, he will be euthanized. 

One of my vet connections is offering a free check up and discounted boarding while we're away, which buys us time and clinical services but doesnt solve what to do with the dog. My husband is working a convention right now and doesn't want to deal with any of this. I'm leaning toward fostering and possibly adopting this dog. 

So what do I do Reddit?",18Jun2019,2

803,"Me f22 and bf f 22 
Okay, I don’t know where else to go. So I have PTSD from an abusive relationship. And I’m terrified of being cheated on again. I’ve been with my current boyfriend for almost three years and he is wonderful, we have a very good relationship and he saved himself physically for the right person. 
Lately I’ve been obsessed with the idea of him cheating on me because I’m so scared to loose him. So I’ve been talking to him about my insecurities , I’ve made up scenarios like what if it was a one time thing , and it was an instant regret and you didn’t want to tell me to protect me . And he’s reassured me that he knows that telling me would be protecting me and there is no such thing as mistakes but only decisions . And I can’t continue to live my life in fear and he’s sorry the past happened to me but I can’t project it onto our relationship . 
Please don’t judge me , I’m really struggling to accept love for myself. Sometimes when I question him he has tears in his eyes and he’ll let one slip or start crying and bring it to a hault. 

He tells me if I just give him a chance he promise I won’t regret it . In desperate pleading I’ve been like promise on my life you would tell me , and he responds I promise on your life on my life on our children’s lives!
Sometimes he just throws me off when we talk about it because he says stuff like I would be screwed either way but I would tell you !  
I’m stuck between the fear that I’m ruining him and our relationship or he’s hiding a deep dirty secret and tears of guilt come out sometimes .. is that awful? 
God I’m so lost between fear and loosing someone I believe is my person. Help 

Tl;dr is crying guilt or worry and hurt",18Jun2019,1
804,"Long story short, ex from high school, (I'm only 21) has recently started talking to me again, she'll call me at 2am just to tell me someone unsavory is trying to talk to her, she'll call me to let me hear her play piano, and we've hung out a few times. I still very much have feelings for this girl, and I expressed that to her, although I enjoy having a friendship. She has made it clear she does not reciprocate but I'm conflicted. I'm happy when she's around miserable when she's gone. Is she using me or does she genuinely want to be friends? should I continue to hang out with her and see where it goes?

805,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have been job hunting for about 7 months now aggressively and consistently. I've had 2 in-person interviews and 1 phone interview that did not amount to much.

&amp;#x200B;

**My main reason for leaving my job is :** 

**1)**shorter commute (currently 35 miles) 

**2)** want a job that is more spiritually rewarding  


**Reason why I would stay:** 

**1)** job(telecom broker) is low stress and allows for almost completely autonomy to do work

**2)** pay is decent 50K.

&amp;#x200B;

Colleague is going on maternity leave for almost 2-3 months. I will assume her responsibilities, I feel like this gives me negotiating power to ask for 60K/year and work remote 1 day of the week.

Alternatively, I can continue to job hunt and find something more in line what I'm looking for. This would put my employer in a difficult position(small company), but again this has been 7+ months in the works and this process has been exhausting.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts? thank you.",18Jun2019,1
806,"Hello everyone, so I’m 18 and have just graduated high school and during my whole school time I’ve felt inadequate compared to others, while others took all A.P I only took 2, 1 after I-went to an on level English class. Where others took hours studying and got straight A’s I played video games and did homework and studying, I used most of my free time playing video games and scraped by with a B-. Where others took so many extracurriculars they slept for only 4 hours a night at max, I took nine. My parents heap praise on me, telling me I’m smart and just had to deal with “different” problems than others like Autism and Anxiety/panic attack’s. Hell even my sister who is 4 years younger than me has several extracurriculars and is taking all honors next year. I feel like a failure, that I didn’t and won’t ever live up to my potential.
How do I stop feeling like this and maeby see the positives in myself, because I can barely get through the week before almost breaking down thinking about wasted time and potential",18Jun2019,2
808,"Hello,

In all seriousness, I am back at job hunting and is stuck. I really need to get a job that is in my career choice or something close. I graduated in 2017 with a bachelor's of science in computer animation (computer graphics). This is anything from 3D modeling, motion capture, 3D animation and more. I also have used Photoshop for illustrating, animating and photo-editing. I know Microsoft office, final cut pro and garageband. 

I'd like to know what states have the best offers for my skillsets and what jobs I should be looking into because I'm not entirely sure what I should be applying to. All the places that have the skills I have say they need 5+ years of experience and looking for seniors(those who have been doing it much longer).",18Jun2019,1
