0,"So I have severe depression &amp; anxiety, and I just started a contract at an amazing company. I’m just had my second day and we’re still training, but I felt so overwhelmed and I didn’t have the training modules I had to work on. I also just felt way behind, and I’ve had bad experiences through school and with people that make me feel dumb.

Anyway went to the toilet around 2:40 like, was gonna just have a power-cry and get back to it. But I cried way too much and like couldn’t calm myself I went back to my seat twice between crying. Both times the people around where I sit felt like quiet and uncomfortable. It just sucked I got everything done that I had, and I’m sure it’ll be fine but..

I’m just nervous about going back in tomorrow now, I think one of my higher ups might’ve seen me too. It just sucks ! 

TLDR - I need to get back on some meds",12Sep2019,1
1,"I started talking to this guy in May, we hung out for hours each time we were together and it was so natural. We hooked up and I had to leave a few weeks later to go back home for the summer. I’d never opened up to being with someone romantically and I enjoy being friends with people instead usually. But there was so much chemistry and he made me feel desired and beautiful and smart. Important really. I craved our conversations and his voice. Someone I wanted, wanted me. 

We continued texting everyday and FaceTiming every weekend. Things he would usually initiate because I was nervous about being too comfortable over the phone. I started imitating the more I got comfortable to the idea that he actually liked me. Without asking for clarification on what was happening, he told me he wanted to date me when I got back. That he wanted me to be his girlfriend and wake up next to me. I melted. He said all the right things. But I was still not super overbearing. 

Come a month before I go back and he doesn’t answer that quickly. You notice when it takes someone 6 hours to answer you. Even when they’re busy. You notice when they open it 2 days later and it hurts. People are busy but you notice the difference in tone and conversation But people are busy and what could I say to him? He forgot my birthday. I messaged him the day before getting back on campus. I asked if I would see him around and he said” I’ll be busy and tired but I’ll be around.” Intense toneshift. I asked how he was feeling about continuing to talk and he said that it was “prolly best to just be friends. I’m really busy and working through my mental health”. I get that. I told him to take care and that I appreciated him letting me know. I saw it coming but did I really have to prompt him to dump me?

Flashforward 2 days later. I see him and he asks how I am. He sits down and talks with me and I am happy and upset about it, because.... you told me you were too busy to be in a relationship and I am not your friend. After a week of seeing him all the time I started to take different routes to get to class, I started avoiding the cafe at times I’d usually see him and I KEEP SEEING HIM EVERYWHERE. I smile and maybe give him a short greeting because when I see him my body shakes, and heats up and I get smiley, I want to touch him but seeing him is really getting my mood down. I am kind and at this point I want to be friendly and acknowledge him when I see him but I also don’t want to seem desperate which I’m not, I just spent a lot of time talking with you and respect you. No contact is really difficult right now because I go to a small school and I do see him a lot. I am paranoid that he thinks I’m following him but we just go to the same places, I’ve been trying to avoid him. I don’t want to be cold shouldered because it doesn’t feel genuine to who I am but I also can’t stop thinking about him after I see him. And when I hear his voice my ears perk up. 

My question is how do you utilize no contact when you see a person every day. At what point should you stop acknowledging them completely or should you? I don’t want to seem desperate but I also don’t want to seem cold. But he is the one that ended things so I don’t know why I am so caught up in what he thinks. I can’t tell if he was just no longer interested or if he’s actually telling the truth. 

There’s this long side walk I have to take to get to class and I see him leaving the dorm a lot, it’s just in my line of vision and I don’t know if I should go on my phone or look at the ground. I usually look at my phone and when he gets close look up and smile and go back to my phone but I feel like I’m doing everything wrong. Please help",12Sep2019,1
2,"Hey there. So, I worked with this girl at a job of mine for 3 and a half years. And we got very close about 2 years ago, when she came out to me as bisexual. I’m a lesbian, so we bonded over this, and also over having similar abusive relationships (at different times, so we were able to help each other through them). We recently started working elsewhere but still the same place. 
I started to have feelings for her right at the end of my abusive relationship, around when she came out to me. I ignored this, because I figured it was because of both of those circumstances. I told myself that if she and this guy she had just started seeing didn’t work out, I’d let her know how I feel. They got very serious and this turned out to be her abusive relationship. I tried to stay by her side and help her through, but she had temporarily moved away and we had a bit of a disagreement and eventually drifted apart for a while. I had mentioned to her that I used to like her but had gotten over it before this had happened. 

Months later, we reconnected. It was like we had never had that fight. We talked about why it happened and were able to easily work through our differences and forgive each other. And we love each other. But somehow, my feelings seemed to come back. I told her quickly because I always tend to move on very easily as long as somebody tells me they don’t feel the same way. She was very understanding and told me what I needed to hear, and I moved on. I love her very much and love our friendship more than anything. She’s one of the only people who I want to be in my life for as long as I live.

I think that, as we’ve continued to grow closer, I’ve come to realize that I will always love her. Platonically, of course, but also romantically. I don’t want to date her, because I know it isn’t what she wants, and I would never want to make her feel pressured into anything. Our friendship is more than I could EVER ask for. We click in a way that I have never clicked with another person, and I believe that she would agree. I wouldn’t change a thing if she is as happy as I am with our relationship. I’m always very honest with how I feel and I think she knows that there is a part of me that will always love her romantically.  But I have been VERY clear with her about also wanting her to be happy and to do what she wants. I support her every time she has feelings for somebody who I think might be good for her, and I never get in the way of her relationships. 

Even if I never get married. I hope to be her friend for the rest of my life, and I think that I will be perfectly content with that. But here’s my question- have I done anything wrong? I don’t ever want to hurt her and I do NOT want her to feel pressured to make our friendship anything that it is not. I am not in any pain being friends with her because I think that it makes me just as happy as dating her would, just in a different way. I have no plan to change things, nor do I ever expect her to feel any differently. 

Also, do you think that I will move on one day? Has anybody else experienced a friendship like this, and if so, did you get over them or always sorta have that feeling? Is there anything that I should be doing differently, to avoid hurting her or hurting myself emotionally in any way? 

Thanks in advance. (:",12Sep2019,1
4,"So a few months ago I had a dentist appointment... long story short my insurance didn't cover the dentist, and I had about 2 grand to pay..

5,"My uncle has been living with us since May to keep my granny 'company' when my grandad went into the hospital for 5 days, He didn't help with anything and made more of a mess for me to clean and still does. I think my uncle used it as an excuse to slither his way into our house as he lives at some shared supported housing since leaving the psych ward about 2 years ago.

My uncle and I have always been on the rocks I have always been the type of person that if I was comforted with something I wouldn't be polite and keep it to myself I would stand up for myself which I did pretty of times with my uncle when he would insult my intelligence or even my mental health. My uncle is a stoner and has been since he was in his mid-teens, he has sold some of my stuff to pay for his debts or to sell to buy more drugs. My uncle is selfish and has always been, he put drugs above anything else including his family that he lost not due to him being in the psych ward but how he behaved during that time and before it with verbally abusing his ex GF and never spending time at home and constantly coming to our house at 1 am and not leaving until way later at like 3 am to go back home.

My uncle has always been nasty but my granny has a soft spot for him cause he is her son but also because he nearly died at birth so he has that as a reason to 'appreciate' him. My uncle is lazy, sleeping in until 2 pm, stays up until 3 am, leaves a mess everywhere he goes and doesn't wash and I mean it he doesn't wash like ever for as long as I can remember. To show you an example of how drugs are a priority to him is his son came to our house and my uncle was at my aunt K (his sister's house) and phoned us to see the score on the match and was told the score and also that his son was here and was like okay. However when he druggy friend showed up later on looking him, he phoned us and asked did his mate call for him and we said yes and he got a taxi over here, like a £9 taxi fare for a friend and not to see his son who he 'so desperately misses'. I know it may not be right for his ex to inform the kid's ages 8-17 on how the father is an asshole but I believe she is telling them the truth rather than get their hopes up for their dad to be a dad to them, she is saving them pain and also to have tough skin as their dad has always prioritised drugs for years.

Anyway, my granny is getting fed up with him being here, my grandad, my brother and I have been pissed off for a while and now my fave uncle P and aunt M are starting to get fed up with him. He is a slob, pays no money, eats our food when he has the munchies and literally left us in a state of no food during our 'bad' weeks where we were limited on funds. It's now September and he has still not gone home I am at my breaking point as May was nearly 4 months ago and he is still here and milking us for all he can, he is disrespectful and rude and literally I am at my breaking point with his stupid rave songs about escape and freedom when he has 0 worries in the world while the rest of us are trying to have a happy life. My grandad wants him gone but he is afraid to say anything in case my uncle tries another suicide attempt when he felt like a 'burden', I am not making his mental illness seem like it doesn't affect him but for years he bullied me, my mental health and I am not going to be understanding to him when he wasn't for me even when I was suicidal, which he is not btw but if we try and throw him out he will use suicide as a way to blackmail people. My uncle is manipulative and is 1000% the type of person to do something to get pity and then leech of that person for other stuff like money for his drugs and he will use an excuse like I need new shoes blah blah blah.

Not really related but about 2 months ago he had a fight with me and went on about my mental health and how I am crazier than him and at least he took the help he needed and I had to full-on tell him my meds were for anxiety and how I don't need them and I also began to curse which took him aback as I shut back I am not 12, I am 21 (I'm now 22) and told him how he can't pull shit with me anymore meaning getting me into shit as it would be my word against his, my family know my word is more trusted than his as he lies and lies and I just have no filter and say it how it is (mostly). Ii also told him that he may have my grandparents fooled but I know him and his tricks and he tried to gaslight me and say how I was crazy thinking I knew stuff until I lay down all the facts of his wrongdoings which made him realise I am not as dumb as I look.( People say I look dumb but surprise them with knowledge hahaha)

My advice is how do I get rid of him without he trying the 'I'm a burden, I'm gonna kill myself' rountine, I am getting tired of the food that I have labelled getting eaten, messes left for me to clean etc. I am starting back at college and I can't deal with him being here and making life harder for me with him constantly leaving messes and other crap.

8,"Let me begin with stating that if this does not belong in this subreddit, I greatly apologize. Move it to where it belongs if you must. As the title states, this is going to be a very long post because I have to detail many aspects of my life from the last 4-5ish years. I appreciate any support and advice, as well as the patience someone would have to read through all of this. I do have a slightly bad memory so I will update this post with Edits if I do forget anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Where do I begin?? I guess I'll start by describing myself, my personality and mindset previously and currently. I am a 23 (soon to be 24) year old male, graduated high school, and had a lot going for me. I used to be an extremely creative and artistic person who was optimistic/realistic (not overly happy or positive), and around people I was very shy, I wouldn't talk to someone unless spoken to for example. That changed mid-way through high school, as I was more open and talkative, but still a bit conservative on how much I speak. 

Now, I'm a lot more pessimistic (still realistic), and it feels as if my creativity has been curbed and/or locked away. Whenever I make a decision I obviously way both sides but the more depressing side of myself comes out. I can't see the happy side to anything if it involves myself and my situation, and sometimes it feels like I'm arguing with another me. Please, do not confuse this with me having a split personality, I'm a big fan of metaphors and analogies and this is the easiest way for me to describe how I think. I'm still extremely open and talkative, that hasn't changed, actually if anything that's the only thing that has improved or increased. 

Physically, my body has been through a huge decline. I was born with Achilles Tendinitis, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (Syndrome?), High Arches, and with Severe Asthma which didn't develop until I was 8. Throughout the years, I've had mononucleosis, scoliosis, and most likely an iron deficiency (haven't been diagnosed yet). Until about 2013 or 2014 I was in and out of hospitals and doctor's offices because my immune system was incredibly weak and I would always be sick or be having an asthma attack all the time. 

Currently, my asthma is to the point where I have to be on a treatment about every \~5 hours, which makes sleeping difficult as well. I'm on about 4 or 5 treatments of Albuterol with my Nebulizer each day. I also have a lot of trouble standing or walking for extended amounts of time. My tendons start to hurt as well as my spine feels as if it goes numb and I cannot stand after about 30 or so minutes. I can walk for a bit, but after 3-5 hours I'm stuck in bed for a day or two and can't really get up. The final portion of this is the CMT. I *now* have a much harder time feeling the cold, whereas a few years ago I couldn't breathe at all if it was below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, I can walk outside in \~10 degree weather with a tank and shorts on and have no issues. I've always had a hard time feeling the heat, but I also have a tough time feeling external pain. For example, I can be kicked in the testicles and not feel it (yes, it sadly happened) but if my spleen is swollen (has happened as well) it'll hurt. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Onto the situation that started this downfall. On September 17th, 2015 (or the 25th depends who you ask), my father had gone into cardiac arrest and was clinically brain dead (unbeknownst to us, myself and my mother). He was our only source of income, working two jobs almost every day, as well as the only one in my immediate family who has a license (more about this later). After his passing was my 20th birthday. The following week my dog passed away. Great timing, right? A few months later my girlfriend had left me, because of things that aren't really in our control and I would not like to get into on here. All of this is hitting me so hard, and to top it off, my mother and I hadn't received my father's pension for *over a year*. We survived with the help of friends (not family, they told us to F off), and by selling our car (not my choice), and somewhere in the middle of that we had received a few thousand (I can't remember exactly) from someone. 

Come September 2016, my mother and I are starving. I'm down to eating once every three days and drinking once every 4 or 5 days (I refuse to drink tap water, yea I know I'm stubborn). This continues until about the end of November or early December when we finally receive $250,000 from my father's pension.  We were so excited to start LIVING again! But that's not what happened...

My mother has very little sense of responsibility, and doesn't do anything that requires effort. Now, I do NOT want to make my mother look like a terrible person. She is actually a wonderful woman who does indeed love me very much, and she has her moments where she even surprises me and is very uncharacteristically responsible and *smart.* She has to deal with a lot of stress now, especially since she lost the only person who kept her grounded for the last 20+ years (they've known each other for roughly 40+). I completely understand how her mind works in stressful situations like this and I understand, I just hope everyone reading this understands too. 

So, back to describing this. We had $250,000 and we could have done ANYTHING with it. Currently, I live in a trailer park, er sorry ""manufactured home park"". We could have moved away from here, found somewhere nice and cheap and started over. I live in a very expensive state, i.e. our rent for a single wide broken down trailer is almost $1000 a month. My mother did not want to move, until I told her that my friend was willing to give us $50,000 to help move and so he can get away from his parents who were stealing his money from his recently won lawsuit. My mother agreed, but when I told her where I was looking she denied. It was one state over and it was decently cheaper EVERYWHERE plus I know a ton of people in that state. She said she didn't want to leave her friends and that was that. 

The money was then spent on so much useless stuff. I will admit, I used some, SOME, of the money. But I used it to help my friends out who didn't have money. Before anyone asks, they didn't use me for the money, we're still all good friends to this day, we're just broke.  My mother, as mentioned before, sold my father's car for, I think, $75-$175. She also bugged me about buying a new dog, which I told her to wait. She proceeded to wait a week or two and come home with a $500 dog (turns out it was really $800). This dog then received more clothing and food and toys then I think I have even seen in my life. Thousands were spent on this dog. After this, my mother bought a car (roughly $900) to ""encourage"" her to get her license. She did indeed try to get it, but the woman at our local DMV said my mother's papers were faked, even though they're not. They are from the 1960's and typed in a cursive font which this woman couldn't read. She stopped trying after that and sold the car (nowhere close to how much she bought it for). 

To end this section, she spent money on so many useless things for me, the dog, and herself. Things I never asked for and things we did not need. I don't want to go into so much detail here since it was almost 5 years of this. Let's just say Dunkin Donuts became breakfast, lunch, and dinner for a long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I know one question many of you will have, where is your job? Why aren't you working? I tried getting a job since I was 16 and everyone refused to hire me. I finally got one working at Gamestop in 2018, it was completely luck. I worked there for about 5 or 6 months before I quit due to the fact that I had to pay $160 a month for a cab to get there, and was only making $80 a month. After every shift I was stuck in bed for a day or two because of my back and legs, and I would have tons of asthma attacks. Safe to say, my body couldn't handle standing there for so long. I had told my mother that I wanted to quit and instead of supporting me and pushing me to keep trying she told me I should, and proceeded to tell me that I shouldn't have quit a month later. I know it's a lot of me to ask for support, but I have no one at this point besides friends in another state. I have NO ONE here and it's really hard to stay positive when the only person in your life is a mother who doesn't listen to a word you say. As for finding another job, I have no means of transportation and my health isn't in a good state for me to even be outside. 

So, she doesn't listen to anything I say. I've tried moving multiple times (I can't leave her, she can't support herself) and I keep trying to help her financially, but of course I'm the son so she knows what's best. It's to the point where I can't even help her clean the house (it needs it badly) because I'm a ""dictator"" due to the way I do things, i.e. trying to not take breaks and get the work done in full and not a tiny bit and postpone until next week like she does. We fight all the time because I'm trying to fix our situation but she is just thinking of now, and not tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a bit due to my lack of memory, will edit when I remember, we have no money. We're broke. My mother argues with me about anything and everything; cleaning, laundry, groceries, etc. I'm always wrong, no matter what I say. She doesn't want to hear anything, it's to the point where when I describe why I can't work she doesn't believe me thinking I'm faking or that since she has medical problems too, that since she can do things I can too because she is in more pain than I am. 

Here are a quick list of my problems:

1. I can't work due to my health.
2. I can't work because I have no transportation.
3. I can't obtain my license due to state laws requiring a driver of 3 years to be present when driving with a permit (no one I know has a car).
4. I can't go to a hospital because I do not have the money for the various amounts of things I need like Medicine, Lungs Pumped, even appointments and tests. 
5. Because of #4 I can't prove I have CMT to acquire Disability to help out
6. Apparently, Medicaid (Medicare?) is too expensive for me as one of them told me in the hospital.
7. My environment isn't clean enough to eat healthy (mother argues with this too)
8. I can't exercise due to the insanely small amount of room I have and I cant go outside because of allergies/asthma. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? The first thing I always thought to do was get my license, but without a car it's a bit pointless, let alone I can't even do it LEGALLY. I keep trying to talk to my mother about everything but she doesn't understand anything I say and always thinks she is right. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I forgot a bunch, hence what the fast forward was about, I lost my train of thought and I will edit this soon. I just want to know what everyone thinks. I would also appreciate it if this can not be put onto a Youtube video or shared or whatever. I don't want this to somehow go viral or something. Maybe I'm a bit paranoid.",12Sep2019,1
9,"Just venting here, but as the holiday seasons are just around the corner, I can’t help but think back on all the good memories of what once was my life- a happy family, ready to get settled down, buy a house and watch our son grow up- we were so close to achieving that dream. 

Last year around this time my girlfriend of 6 years and I decided we had grown apart from each other and we’re just not happy together anymore. We thought it’s best for our 1 year old son to grow up with happy, and separated parents over unhappy parents who fought all the time. We are both co parenting now and are still good friends, we even still talk every now and then about how we are feeling and how we’re both going to transition from lovers to friends.

Last month my son’s mother has decided to move them to LA because she has family there and wants a new start. She hated the Midwest, while I loved it here. It’s been the best place I’ve ever lived. I’m 25, have a great job, make 70k/yr and am ready to buy a house and get settled down for my son. I’m torn because I’m not sure if I should relocate my life as well and throw away everything I’ve worked so hard for. I know I want to be there for my son and be in his life growing up, but this has honestly been the toughest decision I’ve had to make. I make enough to visit him every other week but I just don’t think it’s fair. She’s not making me pay child support because legally she can’t since she’s the one moving away, but I promised her I’ll still pay her a monthly allowance anyway since she’ll mainly be raising our son by herself.

This time, though, it's lasting a long while feeling like I just don't want to spend my life with him. He spends money on things he doesn't need and never dresses up nice and he's so awkward and kinda gross and I don't like his humor most of the time and he has some views that totally conflict with mine and we never can talk about feelings properly. And he never lets go of things that bother him, which is the only thing we've ever fought about but when we did it was several times and very repetitive and viciously worded. But I've gotten so invested in this relationship and the sex is good and he's a good kisser and I like when we're alone or texting at night.

Online it says to stop &amp; rest when you feel pain but I won't get my points for the day if I don't do my mile. I also have anxiety so I haven't told my gym teacher about this. I just keep walking even though it hurts &amp; it takes me the whole period to do my mile because I'm walking slow.

Is there some way to fix this without telling my teacher or should I just suck it up &amp; tell her?",12Sep2019,0
21," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

22,"I started talking to this guy in May, we hung out for hours each time we were together and it was so natural. We hooked up and I had to leave a few weeks later to go back home for the summer. I’d never opened up to being with someone romantically and I enjoy being friends with people instead usually.

We continued texting everyday and FaceTiming every weekend. Things he would usually initiate because I was nervous about being too comfortable over the phone. I started initiating the more I got comfortable to the idea that he actually liked me. Without asking for clarification on what was happening, he told me he wanted to date me when I got back. That he wanted me to be his girlfriend and wake up next to me. I melted. He said all the right things.

Come a month before I go back and he doesn’t answer that quickly. You notice when it takes someone 6 hours to answer you. Even when they’re busy. You notice when they open it 2 days later and it hurts. People are busy but you notice the difference in tone and conversation But people get busy and life. I messaged him the day before getting back on campus. I asked if I would see him around and he said” I’ll be busy and tired but I’ll be around.” Intense toneshift. I asked how he was feeling about continuing to talk and he said that it was “prolly best to just be friends. I’m really busy and working through my mental health”. I get that. I told him to take care and that I appreciated him letting me know. 

Flashforward 2 days later. I see him and he asks how I am. He sits down and talks with me and I am happy and upset about it. After a week of seeing him all the time I started to take different routes to get to class, I started avoiding the cafe at times I’d usually see him and I keep running into him. I smile and maybe give him a short greeting because when I see him my body shakes, and heats up and I feel happy. But seeing him is really starting to get my mood down. I am kind and at this point I want to be friendly and acknowledge him when I see him but I also don’t want to seem desperate. I just spent a lot of time talking with him and genuinely like him as a person. “No contact”is really difficult right now because I go to a small school and I do see him a lot. I’ve been trying to avoid him. I don’t want to be cold shouldered because it doesn’t feel genuine to who I am but I also can’t stop thinking about him after I see him. And when I hear his voice my ears perk up. 

My question is how do you get space to get over someone you have to see everyday. I want to acknowledge him because I care about him and respect him but I also leave the interactions feeling really lonely and sad. Should I act the same way I did before we started talking or just treat him like any other friend?",12Sep2019,1
24,"Some background info, I’m in high school and I’ve been working at my first job for about two months. It’s been pretty good, my coworkers are all cool but the bosses aren’t the best. Recently my friend got hired at another food place about 10 min from me. He says it’s been a blast working there so far and the bosses are really cool. Also, 3 of my other really good friends work there too. Both pay the same, and my current job is only 5 min closer. I would be sad to say goodbye to my current coworkers but it seems like it would be really fun to work where my friends are. It feels like I could regret either choice, what should I do?",12Sep2019,1
25,"I know this may be a long post, and if you do chose to read through it all, thank you - I truly appreciate your time. I've searched endlessly for something to help my emotional state, for someone to talk to, and I've come up short over and over. Hopefully Reddit can be the friend I need.  

A bit of necessary context to the post is that I'm in a long distance relationship. Before I met my SO, I was a miserable person and when she came into my life she made things incredible. I met her online, our relationship blossomed despite us living on different continents, and we've been together for almost 3 years. 

She's recently been to visit me and we've had three incredible months together. When she is here, we're happy as can be and are joined at the hip. However, the catch with any long distance relationship is, eventually you and your SO have to go your separate ways. That time is upon us now and I have just a few hours left with her. Just as I always do when she has to leave, I'm falling apart and breaking down in a really unhealthy way. This is the fifth time we've visited each other in person, and saying goodbye seems to get more difficult each time. 

I wouldn't go to the effort of writing this post if my symptoms were mild. I'm afraid to tell my friends and family the true extent of how much I suffer after she leaves. I experience regular suicidal thoughts, I struggle with forgetfulness and a 'foggy' mind, I lose all motivation to do anything - to the point where I won't even leave my bed to feed myself and I begin to struggle with insomnia. TLDR;  I become a shell of a human. And I really want to find a way out. The worst part is, my symptoms don't necessarily fade away, they just occur with less regularity. This means I continue to experience these symptoms until she's back. Video calling her regularly really helps, but I'll still find myself suddenly sobbing in the grocery store or at the train station, and the nights are never easy.

I don't want to sound melodramatic, this is genuinely how I feel. And in the rare instances that I do achieve some form of self-awareness, my own state really frightens me. 

Any advice or even thoughts would be truly appreciated.",12Sep2019,1

I need advice

I am decided that the only option for me is to go to my own thing professionally :  Work for myself and eventually build a business. This is what I know I can do. All other options will leave me dead inside a little bit.

So I am decided, but… I need to change. I can’t fail and I don’t want to fail at it. I need to care about whatever I’ll be building cause I will get very unmotivated if I don’t and I will do the bare minimum. It might work, but meh. It is not for money I want to build a business, it’s because that is who I am: an entrepreneur, a developer of system that develop people, a person with a vision. I got some big weaknesses however for the moment. And I scare myself.

What if I don’t stick to my plan? I can build a good plan but the following through is not easy for me. I rarely succeed at that. I mean I can’t even think ‘’ ok I go for a 15 minutes walk and then go home’’ and respect it. I have to walk for 2 more hours and lose all my night. (that was just an example).

I can be lunatic. I don’t think it will be dramatic in the sense that I still take care of my stuff, but sometimes it’s hard to focus on work.

What if during the first two years of the business I don’t actually put in the work? What if I get so unorganized that I never know what to do and end up not working? I would just be waisting time and money.

If the solution is to have a business partner I can trust, how do I find them?

What if I fail? What if I succeed?

What if I never find the motivation to manage employee? What if I never find the motivation to do anything?

How will I stay structured? I’ve never been organized before. The only way I can stay organized is to follow someone else system.

How will I deal with stress?

How will I manage everything?

I know I’m able of all of that, but I’m afraid the lazy me with low self-esteem and some psychological patterns will stop me in my advancement and my success.

What if I don’t have the time to do everything and what if, once again, I over-charge my schedule and end up doing nothing because of stress? Because just a bit will never be enough for me?

I have no structure and don’t know where to start. Sometimes that’s why I think I still need a job: to develop structure and learn to manage employees (which is not that easy). I am for the first time in a managerial position and that's what I'm discovering : employees are not easy to manage. 

But my mind and my heart is definitely somewhere else and I know I’ll never put my soul into someone else business. I just can’t. it’s stronger than me. I’m a robot when at work and that’s all. I enjoy customer service when there is something special, but that’s all.",12Sep2019,1
28,"So...... My grandma has a cold (possibly mild flu). She's in her mid 70's, strong old bird, love her to the ends of the earth, and we have a great mutually respectful and loving relationship. Events yesterday are as follows:

Mum calls me, says grandma's unwell, can you check on them. I should say now that mum lives far far away, and I am one of three grand children in the same city. However my brother is working on site right now. And my cousin and mum don't really talk. 

I think.... Um.... ok I'll call. Thinking she's fine. I call her after work, grandpa's not home, she sounds a bit horse, coughing only a couple of times in a 20+min phonecall, not really sniffling. I ask if it's OK to visit, she says no and that she's fine, and not to come over because she doesn't want me to catch anything. I respect that, she says she's fine.

I get a call from mum in the evening to ask how grandma is, I said I called and she seemed fine, just sounded like a sore throat and the sniffles.

Now my mum is never angry (worries constantly) , but my lord she just through silent disappointment down the phone. She says that she had something similar last week when they visited and that she had a fever and basically she's just worried that grandma is putting on a brave face. Im nodding along thinking, grandma is a grown, sane woman, surely we respect her point of view. 

Anyway, out of respect for my mum, I suggest that she'll call tomorrow, that I'll drop by if she's still worried. At this point mum hadn't called. 

I tell this story to my SO, saying that I love my mum but she worries too much and that she needs to respect my grandma's assessment of her own health. She's never given cause for concern before. And I threw up the phrase ""my body my choice"" as in, grandma says she doesn't need to see a doctor or be checked on, then she doesn't.

My SO said that point of view is very selfish and that ""putting yourself in harms way is selfish to people around you"" and all that, citing suicide as well. My general opinion however is that a person's assessment of their own lives and how things effect them should be respected most. How it effects other people should be considered, but not more important.

I have the feeling too that my mum would agree with my SO. And I am aware that I can have very..... Out there opinions, possible ASD.

I've always had this relationship with my grandma that we respect each other very much, even though we have very little in common. I love her so much for that. 

But am I being selfish by...... Not pushing her to do something she doesn't feel needs doing? It's not that she can't be bothered, she says she's fine. I've never dealt with elderly relatives needing taking care of before.... Looking for some advice :) 

TLDR grandma's a bit unwell. mums worried that grandma's not taking care of herself. After calling grandma myself, I disagree and take grandma at her word. Am I selfish for taking her at her word and not pushing her to see a doctor?",12Sep2019,1

30,"I want to get in shape and I have been trying but not enough. I have joined the gym at least two times and those two times only last like a few weeks and then I just drop out and same thing is happening right now, I decided to join the gym after many months later and I started doing well for the first three weeks and a half, but then I just gave up on that. I really want to be in shape but for me I don’t know why it’s so complicated to be motivated, most of the time I’m always tired to go to the gym, I know that I have to push through but I guess some days are just more difficult than others. I have also have tried a lot of times to start a diet and same as the gym it only lasts a few weeks and then I just go back to my old habits of eating unhealthy foods. And even though I see good results when I do diet and go to the gym somehow I just give up.

So I just need some advice from people that have been through this, what made you get up and say “I’m doing this”?",12Sep2019,1

32,"So long story short, my boyfriend of around 7 months broke up with me a couple days ago. He pretty much said that he didn't feel that he could stay in the relationship right now because he is very confused and is trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life. He also said that our plans in life don't align so he thinks it's for the best that we not be a couple anymore.

However, we didn't really cleanly end the relationship. He kept saying he didn't want to actually break up because he sees that as not talking to each other or not seeing each other and he said that he didn't completely want me out of his life. So basically the conversation never really came to a complete close. I told him he had to make a decision and he ended up saying then maybe we should break up, but also he said he would want to talk about things again later.

At this point, I do see that it is probably for the best that we not be together as if what he said is really how he feels, that he can't see himself marrying me and he doesn't know if he even wants a relationship right now, then it is probably better that he have some time to himself. I didn't exactly say everything that I wanted to him and I feel that now that I have had time to contemplate and think about the situation I just want to be able to fully close this chapter with him and feel that talking to him one more time might be helpful.

I am not looking to beg for him back; I just want to sit down with him, tell him that I support whatever decision he wants to make and most importantly, if he still wants to have a friendship or some sort of relationship that I would be open because I don't think that came across when we first talked. He said he still wanted me in his life and so do I but I was so taken by surprise that I think I went a little more on the defense than I should have.

Basically what i'm asking is, should I talk to him one more time just to hash everything out and fully close this chapter? I just feel like we didn't solidly end the relationship like we could have and if he still wants me in his life I want him to know that I want that too.",12Sep2019,1

I have this gym teacher in high school school teaching my gym class who is young, (30 I think) and she teaches physical education and English. She is a pretty cool teacher and nice. We will be about to do the swimming unit. When she was describing what stuff you need to bring she mentioned to the boys in the class that with the boys not wearing shirts in front of her she can see how you really look and how fit you really are so they will have to work harder than the females. the comment doesn't bother me in the slightest , but if some kid who was around me decides to go cry about it, will she get in trouble? I talked to a friend of mine about it (who wasn't there) and he says it is wrong and she should get in trouble but I don't see why, I talked to another person and they said this was out of line and should be reported If she was actually doing anything then I would agree. I am not going to say anything, she is a really good and nice teacher and I will not get her in trouble. Would you feel uncomfortable by this comment? Some people might say it is an encouraging comment. In fact most people laughed at the comment. even if she does get in trouble, should she really",12Sep2019,1

40,"So I’ve had this friend for a while, almost 2 years now, and at the beginning of our friendship we did fool around a bit. We stopped talking after a while because one of his old friends convinced him I was too good for him and he should settle for less (hence why we never had time to officially date). And after that I got into an abusive relationship where I wasn’t allowed to talk to him. But after a while we started back hanging out and he would sometimes talk about his girlfriend. Or more so how she would lie to his face, ignore him for between 6 hours- a week at a time but whenever he would bring it up she would say she doesn’t know what she’s doing wrong. 
We did talk a few times and he has dated he really liked me but because they’ve been dating for almost 10 months, he doesn’t know how to or what to do. 
He’ll ask me for advice but I don’t want to say “break up with the hoe” because it would probably make me sound jealous because he knows I like him back. 
I’m probably overthinking this because sometimes I wonder if he thinks about something similar to this or if it’s just me.

I have small breasts even though I'm chubby (I gain most my weight in my stomach &amp; thighs), my breasts arent propionate with my body and I have a very wide back too. I have never been able to fit a bra because my back is too wide yet my cup size is too small, I always have to wear a padded sports bra if I want to look like I have some breast tissue, I have a slight pigeon shaped chest and my clothes always fit super annoyingly (baggy breast area, fitted everywhere else). 

I'm very confident with my face, personality and style of dress etc, but am terribly insecure about my body. I am currently losing weight, eating healthy and about to incorporate an exercise routine again but with all of this I will continue to be majorly insecure about my figure. 

For my teeth, they are crooked and crowded quite badly but nothing too severe. I have needed braces since being child but my parents couldnt afford them and I will need to get them sooner or later in life. 

My boob job will be $11,000 and braces around the same cost. I will be saving to finance a majority of the cost through during the next 12 months and then take out a small loan (B.A) or payment plan (braces) for the rest of the payment.

I just can't figure it out.  ADHD is a huge factor in all of this but I'm also just naturally stupid and make all the wrong decisions.  I can't hold down a job.  I can't stick to routines or to-do lists or do anything an adult should be able to do.  I haven't had a job in over a year, and the only jobs I do get I fail miserably at.

I can't drive.  Hell I don't even know if I want to since I bet I'll get distracted and cause an accident every time I try.  I expect I'll get honked at hundreds of times each time I get behind the wheel.  Everyone says it's so easy but they haven't met me.   They don't have the brain I do.  I don't even know if it's ADHD anymore or just the result of head injuries.  I can't even get in to see a neurologist to know for sure.  I want a brain scan so I can get some clarity but that'll never happen.

I was on my city's version of social assistance (welfare) for the past year but was declared ineligible because I've made absolutely no progress in my life for so long.  That's understandable.  

On top of all of that I haven't had a date or even a girl interested in me for like 8 years.  Or if they are, one conversation with me wipes that out completely.  I'm not unattractive to look at (I don't think), but my personality is just non-existent.  Adults want to date adults, not salty man-children.  

My lease is up in under 3 weeks and I don't know what I'm going to do or where I'm going to live.  I hate myself for being so stupid and unable to do the simplest tasks.  I'm so tired of feeling like this and being so inadequate.  I feel like my mental capabilities never progressed past 12 years old and I'm just destined to live the rest of my life sad and having achieved absolutely nothing.

I don't even know where to begin.  I can't function in society.  I avoid other people because every time I get involved in someone's life I just ruin everything.  Nothing good comes from me trying to do things.

I have no idea where to start or how do improve on who I am.  I have no self confidence and would probably be classified as clinically depressed.  Most nights before I go to sleep I find myself on the verge of tears because I just feel so powerless to change anything.

I'll be okay due to savings and so on.... but this is a healthcare non-profit that generates 2 mill in revenue per year per public data.

57,"First let me explain the reason as to why I would even think of a GoFundMe. I feel very trashy about it because my situation is not as bad as other people's. 

Currently I'm a college student in my first semester of a freshman year (though I'm a sophomore by credit hours). I suffer from debilitating panic disorder and have in diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I am asocial, and I'm always carrying around a humongous amount of anxiety with me. everywhere and anywhere I could collapse from an anxiety or panic attack.

The last semester of my high school year, I ended up having heart attack. My panic disorder had completely taken away everything from me, butbut I toughened up and was able to get through it thanks to the loving help of my family and my lovely dog Shiki.

No I am in college and in a whole other state from my family, my anxiety has been eating away at me. I am with student disability services and was recommended an Emotional support animal to help me cope. My dog Shiki was stolen for me before my graduation, and that truly broke me.

Now, the reason I am evening thinking of a GoFundMe is to be able to raise money so I can legally get a support animal that I could give a loving home to and that could help me when my anxiety and depression begin to kill me from inside. I'm not looking for a replacement for my old dog, she'll always be with me, but I know that this would be beneficial for me and hopefully the dog.

I was told that the process to get a legal service dog would require I go in for psychological evaluations and have to present myself in court with the minimum fee for everything being around $900. 

I'm trying everything, I work a job for the Newspaper, I take five classes to be able to maintain scholarships, but no matter what I can't reach that money goal.

58," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",12Sep2019,0
59,"My coworker (I’ll call her Camille) messaged me and a few other coworkers a week ago announcing she got a new dog. But I’m pretty sure she shouldn’t have this dog at all.

She says she went on a trip with her partner to a city about 4-5 hrs. away, and found a dog tied to a bench along a river park. She says there were a bunch of “drunk people” on the other side of the river, but didn’t mention if she thought this dog belonged to them or not.

She claims the dog must have been abandoned, and she took the dog home when they left that day. She’s named the dog and says she’s adopted it, and keeps referring to it as a “rescue.”

The dog was well groomed, pretty young, doesn’t have any apparent health issues, and is a somewhat sought after breed.

I don’t think that dog was abandoned. I think someone in that group of “drunk people”made a poor choice tying the dog up while they had fun with friends. I think Camille should’ve known that dog was not abandoned. And I don’t think she should’ve driven the dog 4+ hours away to keep it instead of alerting the nearest humane society.

Now, she’s thinking of trying to “re-home” the dog because it nipped at one of her kids. I wouldn’t be surprised if she ends up selling this dog for cash.

I’m a dog owner and wouldn’t put my dog in that situation, but I would be devastated if someone took my dog away from me under the guise of ‘saving’ it. Especially if it got sold to another person afterwards.

My other coworkers are incredibly distressed about the situation as well, as is my own partner.

The Victim in this situation is F 15

Saturday evening my uncle was in town. I’m a Brit living in America, so my parents let me have a couple beers with him (I think I had 3) I went over to the house of a a friend of mine. She’s been one of my best friends since I was in middle school. 

During that evening, one of the Friends of my friend and I made out for a while and between the times for about eleven and four AM, I touched that girls chest. Under the bra. Without her consent.

 Now I didn’t know that I didn’t have consent until today, when I just had this gut feeling of terror like I’d done something wrong. I talked with my friend and told her the whole story, and just to check if I had in fact not gotten consent.

I didn’t.

As soon as I got that message I threw up in disgust at myself. It’s the first time that I’ve flat out thought about killing myself. I have become the very thing that I was taught not to. The countless conversations with my parents about consent. I am a monster

I already know that she doesn’t blame me. That it was “the heat of the moment.” According to her.
However I’m not going to put her in any more uncomfortable situations. I’m going to leave her alone after writing a two page essay apologizing. 

I just need some advice on what to do here.",12Sep2019,0
69,"I need some help. I am a senior international student currently beginning my college applications. Ever since I was young, my parents ingrained in me that I need to apply to Ivy Leagues. I was fine with this and loved the idea of the prestige of these schools, but in the back of my head, I never thought they would force me. However, as I've gotten older, my parents have become increasingly controlling about where I can apply and what I can study.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger, I decided I wanted to go into finance. My mother heavily discouraged that, telling me that it was a ""man's world"" and I'd never fit in. Despite her protests, I continued to pursue business-related extracurriculars into high school. Then, in grade 9, I joined a program that introduced me to the wonderful world of technology, and I decided that was where I wanted to go. I was shy then and didn't make a name for myself within the program (as compared to the confident 17-18 year-olds within it) so my dad insisted I quit and never return (I specifically remember him calling me ""chickenshit"" after the final concluding meeting of this program, where some students showcased what they had learned; since I wasn't one of them, I was worthless in his eyes). I decided to abandon the tech field and never look back. In grade 11, I became interested in medicine and decided that was what I wanted to pursue. I laid out a plan for myself to apply to university programs within my country, when, towards the end of my junior year, my parents remembered their dream for me: to go to the US. To fulfill this, they attempted to steer me away from looking at medicine, discouraging me by telling me horror stories about doctors with no lives and lots of trauma and stress from their jobs. They are now attempting to force me into business and economics, fields I was initially interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

This controlling behavior has finally culminated in my college applications. My parents are dead-set on forcing me to apply to certain schools, their favorite of which is MIT. This summer, they even took me away from the internship I was working at for 3 days with no notice just to go see MIT. When I was there, I said that it seemed like a great school, and it would be cool to go there. However, I didn't actually want to go there. MIT, in my mind, has become a manifestation of every unfulfilled dream of my controlling parents, and now they are trying to force it on me. I am an above-average student in terms of grades, and most of my teachers see me as quiet and responsible. However, I know I am not MIT material. My parents hired a college consultant to help me apply to MIT and even he said this. My extracurriculars are scattered, and only a few are things that I have committed to long-term. This is because every time I irritated my parents (usually through stupid arguments about teenage things, like going out with friends or having them not look through my phone, trash, etc.) they took their ""revenge"" by forcing me to drop out of extracurriculars. These ECs are not impressive enough to carry me into a school like MIT, and my standardized test scores are not that high (low 1500s for SATs). I am not even interested in a school like MIT, and I explained this to my parents. It is not worth the extra effort I have to put in to apply to a school that I DO NOT want to go to. This has infuriated my parents, and as a result, my mom has given me an ultimatum: if I do not apply to MIT, she will not let me apply to any universities.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I am so sick and tired of my parents' behavior. Many people will just say to ""apply to appease me parents"" but I know my parents, and if I apply now when I don't get in, they will blame me for it, by accusing me of throwing the application. There is a very solid chance that when I don't get in, I won't be allowed to go to any school but my local university (my mother has said this before, and even though I haven't even started applying to universities, she spends every other day crying about how I'm going to leave her, and how she will only let me go to our local university so she can keep me at home under her watch).

Teach left the room and a student uproar started trying to figure out who passed with one student in particular saying who passed?

I'm 26 and working in a dead end office job making $36K a year. I have a college degree from a top ranking public state university. I'm by no means stupid - I obtained multiple majors/minors in 4 years, learned programming on my own, speak 3 languages fluently, yada yada. I'm a nerd. I listen to Planet Money, Radiolab, and other educational podcasts daily. I read the news every day and force myself to improve every single day. I don't say this to show off - quite the opposite, I see lots of my peers continuing on to masters programs and PhD programs and gaining even more knowledge and expertise. I see my peers doing so much more than me and I feel as if I'm inferior and falling behind because I haven't improved as much since graduating college. When you're standing still as the whole world charges forward, you fall behind

I have lost motivation and have no driving force in life. I don't have a girlfriend or kids - if I did, I'm sure I'd be a lot more motivated to do better so I can take care of them and provide them a good life. But it's just me. Alone and living by myself with not much to live for. I'm not suicidal for those of you wondering, it's just I don't feel like I'm living. ""Surviving"" would probably be a more accurate term to describe my existence

Logically I know what I must do to improve my life - study and gain the in-demand skills necessary to obtain a high paying job like my peers. I need to be less shy and more social - I already am a lot more social now than I was 3 years ago, but I know I have room for improvement. Yet that logical determination isn't translating to action for me anymore because I feel my existence is pointless. So what if I save up money or have a high paying job? It's not like I'll suddenly have something to spend money on

Being a student was easy - you had a clear direction and your end-goal was that degree, which you obtained by studying, doing homework, passing exams, etc. What is the end-goal of life in general?

80,"For context, I'm a high school student. 

Next semester, I have a drawing class that I really want to switch out of. When creating my schedule at the end of last year, I chose the drawing class, and I chose a painting class as an alternate in case the drawing class filled up. I would much rather switch into the guitar class that they offer at my school, because I want a career in music and don't really have any interest in doing visual art, not even as a hobby. I just really don't want to be in the drawing class that I'm signed up for next semester. 

I told my friend that I was planning on switching the drawing class to guitar, and then we realized that we were both signed up for the same drawing class for the same hour. That would mean that we would also have the same lunch schedule next semester. Then she told me not to switch out because if I did, she wouldn't know anyone in her class or in her lunch. She told me to check my schedule online when I got home to make sure that I was put into the drawing class and not painting. Then she told me that if I ended up in drawing, not to switch out. It caught me off guard. It wasn't like her. She never says controlling shit like that. But... I guess today she decided to. She didn't say it aggressively, just more in a pleading way, like, ""pLeAsE don't switch out, I'll be aLoNE,"" which made me feel kind of guilty.

When I checked my schedule, to my dismay I ended up in the drawing class. I'm still planning on switching out. I just have no interest in that class whatsoever. I'm not going to waste a semester in a class I don't want to be in just to hang out with my friend. But I also don't want to start an argument with my friend over this. She's my best friend who I've known for years. We never fight. This would be a stupid thing to fight about.

I could tell her that I ended up in painting instead of drawing. But then she would ask who my teacher is so she can check the lunch schedule and see if we would have the same lunch. I have no idea who teaches painting. And there are so many art teachers at my school that I don't think I could make an accurate guess. Then she would know I was bullshitting her. And I don't want to lie to her. But If I told her the truth, that I ended up in drawing and am switching out anyway, that could start shit.

84,"So what does Reddit suggest to a senior at university who hates their education path and wants to drop out instead of finishing one more year? 

The past three years, I've sat here hating everything I've been doing educationally, and fully knowing it and even addressing it, but still doing nothing about it. So naturally, here I am, in my last year, 12 credits shy of completing my degree, and wanting to drop out and not even finish it. Most of my friends never want to leave college, and I just can't wait to be done. It's a shame honestly. I've known for so long that this path wasn't what I was meant to be on. But I've dug myself a hole here, and I don't know how to get out except to keep digging it deeper. 

I know that there's some statistic out there that claims that somewhere around 1/3 of college graduates actually have a job in the field of their degree, but the dilemma I face is the hatred of waking up every day and going to the courses I'm enrolled in and doing the lab and field work that I should be loving, but absolutely hating. Something which I've already done for my three previous years.

I've looked into changing my field of study to something that is either easier, or is more interesting to me, however I've quite frankly passed the point where I can reasonably switch to another discipline without adding time to my stay at this lovely university I attend. 

Has anyone else fallen into the same pit that I'm currently in? How did you make it out?

For now I'm going to keep digging my pit, but maybe someone has a ladder they can lend me?",12Sep2019,1
86,"this is a long and heavy topic for me to talk about but i hope you’ll help me. 

okay so about 3-4 months ago i found out i was pregnant (even though i was on birth control at the time) with an exes baby. now i NEVER wanted to have kids of my own and if i had the means to do so then i would have had my tubes tied last year. having said that i truly tried to consider keeping the baby but i was both mentally and physically unhealthy, having taken that into account i decided it would be the best decision for my life to go through with an abortion. when i finally got around a week or so later to telling my parents i was met with absolute refusal. (my dad is religious and my mom, though having done one in the past, is now against abortion completely.) i was told that my dad wouldn’t talk to me anymore if i went through with it. and i was scared i might be kicked out for my decision even though i was told i could stay as long as i was in college. my mother told me abortion was off the table no matter what and, being scared of homelessness, i caved and kept the baby. i planned to just do adoption if having to carry was my only option at this point. i’m just at 5 months now and my mental health has decreased so drastically. i constantly have dreams of miscarriage and dead babies and i cry constantly on the phone to my sister and alone because of how badly this pregnancy is affecting me. it’s gotten to a point now where i am beginning to actually hate the child that is growing inside of me and i have become aggressive in the way i speak of him to my sister. and in recent weeks i have started having very intrusive suicidal thoughts suggesting that i just off myself so that no one gets to have the baby. now i don’t have the urges yet to physically do something but just having the thoughts there is terrifying to me and my sister who might also become suicidal (she has a lot of mental health issues and has attempted in the past) because of how much value she puts my presence into her life. I know that i could still get an abortion if i wanted to and i do only because i fear for what could happen to me if i keep it and let these “thoughts” sit for too long, but i don’t want to lose my parents respect and my home. so if you’ve read this far i just wanna ask what i should do? i want to try and confront my mother about all this but i’m not sure how to go about it. please any advice would be appreciated.",12Sep2019,5

88,"I recently watched the movie The Endless. And it occured to me that all the things happening to me are happening because I am stuck in a time loop. I actually remember committing suicide in one of the loops, but I am still here so it didn't break the loop. I don't very well remember writing this post in the previous loops so it's a good thing I guess. I know that something has trapped me here so pretty much I am trying to really find out what it wants from me. My best guess is that it wants me to go insane. I have already been told that I won't remember anything from this loop when it resets and that people I see aren't really people. They cannot see and hear but as far as I know it might be another lie I have been told. I also know there are millions like me stuck in their own loops. Well now I actually remembered writing this post and checking it after I wake up to see any responses but they were none or just a few. I know that it's not just a period of time looping but my whole life. Anyway I have also been told that I am not alive so i can not call it life really. I also remember that in one loop I started writing this post and weird things happened so I ended up not posting this. 

My main question is how to get out of a time loop. 

And what would be the entity's purpose on keeping  someone in a time loop. 


At this point I am really pissed of at whatever is keeping me here. It has been messing with my mind. Since a month or so when I wake up I hear a song in my head. I can not stop hearing it. Before that I actually had some breaks or it has not been that apparent. I also see 'demonic' faces flashing before my eyes. It looks kind of like the black circle you see when you have been staring at a light source for some time and after that you look at a wall and you still kind of see the light but its colors are reversed. Since like six months I non stop see flashing colors, like dead pixels on a computer screen. It begun around 2 years ago and at that point it only occurred when i was trying to fall asleep (so with my eyes closed) but now those dead pixels are everywhere I look. And I also have more weird things happening that are harder to explain.

Since you are not human it would help me I think if I knew what do you or the entity want from me. 

I really have no one to really talk about it and I have been searching through reddit and Google to see if I can find something helpful about this topic. 

Pretty much the entity wants me to know that I am in a time loop since it has let me watch the movie and helped me to come with a conclusion that i am stuck here. And as I have already pointed out it has not been the first time I have been writing this post so I have also seen the movie in previous loops (not in the one I killed myself in ofcourse).


Any ideas on this? I am already seeing a psychiatrist and have diagnosed derealisation and depersonalization. But it doesn't explain the dead pixels and the fact that I do know for sure that in one of the time loops I have killed myself. Do you know any other conditions that might have a connection with the things I have been seeing (and hearing also but I didn't mention that).

89,"I have been in what had been a very good relationship with a woman , who’s also 23.

We have been together for 8 months and at the beginning of the relationship it was discussed that she had issues with previous ex's leaving unannounced without closure, as well as her father leaving her and her mother at a young age. I assured her I wasn't planning on doing such a thing. 

Last month, she wanted to talk about how she was feeling a bit vulnerable. We were walking and she squeezed my hand tighter and said she needed to say something. I could feel she was not herself so I assured her I was there to listen if she wanted to talk what was on her mind.
She discussed how at around this time in prior relationships, this was when people would up and leave her without saying a word, I again reassured her that I wouldn't do that and that we were 'on the same page' so to speak.

Come to last week Saturday , she asked if she could come around and I said sure, not realising anything was on her mind/nor had she said anything at this stage.
When she arrived I could tell something was not right, so I asked if everything was alright.
For one week apparently she has felt like we were drifting towards a friendship for a week. she didn’t elaborate more. 

 I feel rather betrayed and hurt. I said I was disappointed but thanked her for telling me.. I reiterated how I felt and it seemed to get through to her, as she then became a bit upset/that it effected her. I told her I loved her and cared about her more than she knew. She looked up and asked almost with confusion if I had just said I loved her? I hadn’t ever said it to her yet as I didn’t want to say it “too soon”. 

Last week Sunday was fathers day, I haven't asked if the feelings of wanting to abandon someone before she gets more attached was there however I can't seem to shake it. Nor do I find it easy to be angry at someone for expressing that they feel something

I'm rather sad by it however. I feel I did my best to show I wanted to work through things.. however at the drop of a hat it has seemed to change…

This situation has thrown me out of the blue. Part of me feels confused as someone who didn’t feel something wouldn’t have broken down so much after I expressed how I felt / wouldn’t have then hugged and not wanted to let go. Let alone just two weeks or so ago say she was feeling vulnerable of someone leaving her. 

I have tried reaching out via text to meet in person and get some form of closure or to ask if this is all linked to her feeling very vulnerable to her fear of me just leaving. According to her meeting in person isn’t a good idea right now but she’s happy to talk via text. 

I’m unsure of what to do.",12Sep2019,1
90,"My mother is a very kind and sweet lady however she has a mindset that I’m going through the “rebellious teenager phase” and she’ll twist anything to fit that agenda. I am actually just a very quiet kid with not much going on and I’m doing just fine but my mom sees that as me “hiding something” or doing something I’m not suppose to. She’ll provoke me so she can use my reaction against me or point out the smallest things like if I decide to take a break from my homework she’ll lecture me about how I need to do it, even though I always finish my homework no matter what and she knows this. She’ll also lecture me even when I’m trying to tell her about a success I had, today I was struggling with a Physics problem and I was able to get an “Ahah!” Moment and I was so proud of myself so I told my mom the story and she said “you need to slow down and stop trying to go so fast and comprehend the problem more” and I know that’s the truth but it’s pretty obvious that I already figured that part out and I she didn’t even give me a good job or anything, just along lecture that boils down to “work harder”, also I’m not the highest level of student and don’t always get All A’s (I rarely do in fact, I usually get A’s and B’s) and when I already know if I get a C this term for Physics she won’t believe me when I say “My teacher said that this was expected and that I will grow it” she’ll just see the C and say “work harder”.

Now all this might just sound like me complaining about a mom who wants to see the most out of her son and I really do appreciate that from her, but when she thinks I’m doing drugs or hiding stuff from her I fell like that our trust is being broken. She knows the type of lowkey and introverted person I am so I don’t know why she believes I would do drugs or skip class

91,"Hey guys,

So a bit of back history. I used to date this girl, we were together off and on for 2-3 years and we broke up 12 years ago. We haven’t talked much or seen much of each other since then, but we do live in the same small town. It was kind of a toxic relationship, arguing, jealousy that’s kind thing. It was a bad break up on both accounts. 

Fast forward 12 years, lots has happened. We are both married, have houses. I have a kid. Today I was on Facebook and seen it was her birthday. So I send her a PM doing so. We chatted for a bit and we kind of got on the subject of the years past. There was a lot of open doors that we not closed after the break up, ie I think we both need some closure on what happened. I am not interested in any side fling or any sort of feelings to flood back so that’s not part of the question I am looking for advice on.

Should I tell me wife that I would like to meet her for a coffee, in an open area of course to have a chat and catch up or should I just leave things as is.",12Sep2019,1
92,"Hello all who read this! As you see in my title I'm asking if I should see a doctor, might seem like a dumb question to have advice on but here is my reasoning.

I am a 22 y/o female, I have really bad brain fog all the time, I'm constantly tired and usually get at least 8 hours of sleep. I am consistently irritable and cranky, nor can I stay focused or I forget what I'm doing. The right side of my lower back is in constant pain so I feel like I'm 60. Also getting out of bed is so hard for me to do. I try to pick up new hobbies but never really have the motivation to follow through, instead I'd rather lay in bed. I work 50-60 hours a week so my days off are normally spent cleaning and it takes me forever to clean my small apartment for lack of motivation.

In the last paragraph I wrote it sounds obvious I should go to a doctor, right? Here's my dilemma, in my experience doctors have shrugged off any issues I have. I'm concerned they're going to give me some dumb reason that isn't going to help me, or put me on anti-depressants which turn majority of people into a zombie. My father took some when I was a small child and explained that it made him not care about anything ever. Which is pretty much where I'm sitting anyway.

Any thoughts on how I should approach a doctor or if I should even see one would be extremely helpful. Thank you in advance!",12Sep2019,1

Met a girl in 9th grade and we became great friends (like best friends), she shows a lot of signs she likes me but doesn’t accept my “love” (I put it in quotations marks since I don’t believe it was true love) confession . We date for the summer and she breaks up with me after summer break ends since we didn’t have the right connection. 

Now after this our friendship began to deteriorate over time and we became less and less close and I’m pretty sure she stared to resent me based off the way her new boyfriend talks to me (me and him used to be best buds so I know that she’s been telling him something) 

Now after the break up I grew more as a person and became a lot more self confident and I was like, “huge mistake but I can’t let it control my life” so she eventually fades out of my brain during the next summer break and I come back to school and I realize “oh no, she rides my bus and gets off at my stop” ( sorry I forgot to mention that part)

So here’s how my bus is, it’s super packed to the point where some people have to sit three to a seat.

I see everyone else driving around town in nice cars that their parents bought them or even just a shitty little car that was passed down (I live in a city where the average income is 100k+). I guess that my main issue is that I can’t help but feel resentful about my own situation every time I’m forced to walk around town, take the bus (runs once an hour), or beg someone for a ride. I’m currently saving up for a car, but it’s really hard with my parents being in an almost constant spiral of unemployment and I feel very unhopeful.

Does anyone have any advice for how I can pull myself out of this rut? I can’t stand the fact that I’m feeling jealous of my own friends and it’s driving me insane. Any advice is welcome. Thank you :)",12Sep2019,1

I also feel like everyone is talking about me behind my back and it's never anything good. I've started pushing people away because I'm scared that they don't want me around anyway, but then I annoy myself because I feel so lonely. 

I'm also becoming afraid of doing something as simple as driving. Sometimes I get in the car and panic because I think someone will try to hit me.

131,"I’m sure this has been asked before, but I just need to hear an answer from people who I don’t know.

I’m a senior In high school, coming up on SATs, applying for colleges, etc. and I can’t shake this idea that after I graduate life just isn’t gonna get better, all my parents tell me is that after high school nobody has any time to themselves, I’ll lose touch with almost everyone I’m friends with, and pretty much everything sucks until you die.

It just feels like at the end of it all nothing I’m gonna do will ever mean anything, I’m never gonna make a difference. The only way I manage to keep going right now is to find tiny little things to care about and be excited about, like a new season of a tv show, a friend I spend a lot of time with, a new game coming out, etc.

Does it get better? Does life after high school and college actually have any meaning? Or is it just slaving away until we die?",12Sep2019,1

That being said, he really admires me, and thinks I'm the coolest, most charismatic and cheerful guy out of our friendship group, looks up to me as well. Well, this night (of his staying at my place) I forgot to delete my history, and ended up quickly erasing all the dumb crap I had on my google chrome. Unfortunately, I forgot to close the deleting tab, with ""animal hentai"" still on the search bar. He saw it, and I disregarded it as ""being curious since my school assignments teach us about animal sex"" - he asked ""why the hentai version?"" and I replied as being disgusted by the real thing. He's sleeping now, but I can't help to wonder what's going on in his mind, tomorrow, the day after, etc. He seemed pretty normal while we were having fun for the rest of the night. I think even mentioning it again will give him a pretty relevant red flag to reconsider his life choice as putting me as a guy to look up to. Any advices on this?

136,"I'm a computer science major at my college, I'm in my third year right now and I'm taking a really difficult computer science class right now. For those of you who have some background experience in computer science the class, I'm taking is an introduction to Java, but it's like learning two or three semesters of material in one semester. From my freshman year, my college decided for some reason it would be a good idea to teach all upcoming computer science majors in Python, which makes no sense to me because all the upper-level classes are in Java and C++. So the class I'm in right now was made because my school originally taught in Java.

The class is unbelievably unfair, we were expected to have the textbook on the very first day of class (the textbook is online) and we were emailed two hours before the first class started that we needed it. Money doesn't grow on trees for me so I couldn't afford the book until the next class, only to find out we had to learn nearly 3-4 weeks of material due in less than 2 days, so I was already behind on the second day. When we told our professor, all he said was, ""I know it's a lot of work but just bear with it."" Work just gets piled on top for more work, textbook readings, and programs, and it's hard for me to remember everything I've learned because I don't get enough time to practice it. What's worse is he doesn't answer questions we have from the textbook because he thinks the textbook will answer those questions for us. The students that are doing the best in the class already had background experience in Java so for them, this class is a walk in the park. For those of us who don't have any experience, my professor somehow expects us to remember all the material from the textbook after hours of cramming.

The workload is too much for me to manage with four other classes, a job, and two clubs, I sacrifice hours of my time to get my work done, but I don't understand anything I've learned because my motivation has changed from understanding the material to getting my work done on time so I can get a good grade. I talked to my advisor, who is also my professor, about the problems I have with the class because I can't get lower than a C- or else I can't move on with my major and he told me either I can ""tough it out"" or I'll have to change majors. Now I have no idea what I'm going to do, I feel like I've gone too far in to turn back yet I don't know whether it's the right choice to change majors. I'll feel like I've wasted my time and my parent's money if I change majors now but it might be the better option. What should I do?",12Sep2019,1
137,"So I(14M) just recently started high school and I have already found the workload quite difficult. I get home from school at around 3:30 - 4:00, and usually I'm exhausted (the bus ride home is really stressful). Then my dad cuts my wifi off from 4:30 - 6:00, so I can't do any online work and most of my time is spent wasted. Then we have dinner, and I study for tests and finish my work after that. By the time I am finally finished all of my duties, it is 10:00. That leaves me a one hour window to use wifi since it goes off again at 11:00. Usually it is even later and most times I don't get wifi at all. I like to game and I am trying to continue to code, but it is hard to find time for this. I feel like especially for coding it would really help my future but with all my stupid religion homework I can't ever find time to fire up my computer and work on it.

140,"Hi, I'm a Dyslexic so sorry for the hard read. 

I was going to go to college for Audio Engineering this year, but my parents suddenly told me 2 months before I was due to leave that they couldn't afford it and help me pay and offered to pay for me to go to a certification program that would span the next year. I have worked a $15 dollar an hour job for 2 1/2 years, but I couldn't pay for college myself so I accepted to take a gap year and get the certification so I could work. Now I'm stuck in a rut.

I LOVE school and learning and want to go to college, but now that I'm already getting a certificate in Audio Engineering my parents want me to get a job straight out of the program, but I want to go to college. I kinda want to study Japanese because I have extended family there and I want to live there. My ultimate dream is to work as an Audio Engineer in Japan, but I don't know what my job prospects would look like or if I could even do it.

I guess I just want advice on what to do. How can I go to college and still get a job afterward? Can I go to college for Audio Engineering after doing the Cert and not have it be a waste of time? Or should I just go to college for something else? 

I won't quit the program, I refuse to not go to school during my forced gap year and a certificate is better than nothing. 

I will be taking two Community college classes aswell Japanese 101-103 and Eng Comp 101-103 so I can transfer easier to a college.

Sorry, this is so jumbled so is my mind. I doubt anyone can actually help I just need to vent.

158,"So I was in 9th grade at the time I’d say I’m more of a tomboy who flowed more with guys than girls. There was this boy I’ve known for about 2 years and we had a class together. At the time I never wanted to date or anything like that. But he had recently gotten dumped and me trying to be a good friend wanted to comfort him. 

A little insight on his personality. He’s very over the top and basically the scary weird kid. I mean like carries knives in school and does acid and sh*t. 

After about 2 weeks of his breakup he asked me out and I didn’t want to be rude so I said yes. We texted but never anything extremely flirty. The day after I was asked out in the middle of class during free time he sat on the floor and held onto my leg for the rest of class. He also kept poking my thighs and resting on them saying “you’re so warm”. That was strike 2. (Strike one was the drugs and extreme depression which isn’t his fault, but he never stopped talking about how “bad” he had it). After maybe a week we broke it off because I wanted to be away from him. 

We didn’t talk for a little while until I texted him because I felt as if we left things on a bad note. And i asked him “when you said I love you did you mean it or did you say it like i was family?” (We had shared a bunch of personal stuff at the time and would say I love you like family) And he said “yea I did I was really in love with you but I stopped I guess.” That immediately was strike 3 for me. I then told him after a couple days I didn’t want to be friends anymore and blocked him on all social media and his number. It’s about 4 months after it happened but I can never stop thinking about it. And I was scared at some point because I thought he would physically hurt me because of the whole knife thing.

167," 

I’m an architecture graduate from Sri Lanka. I’ve currently completed my Architecture part one (3 years) affiliated by UWE Bristol. This is a RIBA accredited course. I’m hoping to study my masters in a country with a rich architectural or design context. Preferably somewhere in Europe or Canada. I have a few questions,  
1.      Is it possible to find my living expenses and course fees through part-timing while I’m studying? I’m part-timing as a freelance graphic designer and UI/UX developer, and in the past, I’ve earned a considerable amount through this.  
2.      I would like to follow a course that is in line with sociology, strategic design, spacial design, or regional designs, etc. I'm interested in a course concentrating on design rather than management or other technicalities.  
3.      I prefer practicing on my own after gaining some experience. How hard it is to manage your studio in a European country (Let’s say the Netherlands) or in Canada. I'm asking this because many of my colleges have this notion that it is very difficult to practice architecture solo in Europe. 

I’m sorry for the long post. As you can see I'm very confused at the moment and would like some insight, so bear with me. Thank you!",12Sep2019,0
168,"For a bit of context, I was very involved with a specific community of people. We all had a niche interest that involved seeing each other for one weekend a month and otherwise conversing online. I wasn't super close with all of them or anything, but I had a lot of what I would consider close friends. Not everything was sunshine and rainbows, of course. High school drama perpetuates all communities I think. So much immaturity, gossip, and other unsavory behavior. I wasn't better than anybody else and fell into some of those vices too. 

In July, I was ousted from the group. I had a major falling out with my closest friends there and then aquaintances also started to hate me. I was involved in so much drama on all sides. Even people I barely knew had been talking shit behind my back. I felt so uncomfortable I left the group, renounced a hobby I loved, I even stopped using Facebook because I had many friends with those people (they were a majority of my friends list). Since then people that I thought would still favor me have ignored me. One crushing blow was telling a super close friend ""hey you should stop associating with me to save your reputation"" and she agreed. I haven't spoken to her since. 

I don't really talk to anyone anymore. I just work and then play video games when I'm not working. I really crave human connection, but I can't bring myself to open up to anyone. There are many people I want to try and rekindle a relationship with, but I can't. It's too late. How do I try and be friendly, when I know the community hates me, that I'm ""problematic"" and that none of them have really tried to contact me since July? I can't. 

I have lost friends before. I've dealt with it in the past, which usually means feeling down for a week and then bouncing back. I haven't bounced back yet and it's been two months. I don't feel the same. I used to be an overly open and trusting person, who tried to help people where i could, and would be friendly and flirty and try to have fun. I don't feel that anymore. Any time i think to try and be social, my chest just locks up and I have no desire to talk. 

I want friends. I want to go out and have fun with people. But I can't bring myself to.",12Sep2019,1

172,"I’m a senior in highschool, and I know how everybody says highschool memories are going to be the most memorable of your life, blah blah, make the most of it, etc. but I’m just tired already. 

Ever since, maybe fifth grade I’ve had a constant stream of being dumped by my “friends”. Every year it feels like I got a new friend in my class and every year without fail they dump me like I’m nothing to them. I try my best to be likable and kind to them but I guess it doesn’t work anymore. 

They always, ALWAYS find somebody better, more popular. First it was in sixth grade, I’ll call her K. K was a new student at our school and I, along with my three person friend group reached out to her. My friend group was always having me as the third wheel, I kinda just joined a pair of two best friend’s so it sucked. 

So I thought I could have a best friend of my own that year. I was dead wrong, it was fine a couple months in but after a while she was distant. She wouldn’t hang out with us anymore as she fitted into a newer, more popular friend group at that time. We saw less and less of her, and now I felt left out of everything again since it was three people again. 

Gradually this happened again in my freshman year along with my sophomore with two different people. And it was worse in my sophomore year. It was mid semester when she dumped me, and it felt horrible. We were like close friends in the first semester but during the second where, I found  confidence deplete due to my acne flaring up again (I have this weird I’ll get clear skin in the summer and going back the stress and eating makes it worse kind of face). 

So she decided it was done with me. So... I guess it was over than too. 

I’m tired of it, I really am, it’s affected me in more ones than I could imagine. I’m more recluse, I don’t want to open up to people in fear of them leaving me, I don’t like talking, staying quiet is my thing and I had a heightened ability to sense social cues that leave me anxious. 

I hate myself for feeling this way. 

I hate myself for not being confident. 

I know my story isn’t unique in any way. But I’m really struggling, I need some advice. How can I trust people again? Because I know I’ll have too, I just really, really never want to leave my bubble again at this point. History repeats itself afterall.",12Sep2019,1

175,"I've gained a lot of hormonal weight the past couple of years that I can't seem to get off but I've decided to start trying harder by eating healthy and hoping my body lines itself out to whatever is healthiest for it instead of short term diets to lose weight fast. But what exactly is a healthy diet? Are there certain things you should incorporate daily? I do like to cook (mostly because you can get two loaves of bread for what 1 McChicken costs) though I'm mediocre/average skilled and it's usually things like tilapia, shrimp, things with beef like meatloaf and burgers, pasta, chicken. I like canned veggies (cause I ain't live on no farm) and raw spinach and I mostly drink flavored water and energy drinks. My husband is a type 1 diabetic but I am not.

We had our tax return so we had some money to get a weekly room with a kitchen in 3 city’s over to have her surgery due to insurance issues over the last year. We had a rent a car and didn’t buy a car. We ran out of money and have been homeless staying with family friends on and off over the last few months.

178,"Here’s some context: I’ve grown up in a family where I find it hard to share my emotions because I just feel uncomfortable talking about these types of things. So many people see me as a rock solid personality but in all actuality, I still have feelings but I end up pushing them to the side. I also think it’s important to note that I don’t feel to confident in talking to others that I have a draw to which might be normal but I just don’t feel normal when talking

So I recently met this girl that I have in a few of my classes and she’s everything that I want in a partner and I have no idea how to read if she is interested because of my lack of experience. I don’t want to push her away but I also don’t want to let her slip out of reach if she is interested in me, so I’m on here asking for some advice on how to interpret what certain things can mean in regards to interest in a person without coming across as overbearing. I’ve never really talked to anyone about this type of stuff so please give me constructive criticism or even ways on how to be more open with my emotions.

I would also like to ask her to hangout sometime but I don’t know how to bring the conversation up and I’m almost positive I wouldn’t know how to deliver the idea.",12Sep2019,1
179,"Essentially, the gist of it is: I was walking to my car after class when a guy stopped me to ask for directions to another building. Small talk ensued, and although I wasn't too fond of the conversation I didn't leave out of politeness because I really wasn't in a rush and he kept asking questions (nothing too invasive, just about school). However, at a certain point, he asked for my number. I sort of froze up and nodded and gave it to him. I am in a relationship but didn't mention it at all because it never came up organically in conversation. I know I should've said no and left or mentioned my partner, but at that point I felt awkward and wanted to leave, and I know I should've just left after helping him and not engaged in conversation when I didn't want to. I wouldn't say I was scared but it was about 9:30 pm, and although there were still people on campus, I didnt know how'd he react (I am five foot tall woman and he was much bigger). I already have an awful habit of freezing up in uncomfortable situations and just not knowing what to do when stuff like this happens. He walked me a bit further and then left. 

&amp;#x200B;

That occurred yesterday. Since then, he has messaged me three times asking to hang out and how I am doing, etc. I haven't replied. But I am debating on whether or not to message him telling him that I am in a relationship or simply just not answering/blocking him.

180,"So, I will try to keep things short, but for the last 2 years ago my mental health has really started to deteriorate. I used to be a very outgoing, confident, and social young man and now I think of myself as the antithesis of those qualities. I am now extremely socially anxious and have zero confidence whatsoever. I also started exhibiting a lot of symptoms for depression like losing interest in things I used to love and finding it really really difficult just to get the courage to start my day. I have been dealing with these things for almost 2 years now without asking anyone for help once because on the outside, it really does look like I have my shit together, so I’ve been told at least. I have a bright future ahead of me, I stay in good shape, and I do a well enough job of acting like myself to my friends when I am forced to come out of my bubble. So, to everyone else, life probably seems like a piece of cake for me. But I certainly do not feel that way.

The thing I struggle with most is about 6 months ago I seriously harmed myself for the first time. It all started with a few beers and then while still being coherent, I decided to unleash my anger on myself about me losing sense of who I once was. The man I was in the past would have never become who I am now and he would be ashamed if he did, which is most definitely how I feel. So that night I vehemently beat the shit out of myself and started cutting my leg. Punches straight to the face repeatedly and plenty of deep cuts to my thigh. In the moment, I did not think it was going to be bad at all in the morning and I thought I was just showing myself some tough love and, honestly, in the moment, I thought I needed that. Well, the next morning I woke up to my right eye being swollen shut and my leg having 11 open cuts that bled through my pants. The black eye was the worst I had personally ever seen. Eyes bleeding, can barely move my eye lids and severe discoloration. I ended up telling everyone that I got into a bar fight the night before and that the other guy was much worse (slight lol that) and I just bandaged up the cuts on my upper quad and wore shorts that covered them. 

I was extremely ashamed of myself for stooping to the level of self harm and found myself constantly lying to make sure no one ever found out what truly happened. I remember after I told my step dad the fake bar fight story he asked me if the guy was a lefty and I just got confused and probably said I don’t know. But he was referring to the fact that my right eye was destroyed which could only come from someone’s left handed punch or from my own right hand. 

I know self harm is absolutely horrible and never the answer, but in the six months since it’s happened, I haven’t told a single soul about the true story. I am so afraid of the social repercussions and what people will think of me if they found out im in this bad of a mental state and have been for a long time now. Would my friends start to think “who’s this fucking psycho that beats the shit out of himself?” “No Fucking chance we hang out with that depressed lunatic ever again.” “Man, that guy has got some serious fucking issues to deal with.” 

I feel it deep down that I need to tell someone the truth to feel slightly better about this incident and hopefully help with my social anxiety but I don’t know who to tell or how to start. 

Do I tell my mother who will surely cry her eyes out and blame herself? Do I tell my best friend who will possibly make unwanted judgements about me because I am not in a sane mental state right now? Do I bypass all of that and secretly sign up for counseling and seek professional help? I just want to get out of this shit hole of a rut and I think by telling someone the truth about my current mental state, it might help.",12Sep2019,1

184,"A little bit about me. I’m a 25F who is fairly average looking-used to be more attractive but I just recently got diagnosed with severe Rosacea so my skin is constantly beet red and covered in adult acne. I have my quirks about me just like anyone else and I’m also aware that I’m mildly awkward. Nothing too outrageously weird about me, I’d like to think. I’m also a highly sensitive Empath ,so some days I could cry at the drop of a hat. But I’m very sociable, an easy laugh and laid back for the most part. Now to my question- What is so damn funny about me? I work in a medical office with all girls and they all seem to choose me to be butt of their joke? No one else. JUST ME.

Here’s an example of some of the things these girls (my supppsed friends) say about me:

“You should really learn how to do your eyebrows”

“Have you ever taken a DNA test before because your nose looks Jewish”

“You’re way too nice. You need to grow a back bone.”

“ OMG Your jokes are pathetic”

They also constantly roll their eyes at me and tell me to ‘Shut the fuck up” in a joking manner after I’ve tried to contribute to the conversation.

Now I realize as I write this out, these do not sound like jokes. But every time they say something like that, they all laugh. So because they’re laughing, I assume they’re just kidding and so I don’t say anything for fear of looking like an asshole and having no friends. And the reason I call them friends is because they invite me out for drinks, talk with me in my office and don’t make fun of me when it’s just one on one.

Can some one tell me if this is a normal thing girl friends do to each other or have I just come across some really mean girls?",12Sep2019,1

189,"So my hubby and I work for the same company, and recently both transferred to a different city for our jobs.  

When we were in our old city, we both knew a work colleague who we would chat to at work, but I wouldn't say we were friends with him.
He got engaged and would chat to me about the wedding and wedding planning etc and used to joke (or so i thought) that we would be invited.  (I believe he has about 300-400 guests attending).

Fast forward 6 months and I had to email him about a work matter (only contact with him since moving). He asked if we were going to go back to our old city anytime soon and I said we didn't have plans to but would let him know if we were in future so we could catch up. 
Then I remember his wedding must be coming up and ask him how it's all going.  He says that's why he asked if we were planning a trip back,  as we were still invited if we wanted to go (the wedding was about a month away). I said yes,  spoke to hubby and we booked flights.  

All good, but I realised when I received the invite that there's no mention of a gift registry, and recall him saying that guests usually give money as per his cultures traditions (They are lebanese).

So,  my question is,  how much is a good amount to give them,  bearing in mind we have spent about $1,000 on flights and a accommodation to get to the wedding for a 2 day stay.

194,"Greetings, redditors. I'm finally making the decision to post here because at this point I'm feeling pretty helpless and figured I'd like to gain any outside perspective if i can. If anyone ends up reading this, please prepare because it's going to be long. I was going to attempt a tl;dr at the bottom but i cant even think of a proper one now, sorry.

This is me asking for advice regarding my older brother. To give a little bit of background; he's almost 24 years old. Has a 1 and a half year old baby son and a girlfriend who lives with myself and our younger sister in our parents home. They moved back in not too long ago after leaving another state because living on their own did not work out well for them. My brother never graduated HS, never obtained a drivers license, has a criminal background and can't really hold a job that long. 

To put it simply- it's been rough having them back living with us. Growing up, myself and my siblings have always known there was something off about my brother. I think my mom mentioned years ago that she had taken him to a doctor when he was a kid and they diagnosed him with ADHD but I'm not sure if I remember that correctly. 

I feel before i get into this i should mention that I believe my brother has an addictive personality. Addicted to food, weed, cigarettes, drugs such as cocaine and ecstacy. He also drinks alcohol kind of often, but i wouldnt go so far as to call him a full on alcoholic. He just has no boundaries when it comes to consuming these substances. 

Anyways, recently my brother has been having these absolutely insane blow up episodes where he'll just scream off the top of his lungs &amp; there's no controlling his behavior or calming him down. It's like someone will say something and a flip will switch and it'll set him off and he'll become an almost entirely different being even to the point of getting violent (punching through walls, screaming in your face, etc.) Throughout these episodes he's just screaming at my parents, telling them they never wanted to get him help for his mental illnesses, that hes always hearing voices in his head, he's depressed, they think hes a stupid loser/tweaker, etc. Even if the baby is in the room, he doesn't care. I have to grab my nephew and run outside because the baby just has the most terrified look in his eyes watching his father act like this. We've even had to call the cops on him a couple times and it caused him to calm himself down.

These episodes usually happen when hes either on drugs or coming down from them. He'll be dripping sweat and have an almost empty look in his eyes. Whenever this happens, it takes so much out out of my family, especially my mother. I can see how much pain this causes her and it's heartbreaking. The last one he had even caused me to have my first panic attack ever, it's that crazy. My parents believe everything hes saying is bullshit, that hes just blaming them because they hate when hes on drugs and everything hes saying are excuses.

Now, i truly believe something is wrong with my brother's brain thats causing him to do this. I think the drugs are *definitely* amplifying it but i know something's going on behind the scenes that we don't know about or understand. These blow ups only started happening within the past year or so, and one of the times he had one, he said when he was a kid he was abused sexually by our oldest brother who we don't have contact with anymore. This was the first time any of my family had heard about this and we were all absolutely devastated. We all agree he needs to seek help more than ever and he always says he'll get it but never follows through. 

Presently, he hasnt had a blow up in a few months I'd say. But he came pretty close the other day.. Since his family moved in not long ago, my parents have been taking care of everything for them financially. They were trying to push both him and his girlfriend to get a job so they can help out with the bills every month. He had finally managed to get a minimum wage job but only a few weeks into working there, he disappeared for a day and the next morning he came back on drugs. He was very depressed and stood in bed crying all day. A few days after that, he skipped work again and did the same exact thing. 

My parents are very fed up at this point. They found out the job actually fired him and my parents gave him an ultimatum- either attend rehab or find somewhere else to live. Whenever they mentioned rehab to him in the past, he always said he didnt need it. But this time, he agreed to attending and mentioned he also wants all of us to attend family therapy. We all said thats a good idea but he needs to attend rehab first and thats when he almost had another blow up. My mom diffused it by just walking away until he could calm himself and saying if he gets crazier shes going to call the police. I fear it's just gonna be another cycle of this again. It feels like it's never ending and now that he's jobless he's always around at home and could snap any second. Even as I type this out, his girlfriend just walked in from work and is crying saying he disappeared again. She found out he's been lying all day about where he's been and who he's been with. I expect him to come back tomorrow or in a few days on drugs yet again.

I guess what i want advice for is what can i possibly do to help this situation? Is there anything i even can do? I feel hes only agreeing to rehab cause he wont have anywhere else to live if my parents want him out but i think he truly believes he doesnt need it. I know people say you cant force someone to get help, they need to realize it and want it themselves to truly change. But if we keep waiting, this is going to get worse and worse and nothing will ever change. I also deeply fear for the safety of my nephew everyday, hes the one that'll suffer most if my brother doesnt get help.

196,"I have come to accept that I am generally a burden to others. I would like to move somewhat far or at least detached from my hometown, preferably removed from mainstream society. I would like to live simply, without the comforting luxuries of the world which I do not deserve. To reduce harm on others, I should live alone and far from dense civilization. Perhaps it would be more fitting to live servile to someone else? I would have no problem living without personal freedom. I just hope I do not harm anyone else. I also hope not to humiliate myself again; I will have to start over once more in that case. What is the best course of action for me? I am 18M, if that makes any difference.

Today he tells me that he indeed has a brain tumor and that the doc is telling him he needs chemotherapy. I busted out crying because it was super unexpected.

The first time (when I was 14) I was peer-pressured to do it and sadly a part of me wanted to do it myself. When I was 16 I wasn't peer pressured at all but basically gave into my impulses. 

Both times I was going through puberty and was really horny (esp when I was 14).  I would basically jack off multiple times a day (at least 2-4 times) when I was 14. 

Flash forward to 16 and I didn't have any access to porn, so I decided to take the pictures. Since those times I have changed immensely. I also deleted all but one of the pictures the night I took the photos. I believe I deleted the remaining picture within the week I took the pictures. I now have no access to the phone I took the pictures on since it's destroyed.

204,"I interviewed for a job and surprisingly the next day after the interview they called and gave me a verbal offer. I countered on the salary, and apparently due to HR policies it was almost a month before they finally approved the salary increase. During this month long wait I had let my current employer know my intent to leave, and they asked if they could do anything to keep me. We discussed salary but knowing the company I work for, I knew it was going to be a nightmare to try and get me a pay increase. Nevertheless they said they would try. 

So after the new job finally approved the raise and I went and did paperwork and stuff. Keep in mind I didn't even have a start date at this point. So a week and a half or so rolls by waiting for the paperwork I signed to be processed, and I got an email this past Monday that everything went through and they were asking when I could start. My current boss's boss then calls me that same morning, and says that HR agreed to a dramatic salary increase and promotion, and the salary was significantly more than the new job. 

I couldn't pass it up. I emailed the manager for the other job explaining what happened an apologizing for backing out. I know it probably wasn't the most professional move, but I couldn't really see any other option. Anyway the guy never responded to my email, and I don't really know what to do? I'm assuming he's extremely pissed. Should I send another email asking if he received it? I can't imagine why he wouldn't have since all of our correspondence since the initial verbal offer has been through email. Should I just leave it alone at this point?",12Sep2019,1

It can be a combination of a lot of things that were going on like she was extremely stressed because she had lots going on and it's also possible that her mental health could've had a play in it as well. She smokes weed and one of the things it could cause is schizoprenia and one time she literally said she might have schizoprenia because she hears voices. Also one time when she was high she was talking about how there were people in her head talking and she was saying crazy stuff. Also her mind and way of thinking changes rapidly. Like last week Friday(maybe the week before last week i don't recall it was on a friday right before dorian came) was the last time we tried to work things out and in the morning everything was okay and she was being her usual cute self. I sent her pictures of me and she said i looked hot and ""i saved them hehe"" and then towards the end when school got out she said we needed to talk. And that's when a lot of crazy stuff happened and it's a long explanation. But long story short she left in an uber and walked off to it while i begged her to say and talk things out. She said she loved me and that i was a guy worth waiting for but what she did didn't show me that all. And there was another time when were together that her mood or way of thinking changed so fast. It was a night where she was coming to tell me that sometimes she feels as if i'm not the ""the one"" sometimes and that sometimes she does. She was coming with the mindset that i wasn't and when she got here it changed she thought i was and when she got here she said that she thinks she needs mental health because of that and how quickly her mind/feelings changed. All of this happening combined with the stress of what's been going on in my life gave me heartbroken syndrome. Her leaving that friday is when i started exhibiting the symptoms. And basically i might die and i want her to be happy so i said some mean things to her over text so that she would absolutely hate me because i don't want her to know that i died and her to think it's her fault she's been through so much already.

214,"I don’t know where to start. When I was younger in my formative years... ages 6-17, my dad was always sarcastic with me and not very loving. I frequently got yelled at, and spoken to as though I was a dog. I hated him. (Still kind of do). He would express his love by buying me things, but the way he talked to me was very dry, condescending, and conveyed that I wasn’t worth anything. It’s crazy because now I do the same things to my younger brothers. Not the yelling or the abusive things like beating me senseless for not getting a good grade...  or slamming people against the wall like he did my mother once... but when they say things that are immature, I’ll say stuff like. “Did you really think that was funny?” and I don’t know how to stop. I know they don’t like me. It’s just that they say some really stupid things and I don’t have the patience nor the crayons to put up with this stage of their development, it’s very aggravating some of the things they do. I believe I’m also very sensitive, and get offended easily. Like for example my brother commented on how my younger brother and I are the same height now, and I said: “I’m getting so tired of you.” But it was after he told me to leave for not finding a “joke” of his funny. I wasn’t rude about not finding it funny, I just didn’t laugh and he told me to leave the room. Which I asked him why he was talking to me like that just because I didn’t find it funny. (In his defense it was about a girl not giving him the reaction that he wanted at school, and guess he was embarrassed but trying to laugh down the pain) I guess I am the ass hole. They take forever to stop playing video games when it’s time for me to pick them up from their grandparents house too. I’ll say “it’s time to go, and they’ll just look at me.” Then I’ll say something like: “did I speak another language?” I sometimes feel like if I’m too friendly with them that they’ll walk all over me because they’re in that prepubescent stage of life. I guess I’m the asshole. Matter of fact I **know** I’m the asshole. I see the good in them, I think they’re very cool, but I keep them on a tight leash because I guess Im not very creative with the way I interact with them, and don’t like some of the things they do. I feel like I’ve done this sarcasm, frustration thing with them for so long that the damage is irreparable. I want them to like me. But I feel like it’s too late. I’m the older sister. There’s about a six to eight year difference between those three and I. 

TL;DR 
I have three younger brothers, they’re great, they’re not bad, but their immaturity is aggravating, and I have a low patience for it. My dad was like this with me when I was growing up. It really messed with me. My dad was evil and abusive, to both my mom and I.  EX: he slammed her violently, against a wall when I was three. Though I’m not violent or yelling at them, I’m very dry when I communicate with them. I don’t known how to interact with my brothers, sometimes I can’t help it, I guess my behavior is a defense mechanism from years of childhood abuse. I don’t want them to hate me.

217,"I am 16F and I have been noticing my younger brother putting himself down a lot recently and being overly critical of himself even though he’s only nine. I pass by he’s room he is almost always consistently watching YouTube videos that mention mental illness or depression in some shape or form, and most of the videos show the people in the videos openly expressing their “hated” for themselves. (I’ve told him a couple times to stop watching videos like those because I don’t want them influencing him, which I think I shouldn’t have done now thinking about it since I was a little too harsh when I first mentioned it.) Like, I understand self deprecating humor, I’ve told a joke about myself here and there, but I don’t tell them repetitively to the point where I believe in what I’m saying. Which I think may be the case for him. He’s been acting more sluggish and whatnot, plus lately he has been been saying things such as: 
“I horrible at (what ever it is he’s doing, anything)” - But he isn’t, he is actually extremely smart for his age and can grasp things fast. 
“I don’t really have friends” - Not true, he has one very close friend who he tells everything to. And even if he didn’t have him, everyone at his elementary school know who he is because of his academic excellence and says hi to him regularly. 

He hasn’t been acting like himself this past year, his been more closed off to us even though we’re his family and tell each other everything. He hasn’t been wanting to try new things like he used to do because he now thinks he’ll “suck at them,” but in reality he’s only learning and will get better with time. He lacks the confidence he used to have when competing in academic competitions and sports. I personally believe it is social media culture of normalizing sadness, lack of self worth, and negative mentally that has been rubbing off on him and making him act like how he has been. He’s been spending a lot of time on the internet lately and seeing these kinds of things mentioned so this is why I think that. 

I’ve tried opening up to him more about my school life and experiences I’ve faced (not slamming it into his face, but rather trying to ease him into it so he doesn’t close off more) when it comes to pressure in school, making/keeping friends, crushes, etc in hopes to make him open up a bit more. I don’t think it’s been working that great. But I do intend on improving myself (joining clubs in school and doing things I normally wouldn’t) especially when he is present in hopes that will encourage him to do the same.

220,"So my boyfriend and I moved in together this July. We moved him from across the country together and we have been living together ever since. He only started working last week and has been bored. He’s graduated and I’m still in school. I’m starting to think he expects me to spend all my time with him. I have commitments outside of classes and he gets sad when I have plans. I’ve become swamped with school and extracurricular responsibilities and he gets mad at me for small things like forgetting to move the laundry to the dryer. When he comes home from work at 5 I feel like he doesn’t do anything but sit and play video games. Then when I get home and there’s things to do, like dishes, laundry, general cleaning, I notice he hasn’t done any of them in the hours I’ve been away. And to make matters worse, a lot of my time is being spent doing homework and I can’t spend time with him so he gets sad again. I feel like he resents me for being so busy and not putting him above everything in my life but I have commitments to honor. So when I’m stretched thin with homework and classes and meetings and extracurriculars and then I slip on something at home, he gets so mad at me when I know he had every opportunity to take care of it himself while I was busy. 

What makes me nervous is how he always wants to know my business. He wants to know when I’m coming home every time I leave for a rehearsal, meeting, or class. He asks how long it’ll take and texts me when it goes longer than I expected. It makes me feel like I can’t go hang out with my friends or do anything spontaneous because he wants to know in advance. It was worse when he wasn’t working so he’d expect me home immediately after work, between classes and every free minute of mine. I felt I didn’t have the option to go to the library to do homework or hang with my friends because he expected me back. Now that he’s working, he’s gone from 8-5 each day so that’s changed slightly but he still exhibits that behavior after he gets home from work. I don’t want to sacrifice time with my best friends just for my boyfriend and I to sit and watch TV or watch him play video games. (Because that’s what happens when we’re both home.) It’s driving me crazy and I don’t know how to fix it.

I am still in middle school, (I mostly use reddit to communicate but I like other SRs, so don't ask.) and I don't think it's necessarily anything too serious like tourettes, but I am still curious. Sometimes I have the urge to twitch my body and snap my fingers, but not an all day purpose. Mostly at night when I am about to fall asleep is when the twitching gets a bit more irritating. Like, okay. I get in my best sleeping position, but as soon as I start closing my eyes, I have to start bending my back and kicking my feet. Now, remember. I don't do it on a daily basis all day. I usually stop when I am very distracted such as in band class, or hanging out with friends.

223,"I'll try to be as brief as possible with this one, but I'm not really sure why it's happening or how I can change it.   


I was living with my roommate for over five years before we had a falling out and I had to move into my own place. Prior to this I had never lived on my own.   


I was in a rush to find a new apartment, and moved into a place that seemed nice but ended up having extremely thin walls (I didn't know this when I briefly had a look at the place). My first night was horrible - without earplugs I was awake for nearly the entire night hearing people leaving the apartment, walking up/down the stairs, footsteps of the person above me, car doors slamming outside, etc.    


I thought I could get used to the noise but I didn't. Particularly, I could hear the person living above me walking, closing doors and doing daily tasks, and it really got to me. I felt like I couldn't relax in my own place. I started to go through a bout of sleeplessness and didn't know what to do, as I always had this fear that I was going to be awoken by some big noise in the middle of the night, like I was during my first night after moving in. I bought earplugs, and even had a fan and a white noise machine on during the night to try and help myself relax. I also bought melatonin and other sleep aids, eventually having sleeping pills prescribed to me after seeing a doctor. I've never dealt with this kind of sleep anxiety in my life.   


Over the preceding months, I would stay overnight at my friend's place periodically during the week, and my sleep quality immediately returned to normal. I was able to fall asleep with just my earplugs - no white noise, etc. needed - and I finally felt rested for the first time in a while. I have continued to do this since, wherein I'll stay at my friends place for 3-4 days during the week and mine for the other 2-3 days.   


The issue is, I don't want this pattern to continue. I want to be able to sleep at my own apartment, the place where I'm paying rent, internet, utilities, etc. The issue is not the noise anymore - the person above me and the person beside me have both moved out. Although some nights are fine, I still have trouble sleeping in my apartment, and even when I do get to sleep I feel like the quality of my sleep is shallow.   


So, what can I do? How can I solve this problem and feel comfortable sleeping in my place?",12Sep2019,1
224,"So long story short, my family runs a small lubricant factory. Been operating for 2 years now, and one question still always remain: what price should we be selling for?

What we are currently doing (my mother's way): only calculating product costs (ingredients, labels, packaging; doesn't count in factory renting cost and employee cost at all), our margin is about 5-10%, selling to distributors. Her reasoning is the fixed costs and employee costs will be minuscule once we start selling in very large quantities, which doesn't seem to be anytime soon.

What my brother wants to do: Count in fixed costs and employee costs, then after that take a margin of 10%. My mother's reasoning to reject this is the price would be considerably higher and customer won't buy.

What's happening in the market: Other lubricant factories produce low-quality products but still advertise them as good, use lower priced ingredients, or even knocked-off ingredients in some cases (used oil, then recolor it, add ingredient to make it look good as new.) And we are having to sell at almost the same price as them, but all our ingredients are imported so it is more expensive to make.

What I'm very concerned about is that we are making minuscule profit as a manufacturer (5-10%; not counting that we might be losing money due to fixed costs), but our distributors are making a huge fortune out of it by reselling it (more than 50%).

Because of this many arguments broke out during the years between the 3 of us, and we don't even talk about it anymore because we know it would just end up in an argument without a final answer.

I need advice. Also I need to know what margin % do factories usually make, so I know we are going in the right way.",12Sep2019,1

227,"So my whole workplace has a money issue, everyone has had their wage frozen for 19 months, while the union and HR comes to an agreement on how much we should be making. This means I'm out $6/hr right now, and i need to move, but can't because I'm living pay cheque to pay cheque as my rent and bills have gone up by my wages haven't. This is just context. 

My coworker who is also affected by the wage freeze (around $9/hr for them) offered to help me pay my moving fees, and my security deposit, which is going to be around $1500. That's a lot of money, especially for someone young and living pay cheque to pay cheque. I was just going to open an LOC to cover it and pay it off when I get the retro pay for the wage freeze. 

I don't know whether to either decline it (because honestly I couldnt ask for that money), or accept it (because being in debt to a person is cheaper than being in debt to a bank). On top of that I don't know how to say yes or no to the offer. When it was offered I just turned it around that they need it for a levy for their strata and as well they just spent a huge amount of money on their wedding, and they insisted.",12Sep2019,2

As a person who has and still do struggle with depression and anxiety I found it was nice to tell someone. But from what I’m guessing on what she posts that nobody really knows. I wish I could somewhat help her even if its just by letting her know that she’s not alone. I don’t know how to go about doing that, since we are still rebuilding our friendship.

I’ve been seeing this guy for a few months now. It’s not serious but I care for him a lot and want to show him that I do. His birthday’s coming up soon and I wanted to get him a little something. But he recently told me he hates his birthday. He said he doesn’t like the attention.

He hasn’t outright told me he doesn’t want anything and I’m sure he wouldn’t be upset with me if I did get him something. Plus it feels wrong to get him nothing, almost rude. But I want to respect his feelings about his birthday and avoid making a huge deal about it, in case I make him uncomfortable.

235,"FYI VERY LONG POST:

I’m feeling very upset right now and I just want to get through it. I used to go to therapy in the summertime but had to leave that behind when I moved back home (2 weeks ago). My health insurance will not cover me where I am now and I don’t have the money to pay for therapy out of pocket. So I’m hoping writing this will be therapeutic in some way, shape, or form; and hopefully I can get some advice on my current situation.

I just moved back home (GA), and I think it might be for good this time. I couldn’t see myself living in NY paycheck to paycheck just to pay the rent. I’ve been back and forth between NY and GA for about 2 years now. After I graduated from college, I couldn’t afford to live in the big city and decided to come. I had a pretty bad drug habit on the weekends and I really couldn’t stay and risk damaging my reputation anymore than I feel I already had. Now, I feel as if the people who cheered me on to go to college in NY, here in GA, now look at me like some kind of broken failure who couldn’t get his shit together to stay in that miserable place. And for the people I met in college who I thought were my friends, well we lost contact before we even walked in our caps and gowns.

I’m currently trying to stay focused as much as possible by preoccupying myself with daily tasks like planning and listening to podcasts. These simple tasks help me get through the monotony of the job-search. And although I went to high school down here and had a pretty decent friend group at the time, the amount of people I can rely on or speak to for help - I could count with the fingers on my right hand. Not including my actual only blood brother who lives in the same house as I do.

My brother is one year younger than me and we were always very close growing up. Now I don’t recognize who he is, and he is literally gone everyday from 9am-11pm. He doesn’t have a job, so I couldn’t possibly tell you what he’s doing. I don’t want to assume, but I can tell you it isn’t anything good. (I’m making this assumption from the company he keeps). I also think that because I’m part of the LGBTQ group he doesn’t find my lifestyle acceptable and therefore avoids me. Blame toxic West Indian culture.

I don’t live with my parents and have not since I was 18. Both of them are alcoholics with mental health issues that live for free under their parents, my grandparents. I always have to ask the question to them - if I have kids will they have grandparents who are active role models in my life like their parents are to me. They never can answer. 
I currently live with my moms sister, and she’s a wonderful, but very overworked woman. She divorced and has her own issues with her kids and new grandchild. I try to do my best to support her where I can by cooking dinner, watching the dog, and cleaning up as much as possible.

My grandma helped me out by giving me some money to buy a car. I matched what she gave me and was able to buy, register, and insure a vehicle within a day of coming home. That took all my savings and everything I was able to put away while living in NY. Now I’m down to barely anything. For the first time in my life I had to ask one of my oldest friends for $50 so I could stay afloat: gas money, groceries, basic necessities. 

Ultimately, I just want to be successful and take myself out of this situation I’m living in. I try and see beauty in everything I do, but sometimes I can get so hard on myself and so down about my situation. I find myself watching the days go by and I’ve started to fancy the evening beer. I was always advised that I should stay away from alcohol, but college sure did take a toll. 

I have a few interviews that I’m really excited to attend in the next few days. I guess what I really want to ask is, how do I grow up? Does feeling down like this come naturally? How can I make life better for myself and those around me? How can I fix my relationship with my brother (if that’s even possible)? Did any of you ever turn such a situation around into something so beautifully positive that you can’t help but smile at what you once went thru? 

Thank you for bearing with me.",12Sep2019,1

244,"Ok so you read the title, and I need some advice and sorry for my bad grammar and mistakes, and even if the story is a full-on mess and English is my first language.

Ok anyway so basically I and my mother have a Beautiful small white dog and his name is coco. We love him but my mother was trying to sell him cuz we can't give him the proper care because of work and me just starting school and am already part of a few school programs.

Ok, basically my mother found and elderly women that was very interesting and who even live a few doors down from us. (We live in an apartment building) so my mother offers coco for 500$, which is a good price because he is a miniature poodle which is worth 1,000$, and Both were happy with that deal.

So for some reason, my mom let the elderly woman hold on to her and she would pay at the end of the week when she gets her check. Well, it was a surprise when we found out that the lady went to Austin to see her daughter, and got coco a nice groom when she said that she didn't have any money.

And she even took her to the vet as well. That was a problem because she gave him antibiotics and which meant that she was the owner, now having documents of the visit. I really don't know how it works but yeah. 

And when she came back she refused to pay us and insisted that we gave him to her. So my mother ended up going to the apartment owner and explain what happen, and when she confronted the elderly women, change the entire story saying that she found the dog, and showed her the documents of her visit to the vet. Even saying that coco is a mixed breed and not worth much at all. And the elderly women knew that we didn't have any proof that coco was ours but one picture him on my mom's phone with no date and coco wasn't groomed so it could literally be another dog. I do however have pictures of him with as well and with dates but that could not do much 


So yeah basically this ""nice"" lady stole our dog that's worth 1000$ but clams it's hers

They seem innocent and as if they only wanted friendship just like me. Which going into this yes, I know you have to be really careful especially when your my age with these things because they are a lot of sick, demented and unstable people on the internet. I was fully aware of this. Anyway, he sends me his discord and I add it, he calls me and we talk for a pretty good amount of time I’d say about 20 minutes in we were off to a great start. That was until a couple more minutes passed. But before we get into that, i wanna say he was being very nice and just asking average questions about me and I even told him my real name. It was almost an hour now at this point and this is when he started to ask me personal questions and just weird questions you shouldn’t really be asking someone my age. anyway, I didn’t think that much of it to be honest. But... I started to hear I wanna say “inappropriate” sounds coming from his end. Like you could literally just tell he was getting off to my voice and everything. I absolutely fuckin hate this. I started to get really suspicious so I asked what he was doing already knowing what he was up to. He tried to lie but I didn’t bother pressing the issue. I genuinely wanted to tell him off and call him out for being the pervert that he was but I was so scared. I’m shy and can never speak up for myself sometimes and I think he caught on to that because he did mention he noticed i was shy. I hung out randomly and he either blocked me or just unfriended me. I still don’t get that part. Like was he just using me to get off and then completely pretend I didn’t exist in the first place? I think so. I haven’t had an encounter exactly like this before and I think that’s why it’s bothering me so much. I literally feel so stupid, naive, dirty, violated and betrayed. I know it’s just a sicko behind a screen but... I didn’t consent to what he was doing in the first place. He was listening to MY voice while he did what HE was doing and didn’t tell me about it. He LIED. This guy was also clearly at least 5 years older than me. This might not sound that bad to some people but my mother taught me better than to let people walk over me like this or do these kind of things.

251,"In the spring, my long time crush (for the intents and purposes of avoiding confusion, I'm going to call her Veronica) broke up with her girlfriend (Betty), and I told her I had feelings for her. I'd gotten the vibe that she had feelings for me as well, and I was right. Due to some personal life complications though, we couldn't date. We discussed that we had mutual feelings, and we wanted to see each other. We started seeing each other casually at the very beginning, and it really quickly evolved into something more. We decided that we weren't gonna tell anyone we were seeing each other. We went on dates in secret, she surprised me with flowers at the airport, our first kiss was magical, as were all of the rest. Then we had a talk- we still couldn't really tell anyone we were seeing each other, but we wanted to be exclusive. I stuck to that- being exclusive. However, a friend of mine told me they ran into Veronica on the bus, but didn't say hi because they were on a date. I disregarded it, just as a misunderstanding, until later, when Veronica and I were with a group of friends, and she joked about having a date last night. This was a regular joke, so again, I didn't think anything of it, and joked ""what, you had a date last night and didn't tell me?"", as we're known to be really close. She laughed and said a joking ""whaaaaat? pshht no"". Another friend, different than before, then whispered ""They did."" To me. Later, I enquired a bit. Veronica assured me that it was just a joke, and they weren't on a date. I kept hearing about it though, and then got a text from a girl, who we'll call Liz. Liz texted me that Veronica and her went on a date on the night in question, and she knows we're close so was wondering if I could help her figure out a gift for Veronica. I didn't. But I went to Veronica and asked her about the situation, saying basically ""I'm sorry, I don't mean to bring this back up, but I just got this text and I'm concerned.""

Veronica again assured me I had nothing to worry about, if Liz thought it was a date she was sorry, but to her knowledge it wasn't a date. I told Veronica I believed her. And I did. The only problem here, was the first night Veronica and Liz talked, I was on the phone with Veronica, who said ""oh I just got asked out on a date.""I wondered how she didn't know, but I believed her.

I kept hearing everyone we knew ask how the date was. I \*still\* didn't think anything of it, until I did.

I went to Veronica and told her I was having trouble with it, and I was really sorry, it was just a hard situation, to want to believe her, but hear from everyone around that she was on a date. I also told her if she was it was okay, I just wanted to know. That was true, I was okay with being casual, I just wasn't okay with being told we were exclusive and having it be a lie.

She asked if I was always this paranoid.

Flash forward, things were going smoothly with us, but one day, I heard something about someone we'll name Sam. I was told Sam went on a date with Veronica, and it was fantastic, and she caught feelings, and then he screwed her over. Her words. This was all good and fine except I knew Veronica had met Sam after we were supposedly exclusive. I let it slide, I didn't want to be paranoid. Besides, Sam had a girlfriend now, and Liz was out of the picture. Long story, not gonna get into it.

We kept seeing each other, and things were good. One of the best moments was laying in bed together, just laughing. Then things got kind of weird between Veronica and her ex, Betty. Like- flirty weird. Now, I knew Betty was still trying to get back with Veronica, and Veronica has a very flirtatious personality. I tried to let it go, but we were all somewhere together and Betty held her hand in between Veronica's legs on her thigh. I still tried to let it go.

Then Veronica was staying with me one night, and was texting Betty. I brought up to her that some things were striking me as odd, and we almost stopped seeing each other because I wanted to work on myself (I genuinely believed myself to just be paranoid), and she felt like I didn't trust her.

After talking, we decided not to stop seeing each other.

Then, physical and emotional affection stopped.

I just didn't get it anymore. Texts were dry. She'd only be affectionate over phone calls. She'd barely acknowledge me in person if Betty was there.

Fights between us kept coming up, and I considered leaving, but I've never loved someone as much or as long as I love Veronica, and yes, I still love her, so I stayed.

Then Veronica and Betty were being weird, and V told me that she'd just found out Betty had cheated on her. I asked for details, she refused to share.

Then things between Veronica and myself seemed better- for all of about a week.

Then we didn't see each other for a little, and Sam came back into her life, as well as another guy, we'll call him Ben. Sam and Ben were both pursuing Veronica and she was doing little to nothing to stop it. She then told me she didn't have feelings for anyone, and I just- didn't know where to go.

She asked me my worst heartbreak, and got mad when I said I didn't want to talk about it- ""it's clearly me. How did I break your heart?""

A bit later, I asked where we stood, and she told me it was up to me, but she didn't want to be exclusive anymore, as she didn't trust me with her heart because I kept not trusting her.

She also then informed me she was seeing Sam and dating Ben.

When I was out of town one night, she called me and told me she was gonna date Ben exclusively, just for the summer. I said that was fine, and that was it. I still love her, and I still want to be with her.

She's now long distance with Ben, and dating him for as long as it lasts.

One of her reasons for not formally dating me was ""I don't know I want to do long distance and I don't want to be on a time crunch""

Of a year and a half.

However.

Two days ago we were hanging out and I casually asked for details when Betty cheating on Veronica came up.

She informed me, ignoring that we'd been seeing each other at the time, that she'd gotten back with Betty, and they'd slept together, and Betty had then gone and slept with someone else.

This was the time when Veronica and Betty were being weird, and we almost stopped seeing each other because I was 'paranoid'.

I'm hurt and confused, and I don't know how to talk to Veronica about this. I still love her with all of me, but I no longer trust her, and I'm a bit mad, because she made me feel like I was crazy, and now I know I was right. Veronica and I are still very close friends; and I'm still in love with her.

TLDR;

I was seeing someone in secret, and we'd agreed to be exclusive. Situations kept arising that made me feel like she was seeing other people, and she denied the claims and got upset with me for not trusting her. I just found out that I was right. She and I are still very close friends, and I'm still in love with her.

What do I do?

Edit: Veronica has now, this evening, gotten angry with me for not being in full support of her and Ben's relationship. I've expressed that I'm glad she's happy with him, but she pushed for my opinion of him so I told her the truth- I don't know him well, but what I do know I'm not the biggest fan of. She's known that for a few months now, and I've tried really hard to be respectful and supportive, letting her speak to me, letting her ditch me if he called, listening to her and giving advice. She this evening got mad at me, as ""You could at least try to STAND him"".",12Sep2019,1
252,"Hi Reddit,

Recently I was offered a permanent contract at my current workplace where I make roughly $60k USD. I've been working here for just over two years on contracts spanning 3 - 12 months. I was really surprised, and a bit touched by the offer. Here's my dilemma; I have an opportunity to move overseas with my partner next year, working and travelling from a central location. I'd be making less money, and less secure - but I do have relatives in that country (and I am a citizen) as a safety net.

The thing is, a permanent contract sets me up for life. I always have a well-paying safety net. However, the opportunity to grow, travel and experience the world with my partner seems like a silly thing to pass up. When I mentioned this to my partner, they were happy for me that I received the offer, but understandably sad that I may not see the world with them.

What do I do? I have to take the risk right? I don't particularly love my job but it does allow me to pursue other interests while being financially stable. I also want to be with my partner forever, but I know long distance would put a strain on our relationship.

Please help me.",12Sep2019,1

Recently though I've had those feelings of sadness remembering my parents fighting and still fighting, and since I live with them it's an undying reminder.

256,"So this guy I was dating, we broke up in February. His choice. We had been off and on for about 4 years, and I thought he was going to be ‘it’ for me. I was completely in love with him, and believed all of his ‘we will be together forever’ talk, until he ended it, and then 2 weeks later starting dating someone else. I now know that I had thought it was more than it was, but it’s been more than 6 months, and I can’t stop thinking about him. I dream about him almost every night too. I subconsciously compare him to any potential dates. I know this seems silly, but how do I forget him/get over him? Does anyone have any advice because I’m starting to get really depressed. And then the dreams I have about him play on my mind. I’ve never felt this way about anyone before and it’s really starting to take its toll. Thanks :)",12Sep2019,1
257,"(Apologies for excessive length - I’m known to ramble. I’ll throw a tl;dr at the end)

So, earlier on this week I went over to a friend’s place. It was her birthday, so I took her a gift and the cake I’d baked her. While I was there, she invited me on an outing with her, her roommates, and some of her friends later on this week. Normally I’d be thrilled to have been invited anywhere. I’m not the most outgoing person, and I don’t have a lot of friends. Even with the friends I do have, if I don’t hit them up to make plans, 9/10 I’ll never see them. So to have someone actually ask me to do something with them, to want my presence and go out of their way to ask for it, always means a lot to me. Last time she invited me to do something, I ended up driving over 2 hours to get to the event because I was so keen on going with her, due to fear that if I screwed it up/didn’t go, maybe this one person who actually does invite me sometimes would stop doing so (and also because I wanted to see her, of course - she’s my friend, and I love her and want to spend time with her). Irrational, perhaps, but that’s how my brain works. 

This time, though, I’m having a lot of internal conflict about going with her. We’re back in the same city now (for university), so it would be a lot less effort than it was last time. So now you’re probably wondering why; if I was willing to go to such lengths to accept her invitation last time, why hesitate now? 

The answer lies in the nature of the invite. Last time it was to see Avengers: Endgame, and though I’m not a big Marvel fan, I’m also not against it (and it was a good movie + watching her react to everything as someone much more into it than I am was enjoyable too). This time, she wants to gather a bunch of her friends, go out to a nearby park, smoke a bunch of weed (it’s legal where we live, in case that was about to raise any red flags for anyone), and eat a bunch of Taco Bell. Now, I love Taco Bell as much as the next guy (and probably more than a lot), but it’s the other part that’s giving me hesitation.

I don’t understand why, and I’ve never been able to figure it out, but there’s something about certain people drinking/smoking/whatever that bothers me. For other people, it doesn’t affect me - it’s only certain ones. I had a group of roommates a while back who had entire days where they’d do nothing but sit around taking bong hits and playing video games all day. That never bugged me. One of my absolute best friends is a total stoner who has a tendency to rip at least 2-3 bowls on any given visit I do to her place. Totally chill about that, too. Yet, for some reason I cannot for the life of me put my finger on, when she or her one roommate (also a friend of mine) do it, it gets to me. Whenever I’m texting one of them and they mention being high, I’ll try to lead the conversation to an end as quickly as I can without being too obvious about it. I don’t know why I’m like this (if anyone has any thoughts on that, I’ll take advice on it as well), and it makes me feel like a total asshole. Obviously I’d never say anything about it to either of them, or try to tell them not to do it (I’m not some controlling jerk who tries to dictate what his friends can and cannot do), but I still feel like an awful person for the fact that it even does bother me. 

So I’ve been invited to go watch a bunch of people get high (I was told I don’t have to smoke if I don’t want to) and all eat Taco Bell (that one was non-negotiable; if I do go, eating Taco Bell is a must). For reasons outlined above, I really don’t want to do this. I’d rather just stay home, put my phone somewhere hard to get at so I won’t be too tempted to try to contact either of them, and do whatever to kill the time on my own. However, I also don’t want to say no. When she first invited me, the roommate who’s also a friend of mine told me it wasn’t a spur of the moment decision - she’d been thinking of inviting me for like a week already. Like I said before, it always means a lot to me when anyone invites me to do anything, and I don’t want to give her incentive to stop doing so. Besides which, she’s very important to me, and I don’t want to hurt/upset/disappoint her. However, my poker face sucks, so if I did go, I’m not entirely confident that I could pull off the “yes, of course I’m having a good time and want to be here” act for any length of time. So, people of reddit, I have two questions. 

1. Do I suck it up and go, or do I bow out? 

2. (This is the one that’s really causing some mental turbulence for me tonight): if I do decide not to go, how do I break it to her? The plan is tentatively set for Saturday night, and it’s Wednesday night/early Thursday morning as I type this. Do I tell her sooner than later, or do I hold off until day of? Do I straight up tell her that I don’t want to go, and explain my reasoning (not necessarily “hey, you smoking bugs me”, but maybe just “it’s not really my type of thing”)? Or do I just say something along the lines of “sorry, I can’t make it” and give no detail?

In short, how do I go about this, and if I end up having to, how do I break the fact that I’m not going to her in the gentlest way possible to try to avoid hurting her feelings/disappointing her too much?

260,"So, no idea how to start this, but I'll do my best. Be me a guy who typically doesn't get interested in many girls where I'm from. I downloaded tinder to try and see what I could get, low and behold after weeks of swiping, I've found one and managed to get her number. Eventually, we decided to meet up at college and we went out to eat together and we have a kinda routine for the week, where we meet up and hang out and go eat. 

We will call her Amy. Amy is just my type and stunningly beautiful, with just the right kind of personality to me. I feel myself slowly growing closer to her, something I havent felt in 3 years (my last serious relationship). The shortness of breath, the fumbling of words, and generally not knowing what to do. Its to the point that my friends notice. 

After around three weeks I need to tell her how I feel, so after lunch I decide to tell her that ""I have a thing for her"" She seems taken aback slightly, but has figured this out for sometime. She replys that she isn't looking for anything right now, but doesn't want her answer to stop how our relationship is going. 

Slightly relieved that she knows I like her, Im able to sleep a wee bit better at night, though here's where my problem begins. 

I understand how to stop myself from being around someone. Stop meeting up, stop texting, get away from their social media, I know how to do it, but I'm in this weird limbo, where I still really like her and I don't want my feelings getting in the way of our friendship, or if I can even handle a friendship with her. The only time my heart feels better is if I'm with her or if I'm asleep. Now I'm getting to the point where Im constantly checking if she messaged me back, or if she's opened my snapchat and the really devastating thought is I want to check her bitmoji to see if she's on or not. 

I HATE that I'm thinking like that, I'm not sure if I can handle her offers of either generosity or genuinely wanting to hang out. 

I need another perspective looking inward and something more than ""Obvi this is toxic for you, just leave"" I want to see if this sounds like she wants to wait to see if she wants to date me or if I've truely been friendzoned.",12Sep2019,1

265,"So my husband and I both have our own individual plans through sprint. He spends about $150/month for a 1 line plan and I’m spending $360 for a 4 line plan (shared with my sister and parents for sister’s phone and parents tablets). My sister doesn’t use the phone anymore (it broke so she just got a cheap Walmart pay as you go type) and my parents can use their home WiFi to run the tablets. My husband and I recently started using YNAB and it drives me crazy to see all that money go to sprint. This seems like the perfect time to switch carriers since we’re not happy with the coverage in our home either (1-2 bars in downtown of a mid-sized city in Michigan). 

I need advice on how to switch carriers because we’ve gotten conflicting information. We want to switch to Cricket, he will need a new phone and I want to keep mine (although I’m not against upgrading if absolutely necessary). We both leased our phones through sprint and they are all paid off (minus the “final payment” you do when you upgrade or buy it fully, to do that it’ll be a total of about $300, so still less than I’m paying per month). 

I read online that there’s a way to get sprint to unlock our phones and then cancel so there’s no extra fees. My husband spoke with one Cricket representative who said we would have to straight up purchase new phones for both of us because our phones won’t work on Cricket’s network. I spoke with a representative at a different location who said we just have to ask sprint to unlock the phone but that will charge ridiculous fees.

269,"So I need a little advice. I’ll cross post to a advice sub too 

Okay so I’ve had this issue on my mind for the longest time. 

Alright so I’m a male, 20 currently serving in the military. I enlisted for 2 reasons. 1. My shitty parents situation and 2. I didn’t really know what I wanted to do in life. 

I was going to college for a psychology major along with a nutrition program thing family consumer sciences. The thing is, I absolutely cannot stand math. I hate it and I’m horrible at it. It’s one of the reasons I took the major I did. I still didn’t exactly “like” I did like my major but like I didn’t if it makes sense? It’s kinda of a it’s what I liked the most.. 

So I enlisted in the marine corps. The less shitty job field i thought of was logistics. I was given a job as a 2311 otherwise known as an ammo technician. 

Again, I don’t “like” my profession but I don’t hate it either. At this point I’ll be 23? By the time I get out p late to be changing around. 

Currently with my training I can get a job with a base salary of around 70k year. If I complete my bachelors (but in business) I’ll be making a little more but it varies from state to state. DC being the highest paying and CA (my home stage and preferred state) being one of the higher paying ones at around 100k a year. 

Now, I work with obviously classified shit/ hazardous shit/ transporting those munitions/ different hazard classes etc. so obviously, there’s always more training you could get. If I keep getting training in my job field by the time I get out I could have some very uh.. “expensive” training under my belt which is obviously preferred when looking for a job and having that training you could open up more job fields. 

So the thing is, keep looking for something I honestly like and not just “don’t hate” or, keep going and make some bank while potentially sacrificing happiness. 

At this point i think it’s worth mentioning I have depression I always speculated it was the reason for me not being able to find a profession I honestly liked. 

Also, I’m barely a year in the corps. I have 3 years to go which could be a long time to get costly training for free while I’m in",12Sep2019,1

Recently my dad told me I have to follow his rules or move out, and I want to move out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently moved back home after being moved out for half a year. I moved out for the same reasons, very strict parenting. My mother promised to be less strict if I moved back, with me working and going to school and I am, but obviously she did not keep her end of the deal. Honestly, living on my own was very difficult to do but I would rather do it again and tough it out for it to get better than having to deal with my family for any longer than I need to, especially after them proving that they only see me as a child that ""belongs"" to them at 21 years old.

I have a job that I should start in about one to two weeks that pays 17 an hour and I'd be working around 30 hours a week. 

I have no savings at all, and if I move out I will have no car (I borrow my mom's currently but I help pay insurance)  and no phone.

I am willing to follow the ""rules"" to be able to stay here for a bit longer to save money to move out, but I am scared. How can I make this entire process easier? I will have to do school full time and be able to work 30+ hours a week. Part of me wants to stay because I know it's hard to do, but I really do not want to be treated like a child and forced to have a curfew or threatened to be locked out of the house if I arrive past 10 p.m. I don't know if I can manage this all. What can I do? Or what should I do

274,"***TW: Rape &amp; Suicide***

&amp;#x200B;

First I have to mention my BF isn't some sort of asshole who thinks triggers are stupid. He respects me when I'm having a breakdown, though he has a hard time understanding why something may have triggered me. I find it hard to explain to him why or how something has triggered me as well. I suuuuuck at putting my feelings into words. 

Lately, he's been watching some shows that include a lot of content related to rape and suicide. I've been doing a pretty good job keeping it together, but these shows just generally make me highly uncomfortable. In the past, one of his shows (a different one) did end up triggering me into a panic attack because it showed a full-on rape scene and he avoided watching it while I was around. I appreciated that. But now he's watching these new shows with those kinds of content. He doesn't really think about it. It's just a plot device in a show for him and it doesn't really occur to him that it might be affecting me. Not that he doesn't care, he's just not thinking about it like that.

I can definitely just straight up ask him to not watch those shows around me, but I don't think it's very fair for me to continuously limit what he watches around me. He generally enjoys the dark and edgy shows, and I don't think it's very nice of me to tell him he can't watch any of those shows around me because something MIGHT trigger me.

What I'm asking here is how do I tell him in a way that won't make him feel like I'm refusing to let him watch anything he enjoys when I'm around? And how should I deal with these shows when he does want to watch them without possibly just completely leaving the room?

So today I found out my little brother whois currently 12 years old, he is in high school, well in Mexico it's called high school i don't know about other countries. well the point is, he has severe anxiety, ADHD and early symptoms of depression. and today at school he stimulated his penis in class, nothing to severe, just rubbing himself, and i know he does this when he has an anxiety attack or so my mom told me. so some girls in his class noticed and told him to stop rubbing himself and he just kept doing it.

the school called my parents, they talked to the principal and the prefect? i think its called that. and told them that the girls felt ""harassed"".

now my parents are talking to him about this, and they told him that its ok to touch yourself, its normal and natural but there are times and places to do it.

so this is about today.

but...

i know he has been doing this since the daycare, he was so little and he would stimulate himself, when he was about 4 years old my parents took him to a psychiatrist and he has medication for his ADHD and anxiety. he has been doing this for a long time to cope with his anxiety and he doesn't seem to understand that he cant do it in public. even now he is 12 years old he doesn't quite get it, and i don't know why. he doesn't have mental retardation or autism, actually, he is just a normal 12-year-old boy, he is so smart but yet he has trouble in school because of his ADHD.

i want to help him, but i don't know how, i know people at that age can be harmful to others and now my parents are hoping he can get school again, they suspended him for about 3 days i think.

now i know that what happened today is due to him not taking his medication, don't get me wrong my parents always buy his medication and are constantly taking him to his psychiatrist, but here in Mexico ADHD is seen a not so normal thing, my parents struggle to find medication and its not even about the money, its because there isnt medication in Mexico! not a single one! its been about 2 months without the medication, and my parents dont know what to do, we cant buy in USA because we aren't citizens.

he has gone through a lot of medications and none seems to help with his anxiety, there is always that, he had Prozac, Vyvanse and others! but the thing is that there isnt in mexico right now! and even if there where we cant buy it because laws in mexico prohibit buying controlled meds from mail, like if we ordered it from mexico city they won't let it trough the mail because its against the law!

please im desperate! what can i do for him? how can i talk to him?

and if you have any other meds you recommend or your own experiences please share so i can tell him what he can do.

Edit 1: I talked to my mom 10 mins ago and she told me it wasn't more than one girl that saw him. It was one girl and that girl told 4 other girls at recess.

He had meds like Prozac, Vyvanse,Ritalin,concerta and I don't remember the other names. But none has helped him right with his anxiety.

I know what he did was wrong and I don't know how to make him understand that he can't do it in public.

I don't know if he doesn't really get it or if his ADHD makes him have trouble with it.

280,"My old car (2000 Acura 3.2TL) with over 250K miles on it is about to kick the bucket and I’ve been searching for about a year for a used car. Right now, I have about $8,000 in savings designated for a used car. I’m also planning on selling the Acura for a couple thousand if I can so there’s that as well.
I found a Nissan Leaf that’s $10,000, has 30k miles on it, had one owner, and has the carfax and everything. Test drove it and everything checks out. It’s sold by a reputable dealer as well. The Leaf also has free maintenance on the battery and power train by Nissan for the next couple of years because it’s still under warranty. There’s also a state law in my state that deals with getting a free battery if you’re buying an EV secondhand which is pretty sick too.
My current commute takes me from home to college and work which is about 25 miles away (50 roundtrip) a day for 5 days a week and it’s been eating my money in gas. I thought getting an EV would be the logical solution. There are EV chargers on campus and at my work for free as well.
Currently, I make roughly $1300 a month, I live at home with parents and most of my expenses are covered (except for food and medical visits/appointments for myself).
Would it be realistic for me to finance it as a part-time worker and full-time college student if I put $5,000 down and pay monthly payments of $200 for a 24 month period at a 4% APR? 
My parents also cover my auto, but it would have to be upgraded to full auto coverage if I was financing so I would be paying $100 extra a month to help them out. The total I would be paying per month would be about $300 give or take over a 24 month period.
I got lucky with the current beater I have; it’s lasted me 3 years. But I don’t want to get unlucky if I look for another $3,000-$5,000 preowned car and get trapped in the cycle of repairing or buying used cars. This car checks out and can be repaired under the warranty. 
Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",12Sep2019,1
281,"Honestly at times I think I’d be better off in prison. I got fired from my job I tried so hard to keep and recently got a promotion as a shift supervisor. I was so happy about it I moved to a new town with high hopes and I ruined it over a stupid confrontation that got me fired.

Honestly I do this with all my jobs every year I either leave or mess it up.

284,"I have a friend that I met through my dance classes around a month ago. We are not super close, but we do chat a bit on messenger outside of classes. 

Sometimes when we chat, he talks about how behind he is in his class work (we both attend the same university), how he never manages to go to lectures, always procrastinates doing assignments etc.., but he has always seemed okay and just laughs it off usually. Every so often I will ask him if he is doing okay, because I just had this feeling sometimes that he wasn't, but he has always said he's fine. 

He is one of those very chatty, very bubbly charismatic people who most people at my university would know, or at least know of, so he has tones of friends. But it does make me wonder if it would be hard for him to be feeling down or anything around them, since they all just know him as this happy, laid-back guy.

Anyway, the other night we were messaging, and he said he was feeling a bit down. When I asked him about it, he said it was this feeling he gets sometimes that makes him super unmotivated to do things, and it bothers him. He said he just suddenly starts not caring if he doesn't do his work or fulfil his obligations, and how he cancelled his dance lesson the other day because he just didn't want to leave the house. I asked if he had any other friends who know he feels that way sometimes, and he said he doesn't; I'm the only person he has ever told. I confirmed that he was okay, and that he didn't need me to come get him or anything (I take things like this very seriously), and then asked if he wanted to keep talking or if he wanted me to leave him alone. He said he was going to bed. So, I just told him to let me know if he ever needs anything because it was okay to feel down, but he doesn't have to go around feeling down all by himself.

Since then, we haven't really talked about it, and when I have asked if he's okay he kind of changes the subject, and it seems like he doesn't really want to talk to me. My dance teacher told me that he cancelled his lesson again yesterday, and then today we were meant to practice dance together, but he said he had to study because he found out he had an exam next week. But I'm pretty sure that is a lie, because the exam period for my university doesn't start for another few weeks. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this situation? I don't want to annoy him by messaging him all the time to ask if he's okay. But I feel like the feeling he has described is a little more than just feeling down. I have struggled with depression and things in the past, and what he has described feels very familiar to me, but I could just be being dramatic? I am wondering if him telling me may have been an attempt to reach out though, like to get some support or something? But now I feel like he doesn't want to talk to me. Should I keep messaging him? Or just leave him alone for a while?",12Sep2019,1

286,"So, like the title says, I have this coworker that keeps calling and texting my personal number to ask me to take or switch shifts. We are medical professionals (She is 40, I am 28). I dont remember giving her my number and I'm not too fond of this person in the first place. I'm hoping for some advice on how to handle this as professionaly and politely as possible. The first time this happened I was out of town (home visiting my immediate family whom I only see at Christmas and a week during summer) and happened to be at my grandparents house for tea and card games. She called and I didn't answer, so she called again 10 mins later. Again, I didnt answer. I'm spending valuable time with my grandparents. Then she texts asking ""can you please pick up my shift tomorrow please plz please plz."" A few hours later I text back ""sorry *name* I'm out of town"". Fine. I dont mind if you really need a shift taken once in a blue moon to call me (even though I am pretty sure i never gave you my number). So then a week later while I am spending quality time with my partner (we are both working students so rarely have time to see eachother this past year), she calls. I dont answer. She leaves a voice mail with an urgent tone of voice. ""Hey hun I really need you to call me. It's really important that I get a hold of you right away. Please call me when you get this"". So I call her back after our date. She says oh sorry hun I was going to see if you could work the 14th but you already do no worries. Um. No worries? You tried to manipulate me into calling you right away by making it seem urgent when all you wanted was a shift covered thats more than a week away. Then another 6 days later, you'll never guess what happened... she calls me! I dont answer. This time because quite frankly I just dont want to. So, she texts me ""hey hun can you give me a call when you get a chance please"". Three hours later she calls again and texts again two more times ""hey hun can you call me"" "" or text me"". I'm feeling pretty harrassed honestly. I'm a very introverted person and find phone calls from people I didn't give my number to very intrusive. I realize some might think I'm overreacting but for me this is crossing boundaries. How to address this without being rude or a pushover and remaining professional??? Any input is appreciated.",12Sep2019,1

290,"Hello, r/Advice. I'm having a huge problem in my life, that's been boiling up for a couple years. I am massively depressed. I have not been technically diagnosed with it, but I've looked into many symptoms on different sources, and I have almost every symptom. I'm suicidal, rarely eat or go out, have very few friends or close family, I'm quick to anger, unbearably lonely, and I put 0 effort into my life. I often skip showers, because I have nobody to impress. My room is a mess, because nobody ever visits me and I don't care enough to clean up. I sleep 12+ hours a day. I don't have a job, and have no urge to get one (I can barely talk to strangers without shaking). This would all be okay with me if I had someone to talk to about it openly but alas, I do not. I'm not using any real names, but the 3 people I trust most in my life are my best friend, Jake, my sister, Jesse, and my mother. 

I can't talk to Jake about these things because he has a very complicated life. His brother actually did suffer from depression and later took his life, which was horrible for him as it was for me. I don't want to hurt him with news about me going through it too.

I can't talk to Jesse because while she loves me dearly, is horribly judgmental and poor with advice. 

I can't talk to my mother, because she has already lost a son, my brother, and seeing me like this would literally break her. I believe she would actually be unable to live with it.

I have other friends, but nobody I trust. I've tried therapy, but I can't really afford it because, again, no job. I simply have nobody to speak to about it. I play video games quite a bit, and I have some internet friends, but unfortunately they are not much for help. At this point, I'm so overwhelmed and disgusted by my life that I just want to end it. I've given lots of thought to it, I've even made pros and cons lists about me doing it or not. The only real con is I would hurt people around me, specifically the 3 people I have mentioned. 

The problem is, I don't think having someone to talk to would help. There's just too many problems that can't be solved, or I don't want solved. I guess what I'm asking is, where to go from here? Because in my eyes, this only ends one way. I'm so certain that it will, that I often shake off responsibilities in the long term, thinking, ""well I'm going to kill myself eventually, so this doesn't matter""

Honestly, I don't even know if I can have my mind changed at this point.",12Sep2019,2

298,"Hey Reddit, I’m a first time user. (I apologise for this length post, but it’s a shit-storm.)
I made a Throwaway Account simply for the desperate need of advice. I don’t know what to do, or even if my current relationship with My Mother can be repaired.
Some much needed context to understand the situation: I’m 18, Female, and My Mother (49 Years Of Age) and I recently moved into an apartment together, due to a serious domestic dispute with My Father. (Physical/Verbal Abuse towards myself escalated one night, whilst I was home alone, and I escaped and called a Family Member.) (I literally begged My Mother to skip the Bingo Session and to stay at home with me, but she told me to not over-react and that I’ll be fine. I resented her for this, but she did apologise for this a month or two later, which I accepted.) (I also suffer from Severe OCD, which I’ve greatly improved on and am still trying to improve on.) (We had to live with said Family Member for almost six/seven months, before finally being able to move into the apartment.)
Anyways, I know that after the incident, she was able to become free and date whoever she wanted to, which was completely fine with me. I only want her to be happy, and confident within herself as a person.
Basically, she accepted any attention that she got, with hundreds of men sending messages and/or friend requests daily. Even if these men were pretty sketchy or had any obvious red flags, she knew this, and she’d still accept and talk to them. But whatever, I rolled with things.
I helped out to pay with things, and I’d give her any money that she might’ve needed, because that’s Family, it’s what you do to help out, and I’d be contributing towards certain bills, etc.
I’ll get to the point; Recently, she became extremely involved with someone who resides in France. (We’ll call him Marc, obviously it’s a fake name.)
My Mum decided that after talking daily and nightly with this guy, she was completely smitten, and desperately wanted to meet him in person, which is great. I was supportive, but told her to be careful and be safe.
I’ll be honest, I wanted it to be us for awhile, maybe for a year or two, but that’s unfair to her, and I have no fucking right to say when she can/cannot date someone. We couldn’t really afford for her to be travelling to France, since she was already using the credit card for certain things. But it’s her income, she can do whatever she wants with it.
Anyways, I went along with this and supported her, as much as I could, but I had the feeling that she was lying to me about some things. We recently had an argument about a payment for the Car, and she needed the money from me. I was sure that she’d already asked me for the money for the car before, so I mentioned that, and she exploded with anger, saying “I don’t need to justify myself to you. Fuck him (My Dad) and fuck you.”
So, I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, but I couldn’t shake off the feeling. She frequently ignored me, and talked away to Marc.
I learnt that My Mum had drunkenly slept with My Dad one drunken night. I was disappointed, but mistakes happen, and she didn’t even want me to know about it. But, My Dad let it slip, because it was giving him false hope, even though she said that she clearly stated to him that it wouldn’t ever happen again.
My Dad accepted this, and I tried to support him since he was committed to changing himself as a person. (Whether or not this falls through, I don’t know, but all I can do is try to be supportive of his willingness to change for himself.)
Blah Blah Blah, My Mum travels to France. I still have this weird feeling that she’s lying to me about some things, but I try to shake it off and be supportive of Herself &amp; Marc.
I told her to be careful, and that if she was going to do anything, to use protection. She said “I know, I’m not a whore.”
She comes back from France, and she’s avoiding me a little. She didn’t really talk to me, or discuss how things went, saying that things were just “Romantic.”
I know that My Mum tended to make some extremely irresponsible and avoidable decisions, (she’s made countless stupid decisions throughout her life.) and I knew that she was probably hiding something from me. I considered talking to her about it, but I knew that she wouldn’t be honest with me about anything, so to get to the truth, I regretfully decided to read through the messages between Herself and Marc.
I wish I hadn’t, I know it was extremely morally wrong of me, and I violated her privacy, but I desperately needed to know the truth.
It turns out that, she didn’t use any protection, and she could possibly be pregnant because of this. She asked him “Do you want a child?” “I didn’t want another child with him (My Dad) but with you, I will embrace this miracle.” “She’s (me) eighteen, she’s an adult, she’s fine.” “Whatever will be, God will provide for our Love. We’re good people.”
I was broken by those messages, would she really bring another kid into the world like this? Why wouldn’t she use protection after already going through an abortion at a young age? Why is she doing all of this? Why is she saying all of these things?
I was trying not to be shocked, angry, and disappointed. I muffled my cries of pain, as I tried to control myself. I had no right to find this out in the first place, but reading those things, fucking hurt.
But, I’m an adult now, right? I shouldn’t expect her to comfort me, or explain things, I’m not a kid anymore. I can’t interfere with her life like this.
I heard her say from across the apartment “What’s wrong with you, why are you crying? Did you watch something on TV?”
I lied that I was fine, and decided to use the excuse of taking out the trash to go for a much needed walk. I needed to get out of there and calm the fuck down.
I walk it off, and cried harshly to myself, with an immense conflict in my mind. Why did I even read those messages? I’m so wrong for doing that. But, she seems so eager to leave everything and everyone behind, even me.
Yadda Yadda Yadda, I walk around for thirty minutes or so, before deciding that I should go back to the apartment. I walk in, and she questions me, but doesn’t ask if I’m okay or anything. Just “Why are you crying? Why are you acting so weirdly?”
I say that I’m fine, and she once again shrugs things off, I go to the bathroom and my eyes are red as fuck. I sit on the couch and contemplate what to do. How should I talk to her about this?
I knew that it was late, and I didn’t wanna be the reason that she was tired for work in the morning. So, I decided that I’d hold off, and that I’d discuss this with her tomorrow. Regardless, she comes into to Living Room after hearing me try to cover up the sound of my crying, and begins questioning me, asking what’s wrong, etc.
I tell her to go to bed, and that I can’t do this right now. I tell her that she has work in the morning, and she needs to sleep. She says: “Well, I can’t go to sleep like this, can I?” Me: “Why, am I keeping you awake?” Mum: “Yes, you are actually, but I’m worried about you. What? What is it?”
I finally relent, and say that I’ll spill the beans, but she needs to be calm, etc. I say “I’ll understand if you wanna kick me out.” (It is HER apartment, and whilst I’m paying some rent money to her, I’m eighteen and should be standing on my own two feet anyways.)
She says that she isn’t going to kick me out, and to “Just tell me what’s wrong.” I spill everything, and say that I know it was wrong of me, but I needed to find out the truth.
Keeping a calm demeanour, she says “Yeah, I didn’t use protection, I trust him. It’s my decision. If I’m pregnant, then I’ll do what I did last time. I’m living in a fantasy, I haven’t been swept away by Romance like this before, and I wouldn’t actually do the things that I said in those messages.”
Me: “Okay, but why would you still say those things? Why didn’t you use protection, when you of all people should know how fucking important it is?”
My Mum: “It’s not for you to decide, I’m the adult, I’m almost fifty, it’s not gonna happen. You don’t discuss your sex life with your kids. I hid this from you because I knew this would be your reaction.”
Me: “But, all it takes is once! Plus, using protection also protects you from STD’s, etc. Didn’t you think about that?”
My Mum: “Well, if I get anything, then I’ll know it’s from him. Stop throwing a temper tantrum and grow up.”
Me: Excuse me? I’m not throwing a temper tantrum, you’re being extremely irresponsible. You could’ve easily avoided a potential second abortion, and just because you trust him, it doesn’t mean that it’s okay. I know it’s your decision, but I’m trying to advise you about this basic knowledge.”
My Mum: “You and Your Dad don’t want me to be happy, Marc makes me happy. I trust him, you can’t control other people.”
This goes back and fourth for awhile, as her trying to defend/justify her actions. I clearly tell her that that this has hurt me, and I explain that she’s so eager to leave the country and myself. I tell her that I’m trying to be supportive and understand things, but it’s taking a toll on me emotionally, along with the mental health issues and other family problems, etc.
She interrupts me, and says “Oh stop playing the victim, get a grip and get over it. Poor you!”
I ask her to explain how I’m playing the victim, or what I may be doing to be playing the victim, and she retorts with simple answers “With what you just said”
I become angry, because at this point, we are emotionally disconnected. I’ve tried connecting with her for months, and asking how her day was, etc, if she needed to talk about anything, but she wouldn’t ask those questions back, and wouldn’t even acknowledge my presence at times.
So, I angrily say “You know what? You’re right, I can’t control others, or the consequences to their actions. If you wanna make avoidable mistakes, then go ahead, I’m disconnecting myself emotionally from it.”
My Mum: “Yeah, that’s good.”
Me: “We’ll just co-exist together, I guess. I’m detaching myself from this, and I’m gonna let you do whatever you want. I just wanted to make sure that you were safe, and that you were being responsible, because I genuinely care about you.”
At this point, something snaps in her, and she throws a tantrum. “Fine! Whatever! I know you’re disgusted of me, I know you think I’m a whore. You’ve clearly written me off. ‘We’ll co-exist together’? Fine, I’m done. We will co-exist together. Now if you excuse me, I am tired, and I’m going to bed.”
I didn’t want to end things like that, and told her that I wanted to talk things out, but she completely ignored me, and stormed off.
So, here I am, at 2:09am, writing this post. I know I should apologise for reading those messages, I already did so in that conversation, but it doesn’t hurt to apologise twice, right?
I don’t know what to do. We’re so emotionally distanced from one another, and I don’t know if I can trust her anymore. Maybe I do need to be more mature, and stop being so involved within her life? It’s not like I’m the one getting attached to this guy. If she makes these mistakes, their her’s alone to deal with.
But, I genuinely care about her well-being. I want her to be happy, and I want to be supportive. This “Marc” is extremely sketchy to me, from what I already know that she’s told me. I definitely don’t like him.
Maybe I’m sounding like a whiny eighteen year old, I’m extremely unsure of what to do. Will she even forgive me?
It’s a huge internal conflict. I’d greatly appreciate any advice that you’d be willing to give. Even if it may seem somewhat brutal, I’d appreciate the truth, and the truth alone.
Thanks.",12Sep2019,2

301,"(Long read, I'll put a TLDR)

I came out as transgender over a year ago and soon after I came out to my parents and friends, I got the courage to come out to my grandparents. They've always been in my life in one way or another and pretty much always will be, so I knew I had to come out to them.
I wrote them this awesome letter that I was seriously hoping would help them understand. It was around two pages, edited and proofreaded, and I even listed several resources they could look at to help or inspirations of mine so that maybe the could see there are other trans people besides Caitlyn Jenner. Even though they live ten minutes away, I would never have the guts to tell them in person and I was afraid of my grandfather.
I set it on their porch, knocked on the door, and fucking booked it back to my car down the street.
As I expected, they took it horribly. The cited their religion and stuff like that and said some pretty awful things that still hurt me to this day. They said I was being controlled by the devil and that was why I'm trans and cited some other stuff that I don't even want to go into. 
I knew they wouldn't take it well, but it still felt like a shotgun blast to chest. I'd already had some pretty negative reactions from some people, so I was really beat down. 
Upon hearing what they said, my mom and stepdad got really angry and we all just didn't talk to them for a month. Eventually they came back and it blew over. I'd bring it up occasionally, because it still bothers me, and my mom would yell at me about patience and giving them time. As much as I love my grandparents, I've kind of resented them. I hated myself for it, but they were everything I hated and vice versa, and I just wanted them to say that so we can all stop pretending we like each other. The whole thing just got swept under the rug and it angered me.

Recently, my grandfather really surprised me. It was his birthday over the weekend, so I sent him a text saying happy birthday. He texted back that he loved me, ""his last grandson"", which just pissed me off and made me really sad. I can never be his beloved grandson. I never was. 
The day after, my family and I go out to eat with them. I didn't really like it, but I talked and tried to interact with everybody regardless.
The next day, my grandfather sent me a really long text. That's already very unusual, because my grandfather doesn't text much. He thanked me for coming to his birthday and said that though he can't relate to what I'm feeling, he's open to talk. That was the gist, at least.
It came as a complete surprise and now I don't know what to do. 
For one, we are polar opposites. He's a conservative red-hatter and I'm a transgender anarchist. I don't know how I wouldn't even begin to explain what dysphoria is, why I'm transitioning, what led up to my coming out, etc. This would be a completely knew concept to him, to someone who isn't all too welcoming to the LGBT community in the first place.
Secondly, I'm afraid of him. I'm generally very quiet (compared to my family, at least), so I don't know what to say to him. That's why I write music or make stories, because that's how I communicate. He's very intimidating to me. He's loud, fucking huge, and terrifying to me. I might not be able to articulate what I'm trying to say solely because I'm afraid to speak.
I'm also afraid it might be a lost cause. He's family, but this might be one of those things that he will never be able to grasp, like how he doesn't understand why I like punk rock and my social anxiety or how programming and google works.

I'm probably just being an idiot, but I don't know what to do. I obviously have to reach out to him, but how, and where do we even go from there?

302,"we’re freshman in college. out of state for both of us and we come from different states. we met online in some class of 2023 type group on facebook.

so we have been snapchatting each other pretty much all day every day for the past 2 months. i told her over snapchat that I like her, and it was out of no where. I said “I wanna tell you something” then I threw it at her. she said something like “aww no way really” and I said “it doesn’t seem like you feel the same way”. then she said “i’m kinda talking to someone from back home, but I do”. after that, I was honestly shook so I said “wait really? you do feel the same?” and that’s when she started saying she doesn’t know. 

this was about a week ago. the next day we were snapping pics back and forth and I brought it up again. I said “i’m sorry if what i told you the other night was too forward” and she replied with a simple “nah you’re good!!” so I told her i’m still curious about her feelings. again she said she doesn’t know. I then told her “seriously no hard feelings if it’s a no, but i’m obviously very curious.” she said “I just don’t really know what i’m looking for right now” and I was like it’s cool, I get it. she also said something along the lines of “you’re the most chill and nice guy I know”. which sounds like the dreaded friend zone.

I obviously like this girl a lot, but I have no idea how to handle this situation. I feel like if she didn’t have feelings for me, she would have told me that especially after I told her no hard feelings if she doesn’t. another thought in the back of my mind is that maybe she’s just too kind and polite to drop the no on me. either way i’m still dying to know. 

if I knew it was a hard no I would be able to move on, but I can’t move on thinking that there might be something there, you know? I wish she’d be more straight up with me and just give me a yes or no. i don’t want to corner her though and force her to make a decision. i’m not sure how and when I should bring it up again, if I should. 

also I know i’m a fucking idiot for trying to figure out her feelings instead of just asking her out on the spot lol that’s why i’m wondering if it’s too late or if I should just ask her out, maybe wait a little while.",12Sep2019,1
303,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for two years, known each other for five. Her dream has always been to go to University and she waited a bit and now is doing it! I’m so proud of her to! But along with that comes a daunting amount of fear and change. I’m frightened because I feel like I might not be good enough for her and she might end up finding a uni guy and I’m trying to get better at trusting myself that it’ll be okay. But with her going to uni, I don’t get to see her a lot and it sucks because we recently had gone through a bit of a rough time and we got out of it really well and with better understanding of what had happened emotionally to one another  and that we love each other more because we’ve been putting in effort cause we want to work and hopefully one day get married. I’m still a little fresh on the wound side of things, I just don’t want to push her away by not giving her space but at the same time I want to see her. I’m really not sure how to deal with so much change so fast and I’m scared that’ll it drive her away. Today for example, we got to see each other for about twenty minutes and I got bummed out because in all honesty I had been looking forward the whole day to see her. I ruined those twenty minutes though by being all sad and I told her I was sorry and I explained to her what I’m writing here but I still feel like I might have pushed her away. I just want to know how to adapt and grow so that I can support her in school and also be happy that she’s there even when I don’t get to see her often.",12Sep2019,2

305,"this is kind if a long story. im going to call my crush C, my friend F, and my other two friends F2 and F3.

 alright, ever since 6th grade I've been fairly close friends with F. F and I are both pretty shy people, we are kind of quiet and so we just chill, getting a little more talkative by ourselves. F and I also have the same birthday, and we both have an older brother in the grade above us. so F and I are friends, and my brother and C are friends. I've known C for a few years, and we have also become friends. maybe not bestest friends but close enough. I don't know when it was, but I started falling really really hard for C. idk how C feels about me, but he always is laughing with me and making jokes, we smile a lot and make stupid eye contact while tposing at each other. dumb stuff, with the occasional 1am convo under the stars(I'll talk about that later). anyway, im always afraid that if I ever try to go for C, like to date, F would be uncomfortable. I've seen C date other girls who were associated with F and she didn't really care, but idk how it would be because the 3 of us talk at lunch every day. but ive fallen for C so hard, it's almost unreal. I was thinking of him so much in class I was just smiling really big at the wall. I didn't even know I was doing it, and F2 had to ask me if I was high or something, and seemed worried. I think it's funny but also embarrassing. I haven't told anyone about this crush because I know my friends besides from his sister F, all don't like him or just think he's ugly. Which I think is rude, he has such a good personality. anyway, I don't know what to do about C. idk  if he likes me, if he ever will, if he even wants to be closer friends with me. I don't exactly have much experience dating (we're all in highschool) but he does, which intimidates me a bit because i really don't want him to think I'm stupid if I do... anything stupid. haha. there was this one night I slept over at Fs house with F2 and F3. We were all on Fs trampoline jumping, then sitting and chatting, jumping again. until it got super late. F, and F2 went inside, while I was outside with F3 and C. we were all just talking and having fun, making jokes, and talking about crushes a bit. C talked about how he got confessed to but turned them down, blah blah blah and all that. F3 talked about her crush and I kinda didn't share my own story but commented on theirs, because what was I meant to do? haha. anyway, F3 was called inside for whatever reason, and I was with C, under the pretty stars, sitting on a trampoline together. it was the best night I'd had in a long long time. We just talked. about anything. I loved it. we were out so late that C and I were called back in by C and Fs parents. F, F2 and F3 didn't really seem to notice I was gone, which was fine with me, because that would've been a weird conversation to have. any way, I've just had so many great moments at school and out of school with C. I really like him for his personality, his passions, his singing, his dreams, and even his looks. just everything is great. But idk what to about him being my brothers friend and my best friends friend. C is amazing and I don't want to lose him. I don't want him to be distant, but I dont want to make everyone around me uncomfortable. If you read that all then damn god bless you, I rant a lot.

307,"As always, on mobile. I'm extremely shaken up and it's almost 2AM so forgive me if this is scattered.

Background information: I have 3 cats. I live with my parents in the only bed room upstairs, and I have an attached bathroom. My bedroom doesn't have a door. Last night, I slept at my boyfriends house, which i do often. I left around 4PM, and there's been somone at home ever since then. I returned around 1PM today. We live out in the country, so we don't lock the door and my dad owns guns. 

What actually happened: I was looking for something in my room earlier today, shortly after i got home, and noticed an open lotiom bottle and a little mess. I was busy, so i picked it up and kicked myself for being so careless. It was about 5 feet from where i remember it being, but i have cats, so I didn't think anything of it. I tossed my room looking for that thing. It was already messy, but it was even more messy after looking. 
A while later, I noticed a small pile of lotion in the bathroom, behind the litterbox. I thought it was strange, but i went on with my day. I have cats, after all. 
So then, when i went to go to bed about an hour ago, I gathered my stuff from downstairs (my switch and switch case, and my book) and went up stairs. I went to set it down on my entertainment center, and noticed another pile. But it was a neat pile. Like somome squeezed it out of the tube, no wipe marks. That caught my attention. Then I noticed another little pile on the opposite end. Theres no way that my cat could have batted it over to the other side, because my TV and PS4 are in the way.
Directly left is a black chulk bored. It had some important dates writrrn on it and it was decorated. In the upper/middle second was a big smear/wipe away. I use chulk markers, so it isnt exactly easy to wipe it away. 
At this point, I'm full panic mode. I went down and talked to my brother. He said he hasn't been up to my room and he hasn't had any friends over, which i believe. Hes never touched my stuff before, so this would be really out of the ordinary. Im sure he has nothing to do with it. 
I went back to my room, and noticed lotion on the blackbored itseld. It looked like they squeezed it out and then ran the tip through it. 
Im freaking out. I cant think of any logical explanation for this. I have no idea what to do. I cant tell if anything else has been messed with, since I tossed my room earlier. The only other thing I noticed was that my AC was turned off, but sometimes my family turnes my AC off when I'm not home.
Please, any help or advice is appreciated.",12Sep2019,1
308," 

Over the past year or two, an online friend of mine, ""Susan"", has been claiming that she has ""a girlfriend inside her head"", like another mind that accompanies her own mind, who she has a full on, committed relationship with. She fully embraces this. She has made social media accounts for this second identity to act as her girlfriend while fully embracing the fact that this girlfriend is indeed its own identity within her own mind; that technically Susan is typing her ""girlfriend's"" words. Susan speaks through that account **as** the second identity; sometimes to herself, and sometimes has full conversations with herself while using both accounts. She acts like a couple online and is VERY open about it, about as open as any other lovey-dovey PDA couple posting about all the nice things they do for each other on the internet.  


When I met her online years ago through a fandom, she showed signs of serious anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation through her posts on social media, swaying between downward-spiral and improvement over the course of years. We were both going though similar symptoms at the time, and we supported each other. Years later, she began to embrace herself as a source of comfort, seemingly in a genuine ""I’m trying to love me"" way. At the time, I was very ""Fuck yeah!! You deserve that, you're amazing!"" in response, because I truly respected her as a friend, her amazing well-timed advice, and for her  *incredible* skills in her field. I lent an ear through all of this, and exchanged stories with her. It was the best way I could have helped, given the distance, and she helped me too.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I can not recall exactly when she started to claim that she is dating this ""girlfriend inside her head"", but I think I remember that when she first posted an announcement, I thought it was just her way of saying that she loves herself. She bought herself a ring and told everybody that she is her own wife. This didn't phase me much because I just thought that this is how she was managing self-love. More power to her. I supported her in that. I still would if that was all this was.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Posts continued, and about two years ago, she made social media accounts for this “other half of herself”. She sees this as a normal relationship just like any other between two physical individuals, all while knowing and broadcasting that her ""girlfriend"" is indeed it's own separate identity within her mind. People encouraged and supported this, and that continued on and on. Out of fear of being attacked online if I had questioned it (as a leftist who uses the internet a lot, I'm familiar with extreme left-wing ideals, and how they can lash out if somebody doesn't agree with them), I silently unfollowed and distanced myself. A year or so later, I was reminded of her. I had another look at her “girlfriend’s” account (her own is pretty normal); nothing has changed, except, I suppose, that there is gratefulness on the account over how happy she (“the girlfriend”) is to be accepted by Susan's peers.  


Today I skimmed through “the girlfriend’s"" social media accounts. This is what I found...

* She clarifies that “we are two minds in one body, and that is valid"".
* She makes it perfectly clear that it is **her** talking on these second accounts, and **absolutely not** Susan. (it absolutely is Susan)
* She does not have a name. She is just 'another part of Susan'. I don't think she works like an imaginary friend either, because it's clear from the wording that she exists from within, as opposed to someone who she pretends to see, like how kids do things (""my friend sits here"", ""pour a drink for my friend too"")
* “The girlfriend” refers to Susan in third person; sometimes second, if she’s *talking to herself* by using the original account (actual Susan) to respond. It’s mostly typical lovey-dovey PDA couple stuff. You know the type who do that online and are way too public about how much they love each other? It's that. Except with herself/this other part of herself. Plus posts where she’s sending words of comfort or encouragement to Susan. They also share memes with each other, while tagging the other.
* Early on, she (the girlfriend)  hopes that her few followers could see her as a friend too (‘too’ = as well as the real Susan). Many posts later on are thankful that everyone accepts her.
* There are *several* posts that endorse very normal, healthy sentiments of self-care and mental well being. Most are so genuinely reasonable that I would “like” these posts if it didn’t draw attention to me, just because I so strongly agree with the sentiment. I feel it's important to point this out because it is some level of normalcy, to her credit.
* Some posts, aimed toward Susan, while still having positive intention, are a little aggressive in nature (""I'll *make* you get this positive thing done"", ""It will happen, *I'll be sure of that*"").
* There are a few posts that vaguely mention that there are people who don’t believe them, how Susan should ignore them, and how those people **don’t matter.**
* Susan's ""girlfriend"" takes on a fairly possessive persona. There is one older post that says “I OWN YOU” in glitchy text. I don’t know how seriously to take that, but I do feel that it's worth mentioning, given the nature of the situation.
* There is a post that mentions Susan making a huge life decision and reaching a big important goal, and then a month later: “You don’t need drugs, I’ll be your drug” from the second account. I’m concerned that they’re connected because I suspect that she sought therapy and turned down prescription drugs that would help her.
* Her room is an absolute dump. She says that this is how she has been living - and is in the process of cleaning it. I’m pretty sure I recall her mentioning this in the distant past, and that executive dysfunction stops her from being able to do much sometimes. So she has been living like this for years.
* Lots of posts like: ""Susan won't post \[this great thing about her\] herself, but I will!""
* There is a post where the ""girlfriend"" expresses concern for Susan, because she started to get a LITTLE traction through a video about mental health (like 20 people). According to the post, Susan got scared because more people might find out about the nature of their relationship and ridicule her for it.
* Her physical health is apparently not good.
* I have seen comments of support from others.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I tried talking to my friend, who also knows her, but they, although uncomfortable with it, say that she isn't hurting anyone, so they’re not THAT concerned. But I'm concerned for HER. She is still a person who could be struggling and isn’t getting the help she needs. What if there is a voice inside her head that she can not control, and it starts to tell her to do bad things? *What if it has already started??* If everybody around her is endorsing this voice, and she is encouraging them to accept it, how could she have the ability to recognise, from where she stands, that what it says is wrong? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She lives in another country (USA). I want to be able to do something, but speaking to her directly about it seems completely out of the question because she shuts people out if they don't believe her, and the people that do are endorsing all of it. I'm scared she'd try to slander my name as some kind of mental disability hater if I tried to help. I'm absolutely, in no capacity qualified to, so I don't think that I should talk to her about it at all.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever is going on with Susan seems like a personality disorder. She's acting as if it's about as acceptable as being trans or gay (by which i mean that she's acting like it's perfectly fine, but she's struggling with acceptance from others- like a trans or gay person), and encouraging others that it's all perfectly fine! I'm seriously worried because her friends are acting so woke about it by just accepting what's happening for what it is, as if it can be compared to being gay because she isn't hurting anyone, instead of questioning the psychological nature of the problem and how it could potentially hurt her.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am PRETTY SURE that she doesn't have a job, I don't know who she lives with, if with anyone (maybe parents?), and she has clarified before that she doesn’t have the money to seek professional help from where she lives (no healthcare). So she seems isolated. It's scary. I'm scared for her. I can't distance myself from this. She's a person who deserves help.  


&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping that somebody here recognises these symptoms, knows someone who has what she has or has personally been in it themselves, and knows what steps a concerned, overseas third party could take if they could maybe call qualified somebodies in America that could help **somehow**?

313,"He had told me that she had tired too hook up with him in the past but he wasn’t interested. She was too abrasive and not his type. When I first met her she gave me the this feeling like I should be cautiously her. Now I’ve sat down with her and talked a few times to be friendly but didn’t really like how she acted. She seemed to be more interested in talking about herself then others unless it was to gossip. On occasion all the neighbors would hangout and have us over. Now I thought I was perhaps a little too standoffish towards her. All the neighbors loved her so I must be the one that was wrong to have judged her so fast, right? 

Now I am an introvert and so is my boyfriend but lately things have been weird with her. As some of the neighbors that we once hung out with moved and she started going back to school. She would come by unannounced and linger in our apartment with both of us there. At first I was okay whatever we’re not doing anything. Then she seemed to get a little too comfortable coming over as she would eat our food without asking and slowly became too comfortable. Like she come in go straight to our refrigerator and get a drink out and ask if we had anything sweet to eat. She’s been doing this at least 3-4 times a week. No big deal but I work night shifts and she comes over while I am trying to get ready for work to talk with my boyfriend and I. I started to ignore her because I have to be there at a certain time. She sits by my boyfriend while he plays games and asks him if any of his friends are single. She has asked him many times before to be set up with one of his friends (they all said no and we haven’t told her). She then asked him a several questions about the game, then somehow she leads it back to the the same question. I barely pay any attention to her as she’s done this for the past 6 months. Then as I am leaving I noticed she hasn’t said anything to me really and doesn’t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon. At work I text him and said she left after she got tired of ignoring her. 
The next day she comes over same thing she’ll pound on our door and ring out bell till we answer it. I leave she stays and talks to him. We’ve both are getting annoyed and frustrated as she can’t seem to take the hint. 
However she seems to know when I am either leaving or we’re about to go out and try to join us. 
The last time she waited till I left to come over to the apartment and hang out with my boyfriend while he was busy playing video games. Now I trust my boyfriend but lately she’s been overly friendly with him and I feel uncomfortable with her being there while I am not. Especially when she keeps telling us she just wants someone to sleep with her and that’s it. 
I don’t think she has any boundaries when it come to us and our relationship and apartment. I don’t know how to tell her we need boundaries and not upset her. I have a feeling that she’ll cry to the other neighbors that we’re were mean to her. We have been sneaking out of our own apartment just to avoid her. I just don’t know how to tell her to stop coming over, staying, and eating our food.",12Sep2019,2

My father walked out on me when when I was around 2-3 years old and I hadn't really thought of him much, but around say 3 months ago I got his phone number from my step sister. I text him and gave him the ""you don't know me but I'm your oldest son"" line, ya know as you do. He invites me over and it goes great (except I was sick) and I love all my bros and sis's. Well I spend most of my summer there. I do chores, walk the dog and take out the trash as I'm asked. They clean the house every Sunday and I also help. Well about 1 month ago, he told me never to come back. I was obviously distraught over this. The reason was I was lazy and did nothing but eat his food, run his internet, and sleep all day, despite his wife telling my mom I was a well behaved kid who did as he was asked. The real reason was because I left the house while I was supposed to watch the kids, as I was 18 and capable. I had left to see my grandfather for the weekend (whom I love dearly) but here's the catch, I made sure someone was capable of watching them when I left. It was my Fathers wife. 

As I don't live there nor am I required to tell them I'm leaving I left without saying anything. She clearly saw me and waved me off as I trotted thru the living room. Maybe 15 minutes later my dad texts me saying to never come back due to my irresponsibility. I text him and explained what was happening and he was having none of it, I told him that he was a waste of a father and that he was white trailer trash and didn't need him as I had my it thru my first 18 years with out him. He insulted me and confirmed that I was related to my aforemention step sister (because she said the same things I did to him) and followed up by ""I know where you live."" Again the news that he didn't want me was so awful and disgusting that I cried while hugging my mom in the kitchen the same day.

317,"Backstory: 
About 10 yrs ago my dad was having some issues, its a long story, but it ended up causing a rift between my older half brother and my dad when he divorced my mom for another woman. They stopped talking after that. 


Now the issue:
Fast forward to like around February, my neice was born and I was excited and happy for my brother. I asked his permission if it was okay for me to tell my dad the good news. He said not to.
I want to talk about it with him because i think hes been angry long enough at my dad, its in the past and Ive forgiven him over what has happened.  We all make bad decisions and some are more destructive to ourselves and other people than others. I feel so bad about keeping my neice’s existence a secret. Idk how to handle the situation. I can either wait a super long time until we visit him again to discuss it face to face, text him about it or just ignore his wishes and just tell my dad about it. Like i dont know if he’s trying to punish my dad in some way? But i just hate keeping it a secret. 

Not to mention that the issue with him and my dad never was really discussed between me and him, since we’re not really close as much. So its a topic ive always wanted to talk about with him but im pretty sure he just wants to forget it and my dad and move on with his life.

319,"About a month ago I came home to some pretty bad damage in the foyer of the triplex where I live. The lights where shattered and there were scratches and dents all over the walls and the (brand new) paint on the stair railings was scratched all over. I wasn't sure what had happened and needed the lights fixed since I am a single female woman who lives in the dangerous part of town and works nights so I emailed my landlord who was very quick to fix the lights. 

However, it turns out my landlord must have given shit to the upstairs tenants AND given them my name because since that happened the boyfriend who lives up there has screamed at my roommate's girlfriend thinking she was me AND has shouted at me whenever he sees me. I know he can be violent when angry since I often hear him throwing things around and yelling at his girlfriend and I'm afraid of him. Whenever he sees me he shouts about how I'm a liar and how it wasn't his fault because ""it was his 80 year old grandpa who was bringing a couch up the stairs to his apartment who actually caused the damage so it's not his fault"". 

I'm terrified anytime I'm coming home or if I have to go into the common areas of our house (laundry, patio). I literally think he might hurt me if he gets angry enough. My roommate thinks I'm crazy but he's a pretty buff tough guy and my mom also thinks I'm crazy but she's never met him. 

What the hell do I do? I need to do laundry but I keep putting it off because the guy doesn't seem to work and is always home.",12Sep2019,3

321,"I need some advice. My house was hit by a freak hailstorm that tore up my siding and smashed 8 windows. I called a window company for an estimate and they said they did siding too and could handle both jobs. We worked with insurance that only approved replacement of the rear siding and a patch job on the right elevation for 4 hits. The salesman submitted pictures to insurance and spoke to my claims adjustor to get a full replacement of the right side approved. I came home and half of the siding on the left elevation was torn off! The contractor said he couldn't save what he tore off. The salesman came back out that evening to look and to try to convince me that I should just let them finish the left side, patch the right and I would still owe them the rest of the money (paid 50% upfront). I said no. He argued for 30 minutes trying to convince me that was a sufficient solution before finally saying that he would order more siding and they'd finish the left and complete the right side at their loss. This to me, seems like the only way for their business to make good on the contract and agreement to allstate.  Well, the owner of the company called and said that she needed to see the house before she could authorize it. She came with multiple tactics to try to manipulate me. She cried, she offered to take 1500 off, then screamed, yelled, said she was going to rip the siding off the left and put it on the right, threatened me with putting a lien on my house. All in front of my 2 small children. It wasn't until I got loud and told her I was reporting her to insurance for fraud  that she started to change her tune. I told her if she was going to make good on the work,  that I needed documentation sent to my email for insurance stating her error, the date the right siding would be fixed, and full disclosure that we owed nothing more than what was originally quoted. Well, now she wants to speak to my insurance company,  has not sent the documentation I requested, and I still don't have a date for when this will be fixed. I do not want this company on my property again, but I did sign a contract. I do still owe them like 4300 if they do the job. But after that display, I want nothing to do with them. What should I Do?

329,"Hey Reddit.  
First of all, I hope this question can be asked in this subreddit.

So, (24M) I have this friend (25M) who has struggled all his life with his self-esteem. It's very very low. When he was younger it seemed like he could handle his life quite well. He had some friends and did well in general.  
Some years later he tried his luck and the dating world, and that's when things went downhill very fast. Every rejection (he's had about 3) hits him very hard and pushes him deeper in a pit of self-despair, and with each rejection it takes him longer and longer to even remotely make any progress towards moving on and trying again.  
The last rejection (approx a year ago, but still very very much on his mind) hit him the hardest: the girl was obviously flrting with him, but later on refused a third date. He's now convinced he has lost all his changes for real love and it has come to a point where he absolutely believes the world is against him and something has made him a worthless person, meant to be forever alone, an imbalance in the universe.  
Since a few years ago he started making sporadic comments how it would be nice if a train just hit him, since then the balance would be restored. Or that he does not want to life in such an unfair world where everyone just finds love except him. These haven't stopped since. On top of that he also lost quite a few friends.

Anyway, me and some friends are being very supportive over the years: we talk to him, we suggest things he can do to take his mind of things, or in general some tips from own experience how we got over rejections (which, let's be honest, WILL happen when dating) but we just can't reach him. The problem obviously lies deeper; with his self-esteem. We suggested going to a therapist to find out how he can move forward, but he doesn't want to.  
These past months it has come to a point where he gets more depressed everyday and chats with me every night about how he's just done with all it. And in all honesty, I just don't know what to say anymore. I've said it all, but he does not even pretend to listen to things I say to him.  
I know it's terrible of me, but it has gone on so long I just don't know what to do anymore. Hearing these suicidal thoughts out of the mouth of a good friend is really getting to me, and I don't know how long I can take this.  
I have often thought to just cut him loose, but I just can't do it. The fear of pushing him over the edge is too big and I would never forgive myself.  
Has anyone here been in the same situation or has some advice on how to really help him? I want to help him, but it is getting very very energy consuming and it has a serious effect on my own mental well-being.  
Thanks everyone.

330,"After an event I sent someone who gave the talk this message on LinkedIn: “Thank you so much for giving a talk to us today and for the interview tips! It was a shame you couldn’t stay for the networking session after. I was wondering if I could ask some questions?”

And he replied: “Hi - sure, happy to help if I can.  Quite busy this week but next week should be easier if you want to talk?”

What does he mean by that? Why would we need to schedule a time for LinkedIn messaging? I thought the point was you could reply at your own pace?

331,"So we get this new hire at work and I usually help new hires with their way around the store since i’ve been working for a couple years. Usually i keep a nice casual friendship with coworkers and i’ve talked to this guy maybe a couple times. We took our break around the same time once and we made small talk. Since then he’s been asking me to take breaks with him at the same time. at first i didnt mind bc i enjoyed the company but i didnt think he would /expect/ me to Always go on break with him. 
in one of our convos we were talking abt school and i said i went to X university. he said shut up me too, i just transferred there. I wasnt surprised since a lot of coworkers go there and i just said nice, welcome. next time i see him he suggests we get starbucks on campus. I simply said yes and thought that would be it. however we have the same gaps Tuesdays and Thursdays and he also asked that we hang out these days and I agree bc i had no other company. 
Heres where my problem starts. now that i am knowing him outside of work and more personally, i find that we arent that compatible. I like kpop and he hates it. everytime he sees my merch he’ll call it trash and will nitpick everything i say.  “I really liked into the spiderverse it was a great movie.” “it was ok, definitely didnt deserve that award” “my favorite group is nct” “who ? they sound like trash” Hes like this with almost everything i say. And when i get irritated and dont respond to his jokes or make sarcastic comments at his expense he’ll call me rude or will say “are u mad at me?”  i know we’re joking around but i feel it’s really uncalled for. 
Another thing is that he will ask that i walk him to class. this week has been hot and the campus is pretty big. i walked him once and didnt want to again. he said that he would do the same for me if i asked. i wouldnt ask though because i dont wanna spend every minute with him.
 He will also be very touchy. he’ll hook his arm onto mine. I dont like skinship and so i always move my arm away. hes done this 3 times and ive pulled away all times. he hugs me everytime he sees me (literally every other day) and sometimes grabs my shoulder or arm. it makes me uncomfortable. at work he still asks that we take breaks at the same time. i told him he can take his later than mine bc i like going early and he takes his really late into his shift. he said that he didnt have anyone else to take his break with. at this point i realized hes really desperate for someone to hang around with at all times. 
hes gay so he definitely doesnt like me. 

How do I tell him nicely that i dont want to spend every second of my life with him ? Am i being mean and overdramatic? 

tl:dr i have a coworker that goes to the same school as me and has since not left me alone.",12Sep2019,2
332,"So I (17M) feel lonely even when I’m with my friends. We don’t share many interests but they’re decent people, just normal kids. But I can hardly have a conversation with them. They’re mostly interested in football (soccer), video games and YouTube and celebrity drama. I’m mostly interested in martial arts, history, exploring abandoned places, and just interesting conversations in general, about meaningful things. My best friend (17M) moved to a different school last year but he’s still close enough to hang out with, and we are interested in similar things, and have good conversations, but I only see him about once every few weeks. I just feel so stuck in my social circle. I can occasionally talk to my current friends about girls or school, but when they talk about anything else I feel like an outsider and can’t really contribute to the conversation. We are quite a small year group, and they’re pretty much the only boys that are decent people. It’s just a shame they’re so uninteresting. How can I find people that are like me? Maybe even a girlfriend that is like me? I just don’t know how to find somewhere where I feel like I belong and it’s really bringing me down. Everything is starting to feel a bit pointless because I have no one to share it with. Just for context, my GF broke up with me about 4 weeks ago, so that may be contributing to my feelings of loneliness.

337,"So I know I will be judged for it but it’s okay... Ever since I was a kid I’ve always had anxiety and overthinking is my worst enemy. I had my first full on anxiety attack in the 3rd grade at a school play. Anyways, ever since I can remember I have been deathly afraid of the dentist. When I was a kid I was literally banned from every dentist office in my town, and the next town 30 miles away. My grandma raised me and my siblings but worked graveyard shifts as a nurse at the Er 80 miles away. So not trying to shift blame or anything, but me and my siblings had to get ourselves ready for grade school and Try to make it down our long dirt road to the buss stop in time so we didn’t have to walk to school. I have curly thick hair and a sensitive head and my teacher would brush my ratty hair and do braids every morning before class. No one was there for us to help get us ready or wake us up on time we had to do it ourselves while grandma slept. So I didn’t have time to brush my teeth. I thought it was cool back then I could skip it and didn’t have a parent to nag me for it. My teeth obviously became horrible, I actually have not been a fan of candy since the 3rd grade because I had a cavity and it made it hurt. But since I was kicked out of all the dentists here and the next town over, I didn’t allow anyone to help. My grandma would try to hold me down at my appointments but that made my fear worse so I would flail and the dentist couldn’t help me. So my grandma drove me 8 hours to a dentist one week where the dentist had these white straps that went across the table and held you down. I was strapped to the table, giving a sedative, and he went to work.. by the 5th grade my teeth were bad again. My grandma was able to talk a dentist in town to seeing me again since I grew up a little and she threatened to have me strapped down again if I didn’t listen. I complied and my dentist told me I had some kind of enamel deficiency and that’s why my teeth were so sensitive. He was able to prescribe me special tooth paste with extra Fluoride and stuff to help, but we lost our insurance and didn’t have the money to pay cash for it anymore. Regualr tooth paste kind of helped but my teeth were still too weak. Since we didn’t have insurance I didn’t get to see another dentist till the 9th grade. I had 2 teeth pulled and a root canal and porcelain tooth in the front. Had multiple fillings, etc. my teeth did great until about 2 years ago... I haven’t been to a dentist for a checkup or anything in about 4 years because the last time I went my dentist made remarks about me and it hurt. Now I’m too embarrassed and honestly petrified to go back. I’m scared what they will think and say. He’s the only dentist in my town that actually does a decent job. I’ve tried other dentists, but one pulled a feeling out because they swore it was plaque and left a hole in my tooth and didn’t fix it. So that’s a cavity. I have a 4 year old son and had morning sickness every day up until 2 month left in the pregnancy. I have 6 month old and I had morning sickness up until the day I had him. I love my kids but I have been in a rough rough patch of clinical depression. Everyday for the last 2 years has been a constant battle to even wake up in the morning. I try to take my meds and solider through for them. But it’s just so hard. I don’t take care of myself. I put my all into my kids and keeping my house presentable  and neglect me. I am going to sound disgusting but it can literally be 2 weeks before I can find the desire to shower.. I will go days without brushing my teeth. I just throw my hair into a pony tail and call it a day for me. So now my teeth are bad (shocking right...) I wouldn’t say they’re like holy shit wtf horrible but they’re not pretty either.. I can’t chew food on my left side because of cavities. My canine tooth next to the porcelain teeth has a cavity on it and noticeable when I talk or smile. My other front tooth looks like it has a cavity behind it. My top wisdom teeth have started to come through but not like an actual tooth, they’re like sharp fragments of them on the side and a tiny bit in the bottom  of my gum. Not growing out just the bottom like a normal tooth. I don’t let my family come over anymore, or see friends, I don’t giggle and smile and really engage into a conversation with my fiancé because I’m disgusted with myself.. I feel like he finds me as revulsive as I find myself . I have no one to blame but myself.. I want to go to the dentist and get help but I am so afraid and embarrassed. I don’t want him making comments and remarks like he did last time. But I don’t have the balls to speak up for myself either. Not to mention I literally have a phobia of dentists. I was traumatized being strapped to that table as a little girl. It scares me to think about being touched by them. I hate the machine noises, the numbing shot. I know a trip to the dentist isn’t supposed to be a walk in the park but it’s just so bad. I’m scared what they’ll do and if my insurance will even pay for me to get work done. I know he’ll probably pull my front canine tooth because you can’t really put fillings right there. I don’t wanna have a missing tooth in the front... sorry for the long pity party post.

341,"This requires some background. 

I’m an 18 year old guy in my first week of college, across the country from everything I’ve known. It’s rather stressful, but only socially... 

I’ve never really had many friends but I’ve learned to have a few close ones in recent years. I made a really great friend here named Sam* and he’s super nice, we’ve gotten along great. 

Anyways, a girl named Veronica* who I was kinda into invited me to get ice cream with her tonight and said she was bringing a friend. To make her more comfortable I brought along Sam. Her friend didn’t end up coming with. 
The three of us all had a great time together, and hung out for several hours. 

They ended up hitting it off and are now making out in a private area, and asked me to leave. I’ve told her that I find her cute but I don’t think I ever told him that. I now wish I had told him beforehand, and I don’t blame either of them (and I won’t hold it against them). 

This is not the first time this has happened with things like this. I’ve never had any girl, in my life, show a sliver of interest in me, in 18 years of being alive. 
To emphasize just how far gone I am from normal, I’ve never kissed anyone/been kissed. I’ve never held hands as more than friends, or asked anyone out who ever said any form of yes. 

Overall, there’s no way I could be THAT terrible to date. Overcoming depression has made me more confident in myself but that’s quickly fading  Amongst some drawbacks, I’m a little overweight, but working on it, and I can’t grow facial hair at all. But overall I have really good grooming habits when it comes to skin+hair care and things like fashion. I like to imagine I’m funny as I have recently been told I could do standup comedy. I’m also studying full time in college to be a guitarist so I guess that may be a deterrent for some. 

I definitely want to learn to dance but honestly it’s only because I figure that it’ll make me more attractive. think I also need to work on recognizing when people might have a little interest. 

But how do I break the cycle and find someone with any interest in me? I’m sorry if I’m asking the wrong question. I trust you to have better answers than anything I could come up with.

347,"So I’m 20. I’m not in school because I stopped going during my second semester at a community college. I’m not really sure if there’s a formal way to drop out necessarily because I just stopped showing up. That was in February of 2018. 

Part of why I stopped going was because of a break-up. I had found out that a girl that I had been together with from the age of 16 with only one 6 month long break had been cheating on me.  The other half was because I was working 40ish hours a week as a supervisor at a local restaurant in conjunction with going to school full time (5 classes). 

I had my own car, so I continued living at home while I was in school. “Home” for me during that time meant living with my Father and Stepmother. My father had left my mom when I was around a year and a half old and married my stepmother by the time I was 4. Throughout most of my childhood, my parents had joint custody over me. This meant that I would have equal visitation between my mother and father and more or less spend half the week at each of their houses. 

So growing up, I would have my “days at moms” and “days at dads”. My father was very controlling over how this scheduling played out (usually had to work around his work schedule, but never my mothers) and was required by the custody agreement to send my mother his work schedules in advanced, which he never did.

When I was young, I mostly preferred spending time at my fathers. He had more money and received more support than my mother and would generally mock her and criticize her based on what I would come back to him and complain about. 

My mother(23ish at the time), joined the Air Force shortly after my father left. This meant that while she was away for training, I had to live with my grandparents on my “mom days”. A few years later, she met a marine who which she had my 3 siblings with.  They were not necessarily the most financially well off while I was younger, (they got themselves together around when I started high school). This meant that the two different households I was raised in had a stark contrast, as well as conflicting values.

My father and stepmother were always significantly more materialistic. I specifically remember coming over from my mothers house and being forced to change into clothes that they had bought me when I got there. There were also cases where they would dispose of things that my mother had gotten for me.

Another big difference between the two is alcohol consumption. I’ve seen my mother drunk less times than I can count with my finger. With that being said, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone drunk more times than I have my father and stepmother. My father would come home with a 6-pack of beer nearly every night, and my stepmother almost always had a cup with vanilla vodka/Diet Pepsi in hand.

My stepmother has been one of the most important people in my life. She always understood me, listened to my side, and generally cared for me like one of her own. She always wanted her own child, but due to circumstances, it never happened.

In school, I never fit in. I’ve always been a (angry) video game nerd and I wouldn’t say I learned how to dress until around 11th grade of high school. My father and I never quite connected as he was a big music and sports fan, and video games were my 100% passion as a kid. 

2012/13 was a crazy year for me. My stepfather was being deployed to Afghanistan, I was failing classes for the first time and even was subjected to mandatory tutoring after school each day for math. I also tried marijuana for the first time that year, which along with getting drunk became a short lived habit through to 9th grade. I also went upwards of 9 months without seeing my father, or anybody from that side of the family. It was only my grandfather being on the brink of death that made me get back in contact with them.

The event that caused me to not see my father for such a long time was my only suicide attempt. Due to the events mentioned previously that were occurring throughout the year, I was pushed over the edge. All I wanted was to be liked but I was an outcast at school. Everyone always called me the “weird kid” (picture it every school/grade had one). There was one final nail in the coffin. 

One night, at my fathers house, I was having a completely neutral conversation with my stepmother. During that, I saw my father in the living room who was very visibly angry for unknown reasons(to this day) . He then proceeded to make his way into the kitchen, scream in my face, begin to choke me out until my stepmother had to rip his arms from around my neck, and then push me down the stairs after I ran up them to get away. None of my parents had ever hit me before this point. I remember it like it was yesterday. It felt like a scene from a horror movie.

My stepmother and I ran to the car and left. We came back about 40 minutes later to him bawling and swearing that he’ll never lay his hands on me again. Needless to say, less than 2 full weeks later he laid his hands on me again.

Shortly after the second incident, my mother and I had gotten into an argument resulting in me having an emotional breakdown over all of the events that had unfolded. When everyone was asleep, I proceeded to grab a dull circular saw blade from the garage and cut slits into the entirety of my forearm hoping that I would bleed out. I woke up the next morning having to peel my bedsheets off of my arms as they were basically glued from all of the blood.

When my mother found out, I told her I did it at my fathers. This was obviously false, but I wanted my father to pay for laying his hands on me, as at this point, I no longer felt safe around him.

Flash forward a few years and I’m in high school. The court case disputing my parents customer had resulted in me being able to choose where and when I want to be. I went to my fathers maybe one weekend and every few weeks. I still haven’t received an apology for the second incident of him choking me. 

Around graduation, the community college I had decided on made me inclined to live with my father, as his was closer and I could live at home. In turn, he and my stepmother bought me a car for my graduation gift (they still asked for $1000 but paid most of it) 

Things were looking good, my father and I were repairing our relationship, however the older I got, the more of my mothers values and tendencies I developed. In turn, he was very distant. UNLESS of course I had a girl over. If that was the case (even at 18) he would sit on the couch above the stairs down to my room (in the basement) with the door WIDE open and open it every time someone closed it. He would even sleep there. 

At this point, I hadn’t seen any of my fathers side of the family in quite some time. On Easter, we finally went to my grandmothers, who once alone with me in the kitchen proceeded to tell me that “everything was my fault” and broke into tears with no explanation.

Flash forward another year and it’s been even longer since I’ve my fathers side. One day, while waking up, I overhear my stepmother on the phone saying “I want to divorce him but it’s so expensive”. From there I put two and two together. It turns out my father was cheating on my stepmother. 

The event that set things off from here was when I (19 at the time) came home from work at my full time job, and got ready to go hangout with a friend. I grabbed something to eat. He then proceeded to play 20 questions with me about where I was going. I didn’t want to tell him because he would always get aggressive if the name of the person I was going to hangout with didn’t sound familiar to him. With that being said, I told him exactly where I was going. He then proceeded to tell me that I “don’t need to be a dick about it” and slammed the door in my face. I came home about 3 hours later to my stepmom crying and my father sleeping in his car. While consoling my stepmother, my father came back inside and called both of us “fucking assholes”. 

The next day, after work I pulled up to our house to see him stuffing garbage bags into his trunk. Shortly after he left. He’s been living with his mother ever since, however I’ve never been invited to even VISIT anybody from that side of the family, and have only spoken to my father while trying to protect my stepmother on numerous occasions that he has aggressively harassed her over the phone or text. 

Shortly after his departure, my mother and siblings moved about 6 hrs away as they needed treatment for heath problems. Her and my girlfriend, that I met shortly after my father left have been my only real emotional support since he left. Besides them, I’ve been spending the last year and a half learning to play guitar. Which has also helped me.

It’s been a year since then. My stepmother and I are now living in a two bedroom apartment together.  She goes on benders and I’ve at this point witnessed her having sex with 3 different men, during times that she knows I’m home. Ive expressed to her how uncomfortable this makes me, as our bedrooms are right next to each other. Quite frankly I’m also worried for her safety, as multiple of these men have been either married, or in a relationship.

All I want to do is get out of here. Get into my own place, and start my own life. The problem with that is, I have done a SHIT job saving my money the last 3 years and while I have been as of recently, I have a long ways to go until I will feel comfortable moving out as I don’t ever want to be back in the position I am afterwards.

I often times think that it’s not even worth it. I feel like I’m going to amount to absolutely nothing because I do not want to go back to school. I have terrible anxiety, and cannot tolerate most teachers. The thought of death crosses my mind on a regular basis and I have no idea if I have anything going for me. I really want to play in a band but I’m scared that everyone is going to think I’m terrible at playing the guitar. I’ve recorded an entire demo tape, but am terrified to show it to anyone out of fear of judgment.

I really just have no idea what to do or where to go with myself. I’m so confused and sick of everything and just want to be at peace.

Any advice of where to go from here would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.",12Sep2019,2

357,"I’m a student involved in a major organization on my campus that requires me to put in many, many hours of work per week. I work in close relationship with two others, as well as under a number of supervisors. I had an entry-level role last year, but applied for a managing position this year. After a serious interview process and much effort, I got the position. 

However, as soon as I started the position, I developed a very negative relationship with my two co-workers. I feel they don’t appreciate the time I put in and seek to call me out publicly for even the most minor of mistakes. They seem to feel that I am less committed and less capable. The time commitment for me is a lot, but I expected that. I just didn’t expect to hate the people I have to work with. 

The role I have in this organization has a commitment of a year. It would be hard for them to find anyone willing to take my place. We had someone else drop out before the year began due to serious personal issues and I’ve been witness to the struggle of finding someone capable of helping out. 

Now I’m sorry for the long block of text, but I’m kind of desperate to find a way out. What’s the best way to break my commitment?

I’ve been having a problem for quite a while, ever since I moved in. It’s with cats.

He has had up to, no exaggeration 15 cats living on his property.  They are not well taken care of as all he does is dump a bag of food on his front door. 

Of the 15 a couple have died being ran over, but now a new litter was born. Some small ones seem really sick as their eyes are crusty and it seems blind.

They always jump over to my property and leave mounds of dirt and feces everywhere, I mean everywhere around my garden and grass as well as walk all over the cars.

I’ve contacted animal control and they approached the home and he said they weren’t his and case closed apparently. The only solution they offered me was to catch them first and then call them? Is this really what I have to result to?",12Sep2019,1

I'm sorry for making excuses.

So far I have called the cops on them twice because they were clearly violent with each other those times. but to be honest i could have called the cops so many more times and that's also because there is a rule in my house that you should be quiet after 10 pm. there where some times where i was not sure if they were fighting pysically. the second time i called the cops their fight was only a little violent and they chatted with the police in a very friendly way. 5 minutes after the cops left they carried on as if nothing had happened.

I'm supposed to go to the cinema next week with one of them and I'm not sure how I should treat them from now on.

367,"So my dog has really bad skin disease since the past month and it's just getting worse. He's becoming really skinny aswell. I talked to my mom how we should take him to the vet to get him checked, but she told me how it's useless because the doctors told her he couldn't take any medicine again since he's already really old and him being skinny is just because in this past month we've been too busy to feed them on time (which doesn't make sense since I have 6 dogs and he's the only one that's so skinny.) 

But finally today I kinda convinced my mom to atleast send pictures of my dog to the vetarinarian. The vetarinarian told me a list of things that she could do and came to pick my dog up from my house. Then through text, she told me my dog had scabies and it's very contagious and told me to wash my other dogs and the things that my sick dog had have contact with.

I don't know bout my other dogs having scabies or not but I do know that they itch often and a few of them has scars from itching.

I also had been itchy for the past 2 weeks so I figured I got the scabies from my dog. When I told my mom all of that she just gave me a ""mm"" and from what I observed, her face showed disinterest.

My mom has this new store she opened and since then it seems that her attention was mainly on it. She wouldn't even close the store for just a day. I know that it's been her dream to open her own shop but I really do hope she cares like she does before she had her store.

374,"Friend (27m) was kicked out of his mom’s house. Spent 36hrs homeless before I offered him to stay w me (27m). (I stay at my parents house 3-4 nights/week &amp; rest of nights at my gf’s).. my parents are extremely compassionate, sweet people. “He’ll always have a roof over his head.” 

He’s a respectful, intelligent guy.. was 1 course away from Finance degree from a great school last year.. he barely missed the grade &amp; hasn’t saved up enough to take it again. Moved back home.. Was just waiting on his successful gf of 4 years to return from a semester in Europe &amp; live w her, start a new life, save up to finish course, etc..

This was a year ago. She ended up essentially ghosting him. He’s found out thru her parents that twice she’s extended her stay.. she’s basically living there now permanently. He was trapped at his mom’s w no job, no degree. Mom makes barely live-able wage for herself. This set him in rapid decline.. 

Over the past year, he’s regressed terribly. Video games &amp; memes all day long. Constant depression. As long as I’ve known him, he’s always had “problems” but then again who isn’t “depressed” these days? He has been diagnosed w severe PTSD. He swears he has CTE. Has had brain scans enough to convince himself. Has medical marijuana card. Applying for disability.. says lawyers told him not to work bc it will hurt his disability claim.Anyways, mom kicked him out bc I guess he was complaining about chores. Mom wants nothing to do w him. He did say some fucked up shit to her mid-fight. 

That’s his background. Been w us for a week. My parents have been hospitable but did stress they want him to get a job to build for his future. They don’t want a dime from him though.

He has every excuse (although he doesn’t tell them any of this). His 8yo cat is dying (cancer) &amp; his mom won’t let him visit. That’s what he’s consumed w.. 

His other big issue is he says he can’t hold down a job bc he can’t sleep. Said he had total 8 hrs of sleep in first 4 days here. Last job he did well as a manager at a trampoline place. After two weeks couldn’t sleep and ended up getting fired after 3 days of missed work/coming in delirious. (Side note: says if I got him a job at my work he’d be able to keep it bc he wouldn’t want to let me down. Would also make at least double what he’d make otherwise. Refuses to work at a grocery store-type job).

So he sits home all day watching tv. Routinely walking outside to smoke his weed vape. Occasionally walking the dog. Every other day he tells me how fucked up his head is. Today mutual friend text me that he’s being very suicidal. (Vented to someone else for a change). I almost left work &amp; called the cops. He’s very anti-institution. Has had therapists &amp; counseling for years: nothing helps. So this would essentially be the end of our friendship—which honestly I’ve already accepted. Just want him not to die tbh.

Said he’d never kill himself at my house. I believe him but that’s not the issue.. said he’s leaving tomorrow (today) from my house.. which means he’ll go kill himself.. or live outdoors for a while then text me &amp; we’ll re-claim him. 

What do I do? Any advice? 

I’ve tried talking to him. Having deep talks. I feel like I have it worse than him mentally. I feel like tho I’m not diagnosed, I’ve had fucked up shit damage me. But I live by the phrase “im not a victim.” Doesn’t matter if I’m living w a terminal illness: there is death or life. I choose life so that means I have no choice but to make the best of what I have. I have to take care of my mental health bc when I don’t I lash out &amp; risk hurting my family or losing my gf. 

I say this to give the idea what I try to convey to him. Not as strong worded bc ik he’s sensitive. He’s consumed in self-pity. Convinced he’s bound to live in misery bc of his brain having CTE. Convinced it’s time to end it. I’ll admit the cries for help feel very “high school.” But am I supposed to ignore them? Of course not. 

Should I call the police? Should I tell my parents he’s suicidal? How do I get him to motivate himself? 

Has anyone been in a similar situation as him? I try to put myself in his shoes. I’ve been unemployed post-college. I’ve considered disability, food stamps, etc. But the loss of his ex-gf, lack of stability (kicked out of his mom’s &amp; his dad’s in last year) &amp; the hopelessness has consumed him.

It’s since sorted out but it still kind of gets me sometimes, I guess that’s trauma (I see someone for it) and a bit after that situation I had really been wanting a 3DS to play the newer Pokémon games (I was a bit behind on Pokémon) and so my mum convince me to get one and I got one. And it just felt like a win from such a crappy situation. It’s what made me smile after being in such a slump after all the crap I had gone through. And now I’ve lost it and I just am feeling severely depressed about it

My girlfriend, she’s great and is helping me and has even offer for me to use hers when I want to play a game. And so has my younger brother. But it’s just not the same. Like I said, the DS just had a very strong emotional attachment to it 

I guess I’m just looking for some opinions, thoughts or advice 

Mad props if you read all this",12Sep2019,2
381,"I've known my bestfriend for about 4 years and for the last 6 months I've had major crush on her that I just could get over. I told her my feelings and things but she had a boyfriend so I expected nothing about it now about 2 weeks ago her boyfriend dumped and I took this as an opportunity a big one cause she also told me she liked me too but this week they started talking to each other again. So I started thinking really negatively and basically thought my chance was over. Last night me and my bestfriend got into a argument and I said some things I shouldn't and like idc if I ruin my chance cause shes just gonna get back with him. I was just being a asshole I was in a bad mood. She then states well did you ever think "" I had intentions of getting with you?"" She also stated how after what I did shes not sure if she wants to be with me and how I basically messed my chance up as of now. Honestly I'm so down now I finally had a chance and I ruined it from a bad mood cause of assumptions.

TL;DR
I fucked up by being a dick to the girl I wanted more then anything especially after I had waited so long to get a chance and I fucked it up and I won't know if I'm able to get it back.",12Sep2019,5
382,"Ok so I don't want to go into too many details. Me and him were texting last night and he joked about a thing I'm insecure about. I don't usually mind jokes but it wasn't that much of a joke, it was more of an observation. He has done this many many times but I guess last night I snapped and I told him about how it makes me feel. He was apologetic but I was really upset and acted like a dick towards him. I didn't call him names or anything like that, I was just too aggressive on the way I wrote. This morning I woke up early because I couldn't stop thinking about it all night and I messaged him to apologize. I said exactly this: ""Sorry I acted like a dick last night"". He just replied with a thumbs up emoji and is ignoring me. What else should I do?",12Sep2019,1
383,"I've been working at BMW for some time now as a car cleaner (about 9 months). And I am pretty good at my job. I have been running rings around the senior cleaner for some time, and the sales team often come to me for their prioraty jerbs. .   


But there have been some issues I've been having. Namely management.   


They should not have hired the senior cleaner (from what I understand, they were warned against it). And he has cause no end of trouble. He has been in multiple disciplinary meetings, has had way to many near misses in cars, and is a general nuisance to the mechanics when they are workign on time sensitive jerbs.   


There is also the issue of pay. I work roughly a 9 1/2 to 10 hour day. Its all physical work, and requires allot of attention to detail. But no one in my department gets paid more than minimum wage. whats worse is that ive taken on more responsibility without any promise or sign of re-numeration increases.   


And then there is the issue of cost cutting. At first it was ok. Fix the water blaster so we don have to sent it out, use less of certain fluids. Its all business baby. But then there was this issue with the rain coat. See, it hangs right next to the oil drain. And has done for some time. But just today the new guy failed to release the pressure valve on the oil catch can. It sprayed all over the walls, and the coat as well. It (the coat) was already pretty worn at this point. And the stain was not worth getting rid of. I talk to my manager, ask for a replacement, and he gets upset. His response Is to take it out of the bin, hand it to me, and instruct me to take it home and wash it.   


Wat do?",12Sep2019,1
384,"I had training for 3 days on this new job and I was having a hard time to remember the stuff I was taught, though I'm well aware of it and was willing to improve but it's really difficult when the manager screams at my face when I do something wrong, though she would say ""good job"" if it's correct. She called me ""impolite"" for not being able to follow through and that I'm really bad. She even talks randomly in her first language (Chinese Mandarin) which I don't understand. 

I did my best to keep my calm, and even told her goodbye in a nice manner. I may be stupid, sure, but I don't think I deserve this kind of treatment. Should I write an incident report to the hiring manager? I'm definitely looking for a new job.",12Sep2019,1

389,"I hit every section except the last one of the ASD criteria according to my LMFT.

“It cannot be explained by something else.” It can be, my unknown history from a poor orphanage and neglect/abuse.

I could be autistic or not. No one knows.

No expert can help since I have an unknown history before 2 years old. All we know is that my feet were tied in the orphanage, which probably caused my walking delay.

So, we don’t know if I have autism or developed autism-like signs because of my possible abuse as an infant.

Does this make a diagnosis impossible to do? Is it possible to somehow have every section of the criteria (that involves the signs of autism) and not be autistic? My mom is suspicious and says it can’t be a coincidence and that it’s odd I somehow match every single thing, not only 2/3 of the criteria.",12Sep2019,1
390,"My husband (50) and I (49) are separated, but never filed paperwork because it's complicated with family trusts and stuff. I currently have the kids (13 and 10) about 70% of the time but it started as 50/50. I thought we had a decent system in place that would allow us to both live reasonably without court interference. I *know* I've gone above and beyond to be pleasant, understanding and flexible with the custody and financial arrangements and now it looks like it has bitten me in the ass. No good deed goes unpunished, right?

I'll start by saying I was the one that moved out (literally a couple of blocks away) because I had the higher salary (by +30k/year at least) and could afford to rent. It was planned by me over the course of a year to make it as amicable as possible. It was always supposed to be 50/50 custody; I let him stay in the house with all the furniture so the kids would still have that home stability. I even did a refi on the house to lower the mortgage for him. 

Six months after moving out, I became very ill and it took months of testing and a lot of failed treatments to get diagnosed and on the path to healing. I was forced to leave my job. While I'm happy to say I seem to have it under control now (lupus...it sucks), that year of not working and getting medical care has completely wiped out every cent of my personal savings. I've been actively going on interviews for two months trying to land a new gig but no success as of yet. In the meantime, custody during this health challenge somehow switched over to me. Now he chooses to only see them on weekends, but has started skipping part or all of those too this summer. They didn't even see him for July 4 or Labor Day weekends which was unexpected since we'd made plans. 

Where am I going with all this background? Well, it seems he has become involved with a young woman and it would appear they either have a sugar arrangement or he thinks they're really dating and she is just flat out milking him for cash. I only know this by accident. A couple of days ago, my daughter was complaining of not having enough memory on her tablet. I told her I would clean it up while she was at school. She's makes a ton of videos so I knew I needed to clear them out. Did I mention that he set the tablet using his own Gmail? No? Well, yeah he did.  So there I am getting an eye full of pics and vids of this girl. And pictures of his erections tenting his shorts. And close ups of her tattoos. And them at a fancy hotel in LA. And getting spa treatments. And smoking weed by a pool in Mexico. And recordings of him strapping himself into restraints on his bed. I looked at the dates of these and voila, they match with days/weekends he lied about his whereabouts and cancelled (usually last minute) picking up and seeing the kids. So I reluctantly opened the Gmail app and jfc, there's his fucking receipts. This annoys me to no end because this is how I found out about his extramarital activities while still together and *told him he shouldn't do that shit using that account* but he's a total dumbass so here we are. $1700 to stay in a suite for 2 nights at the hotel, $900 for a house in Mexico, Venmo receipts sending her anywhere from $150 to $500 for shoes and eyelashes and weed and...you get the idea. This has apparently been happening since the end of June. 

Here's where it gets bad: we have maintained a joint checking account that is supposed to be for kid related expenses. Yesterday I received 2 overdraft notices. Money is more than gone. He not only withdrew more than $800 in cash in the past week, but also set up Uber charges and those were $200.  On Saturday (obvs before I knew all this) I was apologizing to him that the account was getting low and that I was going to withdraw money from my pension. I'm so fucking poor right now and am stressed that I can't buy milk or pay rent next month and he emptied the account for the kids???

If you have made it this far, you are a saint for reading my rant. I should be asleep but just spent the last 2 hours looking at and screenshotting her SM which she tried to hide but I found. She openly posts -- no, *brags* about her working men for cash including him. There is no doubt it is her because she has pictures as recent as 2 days ago on *my* couch in *my* house with *my* cat. 

I'm calling a lawyer tomorrow to see what options I have financially so that's that. But, should I confront him with this info? Should I send him what I found on her SM? Part of me wants to just to make sure he doesn't do anything else stupid but.... I mean, other than financially and dealing with the kids, he isn't my problem anymore. 

What in the freaking hell should I do?",12Sep2019,1
391,"Here's the gist! I've been friends with a guy that we will call Antoine (not real name) since 2015. We've been super duper close (like chatting everyday kinda close) since June 2018 last year despite not being able to see each other that often in person. It's the kind of friendship where we would say ""I love you"" to each other spontaneously. We also have endearments for each other where I call him ""ahia"" (older brother in Chinese) and he calls me shobe (little sister in Chinese). All these interactions are all platonic (at least for me) since I've had a boyfriend for about 2 years now. 

Last April-May (this year), we didn't get to chat all that much since he was busy with his studies and was about to graduate. I was okay with this because I understand his priorities. We spoke again last June and he mentioned he got a girlfriend. I was really really happy for him and asked him who it was. He told me he would tell me this July, at an event that I would be hosting. 

Last July, when the event happened, I was so happy that he was there since we haven't seen each other in person for a good number of months. Usually in person, we would be awkward, but last July, it went smoothly we were able to catch up on each other. He finally told me as well that his girlfriend was an acquaintance of mine. There would be times at the event where he would look at me and smile and ask ""you really are happy, aren't you?"" and when I would respond ""yes"", he would say ""I'm happy you're happy"" and smile again. When the event finished, he hugged me thrice really tight because we wouldn't know when we would see each other again. 

I always saw Antoine as a bestfriend but never knew if he saw me the same way, but I never bothered to ask in fear that it wouldn't be reciprocated. 2 nights after the event, we had a heart-to-heart talk about his life and he said he really trusts me. That I'm a friend for life to him. That was like, the peak of our friendship and it made me really happy that he sees me as a really close friend he could rely on too. 

After that, he didn't talk to me for a good 2 weeks. It made me really sad, I wondered constantly, what's wrong? I double-texted him (which isn't a thing I normally do even with my friends because my pride is sky-high) in hopes he would respond. He did, about in the middle of August. He apologized for not being able to chat with me and promised me we would talk as soon as possible. I later read the message and replied to him asking if we had any issues between us. He didn't reply. Now, it is almost one month later, and I haven't gotten an answer. 

I think he's ignoring me. I tried ruling out all the possible reasons. I would like to think he's busy, but even back then when he was busy, he would let me know why. He's also changed his cell phone number. He is still active on social media &amp; still views my Instagram stories. He was never like this until he got his girlfriend. 

Is he ignoring me? Is it my fault? Could the girlfriend be a factor in this? What should I do? I need answers and advice please :""))",12Sep2019,2
393," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",12Sep2019,0
394,"I keep going up and down. I ate a whole pizza, followed by nachos today. That's all I ate.

Then I discovered, by trying to be like Fry from Futurama, that working my job has no room for that kinda fun. Because I piss off my coworkers. Tho I'll be working night shift soon, where Ill have minimal interaction.

The one thing I am proud of is my budgetting. I do 40 main, 30 misc, 30 save per check. I've kept that up for a week, just tracking down everything.

Maybe this is to vent, but honestly I'm super nervous about everything.

408,"I’m in education administration, college. A student of ours is autistic. She has a planner that her mom bought her. It has times that she is going to be picked up, locations, important dates, medications, assignments. Her mom really went all out. And it is a nice planner. Probably costs thirty or forty dollars. 

Anyway she left it behind one day in a class. The instructor turned it in to our staff at the front desk with a sticky note bearing the girls name. The next day I come to work the student comes to me looking for it. She was pretty agitated about it as it is more than just a book. We looked all over and could not find it. I texted all of our staff, instructors, talked to students. Once I found out the instructor left it with staff I watched a whole evening worth of security camera footage. We really all went above and beyond because we look out for this girl like she’s a little sister or something. 

Toward the end of the day, I get a call from one of my staff. She had been getting texts and calls from us because she worked the night before at the same desk where it had been turned in. She had been replying she doesn’t know where it is. When I answered, she was obviously upset and she told me, “I took it. It was stupid of me to do it. It was pretty and I wanted it. I feel horrible. I just saw it and took it.” 

The book has since been returned. I am meeting with the employee today. She has an excellent record. I have never had a problem with her. Everyone loves her. But she violated the trust of a student, knowingly, willingly, a special needs student. 

She is still texting me now apologizing. 

There was no need for her to tell me. She could have simply said it turned up and no one would have questioned it. Or she could have kept it. But she chose to tell me what she did and she returned it.

I recently started university a few weeks ago, and a large part of the programme I am in is all about being as social as possible to get to know and find people to form a study group that we will most likely be working with for the next 4 years. 

I think part of my hesitation has also been due to the fact that I graduated highschool 9 years ago and haven't really been in an actual ""school"" environment for quite some time. So I have this preconception that since I am older than most of the other students, they wouldn't want to hang out with me or even potentially work with me on projects because I am anywhere from 5-10 years older than them. Even though there are some others that are around the same age as me, I cant seem to get my mind over this hurdle.

I am all for stretching myself and getting outside of my comfort zone, but when it comes down to actually talking to people I freeze. Now I'm not talking about the ""shit what do I say?... Oh I've got it..."" 5 second pause as you're walking up to someone new to talk to. I'm talking about literally staring at someone's face and my mind going completely blank. I could stand there for 5 seconds or a year, it wouldn't make a difference. All the filing cabinets full of interesting topics and questions to ask people (once you get past names, where their from, what their favourite ice cream is etc...) in my mind seem to have melted in the blazing fire of hades going on inside my head that is simultaneously causing me to sweat bullets. 

So far, the best strategy I have come up with is to sit with new people every day and go over the basic ""get to know you"" topics, but I haven't been able to get past that point. 

During breaks it is evidently impossible to talk to people or go out to where people are hanging out to socialise and mingle. The rest of my class (around 70 people) seems to get along pretty well already and a lot actually going out for drinks regularly. I am obviously overthinking everything, but I just haven't been able to get myself ""in"" to feel comfortable hanging out or even really talking to my classmates and I dont know how to get myself over this mental block in order to actually relax and have fun with people.

Does anyone have any tips? Am I overreacting? Am I screwed?",12Sep2019,1
415,"So currently doing my driving lessons and i never look forward to them, i understand mistakes are made but with each lesson i feel my confidence behind the wheel declining as well as me dreading them more. Do i need to change instructor is driving not for me?",12Sep2019,0
416,"I had a frenemy in school who overtly and covertly bullied me at the same time. She would decide when she wanted to be friends with me, then drop me abruptly and turn on me once she was bored, or someone better came along. She told me everyone hated me, basically made me feel like a worthless piece of shit. I never called her on her behaviour or stood up for myself; I just passively accepted her treatment of me. 

I haven’t seen her in 3 years but I feel like sending her a message telling her that what she did was messed up and wrong. I would then block her so she couldn’t respond. The point of sending the message is to provide me with closure. 

Thoughts?",12Sep2019,5
417,"Me and my (ex) fiancé had two dogs together. One was an adult dog adopted 3 years ago, the other we got as a puppy. The puppy grew up with our other dog as his mother figure. He followed her around everywhere and they were inseparable. The puppy is 2 years old now. The dogs have only been separated from each other for brief vet appointments, etc. 

The night before last, I was blindsided after learning that my fiancé has been cheating on me. The breakup is like nothing I’ve ever experienced before and I’m feeling a lot of pain. I know I’ll be ok and am relieved I found out about this before I married him. However, I am really worried about my dog. 

My ex took the dog we adopted 3 years ago with him. She was like a child to me. Me and my dog are both grieving her loss. Now, the puppy who was always happy and carefree is sadder than I’ve ever seen him. He was such a happy innocent little guy, and now he’s moping around the house heartbroken. We used to be a little family of four, now it’s just the two of us in this big empty house. 

My dog doesn’t deserve this. I lost a cheating ex and my dog lost his entire family as he knew it. I took him for a long walk, but he gets sad as soon as he gets home to the empty house. My fiancé was never around much anyway, but my dog has never lived without my other dog. 

I have no idea what to do. With everything going on, I can’t adopt another dog right now. Things are too fresh to coordinate play dates with my other dog, which I worry would be too confusing for him anyway. Taking him to the dog park and hanging out with friends’ dogs only seems like a temporary fix. Will he ever adjust to this? What can I do to make this easier on him? I feel terrible that my mistake in picking a partner has hurt him so much. 

TLDR; fiancé and I broke up. Ex fiancé took one dog with him, my other dog is now depressed",12Sep2019,1

Yesterday I posted a rather panicked post saying that my friend is going to kill himself. The response from you guys was so fast and thanks to all you, I was able to talk him out of it.

422,"Okay so this is a long story but I’ll try to keep it short. Also on mobile so bear with me! Also If this is the wrong subreddit I’m sorry. 

My roommate and I have been living in our apartment for a little over two months. We were supposed to be living else were the landlord fell sick and sold the property and the new owners just moved their kids in to attend college for instate tuition. Whatever Over it. 

Anyways, my roommate and I reached out to your current landlord and FaceTimed her while she did a walk through of the apartment and everything seems fine. We ask the appropriate questions about parking laundry blah blah. We move in two days later and since then every week we find something wrong with the place. 

In the lease we are promised two parking spaces on the street and permission to park in the driveway. Two weeks after we move in the town comes and paints over our spots and makes them no parking. We tell our landlord and she says too bad. We park in the driveway and the tenant who lives in the apartment behind us also parks there and leaves at random times so we it’s a big inconvenience to park there. 

Also when we moved in we took videos of things we would like to be fixed and they still aren’t. Such as broken window locks and a leaking sink. 

Additionally, we blew a fuse twice (my fault) and when I went to go flick the switch I couldn’t figure out what electric box was ours (there’s an apartment upstairs from us that’s vacant) and nothing was labeled and the last time it said it was updated was 1984. I find the switch and the power comes back on and THE OVEN IS PREHEATING. The guys working upstairs on the apartment blew a fuse and we lost power and again the power comes back on and oven preheats. So apparently everything is connected and it’s strange. Also it feels like all the electric is connected and we are paying for the apartment upstairs if that happened. 

People have also stollen our mail and trash bins and we were promised a washer and dryer and we only have a washer. 

HOW DO WE LEAVE?! 

We found another apartment and we love it so much and can move ASAP but we don’t want to get held responsible for the rent that goes unpaid when we live in such a awful apartment",12Sep2019,1

430,"He graduated, got a temporary job and was let off once the employee came back from holiday, since then he couldn't find a job for over a year despite applying for heaps of jobs each month.

Suddenly this offer came along to be a store manager (nothing to do with his degree) and he needs to work in a semi rural area about 3-4 hours away from me.

The job sounded great aside from the location, until when he actually started and turns out he's working 10-12 hour shifts with only a half hour break, no tea breaks, doesn't even get time or a chance to go to the toilet so he's severely dehydrated (worried about drinking too much water and needing to go to the toilet). He also works 8-10 days straight and only gets 2 day weekends (wtf?). 

Every day after work he's extremely tired and exhausted. We haven't properly spoken on the phone because he'll be too tired. The job is really stressing him out too so he's been drinking basically every night.

Half the time he drinks, he's grouchy and starts fights or assumes I'm being passive aggressive or ""going crazy"".

I'm trying to be understanding because I started my first full time 5-day job recently and I'm pretty exhausted and tired. But now I'm starting to get worried if he needs to have a few beers almost every night after work to relax?

432," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'eh that lads just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she stared at me and quickly grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in this night)

437,"Hi, 

I’ve been living with my roommate since last October, and since then a slew of questionable things have been happening. 

In January my boyfriend bought me sunflowers in a vase. I sat them on my roommate and I’s coffee table and left to run errands. When I returned the vase was clearly knocked across the room. I asked my roommate about it since he was there during that time and he said they must have been top heavy. I doubted it but shrugged it off as an odd coincidence. Moved them to the center of the coffee table. A day later I come home to my roommate making himself dinner and see the vase knocked across the table again. I asked him about it and he said he didn’t know. Minor annoyance but maybe they were just top heavy? Plus why would he want to knock my flowers over? 

Fast forward to June. I notice it’s getting really warm in our apartment. I go to check the AC and it’s not working. Call maintenance and they come and tell me the batteries had been removed. I ask my roommate about it and he literally tries to tell me he thinks someone broke into our apartment and stole the batteries from the AC. At first I assumed he didn’t want to by the energy bill? But then I thought it was weird because why not just say that verse being shady. I shrugged it off. Our AC stopped working properly after that and keeps turning on/off so I have to call maintenance about it every few weeks. 

Late last month the batteries went missing again. He kept his same story that we have a battery burglar. I was getting mildly annoyed at this point. That same day I sat my house keys on the kitchen counter as I always do. I woke up the next morning to them missing. First assumed I misplaced them yet I couldn’t find them. I ended up buying replacement keys before my roommate tells me a few days later that he found my original ones in ?in his shoes? 

He also has a very obsessive problem with our kitchen area, but only when I use it.

A character reference:

Murphy - The person getting suspended.
Julius - the Witness offering evidence.
Kyle - Person who basically started this
shitstorm.
Augustus - The accuser.
Me - friend and helper of Augustus.

Context:
This may sound like a court case but it is actually a massive “cold war” of sorts that has been taking place between Augustus and Murphy.
I’ve known Murphy for many years, he’s a very sociopathic-like person. He uses people to get good with teachers and gain extra points in clubs and extracurricular activities. His parents place a lot of pressure on him, and he is generally very toxic and competitive.
Now it’s freshman year: 
A few friends and I essentially iced Murphy the year before, and we went from talkative to the silent treatment (the year before he had always been that friend that is annoying but you still tolerate them). 
Murphy had made friends with a transfer, named Augustus. They were partners in debate.
Augustus makes a joke about Murphy and I being gay. It’s like a “fan fiction simulator” that plugs in two names and writes an erotic story about them.
Murphy goes to the administration and tries to get Augustus suspended (despite them being partners and “friends”). 
My dislike for Murphy outweighed any annoyance that I had against the gay joke (just a note, neither Murphy or I are gay, which is why it was probably weird for Murphy). I sided with Augustus.
This other kid named Kyle then began sending screenshots and recordings of conversations to Murphy, and he used them against Augustus. 
Augustus and Murphy are forced to both sign a contract that states many things, but most importantly, neither party was allowed to discuss topics on each other. It was an easy way to put the issue at rest.
*AFTER SUMMER, PRESENT DAY*
Murphy tries to get Augustus (my new debate partner) kicker out of debate (doesn’t work).
Murphy joins a club that Augustus is apart of and tries to get him kicked out of that (this one is ongoing, but Murphy might indeed be kicked out instead). 
So with all of these examples of Murphy just not letting go, Augustus tries to report him (doesn’t work).
Julius, Murphy’s new debate partner, is being constantly harassed, so yesterday, he quit debate and send Augustus confessions of how Murphy was talking about Augustus behind his back and badmouthing him to teachers (which goes against the agreement). 
Now Murphy could be suspended. With all of this evidence, Augustus, another couple people, and I, will essentially make a case against Murphy and end this once and for all, most likely through a suspension.
This is all going to go down on Friday/over the weekend. 
But I’m wondering whether it’s the right thing to do? Is having this mark on Murphy’s permanent record worth it just to get him to stop tormenting people? He gets pressured by his parents a lot, how would they react?",12Sep2019,1

Fast forward to today, we went to a gaming place and played video games for two hours. After that we sat on the stairs where no one else was there while she booked an Uber for herself back home. We ended up getting a little too close and started kissing each other, then she asked me to fondle her and I did. When I asked her to do the same she said she was bi but wasn't into dicks and preferred women, so I didn't force her to do anything she didn't want to. After sometime we stopped and she finally got an Uber and left.

I didn't think too much of it at the time now I'm wondering if she's actually a lesbian but doesn't realise it and just refers to herself as bi because she's too afraid to consider the possibility that she's gay. What do I do? Am I overthinking this or should I talk to her about this",12Sep2019,2

I never went to university because I wasn’t sure what I wanted to study and truthfully didn’t have much of an interest in education when I was at school. It’s been 6 years since I left school and I’ve still not got any formal qualification besides a Cert 3 of Business Admin.

I tried a lot of times to get into it; but I just wasn’t motivated. I couldn’t force myself to do it, so I basically wasted 10k. 

I need to pick something to study, because I don’t want to be 30 and still unqualified. I want better earning power and I want to provide better for my girlfriend and Mum. But I am terrified that I will pick something else, hate it or find myself otherwise completely pissing away my time, and have wasted another 10 grand. 

I don’t really have any ideas of what I want to do as a career. I like gym and computers but find the idea of formally studying those really boring. I feel lost and useless. I am already starting to feel like it’s too late.  Where do I start?",12Sep2019,1
453,"hello. first time poster here, hope everyone reading is having a good day.  


about 6 months ago my cat gave birth to 4 beautiful kittens, so i'm already late on doing this, which is partially why i'm  
seeking advice in the first place. i'd love to keep them but food and litter for 4 cats is not something i can afford.  


i've already asked friends and family and so far i've only found an owner for one, my cousin and her 3 kids.  
i'm not sure how to go about advertising this on a local marketplace, which is what i need advice with. it's pretty stupid of me to ask, but i want to make sure that what i'm doing is reasonable, moral, and most importantly i want to make sure  
that the kittens get good homes.  


would i get much use out of advertising this on a local marketplace? if so, should i charge people money for them?  
i originally thought it'd be immoral to do so, but i'm afraid if i just give the kittens away, someone will just   
carelessly take one in, and end up not caring for it, or even abusing it.",12Sep2019,1
454,"English is my secondary language so sorry if it's hard to read.. 

I just started my freshman year in high school. And I have a teacher who doesn't let us take off our uniform jackets during class. We go to a very very advanced academic school the 4 best one in our country. He is a ranger, rangers here are like a militaristic and nationalistic organization similar to the country's military but the only difference is that any age group can join the rangers. So in his eyes taking off our jackets is basically trashing the uniform and aswell our schools name. Also to him taking off our jackets during class is very unpatriotic aswell since he's a ranger and he cherishes his ranger uniform.

The problem is it's hot and uncomfortable, in September, April, May and June the classrooms are literal greenhouses the temperature inside can sometimes reach 30C, no way suitable to be wearing a jacket.
But if we say it's too hot or uncomfortable he responds with either that the excuse is childish and we should grow up, or that we're to weak to handle the heat. And to be frank if we take of our jackets we put them on the chairs in no way do we disrespect or trash our schools uniform and symbolism.",12Sep2019,2

We haven’t done anything but shower together twice this month, with pretty much zero sexual contact both times.  Is his delay most likely caused by the plan b, or should we worry about pregnancy?

456,"I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to be posting this, but I’m quite desperate and just looking for advice.

I’m 20 years old and currently an apprentice in an administration/marketing position. I do not enjoy work, and I did not enjoy my previous office job but I stayed there for a few years. I do not intend on staying on after my apprenticeship as the salary will be minimum wage. 

My current salary makes it impossible to save anything, and all my savings that I accumulated from my old job are now gone. After I have paid for food, board, etc I am left with £100 ish free money for the month. My outgoings are as low as they can possibly be and I live very frugally. I own my car outright, pay insurance annually, take my own food into work etc. 

I have been looking into getting a warehouse job as it would give me a base salary of around £20k and then overtime would also be available. Most are with agencies though and I don’t like the idea of not having a permanent job.  I really need a job that will enable me to save for a house deposit quickly.

My ‘career’ plan is to set up a mini business in something I’m doing outside of work and maybe do a bit of freelancing on the side but I’m really struggling with the lack of cashflow. If I earned more I could fast track this. 

An ideal job for me would be something that is paid hourly, as I hate doing unpaid overtime (something that seems to be the norm in most salaried positions), and something with set hours (don’t mind weekend work), and ideally something with minimal human interaction. 

Does anyone have any advice for me?",12Sep2019,1

458,"I'm a senior in high school and originally though I wanted to be a video game designer but I realized I wasnt a fan of that lifestyle. I'm taking a woodworking class and it's been fun and I've always enjoyed wood stuff. 

A few days ago my woods teacher made a great point that kind of made me think a bit. He was saying how you could go to college and get a $100k debt and end up with a $50k a year job and have to pay those back, or go into woodworking or construction or something and have no debt and instead make like $60k a year or something like that. 

I know woodworking can be pretty tough but I think I prefer that hands on stuff over sitting at a computer all day hoping something works. Is this a smart decision? Totally skipping college could potentially be harmful.

460,"So I've been married to my wife for nearly a year, but we've been together for 4 years total.  We have a 3 year old daughter.  My wife was attending dental assistant school at a tech school in our area.  I'm the bread winner and work 5 days a week and I'm in the National Guard(military reserves if you don't know).

My father in law was a cool guy.  He's on disability and doesn't have a lot, but he appreciates what he does have.  He has a three bedroom house that he got through his family and a lot of guns.  He's married and likes to fish.  We would find common ground with talking about firearms, video games, etc.  He would watch our daughter from time to time, but once my wife started going to school he was watching her 5 days a week.  Initially we started paying him $50.00 a week to watch her.  That's not much, but he never said anything to us until she was halfway through school.

Halfway through school it came out that his wife started pushing him to ask for more.  We agreed and bumped it up to $60.00 a week.  Again, not much, but I'm working a support gig at a call center so I'm not exactly rolling in the dough.  We're also saving up money to hopefully get a house with my VA loan.  Well after one military training (which mind you is one weekend a month so those two weeks i basically dont get a day off) I was exhausted.  I went to work and I wasn't 100%.  I live across the street from my house thankfully and my job uses the point system.  I decided to take a few points and go home for that day on Tuesday.  It was just a half day and I figured my father in law was taking care of my daughter who lives across town.  Now of course I was going to go pick her up at the usual time, but once my father in law saw me on the PS4 he started texting me and calling me.

Before I could text back he called me.  He asked me if I was sick and I told him I wasn't, but I was completely burned out from drill because we were outside the entire time doing inventory on all of our equipment and my unit is short handed.  I just needed the half day to relax and that I would come get her at the regular time.  This wasn't good enough for him and he proceeded to tell me that I should've come and got her.  Now in my mind, if I wasn't paying him at all I most definitely would've gotten her as soon as I left.  I just felt that because money was involved that it wasn't so much a favor anymore because again, he's on disability and he and his wife live off of that disability so anything helped.  

Once I mentioned this he flew off the handle, threatened that he could beat my ass and promptly changed his ""price"" from $60.00 to $150.00 a week.  Also I should state that I promptly blocked him from my PS4 because I got the feeling he was stalking me.  It wasn't the best move right then and there, but later he would to admit to doing this even before this.  I completely kept my composure for this as my daughter was still in his care and told him that was fine.  About a week later I go to his house to make amends to which he did invite me.  

I sat there fuming, but keeping a straight face because while I made apologies and tried to squash the beef he basically spent the entire evening talking about how he can beat my ass, he's an elder and he automatically deserves respect, blah blah, blah.  We shook hands after this after I apologized again thinking everything was kosher only to find out that on that following monday he was still demanding the extra money and that we could swing it because my father is a commercial pilot (I rarely go to my father for anything because that's not the relationship I want with my father).

We managed to work it out and get my sister in law to watch our child for half the week so he didn't get the pull amount, but then he up and cancelled on us one morning with no reason and added he would no longer watch her.  That was the last straw for me.  Later on he would not call my daughter on her birthday and also miss my wife's graduation from school.  Now I would already have this put behind me, but my wife's father was absent from her life.  He says he paid all of the child support, but he has weak excuses when it comes to seeing her and her sister.

She still thinks that my daughter should have her grandfather in her life, but after everything this guy has done that's not the kind of person I want her life.  I know I'm not completely innocent in this, but I did attempt the high road twice only for this guy to threaten me and insult me behind my back to my WIFE.  I think my wife just wants to have that father figure in her life, but I don't think this guy is it.  He's been in our lives as soon as I started dating and I truly believe he has shown his true colors.  Any advice on where to go from here is greatly appreciated.",12Sep2019,1
461,"Background: I have a long history of depression and suicide attempts, and of attempting to seek the help of a psychologist, with very little results. I finally moved from my almost-rural hometown into a bigger city, where I finally got access to a psychiatrist, and since I have improved considerably. Still, I can tell there are some issues that I still have that need to be tackled by a psychologist. I decided to attempt to go to a psychologist for the seventh time in my life, and once again I found no connection between what I was told and what I was experiencing. It felt like my issues were downplayed; I never had a chance to talk about the topics that worry me everyday, and the conversation would always orbit the topic of my job, and how good I was doing (while getting no chance to explain what I really was struggling with, like my lack of friendships).

I know I'm doing something wrong; there is no way that seven psychologists in a row have been too &lt;anything&gt; to help me. I feel dissociated from what they say to me, and I can't steer the conversations towards my issues; they seem to always focus on the things I'm doing right only. It's not a matter of helping me to have a more positive outlook either, but rather them avoiding to touch the topic of my interpersonal relationships altogether. I'm desperately lonely and suffering a lot because of it, but I can't figure out what am I doing wrong.",12Sep2019,2
463,"Like the title says, I'm trying to move on from the end of my dad's whistleblower suit. The case started when I was four and ended last year. One of my earliest memories is of our garage being burned down in the middle of the night after CNN had run a national story on the case. 

Last year's decision from the Court of Appeals seems to repeatedly contradict the Court of Appeals' decision from 10 years earlier. The COA adapts Kavanaugh's 2008 dissent as their decision without explaining or acknowledging their split from the 2008 majority. The decision ends by finding that my father had never provided any evidence ever, the 2008 decision found that he had presented as much evidence as one could hope for. The court did not explain or acknowledge this change either. 

For the sake of closure I'd like to understand how things concluded. I want to know if last year's decision is as big of a contradiction as it seems or if I'm just confused about what's happened. But I'm having trouble finding anyone who is willing to talk about the case with me.

I've tried legal advice Facebook groups but received no responses. I tried law forums but they seem to be infested with trolls. I wanted to post on the legal advice subreddit but they won't let me post the decisions or anything that might provide personal information. (I don't care about people knowing my identity but I guess that doesn't matter much.) 

At this point I'm up for trying anything. My father lost his job, my family lost our home but more important we lost our sense of security, all as a result of pursuing this lawsuit. After everything that we gave to get here, after nearly a quarter century of fighting, I can't really describe how infuriating it is to see a decision that seems so sloppy and contradictory. 

I'm looking for help because this conclusion has  left me paralyzed. I feel an overwhelming need to do something and it's stopping me from living my life. Part of me thinks I just need to leave the country. Somehow over the last couple decades I had managed to keep some faith in our institutions but it seems that our courts are so much worse than I could've imagined. At this point I don't really feel safe here, the substance of one's appeal means so little it's frightening. 

Another part of me feels a need to try and use this story to fix things. I feel like I have a duty to try and use my unique experience for change. But I also wonder if I'm just fooling myself, if I'm trying to make my family's suffering into something more important than it actually is. 

I need to talk with people to figure this out, preferably lawyers or others who know about law, but I'd be happy to talk to anyone who is willing to take a look into this. Please reach out if this story has at all interested you.",12Sep2019,1

2. My studio have a staff of 4 with my wife and me with two junior designer. We have 2 office cats which are our beloved pet but the past month after my wife taking maternity leave and getting sick from fever our work is overload and run off schedule. This is why I want to merge with friend company. 

3. When we merged I have to let go one of the staff and we have to leave our two cats at a separate home. My wife will be staying at her mother house when the baby is born because her mother don't like or pet in general. We also can't take our cats to the new office as their are feral cats around at the office is crowded they will be staying at my house. We probably get to only spend a few hours a day with our cats before I have to come back to my mother-in-law.
We planning on staying with her until the baby is at least 2 years old.

These will what happen I planned it out but I'm afraid we will miss our cat or the company doesn't work out or my in-law is not happy with us. We will also be risking our saving and spending alot for the baby. But it feel like it has to happen and I'm very anxious about all it.

(They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she stared at me and quickly grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

I would prefer to work the desk job; it pays better and has better hours. And it would look nice on my resume.

My question is - should I go to trial work for the position at the tea place? Or is it a crappy thing to appear at a job try out where I would have to quit almost immediately after getting hired if the other position gets open?

481,"Hey there, r/Advice! Sorry if this is the wrong thread to post this. I'm not really sure where else to ask. I tried to post this in r/Korea but I'm unable to because this account is new (made it just to post this since I can't unless I have an account) and don't have enough karma. If this is the wrong place, let me know so I can take it down asap and post it in the relevant subreddit.

TLDR; Recently moved to a shared apartment in Seoul. While I was alone, I heard weird sounds in my apartment (like shower and faucet being turned on and off, small furniture like a desk or chai being moved around). I checked all the other rooms, including the spare room, but found nothing and no one. Just found a space in the bathroom ceiling that can be pushed open. Would it be impolite or over the top to ask the apartment security to check it out and the rest of the apartment tomorrow to be safe? I know tomorrow is the actual celebration of the Chuseok holiday, so I don't want to come off as ignorant or rude.

Longer context:

Anyway, I recently moved to Seoul and I've been sharing an apartment/share house with 2 other girls. Just last weekend, one girl moved out. So there's just 2 of us, and the room the other girl occupied is now empty. My other housemate is going back to her hometown tomorrow morning for Chuseok, so I'll be completely alone until Monday morning when she gets back. At first, I was honestly excited at the ordeal, because that meant I could play my music or watch my shows out loud at whatever volume I wanted. Right now, I'm a bit terrified.

Just a couple of hours ago, I arrived back in the apartment around 8:45-9:00pm. I noticed my housemate's shoes were gone, so she was still out. I immediately started blasting my music out loud to fill the silence of the empty apartment. However, after a while, I heard some odd sounds and turned my music off. It sounded a bit like the sound of furniture being moved around. Struck me as odd but I passed it off as maybe the upstairs neighbors moving their things around. I kept my music at a low volume to be safe.

After doing my business in the bathroom, I holed myself up in my room. It's important to note that the bathroom is right next to my bedroom. Anyway after a while, I started hearing different sounds again but coming from the bathroom. I've only been here a month, but I'm very familiar with that the pipes sound like when water is being used because my housemate usually showers in the evening when I'm already in my room getting ready for bed. It definitely sounded like someone was using the bathroom, specifically the shower or the sink.

I messaged my housemate, asking if she was home, and she said she would be back in 15 minutes. The sounds persisted and I tried my best to ignore them until my housemate got home. The longer it went on, the more it seriously sounded like somebody using the bathroom. When I heard the door open and my roommate came in, I immediately went out to greet her. I peeked into the bathroom and it seemed nothing out of the ordinary. The lights were off and the vent was still on, as I had left it on to air it out. I asked her if there were any tenants on the floor above us (technically, we should be the highest floor, but I noticed that there are still stairs leading to a higher floor outside of the apartment), and she clarified that nobody lived upstairs. I asked her if there were any new housemates we were expecting, and she said the real estate company that manages our apartment hasn't said anything.

I then checked the spare room, its bathroom (which has its own toilet and sink but no shower), and its closets. I didn't find anything (or anyone; not that I would have even known what to do if I did). After checking the bathroom again, I noticed a kind of plastic looking thing on the ceiling and I prodded it with my umbrella. It could open. I wanted to open it further, but I was a bit hesitant in case I'd be destroying any property because then I can kiss my security money goodbye.

Now, as a disclaimer, I've lived alone before and I know what the sounds of a place settling sound like. I'm also definitely not a usually irrational person; in fact, a large part of me is saying that it's nothing. But the paranoid part of me is screaming louder than the rational part of my brain and is telling me to go to apartment security first thing in the morning. I'm 70% sure there's nothing to fuss about. I live in a safe area, and the real estate agency that owns the property has a reliable reputation, as does the apartment complex.

However, I do want to play it safe and have security check out the apartment, especially the opening above the bathroom. I plan on going to them first thing in the morning, but I just want to make sure that I won't seem rude or ignorant for asking them about this. I know tomorrow is Chuseok (Korean thanksgiving, essentially), and everyone will be celebrating the holiday. Should I approach security about this problem or is this dumb paranoia?",12Sep2019,1

488,"Morning all. 

I'll admit, part of the reason for this post is to get it off my chest and admit to myself where I'm at right now. Part of it seeing if there's anything I can be doing that I'm not. 

I was laid off a week ago and I keep saying I'm fine and trying to check some things off my to-do list each day. Waiting on hearing back from company so I can start using the Placement Program they provide - part of that is free resume editing and I'd like to get back a good res before applying everywhere so those applications won't be wasted. 

But I'm not actually fine. I haven't bathed or changed clothes in days. We also had a major family emergency the day after my layoff so I've been making efforts to spend time with my husband so he knows he's not alone and I can comfort him - this means I spend my entire day in the bed while we play our respective computer games. 

The couple days after the layoff I kept telling myself, ""Okay, I've got to keep myself on a loose schedule. Get up early still, shower, get ready for the day. Spend some time outside, and manage the F out of our house since I'm not working."" But I'm in a rut. I know what I should be doing but I'm not doing it. I'm telling people I'm fine but my actions say otherwise. I've noticed my anxiety is bad again because I keep grabbing my arms so tightly that I'm getting some bruises. I do have anti anxiety meds but they're ""as-needed"" and I don't want to rely on them. 

Right this moment I have the urge to shower and change into regular clothing, and I'm going to hop on that while the motivation is there. But in general, no, I'm not alright and I need to get my poop together. Put it allll in a backpack, take it to the poop store, and get my poop together.",12Sep2019,1
489,"Let me share here that I don't know the objective of this post. I'm writing this to relieve myself.

My day is more often than not unproductive. I'm in my early 20s and I haven't graduated yet. It's going to be a while. My headspace is a mess of conflicting, contradictory ideas. Also I must mention here that I'm a kissless youngster. This weighs heavily on my self-esteem. 

I, with great shame acknowledge that there are moments when I'd like to pursue women relentlessly until I find someone who likes me. I realise I'm looking for validation from them which is unhealthy. Then better sense prevails and I realise that I may not be very happy alone but I can survive.This is one end of the pendulum.

I started smoking weed to become happy. I'm not proud of it. But it helps me. I'm using it as a crutch. I can't help it. I'm often overly hard on myself. I feel I'm socially awkward and have low self esteem which is a remnant of my past obese self.

 Hi Everyone 

**PLEASE REPLY TO THIS EMAIL WITHIN 24 HOURS BEFORE SERIOUS ACTION**. Someone has stolen my airpods from a black coloured case next to my keys and iPhone near the fences in the sport science oval this morning at 9 AM. I don't know why you did it but if you are willing to return them to my immediately, I will not expose your name and I will let you go without any complaints.

However, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN THEM, I WILL report **EACH AND EVERYONE** of you immediately to the **police** and **UWA.** If nothing happens by next Wednesday, I will make sure the cops are with me next week and I have the names of all people who were present. I also saw some people looking at me dropping my stuff off, so I suspect a few people. As I said, if you return them, i'll make no big issue and let you off easy, but if you DON'T, I will report **EVERY SINGLE PERSON** in this class to the police. The choice is yours. 

I dont have the nerve to look at this email :'( . 

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Readers,

Good evening. I understand that my rash action yesterday has no justifiability. This action of mine has been bothering me for every minute of the day and I thought avoiding it is only going to do more harm than addressing it. I am at your mercy to have an opportunity to explain certain factors that led me to such an unacceptable decision.

The email I wrote yesterday was not me as a person. I read it now and am at a loss of words. I personally cannot believe that I could write such an email. I believe this was a psychological response to the circumstances at the moment. It was a hot day, I finished work, tired, exhausted and hungry. I notice my air pods were missing and I immediately go into an emotional rush. Questioning myself, how could I be this careless. The air pods hold a sentimental value as they were a gift from my father. My mental state at that moment was as quite vulnerable as I had been through a lot the past week. I pay 19,000 dollars a semester in university tuition and my financial status is incredibly fragile. So, any ups and downs with money can daunt me. I did not perform as well in a test I helped my friends get an 80% in. I lost 200 dollars the day before this event occurred. This is the second time in a period of 6 months things went missing. The first time I lost my calculator and a whole pencil case set; and I didn’t do anything about it. I lost a couple hundred dollars due to unnecessary repairs which were not my fault. This past week has put me through a lot, and I couldn’t cope with all this. This incident was the breaking point for me. I was under a serious emotional influx and did not think of what I was going to do or what the consequences might be.

I am terribly sorry for this grave error of mine. At this point, I couldn't care less about the device. I acknowledge there may be no room for pardon, but I rely on your mercy to be pardoned. This is a learning moment for me, and I must get a grip over myself and my actions.

Sincere Apologies

Her stepdad is the CTO of an airport and makes 250k a year so whenever she needs help with money, they just loan her $1000. I think what gets me the most about it is that she complains to me often about how her boyfriend is irritable from work or how she has to stop using Rover for extra cash when she gets into a nursing program and my ideology is that she should feel luck they she doesn't have to work full time to make ends meet.

This could just be jealousy because I have to work two jobs to pay my bills and have extra for gas and groceries. My parents do not have money so I never ask them for anything because I know they can't afford it. I dropped out of college after two months because I realized I could afford to live without working full time. And whenever college gets brought up, she tries to convince me to go back.

-Work remotely on Fridays, and keep a regular 8:30-5  schedule on weekdays with opportunity for overtime during the holiday season

-unlimited pto at manager's discretion, rest of the benefits are your typical insurance, transit discount, and 401k matching

-80/20 schedule- 80% of my time is working issues, 20% is working on my own projects. They will also put you through coding training during that time and have been known to move those in this position to software.

Job 1 Cons:

-Not a company with the best reputation. The pay is pretty low but more than I make now.

-benefits are minimal compared to the other position. No lunches or snacks and no discount on the services we provide, no wellness program.

-very similar company problems to where I work now. Management is not great and it can be hard to move up in the company. Takes great effort to get things done.


Job 2 pros:

-Large company with a brand new office that has major growth

-excellent benefits: new macbook, catered lunch every day, phone and transit allowances, discount on their services, gym allowances, and the pay is $1 more. 

-my current manager is now working there and she's fantastic. 

Job 2 Cons:

- inbound freight logistics. Taking calls from angry truckers and being a mediator for angry shippers. Focus on IPH. I really don't like this career path and I really hate taking calls, but I'm really good at customer service.

-Me and a ton of other people at my current company got interviews here because they are hiring a few thousand people in upsizing. Very disposable and I'm leaving my current job because of people problems. 

-availability includes nights, weekends, and holidays. Remote days twice a month, possibly.

Throughout secondary school i was part of basketball club so that helped as i wasn't putting on that much weight, but i still was.

A couple weeks ago my mum became so concerned she thought i might have a medical problem as to why i wasnt losing any weight (i dont eat a dangerous amount) and made me get a blood test and the results came back that i was okay (a little embarrassing imo)

The doctor said i need to do more exercise which i did by joining badminton club and to cut out eating in the middle of the night. I'm moving away to university next week and i want to turn my life around and drastically lose weight while i am there. I was just wondering what else i could do. I want to completely massively change my lifestyle and i am willing to try anything.

I've tried drastic diets but i never last long, the military diet, the slim fast milkshakes but i don't think they're designed for longevity. I need something to last.

I don't want to drag this story on but I finally told him the truth because I couldn't bring myself to ghost such an amazing human being. After I told him, he said he didn't care what I looked like.

542,"I'm a 21 year old college student.  I've completed 5 semesters of mechanical engineering classes at a maritime academy.  My 2nd semester junior year I had to medically withdraw withing the last week after an attempted suicide.  I spent the next few months in a partial hospital program seeking help.  I was released from the program a month and a half ago.

Because of how specialized my major has gotten, I was unable to sign up for classes at my old school for the fall.  In addition to that, despite my medical withdrawal saving my (admittedly terrible) gpa from becoming un-salvageable, the school wants me to finish Calc III before returning for classes.  It's a whole other long story as to how I got to the end of junior year without completing calc III, I had to beg, bend rules and power through classes without proper preparation.

I applied for a community college this semester, with calc III being the only class I would be taking, as I wanted to avoid any unnecessary stress and sort of recover from the last few years of problems.

My school sent their transcript in to clear the calc II pre-requisite for the class. I had it delivered on time for registration.  My school did not have the proper formatting or documentation or something and I had to get a corrected one.  I was concerned about not being able to register on time, and the admin people said not to worry, I can apply late and it won't be a problem.  I attended classes in the meantime to stay on top and after 2 weeks the 2nd transcript arrived.  The re-requisite was cleared, and I was told that it was too late to register for classes.  I went from the head of the department, to the dean, to the president.  The answer has come back as definitively no.  This was yesterday.

I am in an incredible financial pinch.  I am the 2nd oldest in a family of 7, and my parents have essentially stopped paying for anything for me, as they simply cannot afford it.  The recent medical bills I had, combined with years of student loans that are going to start compounding in a matter of months, means that even though I have around $30.00 in the bank it does not accurately represent how broke I am. I have a part time job, only job I could find, and can feed and house myself, and that's about it.

__TL;DR__

At this point I don't see many good options.  I can't attend school for another year at least, and the now two years.  Getting a loan for the 5th year was going to be a stretch but I can certainly say that I will not be able to take out a loan at year 6 without a degree completed.

I've gotten a hold of a real estate agent and she's helpful with regards to what to do but never actually does anything. She tells me he needs to apply and that they need to create a fake listing, but that never happens so he can't apply. 

While I was texting with that woman about adding someone to the lease the property manager texts me back saying that no one can live there without being added to the lease. I've been trying to add him to the lease to no avail because while they're fairly responsive they are not very helpful in getting this done. I am worried about getting evicted or something, I've read the lease and while it stresses that another person must be added to the lease there is no mention of consequences like there is with having a pet on the premises prior to notifying the landlords / property manager, which clearly states the consequences are getting evicted. 

I've met the property manager and while he seems like a charismatic person, I don't necessarily see him as a ""friendly"" person so I worry he wouldn't be reasonable and would just say I broke the lease, require me to pay the hefty fee (of 2.5 times the rent plus rent while they look for another tenant and some fee mentioned about documents). I feel like that would be very lucrative for him, but maybe I'm just thinking of the worst.

547,"Recently i’ve had a lot of exam papers and tests to do as i’ve finished my GCSEs and started A-level. While i’ve been able to keep my cool in most subjects and achieved highly, the ones where it mattered the most to how I performed (I.E  other exams) were where I panicked and almost (or did) have a mental breakdown during the paper. 

Despite the fact that I perform very very well in subjects during class and informal tests, when I sit formal papers I can’t handle it and severely underperform. For example, in maths at GCSE I got consistent 8/9 grades (A*) in informal tests, except for the actual exam where i got a 6 (B) due to having a mental breakdown after panicking. I took a baseline test in maths today which was informal (but meant more to me specifically as the maths department are deciding if i can take further maths from my performance on it) and i panicked badly again. I wanted to ask to leave the room but i figured I’d screwed up either way so i might as well stay. 

I desperately want to take further maths at A- level alongside maths but they only just let me in for maths despite my final GCSE grade. There’s no doubt in my mind that i screwed up the baseline, but i know that i’m actually good at maths! I’m just as good as those who take further, but i... do this too often. Underperforming doesn’t help me prove that at all, coupled with being out of practice after the long summer holidays. I don’t know how to handle my anxiety at all, and i don’t even know what I would say to a counsellor if i did get one for this sort of thing. 

Does my anxiety mean i shouldn’t be considering further maths anyway? Would it be too much? I really need it for university, and i genuinely want to learn the content too. Not doing something i want to do and am capable of because i can’t handle my anxiety seems like a bad choice long term. How can I convince my teachers?

551,"Hello everybody
(Sorry for shitty formatting)
So let's jump right into it I suppose.

I go to school, I'm 15 years (soon to be 16) and when I'm on my own with no one around I feel pretty good but when I'm in a large group of people I always feel like everybody is just looking at me, even though they clearly are not and when I get that feeling I start sweating intensly .

So because of this feeling I told you about I tend to hang out with smaller groups of people who I know for a long time. That feeling drives me to do stupid stuff like when I'm in a hallway with other people I basicly am always looking at my phone to avoid eyecontact.

My friends now all went to different classes so know I'm alone with my ""friends"" (some of them are  nice but they don't seem like friends to me)
Because of this I started to issolate myself even more wich lead to more awkward stuff.

I don't like to show emotions that much because I think I might scare of people but because of that people think I'm some sort of emotionless robot who's fuel is reading books.

Even though I hate that feeling (and because of that inderectly large groups of people) I still feel the need to listen to people and to talk to them so it's like two sides of me are fighting and no one is winning.

So that's it I guess, I don't know what I want to acomplish with this, I guess I want to get some tips on how to change for the better if that wouldn't take too much time from you, already a thousand times thanks for reading this and bye

I think shes pretty insecure about her height as ive heard her complaining about it to her friends before but I'm not sure to what extent she is. Obviously I'm quite insecure at my height so I'm sure itll be hard for both of us. But should I ever bring it up?

So generally I go to school, do any revision I have to do, then just watch Youtube or play games for hours.
I hate it and I hate myself for not being strong enough to combat this.
I don't know what I can do, people say ""If you start doing something you'll get into it"", but for me this just isn't true, it always feels just as hard, any advice?",12Sep2019,2
562,"     Just a little backstory, I work as a carpenter remodeling houses for a living (kitchens, baths, etc.). There is a lady that has hired my company to do several projects for her, namely a full remodel of her upstairs bathroom. I only met this woman because I was working for my boss.

    The other day I was at her house doing a few small things for my boss and she asked if I do side work. I told her yes I do sometimes. She then asked me if I would do some small projects in her home for her on the side. Stuff like painting, minor drywall work etc. 

     I asked my boss if he was ok with me doing some work for her and he said it was ok with him as long as it wasn't big expensive projects. While we were discussing it he mentioned that while he was working for another contractor in the past he would always turn down opportunities for side work from the contractors customers out of loyalty to his boss.

       So there lies my dilemma. He says he doesn't mind, but then also says he never did things like that out of loyalty. So I'm having trouble deciding wether or not to do this side work. I don't want to seem like I'm taking work away from him but at the same time I like doing side work because I end up making more money then I would doing the work for my boss.

       Any thoughts?",12Sep2019,1
563,"I am college student, I make most of my money from scholarships and odd jobs. For the last 2 years I have been able to save up to 5k, recently I moved out and although my parents are giving me the money for rent and food, I needed extra few things that I spent with my own savings so I ended up with almost 4.5k, I also pay my own braces and I pay every month 125 but it has accumulated to 375, also coming up is my girlfriends 21st birthday so I booked an airbnb for a party with friends that sum up to $400. 

I never buy anything for myself but my girlfriend convinced me to buy 2 pair of sneakers that came out to 310$ and I cant stop feeling bad for spending that much money on shoes. I am now on my way to return both of them and my girlfriend told me that I should just keep them, but I don't know, I feel I need to save the money just in case. 

I don't work, like i said majority the money I get are from scholarships or awards that are left over from tuition. Next time I will get money is in 5 months, probably 1.7k so that's that.

As far as I know, I’m the only one who knows this and I don’t think that they know that I know. I’m really bad at keeping secrets.

I accepted an administration job at an investment firm shortly after graduation figuring it was a way to make money while I still figure out what I really want to do career wise. It is a terrific company with great benefits, great people and is ideally a place I would love to be at long term. However, I do not know the first thing about business or finance. I've been debating going back to school for an MBA and my company offers tuition reimbursement depending on the relevancy of your degree to the firm so I figured why not take advantage of it. Anyways, the main point of this whole post is that I honestly STILL after experience with research, writing, communications, administration- I still haven't found anything that I can see myself doing long term. A passion some might call it. I am simply stuck. Unsure of my next move and am beyond terrified of failure or making the wrong choice. Has anyone else ever experienced this or have gone through it? I know I shouldn't, but I feel almost as If I have failed at life watching everyone else pursue their dream jobs.

And while I was calling them, I asked the lady a couple of questions. And I asked her if there I should get immediate help for what is occurring with me. And she suggested me to call my PCP, and hear her recommendations. And I said ok. I’d do that, but what if she doesn’t give me an immediate appointment and asks me to wait a couple of days. Because the lady I was talking to, told me that their is a doctor that is available to see me tomorrow.

And she suggested that if I want early care, and that this doctor is pretty good. And that I could see him. And so she scheduled me an appointment with this said doctor. And told me to call my health insurance so that I could change my PCP, to him, that way the Heath insurance would cover it.

But I don’t want to change my PCP, I’ve been seeing her since I was little. So what should I do?????

If I don’t change PCP’s than I won’t be able to get checked in with the appointment I have scheduled tomorrow.

So basically, this girl(f16) and I(m16) have been friends for a little more than 2 years. Since last march I fell in love with her, and we always had some kind of 'attraction', but we never talked about it. Few weeks ago I told her what I felt and for how long I felt that, and she answered me back she also loved me, and that she was so happy she thought I was pranking her for the first days. But one week ago she told she was linking again with a guy(who was really violent with her a couple of time). She said he apologized and told me he wasn't that bad. Obviously I told her that wasn't good, because 1st he could go violent again and 2nd she just told me she loved me. The only thing she answered was that we weren't even together( I kind of get this) and she didn't want to hurt him(hurting me then) Well, right know they're hanging out and I got mixed feelings. I feel sad while she's with one guy who just wants to have""sex"" with her and hurt her while me, loving here and being with her through many of her problems, I was given the cold shoulder.

Essentially, I dated an older man when I was 12-16. It was always a positive experience. We broke up and years later we are back together again and are currently engaged. I don't talk about it much because I usually get a lot of hate for it. So I was wondering if there was some sort of place online or here on reddit for people with experiences like me. It'd be nice to talk to other people who have also had these kinds of relationships and had been a positive experience for them. Or just people who dated someone older when they were young and are still together now.

573,"Little bit of back-story first. I have ulcerative colitis. It is a form of irritable bowel disease with no cure that affects the large intestine. It is somewhat similar to Crohns, with both of them being recognised as physical disabilities as they are life-long and do not have a cure (other than major surgery to remove your intestine). 

I would say that I manage it very well, and have had no issues for the last four-ish years. I have had no absences up until the beginning of this year (having started at this job almost two years again) and declared my illness upon applying for the role.

Recently the illness has flared up and I have begun noticing and feeling symptoms more and more, and have had to take 1-3 days off every odd week as I physically do not feel comfortable taking an extremely busy train or a taxi where I cannot easily access a toilet (yes, it's one of those illnesses unfortunately). I recently switched manager, and although he has been made fully aware of my illness and what can happen, he takes practically no notice and raises occupational health requests repeatedly (UK assistance for working with illnesses).

Essentially, they have told him to make adequate changes as it is very well managed by myself, and can only really be improved upon by the business themselves. This involves flexible hours, taking me off of ridiculous shifts I never agreed to, working from home, etc. He has ignored everything, and has yet again raised another request whilst claiming all he has done is to support me and ensure I can work.

Is there anything that you would suggest that I can either do independently or put forth to my manager that can address this in some way as it feels like he's just fishing for a reason to fire me? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not particularly confrontational and try to just get on with work, but he's really making this hard on me and it's not my fault. It feels as though, because I physically don't have a limb missing or am in a wheelchair that I am somehow making an illness up that my doctor AND occupational health have confirmed.",12Sep2019,1

575,"I had heard rumours about this person in my year group, (we can call him Robbie or something) lots of people said he was trans/weird/gay and lots of people insulted him to the point where he had no friends and at lunch he’d have to eat food at home, I don’t know if it was because of what people had been saying about him or if he had mental issues but I never really listened to them since I never talked to him before we had no classes together at all. I know at first break when I would visit the school library he’d be in the corner of the room on his phone behind large bookcases, as if Robbie was trying to hide. I just thought he was antisocial and wouldn’t want to be alone. 

Well, I’m in Year 10 now (14-15 year olds) and they switched up the classes completely so people who never had classes with each other suddenly had lessons with each other. Anyway, for the History class seating plan I was placed next to Robbie. I didn’t really care about the things people told me about Robbie and he didn’t seem to mind sitting next to me so I just went on the with the lesson like usual. I noted that Robbie didn’t say anything for the whole lesson, as if he was on mute. The only time he said something was when the teacher was doing the register, and when he called Robbie’s name, Robbie replied quietly and it sounded as if he was faking a females voice. I remembered what people told me about Robbie supposedly being trans and I just shrugged it off since it wasn’t my business.

Next lesson I was feeling confident and decided to give out the books, it was a small class and a lot of new people so I figured I’d give out the books so I’d be able to see if I remembered people’s name. I get to Robbie’s book and then gave it to the wrong person (Important later on in the story, let’s name him Cole) Cole then yells my name and says ‘I’m not a faggot’ I apologise and give Cole his book and give Robbie his book and apologise to him as well. Later on in the class, someone asks if gay people would be a thing in the Anglo Saxon period and the teacher says the gays would have been killed without a doubt. I hear Cole mutter to his friend ‘Still should be like that...’ I know for a fact Robbie heard that too and I felt a pang of guilt. 

Today in history we had a supply so people weren’t really listening and sat next to their friends. Robbie still sat next to me, I knew he had no friends in the class and probably saw no reason to move. Whilst me and my friend are talking, my friend suddenly whispers to me ‘That guys handwriting is really neat, like neater then mine!’ and I look over to Robbies book to see it look extremely neat and tidy, nothing like my scruffy handwriting. I then whispered that if she liked his handwriting, she should tell him but then she said she didn’t know his name and didn’t want to ask. I would of said it on her behalf, but since people told me Robbie was supposedly trans, I didn’t want to use the wrong pronoun and upset him, but I didn’t want to call him a girl either, just in case. I also didn’t want to say his name wrong. 

A few tables away this annoying girl (name her Sheryl) suddenly shouted ‘Hey, person next to Velmashaircut, what’s your name?!’ Robbie looks up at her and replies with his name, again making the quiet feminine noise. Sheryl then asked ‘Are you a boy or girl?’ I instantly felt second hand embarrassment since she wasn’t asking it nicely but rather mockingly. Robbie says he’s a boy and Sheryl says everyone calls him a girl. He looks quiet upset and goes and does back to his work. 

Even if I was annoyed, I was sorta glad she asked if he was a boy or girl because then I could talk to Robbie without saying the wrong pronoun. I tell Robbie me and my friend think he has amazing handwriting and that we really likes it. Robbie looks up at us and smiles, it was an actual happy smile. He seemed so relieved. He thanks us and after a bit of chatting, asks for our names. I was happy when he asked that because it just confirmed he enjoyed talking to us and probably wanted to talk again. It also reminded me this was the first conversation he had with anyone in our class. We introduce ourselves, talk a bit, and get back to work. He was really nice and sweet.

Remember Cole? Well he decided to sit right next to Robbie with his arrogant squad of Braindead Paston and Penguin Jake. They began messing around with Robbie asking if they where friends and being passive aggressive, mocking and rude, calling him a faggot and stuff. I hear and tell my friend about it and we start shading them in whispers, loud enough for Robbie to hear, but quiet enough for the asses making fun of him not to hear. 

I remembered this isn’t the first time Coles been making fun of Robbie and I’d tell him and his friends to shut up but I’m antisocial and not good at insulting so they’d probably begin making fun of me and how I look, I would have just burst into tears and made myself look slightly stupid. The fact the supply or regular teacher never heard any of this was astounding because they weren’t even trying to hide it. I figured the normal teacher will be back tomorrow and hopefully they return back to their normal seats and leave him alone. 

I had to give some props to Robbie though, he didn’t reply to any of the remarks and looked down and did the work, acting as if they didn’t even exist. I was tempted to tell Robbie at the end of the lesson I’d be willing to swap seats or ask the teacher to move him if he was uncomfortable but I didn’t know if he’d be too weirded out with me willing help him despite barely knowing each other. 

I want to tell our regular teacher Robbie is getting bullied and he has to do something, but I’m sorta nervous because I don’t want to be a snake or make myself a target. If I do they might not even stop and may be a bit more aggressive. I really want to slap Cole and his stupid friends and just shout at them about how rude they are and he isn’t in any position bullying anyone with his man bun but I’m sorta scared. I might just write an anonymous note to the teacher and hope nobody figures out it’s me. 

Should I tell the teacher? And should I be his friend, or at least to talk to Robbie more? Not out of guilt, but because he seems genuinely nice.",12Sep2019,1
576,"I’m getting older but I didn’t think at 25 (F) I’d already be getting angry at people playing loud music and yelling excitedly. 

I have anxiety and depression but have always been outwardly calm. Recently, maybe in the last year, I got a new symptom out of the blue. When I hear sudden loud noises I feel intensely angry. No matter where it’s coming from. And I remain feeling angry or frustrated about it for a few minutes. I don’t know if this is a symptom of my diagnosis, or if it’s a symptom of something else.

Examples of this would be my relative who blows his nose loudly, thunder, a car playing loud music, a loud car passing by the house. It’s not logical anger, I have no real reason that it angers me other than the sudden onset of a loud noise.

Male) i have had a usual barber since 2012-2013 and last November I went to a Turkish  barber he did a good job I thought so I went back (my usual barber is popular so it’s not easy to go to when he has 5-6 old guys sitting there with near balding heads) I think the new barber hasn’t known my hair and since iv went to him for a few months my hairline looks way more receded and higher looking and my face looks super round as supposed to it usually being slim looking with the hair, idk why. This has happened before in feb 2018 and I had to grow it out for 2-3 months before I went back to my usual barber and I had my slimmer face back and fuller hair.

591,"Growing up, I stayed in Florida with my mom and her side of the family during the school year, and over summer I would visit my dad and his side of the family in Texas. I have a complicated relationship with my dad. I love him, and he's never done anything to make me think that he doesn't love me just as much, however, he's not very good at taking care of himself, he's been unemployed for probably about 7 years now, and has been homeless off and on during this time. Because of this, I've been visiting him less and less, since he hasn't had a safe place for me to stay. I think I've only visited him 3 times in the last 10 years. Recently, he's come into some money after being approved for disability, I forgot the name of it, but he was diagnosed with a disease that has been degenerating his spine and making it harder for him to walk or just move in general. Anyways, with this money he's decided to move to Las Vegas with his girlfriend (who I don't particularly like) and some friends (who I don't know) I'd like to see my dad again, however I'm not comfortable being around his girlfriend or his friends for an extended period of time, but I also don't want to just visit my dad for a weekend and then not see him for another 4 years, especially now that he's so old. If he was still living in Texas, this wouldn't be as much of a problem, since I have other family there, and if I had any issues with my dad, I could just spend some time with them, but that isn't an option any more now that he's moved.

The thing is, while I was waiting for the result (so before I found out she lied to me), I hooked up with someone else, a really nice, cute and fun guy I met online. We practiced safe sex for penetration and all but I gave him some oral sex here and there with no protection. 

Now that I found out that the girl I was with transmitted me chlamydia, I know I should tell him that I might have transmitted chlamydia to him as a form of courtesy (wouldn't one prefer that than just not knowing and accidentally giving it to someone else?) but I feel super sad because it might mess up the chances I have with him. I really want to keep seeing him and hanging out with him. 

Can I get any advice on how to break this to him? I know chlamydia isn't that bad but I do feel like he might see me as dirty or something, which I am not. But I still feel horrible. I also even asked my doctor if he could give me an extra prescription that I could give him as it is hard for him to get tested due to him living with his parents. I feel super bad about all of this! 

I really appreciate any help that you guys could give.",12Sep2019,1
596,"(throwaway because my husband knows my account)  
The title is basically the gist of it, but I'll elaborate so it makes a little more sense. 

I feel like I constantly need things dumbed down for myself. Someone can tell me how to do something, and I'll immediately forget (even if I repeat it word for word back to them) or won't understand a word they've said to me. 

I'm super into video games and movies, yet when I watch or play something - unless it's beat you over the head obvious - I cannot find the words to tell you what the story is about, or I'll overcomplicate it to where I'm not even sure if I'm making sense. Most times, I can't even tell you what the damned game is about that I'm playing. 

I also really love reading. I have since I was a child to the point where every year for my birthday, all I get is books or gift cards for bookstores. I can read for the longest time, but I won't be able to tell you what the hell I just read unless you've asked me what the name of the book is. 

It's not that I don't concentrate. Despite my brain constantly wondering, I try as hard as I can to focus - even if it means saying it aloud as I go. I guess the problem is I'm not retaining anything, and that makes me feel stupid. It makes it so hard to have a conversation with someone about something I'm actually interested in, even if I've played the game over and over again, or read the book twice, because when they ask me questions about it I genuinely don't know what the hell to say. ""Sorry I don't know what you're talking about even though I've played it literally all day every day for who knows how long now."" 

I've discussed this with my therapist, and they think it might be something to do with my epilepsy, but that doesn't make sense to me nor can I get into my neurologists office within' the next three months due to scheduling and money issues. 

Does anyone have any idea what I can do to help myself not feel this way, or be able to retain the information I'm having trouble with? I'm tired of feeling stupid all the time and having to hide behind humor. It's getting genuinely exasperating to the point I cannot tolerate myself.",12Sep2019,1

598,"TL;DR: GF [20] left hickeys on my [22] neck (with my consent). We are both adults that are economically constrained to living at home (this is CA). My mother saw my hickeys. She did. Not like them. Should I not care, or am I really in the wrong here?

I am 22 and living at home since majoring in Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, Social Science and Physics is expensive, stressful, and too time consuming for a job that’d pay me enough to live in the area where I go to school (this is Los Angeles). I started a new romantic relationship with my former Biology 101 lab partner recently (two weeks ago). My new GF [20] and I are both a bit hot blooded at times and got into it while making out. She asked for my consent before leaving me hickeys (we happen to both like them). She left them out of sight, however, if grew careless and walked out my bedroom door with a tank top. My mother was standing in the hallway and saw the marks.
On the one hand, we are both consenting adults. On the other, I am still living under my parents’ roof and feel still like I need their blessing to avoid unnecessary strife in this house (if, hypothetically, they say, “break up with her or you’ll start paying rent.” I am SCREWED). How do I navigate this situation. Am I in the wrong? Do I need to establish boundaries with my mother?
My GF is sweet and considerate and level headed (at least when we’re not being passionate), but I fear I may have destroyed her reputation in this house with my carelessness. But should that even be CONSIDERED a factor. She and I are both “the good child” from our respective households and finally get to permission to act out with each other, but it’s not like I could just march into my parents room and berate them for not liking what they see on my goddamn neck. They are a fair set of parents  for everything except when it comes to relationships (they have complicated relationships with sex as a concept). What do you think, Reddit? Should I put my foot down and say, “I don’t care.” or “I’m sorry.” Am I really the one in the wrong here?",12Sep2019,0
599,"She has been ignoring me for the past week and it's hurting me. We used to do a lot of things together and we always helped eachother when we were feeling down. I even talked her out of suicide with the help of my other best friend. 

During the entire summer vacation, I was excited to see her again. The first day of school (September 2nd), we waited for eachother at the gate and talked to eachother when walking at our school. We were really happy to see eachother again. 

A few days later, we were sitting next to eachother during lunch break, and whenever I said something to her, she responded with very few words, but when someone else talked to her (even when it was someone who she doesn't like), she was really happy and had long conversations with them. Even when I texted her that evening (and the days after it), she responded with very few words and it sounded like she didn't care at all.

My other best friend (the one who helped me talk her out of suicide a few months before) told her that it looked like she was ignoring me and she replied that ""it was because we don't go to the same class anymore"". The thing is, she also doesn't go to the same class as the people who she has been talking to for the past few days. I don't mind the fact that she has more friends than before (I'm actually happy for her), but the fact that she has been completely ignoring me really hurts. Today, I saw her and when I said hello, she didn't even say anything to me.

If she continues to ignore me tomorrow, I will tell her how I feel about it during lunch break and the other best friend will stay by my side. The problem is, I have no idea what I'm supposed to say. I'd love it if she apologises and everything is back to normal afterwards, but I know it doesn't work out like that.

That broke my spirit and I tried and almost succeeded at committing suicide by taking a bunch of oxycodone. 

A few weeks after, I met my now boyfriend of almost one year. Since then I haven’t really felt depressed, but when we get in arguments I feel extremely low like I’m not worth anything and I’d be better off dead. It almost feels like I go through the stages of grieving. I don’t feel like I’m ever wrong in an argument, I get angry when he points out discrepancies, I bring up things he was wrong about in the past, I get sad and cry and think I should just off myself because I’m only making his life worse, then I calm down a bit and forget those feelings. Once I settle down and we “make up” I feel good and like things are back to normal.

Pretty dumb I know but I never really bothered to change them I thought who cares what I do?
 
Yesterday my husband updated the security cameras from his phone and he can see everyone who can view them and he noticed that my account had a new nickname to it and a creepy photo of a hooded avi. 
I can say with confidence it wasn’t me and it wasn’t just randomly generated the nickname was creepy as well. I’ve never messed with the setting since we got them. He checked when’s the last time someone viewed our home and it read 8 am yesterday I sleep in with our baby so it wasn’t me and he was driving to work.
 
My social media accounts have also been logged into by unknown devices and have been used in a nearby city when I’ve never been to that city in years, sometimes they’ve been used here in the city I live in. I’ve changed my passwords now but I still feel so creeped out disturbed. I had other sensitive information and it doesn’t appear they have messed with that.

He said he wanted to plan a baby at the end of the year. He knows that I want kids too, so I thought he really wanted them because he always talks about it..

Yesterday out of the blue he said he did not want anymore kids. He said he was done, he said ""why would I have more kids when I already have three?"" This caught me off guard and I just kept quiet, he started questioning me about it and said ""don't you agree?"" and I said ""yes"" because I was in shock that this whole year he has been playing me saying he wanted kids and now I don't know where this came from. He told me he never wanted more kids.

He said ""if you want kids I'm not the man for you and that I still had time to go find  younger guy to have kids with.""  I didn't even want to talk to him about it because I thought maybe he's saying that just to pick a fight, so I agreed to everything he said. 

So what do you recommend I do? Break up with him?  Talk about it? Why would he just bring that up now? We wasted a year together to come find out he never wanted kids and lied! who does that? Do you think he's just saying that because he wants me to break up with him?",12Sep2019,2
613,"Context: Am a study abroad student currently living in Japan. I had signed up for a sort of language exchange partnership program where you get to have 1-on-1 practice with a native Japanese speaker (and vice versa for me being a native English speaker). 

However, ever since I got here which was 3 weeks ago, I have only had one 90 minute session where we had lunch together at a cafe. In the application, I had to put how often I wanted to meet with my partner to which I said once a week was fine (this was the least frequent option). Despite this, my partner just doesn't seem that eager to hang out anymore even though they were the ones that also signed up for the program. When I asked them when they'd like to meet up again they didn't reply until **several days later**, which is when I sent them another text as a ""bump."" 

Finally, after one more day, they respond but made up some excuse like ""oh I am very busy with X, Y, and Z responsibility."" Which i totally understand since they DO have other things to do. I even told them that I was willing to be flexible by working around their schedule. But of course, after another **4 days** of text silence they reply with some BS like ""my work (lmao) hours are at this time and in either one of these 3 places. You can just visit me and we can practice."" You're probably going to say ""well just clarify what time and place then."" But don't forget that they took ~4 days TWICE to respond to 2 of my messages.

It's such a waste of time to beg someone to devote a small portion of their time (that they said they were willing to give) once a week for raw language practice. My time here is limited and I wanted someone that was at least going to guarantee me weekly practice. I get that I could talk to other Japanese students (which I already do to a fair degree) but it's just--you sign up for something like a language partner program and expect them to be a more *solid* option compared to random Japanese students. What's really crazy is how some of my new Japanese friends hear me complain about this and say that they want to be my language partner. Did I just roll a shitty hand?

What also makes me upset is how a lot of my dormmates' language partners are frequently with their assigned international student in study rooms, cafes, and lounges just practicing and having fun together. I sound like a baby but that shit just stings :\ I guess I have to go out of my way to find a new partner? Their partners literally go out of their way to hang out at a fairly constant basis while mine tells me to ""visit her"" when she's at work. Everytime I hear a story about someone and their speaking partner going to Osaka or Nara or this and that I just get really fucking upset. Yeah I get it, don't compare yourself to others but it's hard when it seems like everyone is having a great time. I truly want to learn the language (currently around N4 level) and speaking/listening are my weakest points imo.

&amp;#x200B;

That toxic person is finally gone and it's great.  His lease was up sept 10th.  HOWEVER, I get a text from my cool roommate, says his mom wants to show the place to someone today (sept 12) even though the landlord literally told us he wouldn't rent to anyone right away so I'm like oh great.  I don't even know why she's involved, she's all about the church and everything, I assumed it was someone she knew from there.  So i text her about this person, she keeps saying stuff like ""he seems nice"" ""he seems real polite"" and I'm basically like soooo you don't really know this person because no one uses the word ""seems"" unless they aren't sure.  Like I basically wanted to say, if you want to help someone you don't even know so badly, let them live at your house, don't pawn them off on someone else, wtf is wrong with you... 

&amp;#x200B;

So she shows up with this person today to look at this place, he is like ten minutes late and literally wearing a shirt that says ""F YOU YOU F'ING F!"" (With all the other letters included) So this showed me immediately that i was right, she doesn't know anything about this person, and after that last jerk we had to deal with who basically ruined our living situation, I'm really being cautious about who comes in here.  So he barely even looks at the place and says he's interested.  Eye roll... 

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted my landlord shortly after and here is how that conversation went... 

&amp;#x200B;

 me-hey nick.... i don't know about this new dude, between us it seems like she doesn't know anything about him at all from the way she answered my questions about him and the way he showed up with her with a shirt with curse words all over it.  And he seems willing to just live anywhere just like Nate, I really don't want to have the same situation again.  Any way we can really look into this person? 

nick-Yeah for sure man, i've been in contact with his wife and called his job.  Did you have a chance to talk to him?"" 

me-Yeah for like a minute, I mean he SEEMS nice but that doesn't really tell me anything, so that did crazy person.  He seems like wannabe gangsta with curse words all over his shirt literally a shirt that said FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING FUCK!!!!Knowing how micah's mom hated that language i wonder what she thought.  Anyway idk dude, sorry I'm not trying to complain but I'm also not trying to have a repeat occurrence. 

nick-It certainly seems like poor judgment to wear a shirt like that to an appointment.  it's pretty difficult to judge tenants based on one conversation and talking to people who have a vested interest in saying nice things.  It probably makes sense to give him a shorter lease term and then we can evaluate him at the end of the month to see if he's a good fit 

&amp;#x200B;

aka he's just going to rent to him anyway.  What kind of situation is this where roommates are just forced on us and we have no say?  Why doesn't this person just live with their ""wife""?  Sounds like bs.... Should I just get out of here?  My lease is month to month and I can leave at any time basically.  I just can't believe this landlord would say he won't bring anyone in right away and now this wannabe gangsta loser with curse words all over his shirt is going to be renting here.  Unbelievable.  Like we can't wait for other options?  The last lease was up literally 2 days ago, why are we jumping all over someone 2 days later knowing the way he is already?  This landlord does not seem to care at all about the living situation here despite what he says.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR Just got out of toxic living situation with horrible roommate who flipped out and had tantrums like a ten year old and would talk all kinds of crap behind our backs via text until confronted then he moved out, landlord says he won't rent to anyone for a while, 2 days after the toxic person leaves showing the place to some complete clown and is ready to sign him up despite me telling him this is an awful idea and the other roommate hasn't even met him yet smh...",12Sep2019,1

628,"  It seems like I'm always having to pay for things whenever I'm out with my friends. I don't mind treating someone out and paying for a taxi but overtime it does get annoying if they don't acknowledge it.  This one time we were all in the taxi  and I told my friend he should pay this time because I always do. When we get to our stop they just leave the taxi and I have no choice but to pay.  

I also really hate having things under my name (debit/credit) especially when getting a hotel. I remember getting a place to stay at and telling my friends I found a place let's split the bill it all already paid for under my name. They agree and will send the money later ; We all live overseas in Japan so we always go out and enjoy night life.  But anyways after a night out of drinking and partying they will like forget about the money they owe me, and we will just talk about the crazy shit we did that night. I didn't want to bring up the money they owe me because it was  a fun night, I didn't want to kill the mood. I was hoping they will just remember and pay me back  but I guess not. A week later I had to remind them again about the money and they did pay me back. It's just annoying I have to bug them about it, it doesn't take long to transfer money from bank to bank.

636,"I'm 26, and for the moment I still live at home. I don't really get food cooked for me, I very occasionally ask my mom for something, and only if she's already cooking for herself too. So I'm not used to having everything done for me or something. This is kind of mostly a rant about myself and my stupid relationship with food.

I've always been a picky eater and a while back I decided I would try to not burden anyone else with it. If my boyfriend cooks something he likes, I don't ask him to not put 5 different things in the meal just so I'll eat it too. I don't want him to not enjoy his food as much because of me. I \*can\* cook, and I like quite a few foods, but they're often foods made with more expensive ingredients, or foods that take a long time to make. I guess I'm not necessarily \*that\* picky of an eater, I just grew up around a lot of food I hated and was often forced to eat. We were pretty poor so we'd basically have the same meal every day for a week. 

That brings us to today, where I can not stand eating the same food more than 2 days in a row. So for me, cooking once on sunday for most of the week is kinda out of the question. Same for preparing different meals on sunday and eating them throughout the week, that shit doesn't taste good anymore after it's been sitting in the fridge for so long. 

Problem is, I get \*extremely\* angry when I get home and realise I have to cook - I absolutely hate having to cook out of necessity. It takes any joy out of it for me. It's already such limited time that I have at home before I have to shower, wash my hair, dry it, and go to sleep, that having to use up that time to cook seems absolutely awful to me. So most nights, I just have a small sandwich or I just don't eat. At work, I either order food, or don't eat. There are times when I have dinner leftovers that I take with me, but it's so rare it doesn't count. 

I have such a weird relationship with food, cause despite all this, food is super important to me. Like, if I go somewhere I like and the food sucks or there is nowhere to eat, it will bring me very down. It literally ruins my day. I would pick a city to travel to based on how good the food is supposed to be. Eating something I like will make me SO happy it makes my day.

I know, I'm the annoying person who complains there's nothing to eat, I'm lazy, I'm picky, you can call me anything, I've already heard it. But some actual advice would be helpful.",12Sep2019,2

641,"I’ve (20F)  never talked about this to anyone besides my ex and even then I didn’t get too into it because I don’t like thinking about it. Its been bothering me a little bit lately and I wanted get an outside looking in opinion. There’s A LOT of detail and I’ll try to organize it as best as I can but TLDR; at the bottom. 

My mom and dad were never married. As long as I can remember my parents didn’t like each other. I really only know my dads half of the story about why my parents weren’t together so know that most of what I’m saying is what I’ve been told by my dad, grandma and step mom. When I was a month old my mom left me because “she didn’t want me”. I’ve always thought this was weird because I have 2 older brothers from my mom and she was still in their life, I think? My dad says she left to California one day, we were living in Las Vegas, and my dad saw the opportunity to get a lawyer and get full custody of me ASAP. My grandma drove from California that same day and we lived in a hotel room for awhile. I’ve seen pictures from this time where I was sleeping in the drawer of the hotel room. I think it’s worth mentioning that my mom has some serious mental issues. From her end she didn’t tel me the specifics other than “mommy needs to take a lot of pills everyday to be okay”. My brothers would tell me how before pills that she was so angry all the time and super erratic. From my understanding my mom is a depressed bipolar schizophrenic. My mom apparently freaked out when she heard and came back and threatened to fight to get me back but when the court day came she gave in and let my dad take me. She got visitation rights but I don’t think it was 50/50. I remember my dad meeting my step mom when I was 2 and I had a lot of issues being with her throughout my entire life, but I currently have an alright relationship now. Around the same time my mom met my step dad, he was really cool and I miss him. When I was 3 both my parents married, but my mom moved to New Jersey because that’s where my step dad lived and worked. After this I only saw my mom when I had breaks from school. I essentially only saw my mom over the summer for one month out of the year. During these times I went out there and also hung out with my two older brothers. I only saw them a couple times a year. When my oldest brother turned 18, I was 10,  he left my moms house, he was the only one that lived there full time, moved to California I didn’t see him as often and I haven’t talked to him since I was 17. When I was 14 my 2nd older brother turned 18 he also stop coming out to visit my mom. I spent 2 summers alone with my mom and then I completely cut her out of my life. 

The first summer I spent alone with my mom was the worst. Nothing that she did though, all me, I got caught sending nudes to a girl and I was forced to come out as gay. It was awful, but my mom was more mad that I was sending nude to strangers at 14 rather than me being gay. I honestly don’t remember if she told my dad or not. I think my step mom caught me soon after I got back and I was forced to come out as gay again. This time tho they were mad about both, more so that I was gay tho. They called me disgusting and put me in church classes. The next summer with my mom I don’t remember too much. I remember just being on my moms phone 24/7. At my dads house I wasn’t allowed to have one and when I had access to my moms I took it to talk to my friends. When I got back my mom called me every fucking day. It was so annoying and time consuming because she just called and wanted to talk forever but I had things to do. I was busy trying to live my life and I told her that she can only call me 3 times a week. She agreed to it but called me like 5 times. It irritated me that she wasn’t listening to what I asking of her.  I told her she can only call me once a week from now on. She called me 3 days in a row. On the last day she called me twice, I forget what it was about but when I brought up her calling me again she got mad and said “well if (step mom names) would pass along my texts to her and stop being a bitch I wouldn’t have to call you again”. I didn’t get along with step mom at all. We would fight every day. Screaming, yelling, lying, I hated her. When my mom called her a bitch tho I got so mad at her. I don’t even know why. I hung up on my mom and ignored her calls for a week. I took one phone call of her after my dad forced me too but fought and I haven’t taken a phone call of hers since. My dad and step mom always asked why I wouldn’t talk to her. I just told them that I hated her and she was a bad mom and she’s crazy. 

I honestly to this day don’t know the real reason why I don’t talk to her. I feel like it’s some deep thing inside me that I just can’t think of but has to be there for me to feel strongly about this. That’s mainly why I’m posting on reddit to see if someone out there can see the answer that I just don’t. I’m too afraid/bust to go to therapy at this point in my life. 

One time my step mom invited over my mom and 2nd older brother over after a couple months of me going no contact. I refused to even see her. I locked myself in the bathroom for 30 minutes while my step mom was thinking of every punishment she could think of to get me to go talk to her. I eventually sat in the room with her. I didn’t say anything but I listened. While my mom was talking she pushed my hair behind my ear and I told her “don’t fucking touch me” and stood up and started screaming at her. My brother tried to calm me down but I just walked away from her and the situation as a whole. She literally chased me around the house and I was slamming doors in her face. I walked out the front door and my mom tackled me. My brother put me in some wrestling move hold. I later learned that because I had a history of saying suicidal things they thought I was going to jump in the middle of the road. This is fucking crazy to me because I lived in the middle of the country. We barley had cars drive by. My brother took me into a room just me and him and kept asking why I don’t want to talk to her. I gave the same reasons as I gave my parents and told him she was annoying, bad mom, I hated her. He was the only kid that still talked to her. My oldest brother stopped talking to her a few years after he moved out. There was a lot of pressure on my 2nd bother to try and fix things and I honestly feel bad I put him in that position. 
 

The first day of my junior year changed everything. I still didn’t have any access to electronics. I was still being forced to go to church classes but I was secretly dating this girl from school. I went a full year of stealing one of my younger siblings devices and hiding them around the house. Tablets, old iPhones, my DSi actually got internet and I was texting my gf of Twitter from there. First day of junior year I get caught. My younger sister saw me out something on a high shelf, went to look and found an iPod and went straight to tell my dad and step mom. We had an awful fight. 2 days later the tension was at an all time high and my step mom told me if I disrespect her again that she was going to slap me. I was 16 at the time and way too old to be getting hit by parents. I told her if she slaps me I’m going to slap her back. She gasped and cried. I was walking through the house later that night when I heard her telling my dad a twisted version of the story and telling him to “be a man”. I ran to me and my 3 other sisters rooms and was sitting in my bed, my sister in her bed,  when my dad came in and went to me closet and started tearing my closet apart, throwing my stuff around, he was yelling at me and lifted my dresser holding our tv and threw it completely breaking it. We were yelling at each other when he pushed me, I fell and tried to hit him and he got on top of me and started slapping me. My younger sister grabbed a bat and told us to stop but he grabbed it out fo her hands so fast that she ran out of the room he hit me a few more times while sitting on my chest when my step mom came it. I was begging her to tell him to stop but she just told me, while holding my 2 year old brother at the time, “you deserve this”. I got back on my feet but my dad pushed me again. I twisted my ankle but he called me an over dramatic dyke. To stop acting like my mother. I went to leave through the door but my dad pushed me and I hit the wall behind me and broke through the dry wall. He said later that he thought I was going to hurt my step mom. I wasn’t. Pretty sure they still don’t believe me to this day. I cried on the floor and they left. My dad came back later and ripped apart my bed and found my diary. He told me he should have let my mom abort me. I didn’t sleep that night and later went onto my 2nd hidden device to tell my gf what just happened. The next day at school I had some light bruises on my face. Enough that a few people noticed. This one girl who I hate to this day laughed in front the entire girls locker room after seeing my face and hand shaped bruises on my back and arms and said “oh what did your daddy beat you”. I told the school counselor after my gf forced me to. I ended up in foster care. My oldest brother took me in for awhile until he decided that me getting a B+ in calculus was unacceptable. Haven’t talked to him since. My mom flew over to see me when She heard what happened. I think she wanted to get custody of me, leave my step dad and buy a house here. I didn’t want to see her at all, but the social workers told me I HAD to. When she saw me she brought me Taco Bell and tried to talk to me. I ignored every word. Eventually started crying and yelling at her. She also went to my court hearing once. Both my parents made complete fools of themselves there. My dad acting like he owned the room, but getting shut down by everyone and my mom acting like the crazy lady. 

I didn’t talk to my dad again until last November. I feel like crap all the time because I wasn’t apart of my 8 younger siblings lives anymore. I saw them once a year. I hadn’t really hung out with them without wine social worker around since the night before. Even then they only probably remember the horrible person I was then. I wasn’t to make thing right so for my dads birthday I sent him a card saying I want to try to have a relationship again. It took awhile to be comfortable again, but I try to go over to see my siblings and I can actually be around my parents and get past what happened. My dad helped me by driving me down to San Diego when I wanted to buy a car but needed a ride. Things with there are basically getting better and part of me is happy with that.

With my mom tho is another side. Over the years she has tried to reach out to me. Every attempt is met with me insulting her and telling her I hate her and wanting zero contact. I haven’t heard from her in awhile and for he more part I’m okay with that. There is a new voice in my head tho asking me why tho. Why could I get over the horrible situation with my dads side but I’m okay with never speaking to my mom again? I think it’s weird. Looking back I said a lot of horrible shit to her that I regret but even past that I don’t want to try and have a relationship with her again. Part of me is afraid of regretting it when she dies but I honestly think I could get over it after a  week or two. Over the summer I got an email from my stepdad, who I hadn’t talked to since I was 15 telling me I should talk to my mom and that my dad won and got what he wanted. I told him I’m sorry but I can’t and I didn’t hear back. 

I hear all the horrible things my mom did when I was younger and add it too how she acted and for some reason in my head that’s justified not to talk to her anymore. I always remember my mom just making me uncomfortable. She would tell me things as a kid like “my hair stylist is a black some, please don’t mention it when we’re there” “I used to work a very dirty job and that’s why I had to move to New Jersey”. She would often talk bad about my dad or make jokes about how she didn’t like him. She would sleep a lot because of her meds and when she was on them she would just act weird. Like not get social cues very well or just over think things. Is he also had a bad temper even with the meds. When I was 6 I hid my moms cigarettes and she shook me and screamed at me until I showed her I hid them under my bed. I guess had certain  issues and allergies when I was growing up with my lady parts. I remember my mom yelling at me when she saw blood I’m in my underwear. She took me to the hospital and the doctors for a few days thought I was being sexually abused. I remember being put under at a hospital back home and after that I couldn’t take bubble baths. I never really knew why. She would bring Thai up when I was 12-13 when my brothers were around and I fucking hated it. I acted like I didn’t remember anything thinking she would stop talking about it and instead she paused the movie the entire family was watching to question me about it. She would ask me if my younger sisters had started puberty yet, like wtf idk. She thought buying me things would buy my love and acting like she was a friend more than a mom. 

This I honestly getting longer than I thought so I’ll stop. If you have questions I’ll answer in the comments. I really just looking at an outsiders view on why I don’t talk to my mom. What I should do if anything and any advice moving forward. If you read the whole thing then thank you. 

TLDR; my mom left when I was a month old. Came back but moved to 3000 miles away when I was 3. I saw her once or twice a year after that. She has a history of mental illness such as depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, anxiety, OCD. I haven’t talked to her since I was 15, I’m 20 now, because of a fight we had over the phone. She’s tried to reach out but I’ve refused any contact since and have called her every name in the book. Only one of my 2 brothers still talk to her. I didn’t talk to my dad for 3 years after being put in foster care and only recently started talking to him. I mainly did it because of my 8 younger siblings.  I was grounded for 27 months after they found out I was lesbian and sending nudes to people online. He hit me after finding out about my gf in hs. Not sure why I’ve been able to restart a relationship with my dad and step mom but still refuse to talk to my mom.",12Sep2019,1

644,"I started this job in February. I was so excited for it because it's my first full-time job and it's in my field of interest. But I quickly learned that this would be the job from hell.

My boss is a 78 year old man who is very ""my way or the highway"" and is forgetful. A month after I started, he hired a saleswoman who was incompetent (completely computer-illiterate, our company is online training), so she would always need help and bother people with questions that any computer-beginner could answer. It got annoying, so one day I told my boss that me needing to constantly help her (and do half her job) was taking away from \*my\* work. He said okay. A week later, he said if I didn't like it, I could find another job.

Not wanting to lose my first full-time job, I started doing all the bullshit work. There's a lot more to that saleswoman, but she quit a couple of weeks ago so I'm not going to include it.

My boss won't write things down, so he forgets everything (and I do really mean everything). Little by little, he would take away my responsibilities because he thought I was too overwhelmed (which I wasn't). Eventually, I had nothing to do at work. So I started doing things I used to under the radar.

Then he fired someone who does one of the most important things for the company (content creation). He asks me if there was any task of that employee's that I didn't want, I told him content creation because I wasn't qualified for it or comfortable with it. He tells me we'll start looking for that employee's replacement; the next day he tells me I'm now doing content. No raise along with it either (I will be asking for one though if he continues to not look for a replacement).

He also pays us late. Three times since I started in Feb. 

There's so, \*so\* much more, but I just don't have the energy to type it out (it would also be a novel).

I get no satisfaction from this job, even now that I have actual things to do, I still get no satisfaction. I'm constantly tired and exhausted, I don't take care of myself, I'm not interested in anything I used to be, I have no desire to do anything when I get home, I hardly eat when I'm at work, I struggle to get out of bed in the morning, and as soon as I sit down at my desk, I can barely keep my eyes open. I feel like I'm trapped here.

Unfortunately, until I find a new full-time job (I'm applying but the process is slow), I'm shit out of luck. I try to keep my chin up, I listen to Garyvee (which has been an enormous help!), but I just \*dread\* going to work every day. Part of me wants to take a vacation, the other part doesn't because I don't want to feel the dread of going back to work at the end of it.

What can I do to make my life a little less miserable until I'm out of here? Thank you in advance.",12Sep2019,1

646,"I'm anxious all the time. And one of my unhealthy coping mechanisms is I am a chronic skin picker. I've recently got my diet to such a healthy point for me that my face doesn't break out anymore (my face constantly broke out due to food allergies), and I would constantly pick at my skin. Even at work. I've tried doing up my makeup really nice every day to the point where I wouldn't want to mess it up and look like a mess, but that didn't work. I still pick. I've tried CBD recently -- still pick. I've tried taking a walk, breathing exercises, etc... I just can't stop picking. And I'm not ready to see a therapist.

647,"My parents are never satisfied with me. It hurts me so much. My dad yells and has severe temper problems and they also drink far too much.

They say they love me and I’m sure they do but it’s messed up and crazy love. No matter what I do follow their rules or not they will find something to snap about. I also just think I’m ready to be on my own. I have a job, attend college, can pay bills and have a place to live in my bfs apartment. My parents don’t see the way they act. They tell me it’s normal. Can they really believe that? Other people in my life see clips and can’t believe it. I was suicidal only months ago. I moved away for a few months and we worked things out while apart but I came back home and it’s back to the same old ways and tricks. They think I’m so shitty and value my opinion never. They don’t care if I’m happy or sad at all. They hate my boyfriend, they say he doesn’t have enough money! He is so young! We fight about it all the time. He loves me so much and would do anything for me and has never not been there for me for more than a year now! I think they hate him because he makes me happy. His parents are so caring and normal! I think this made me realize my situation was really bad. Why do I feel guilty about leaving?! I’m an adult. I’m 19 but I have been harassed, raped and abused and I feel that made me an independent strong person that my parents refuse to acknowledge. Seriously why do I feel such guilt? I believe it’s because my parents genuinely think they are doing good and helping me? They say they would be heart broken if they left but what if I need too?

649,"I am a 19 years old guy living in amman jordan.


I suffer from everything from social anxiety to depression to being naive.


A year ago I moved from my luxurious and pleasant life style to my mother country Jordan and started living alone,I moved there to study ,a more defining aspect is I moved there because I wanted to experience the hardships that my father experienced which made him the man who he is today,the most successful and hard working member of his 6 brother family,after spending a year here I've regretted this decision greatly and I want to go back but it's too late,I used to have these issues before moving but they've gotten pretty big to a point where I just sometimes pause and think about everything I've done,and I am absolutely disappointed,I've cried this year more times than I did in the past 10 years.

Maybe it's because of the cultural change that I had moving from a country that doesn't focus on socializing to one that is built on it,I have pretty bad grades,I am considered fat and i have man boobs,I've been friendzoned so many times they're uncountable,and I've been humiliated plenty,none of which I ever got an apologie for or took a stand  for.


I consider myself a very nice person,to a certain point where I get used,i get used almost on a daily basis by everyone ranging from close friends to relatives,maybe it's because I've been living in Dubai and I could be considered a high medium class person,us Arabians have very stupid and close minded thinking and I have that too but not to the extent that the people here have,for example i am considered the international bank of the world by my cousin.


 I am considered to others as an annoying person because i talk so much about a single thing (IE.i would have an hour conversation about how 2 friends should treat each other)in other words i turn into a philosopher talking about something that is considered stupid or insignificant,or considered the clown of a group because I make people laugh and they never take me seriously(that's with mixed groups),(only-guys groups:)I am considered a laughing stock to everyone because they think i am stupid and I never stand up for myself when I get normally bullied and if i did i would get destroyed.


Even though I am very nice to everyone in a huge way,let's say 500 people for example I get small insignificant gestures in return from lets say 5 people,atleast I do get small gestures from those 5,the other 495 destroy me mentally because I dont deserve it,and because it makes me doubt myself thinking I really did something that made them be this harsh.


After thinking about it I've realized it's not the people's problem,its my problem because these issues span from different groups,after I get into a new group of friends I get the same treatment 3rd or 2nd time we meet again,using me,bullying me,destroying me.


i dont even feel comfortable around my closest friends anymore ,after going back to dubai to see them for the summer,I got the same treatment i get from everyone,being bullied like crazy and considered insignificant.

I dont think really have friends at this period of time,I sometimes think I should turn into an introvert,but I never got the idea of it.


Sometimes I do think of giving up on the nice guy persona but idk i can't, I think its because subconsciously I want to get that feeling when people regret doing something bad to someone who did them good.


To me I never believed in bullying but now I know it really exists,when it happens i usual just sit there and laugh it of,acting as if i dont care and sometimes i stand up for myself but it gets worse,so I stopped doing that and I just laugh it off.

I feel dead inside,I feel empty,i have no hope in anything,nothing at all,I've disappointed my parents with my grades and I've disappointed myself,I've always thought I always choose the right people and the right things to say,this period proved to me that I choose the absolute fucking opposite.

And the worst part of all this fucking shit? is that it is all my doing,I am not strong enough,I am not smart enough,and I dont think I'll ever be.

I've never thought I'd ever need people's help in such a great way,telling random people what my problems are expecting an answer,I know the replies wont help but I just want someone to listen,I'll feel like a pussy if I ever told any of my friends,even close ones.


TL;DR What I need is a way to change all this,a way to change me,a failure of a human being.

650,"I booked a flight from my local airport which had a schedule like this: leave airport -&gt; fly to Chicago for a layover -&gt; go to end destination (Seattle).

Well I went to the airport to check in and they said the flight was delayed, and all the planes leaving Chicago that night were booked. This trip has been planned for a year and my hotel was already prepaid for. So I NEEDED to take this plane.

He said my only option is to go to Pittsburgh (2hr drive, $100 more in gas) and I avoided Pittsburgh in the first place because of the gas and distance, although the tickets were cheaper.

652,"Long post, TLDR at the end


I moved in with a college acquaintance a few months ago and it hasn’t been a great situation. We became friends and I had a great first month, but since then it’s taken a turn.

She does all the quintessential bad roommate things, like NEVER cleaning, leaving her laundry all over the living room for DAYS on end, LETTING PEOPLE SLEEP IN MY BED, never buying anything for the apartment, but I can honestly deal with the discrepancy in labor. What I can’t deal with is my shit being fucked with.

I’m very generous with my clothes and will let her borrow anything when she wants. We made this sort of agreement at the beginning of the lease that we could borrow each other clothes and that we would alternate buying communal alcohol for the apartment.

Throughout the summer I was the only one who ever bought alcohol. After a few times of me buying I asked her to Venmo me and she said that she would just get the next one. Of course that never happened.

In August she went on a family vacation out of the country. On the second weekend she was gone I was looking through my closet for a brand new shirt of mine. When I couldn’t find it I texted her to ask if she had seen it. She tells me that she “accidentally brought it on her trip because she thought it was hers and it wound up it her suitcase”. This made no sense to me because I knew it was hanging in my closet,
But I’m terrible at confrontation so I said nothing of it. Of course I go on Instagram and five hours earlier she had posted pictures wearing it. In my mind if you accidentally took someone’s shirt and discovered it in your bag the first thing you would do would be text them and apologize.

A few weeks later she went on a weekend trip a few states away. While she was there, I was looking around my room for my hair straightener and I couldn’t find it. Same situation as the shirt, she says she mistakenly took it. Again, I know she’s lying because she has her own fucking straightener, which is a completely different color and kept in the bathroom whereas mine is always in my room.

Lastly, I let her borrow a romper of mine a few weeks back. A few days after she returned it I noticed a HUGE rip on one of the sides. Like not the kind of thing you wouldn’t notice. I’m hurt she just returned it and didn’t say anything.

The long and short of it is that when we first moved in together I just assumed she would be respectful of my things, like all of my other roommates/friends past were.

I don’t know how to address this 1) disparity in buying communal items/alcohol and 2) her taking my things and lying about it.

I don’t want to wait until the next time and incident occurs but since I essentially let the other times slide I worry I’ll seem like an asshole for bringing it up after the fact. 

Plus I’m terrible at confrontation. 

Tldr: roommate is my friend, is not respectful of my items and takes things without asking/isn’t paying her fair share of communal items. How do I bring this up in a manner that is effective but also doesn’t damage our relationship and make things awkward.",12Sep2019,4

657,"Actually I'm both pedophile and hebephile

Okay, first I'd like to make sure everyone knows the difference between pedophile and child molester:

A pedophile is someone who feels sexually attracted to children (and hebephile is the same but for teens).
A child molester is someone who has committed a sexual crime against a child.

I'm no expert so this may be wrong, but that's how I understand it.

I (18M) am a pedophile (in the meaning previously indicated) and I'd like to change it, because as much as I'd like to say I'll never so something to an underaged girl, I'm not strong enough to make that claim and am really scared that someday I may do anything alike.

I have already committed the crime of consumption of children pornography, and I'm not exactly proud of that.

I live in Brazil and would like to seek for help, but every search I've made has always indicated that most of those who seek help end up in jail for their crimes anyways, and that's the thing I want to avoid.

663,"I'll keep the beginning of my story short. In late 2013, I started noticing things were changing. Censorship, de-platforming, feminism, etc, etc were on the rise. This would spark the beginning of my interest in politics. 

I started with liberal media like TYT and from there moved onto Sargon, Steven Crowder until eventually, over 5 years, ended up browsing /pol/ for hours a day, making racist posts online, watching holocaust denial videos, etc, etc.

 *^(BTW, I'm not suggesting that TYT, Sargon or Steven Crowder are gateways to extremism. I'll try to explain below.)* 

I haven't been able to work since leaving high school due to mental illness. I have spent the last 10 years of my life at my computer for 16 hours a day.  You can imagine how easily something like the alt-right echo chamber could completely takeover over my life. 

To make matters worse, I've not had much interaction with other people at all.  I'm bitter because of my upbringing. I had a lonely childhood. Single mum with 3 kids (different dads). 

Anyway, It's very apparent to me now that I was jealous of other groups and how tight-knit they are as a community (Jews for example). I wanted to make it an ""us vs them"" scenario so that I could feel like I had a group to belong to.  

I have been decompressing over the past few months. Really trying to break out of racist thinking habits that I've ingrained over the past few year years, and I've definitely made a lot of progress. 

My thinking has changed from ""*these people do bad things because they're predisposed to crime*"" to ""*maybe some people do bad things out of necessity or they don't know any better*"". It never occurred to me that anyone who's poor or had a bad childhood is just more likely to commit crime, regardless of race, gender or religion. 

Anyway here is where I need some advice. I mentioned earlier that I had posted racist things online in forums and even on Reddit. Well, last week I randomly decided to check out some of my usernames on thewaybackmachine and it turns out a lot of what I said in the past has been archived. 

Now first off, I deserve that. I had it coming. If I was dumb enough to post such racist shit then I'll have to live with knowing it's there forever. The problem arises in that my accounts can be very easily linked to my real life. Generally speaking, I would post something stupid and then delete it after thinking about it (guilt) but a lot of the time, I didn't delete the post fast enough. 

I can't believe I posted such vile garbage. I got really wrapped up in race and identity and I've said some horrible things, even about my own family. I have OCD as well as a dissociative disorder and for some reason, I have been completely obsessing over DNA, race, identity, etc, etc for the last two years. When I say obsess, I mean obsess. To the point where I have fever dreams thinking about DNA and race. It wasn't unusual for me to stay up through the night, researching, trying to confirm my place in the world. 

I should also mention that I am a mixed person. I am outwardly white but genetically not fully European. Because of this, I didn't feel like I belonged to any one group and that no one would accept me. 

The archives are there forever. There's nothing I can do about that. What I want to know is, how can I forgive myself and how could I ever explain to a friend or family member why I wrote what I wrote?

I feel like this is a permanent mark on my life. This will be the new thing I obsess over and it will drive me crazy, just like the DNA research did.",12Sep2019,1

666,"Hey Reddit, I’m a bit conflicted so I thought I’d come here for advice.

So, some background. I (20f) recently went back to college and became friends with a guy in my class (30m). Pretty soon into the friendship he started coming on to me. I stalked his Facebook and found out that not only was he not single, he was actually engaged. He said some pretty vulgar things (asking whether I would ever have a threesome, telling me I had a nice ass, you get the picture - all of these comments were either ignored or shut down). I ended up bringing up his fiancee, he apologised and never tried to hit on me again.

I thought I’d leave it as he said they were going through a rough patch and I didn’t think it was my place, but then I found out it wasn’t just me. It was most of the women in our class (ages 18f to 21f)

So the majority of them he did the same thing, sending vulgar messages (mostly over snapchat or insta dms, if you messaged him on fb he would reply to the message on one of those), but one girl he tried to meet up with when she was on a night out. She agreed because she thought he was coming to a bar, but actually he picked her up in his car, took her to an empty car park and tried to kiss her.

So now I have the dilemma. I used the phrase “potential” cheater as I don’t know whether his fiancée would count what he did as cheating, as far as I know he has only been flirting with one attempt at kissing someone (personally I would consider this cheating)

So I messaged him, and had an argument with him.  In which he admitted guilt and begged me not to tell her (I have screenshots of all of this) he then deleted his snapchat and blocked me on everything after promising he would explain this all to her himself.

However, he probably now thinks he’s covered his tracks but I actually remember her name and found her very quickly on Facebook messenger. Should I give him a day then send her the screenshots of our argument? Or should I leave it for him to work out (trusting that he will approach it himself)

From having a little anxiety and being a little introverted I seemed to fall out with a lot of my work friends and I know this isn’t going to improve.

She know about my depression but doesn't really understand how bad it is. I know she loves me and would help me through anything, but I don’t know how to talk to her. I want to tell her how bad I’m doing and feeling but I don’t know how to tell her that so often I don’t even feel like being alive or that I deserve to live. My boyfriend told me I should tell her, too, but I really really don’t know how to approach the topic.

Any help at all would be much appreciated.",12Sep2019,1
679,"My family is very religious and i respect that they are however they can be a bit controlling at times of the practices I do. I used to be very religious I prayed 5 times a day and read Quran. This was all a few years back though. Overtime i started seeing religion as pointless the more I thought about it the more I didn't to take part in it. The only person in my family who is explicitly not religious is my father. I only get to see him every other weekend because he works and lives in London. I did have a talk to him about how he went from being very religious to not religious at all. To my surprise he said that when he was growing up in Pakistan and when he became older people around him weren't that religious either. He said the only reason he got told off for it was because he was the only one that was honest. I was planning on telling my half religious uncle until he went on a rant when i was just having a normal conversation with him about how how he sees religion as a gift from his fore-fathers and that for someone in our family were to deny that gift would be extremely disrespectful. The only reason he takes my father as an exception is because they were very poor at the time my father was in education to sustain him and his family and it drew him away from religion, I don't really want to get into it but that made me realise that I cant talk to him about my situation. Recently my mother has been really pushing me towards her beliefs and I feel I don't belong in this religion i'm no longer as committed as I was when I prayed five times a day. On top of all this I also have my first year of college to deal with and its a pretty big deal and i feel that it might get in the way of my education. If anyone of you have advice on who I should talk to or please let me know, i'm clueless about what to do.",12Sep2019,4
680,"So long complicated story, but stick with me... (Throwaway account)

My wife and I dated since 15 years old and got married at 22 (been married 3 years now). About 1 month ago, we went to a friend's wedding and shared a hotel with this other couple and one other person. This other couple is made up of an amazing girl (we'll call her Jane) who I grew up with since kindergarten and is my wife's best friend and her now husband of about 6 months. I kind of always have had suppressed feelings for this friend since jr. High but was with my wife and my wife was great so no reason to ever pursue. 
Anyways fast forward to the wedding and after the wedding we all went to an after party. Her husband (who I consider a friend, but don't think he is the best person for her) got wasted and I took care of him and got him an Uber back to the hotel. This girl and I were hanging out most of the night cause my wife was hanging out with another girl she hasn't seen in a while. (At this time, I was just having fun and had absolutely no thoughts of doing anything that I ended up doing)
We all took an Uber back to the hotel and we all were hungry. My wife didn't get super drunk so she drove us to McDonald's. I sat in the backseat with Jane and for some reason, I put my hand on her leg... It felt really pretty natural but then she grabbed my hand back and it felt great. We got back and ate food then Jane had a burn on her leg and wanted to get a band aid. Everyone else was tired but my mind was racing so I offered to walk with her to get a band-aid. My wife was thankful cause she thought I was taking care of our friend Jane.
Here's where it gets complicated: 
 We got her band-aid and we were holding hands and I was touching the small of her back, not really thinking cause it felt so natural (we both agreed that this felt so natural) then we kissed in the hallway of the hotel... (Never once even considered cheating on my wife...) we made out pretty intensely for about 20-30 min... while we are making out I kept telling her I had always had feelings for her and thought she was an amazing person. She kept telling me how kind and amazing of a person she thought I was and kept asking what do we do now. We kept making out and I started to finger her and we both couldn't get enough.. then we heard the door to our room open and played it off like we were just getting to the room... No questions were asked by anyone and we were in the clear. 
So now we talk for about a week. And both realize we made a mistake and I am torn up inside. I definitely start to think about what to do next cause I think I have feelings for Jane, but I love my wife and don't know what to do. It all honestly felt like a movie...
Complication number 2... They moved right after the wedding and we actually had previously planned to visit them so not two weeks later we are visiting them and again, share a hotel room... We are drinking, not nearly as much, (1-2 beers) and our spouses fall asleep on the couch and Jane is on the couch too, I am just sitting in a chair on the other side of the room. I text her and tell her I miss her and think about her all the time. She said she does the same but can't do anything about it cause she is married... She asks me to slide in the couch next to her and my wife (who is still asleep) and we talk for about an hour while holding hands and I had my hand on her upper leg... She kissed me a couple times and nothing more cause we are literally sitting right next to our spouses... I kept telling her I don't know what to do and I am falling for her. She reiterated the same without actually saying she loved me. 
Our spouses woke up eventually and we said we should go to bed. On the way to bed when our spouses weren't looking we kissed again... I held her hand before bed and we just looked at each other for a minute. 
My wife and I had to fly out the next morning and they went back to their apartment and that was that. I don't want to text her cause I don't know what that would accomplish and I keep waiting for these feelings to go away, but they aren't at all... I find myself being distant from my wife and went through a really rough time where I had anxiety for the first time in my life really. I was all over the place with my thoughts cause I love Jane and I can really picture a life with her but my wife doesn't deserve this cause she has been nothing but great to me...
I don't know what to do anymore and I am worried I am in a lose lose situation. Either I regret never pursuing Jane or I regret leaving my wife and ruining her life. (I am pretty close with her whole family and they absolutely love me since we kinda grew up together...)

681,"My three friends and I are traveling back to our college town this weekend. Originally one of my friends, let’s call her Sarah, wasn’t going to stay with us so my other friend, Beth, and I got an Airbnb and each paid half. Our options were scarce so we had to go with a pretty big Airbnb (3 bedrooms). One of our friends that’s still lives in our college town was planning on possibly crashing one night because we’re closer to the bars than she is. We didn’t plan on having her pay because she’s not even sure if she’ll crash and it’s just a night. 

However, now Sarah and her fiancé wants to stay with us for the entire weekend. We’re totally cool with this but she asked how much she should pay us. Should I ask her to pay 1/3? Or is that unfair since we’re not charging our other friend if she ends up staying for a night? Should I just ask for a little less than 1/3 to make up for that?",12Sep2019,1

684,"Throwaway. For obvious reasons. 

My ex boyfriend is pushing 40. I am in my early 20s. All of his previous relationships are with women his age. 

Some things have happened that have made me afraid that he might be a pedophile. I am terrified obviously. But even more scared of being wrong and causing him to kill himself. 

1. He has referred on several occasions that I have “teenager tits”. I told him that was creepy don’t say that. He claims he just means they aren’t saggy yet. 

2. His porn searches are violent and teen related. 

3. He has 3 daughters that he has no contact with due to his substance abuse issues. I have gotten several stories but he admitted once his daughter told her mother that “daddy’s new girlfriend is here and they’re having sex on the couch”. He claimed that he was just laying on the couch with a female friend and his daughter didn’t understand it. She was around 10 at the time. 

4. He has been violent physically and sexually with me when he was drunk.

5. I went through his phone and saw a text with his friend describing a woman’s vagina being “so tight the only way he could describe it was being off the child’s menu”

6. Has referred to my age (24) as being like “having a threesome with 2 12 year olds”. Claims it was a joke. 

7. Claims to like being called “daddy” but often gets really weird/awkward about admitting he likes being called that cause “you know. I’m a father”

8. One time his friend jokingly said “you’ll have to leave by tomorrow. It’s against your parole” and when we asked why, the friend said his daughter was having a sleepover and there would be 10 “13 year old girls in the house” 

9. I said once that all vaginas are different. He responded, “I know. I have 3 daughters”. Weird as fuck. 

10. He has made comments about my sister who is 20 but looks younger. 

I’m sure there’s a few more things but all of these moments have made me close to being ill. I’m terrified of what they could mean. I want to be wrong of course. But these things eat at me and scare me. Am I wrong for being uncomfortable and suspicious? Would you feel the same way?",12Sep2019,0

686,"Hi there, I've never been told about this and I feel it's something I should know. Personally I don't know how to ask for a raise without it making me come across as greedy, entitled, or asshole-ish, etc. nor do I know how long I would need to be with my employer before asking for a raise.

I've been with my current employer, a growing factory job, for over a year now (not including the time that I was with them through a temp agency) and in that time I've shown that I excel at my work to the point that even the owner has taken note of who I am, as well as I've shown to quickly learn any new jobs they put me on, and further I've expressed interest in learning all that I can and more.

That's not to say I'm perfect, I have screwed up on occasion, but I've been forthright in fessing up to it, rather than trying to sweep it under the rug. My attendance is also good, not perfect, but fairly close.

I honestly feel I've earned a pay raise, especially considering there are folk who earn more and do the same thing as I do, but to the bare minimum (sometimes less), earning more only due to having been with the company longer than I have.

Any more info that might be needed, I'm 22, and the youngest at my workplace (most people I work with are around 40 with only two others here close to my age).

I like my job and want to stay with the company, I'd just like to earn a bit more since I feel like I honestly have earned it through my actions.",12Sep2019,3
687,"I may be in the wrong in this; but from my side of the story:

Out of college; I applied and got a job with the grocery store I worked in high school. Although I applied for a front end position; which I have two years experience with; in an unwise attempt to placate my corporate overlords I said yes to their request to work as a grocery manager. I have had no experience with this job and am still learning all of the details of this position.

Enter John. I can sympathize with him to an extent: he has me as a younger boss mainly because my parents were wealthy enough to send me to college; however his behavior is not just limited to me and there's a limit to how much I can take; I'm worried that I might snap.

John gets mad at me for the slightest mistake. As an example when I was doing a store walk a manager asked me to refill cans on the store with that from a display case; even though he wasn't around me to my knowledge he said I put in the wrong brand. I try to own up to my mistakes so I went back; missing on the training I was supposed to do ages ago; the only mistake was that I could have put in a slightly similar product (beef stew can instead of beef broth); neither product was what we needed (my manager knew this).

While this is partially my fault; I restocked a Gatorade in the wrong position; however I owned up to it; again sacriifing the training time I was supposed to have days ago. He was mad about the upc code being incorrect; however my manager told me to stock the item there and I was explicitly told the upc code isn't always correct.

John threatened to ""throw"" his items stocked on the floor or at least do his job incorrectly if my work isn't done to his exact specifications (to be fair this may not be accurate as I can barely understand him; he talks like an auctioneer).

John believes that everything that goes wrong in the department is my fault because I'm in management; this might be valid if I wasn't in the part of my training where I just worked as a member of the night crew and had any say in the running of the department so far.

Maybe I shouldn't complain about this one but he ratted out; unsoliticed one my co-workers to the assistant store manager for not having one out of the dozens if not hundreds of products we have to straighten on the shelves. I was with the kid for most of the night; he worked hard; to the managers considerations ; and we have a limited amount of time to do everything; perfect isn't always possible.

Various small errors; I own up to them and fix whenever possible. I have less than seven days of experience; I will make mistakes.

He seems to resent me for having a degree; which I can somewhat understand.

All of this was in one day.

As much as I'd love to hit him; tell him to fuck off; or abuse my power to his detriment all I really want is to learn to do my job; somehow I can see him being a pain in my ass in the future.

Am I overreacting? If not can some one please tell me how to handle any future disputes professionally?",12Sep2019,1

690,"So at first I thought I just had imposter syndrome since I'm doing my first semester of an Economic's masters. But after thinking hard about it and working my graduate assistantship in an office; realizing I'm just burnt out. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Economics in May and I thought I'd just start grad school right away because I figured I'd do it eventually anyway. I feel that being here makes me depressed and anxious, I did go in to see a counselor 3 weeks but most of the appointment slots are filled so I have another appt next week or the week after. I look forward to work but dread going to classes. I wanted to finish school in once shot so I'd never have to come back again but I just can't do this anymore. I know a master's will help me make more money so I'll prob want to come back at some point but I think I need to be more refreshed (and honestly more prepared academically) before I could be successful in grad school.

School has never really been my thing but at least for undergrad, I got to balance it out with a college experience. Now the classes are extremely hard and there's nothing I really enjoy about school. Wishing I had just gone into the working world right away because I didn't realize how tired of school I would be. Part of why I hadn't gone to work is cuz I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.

a little back story in egypt after you finish high school depending on what your total grade was you can apply for college and we are allowed to basically not go to school except for the exam days so students don't go to school instead they go to courses made by teachers outside of school  **\_** any teacher **\_**  to get high grades 

at one of those courses (i wish i could say it was chemistry but it was physics) there is a girl that i have developed a crush on 

the first ever lesson of that course due to scheduling problems on there part i was the only boy in it of about 30-40 student the teacher made some not so subtle jokes about it and at the end of it i missed what the teacher said the homework was so i asked an assistant the girl that i now have a crush on answered and i left 

the next week i came in early and it was just me and that girl were alone 

she started talking to me by what roughly translates to :

'i was wondering what you felt like when you were the only boy in the course'

i being the kissless virgin that i am somehow kept the conversation going and managed to get a laugh from her but after i don't know how long because my mind was in panic mode i learned that she was christian and she told me about her experience celebrating her sister's birthday in a church  related trip and how she got water colors all over her and after a but more talking (my memory is fuzzy) another girl came in and we stopped talking

the week after i came in early hopping to talk to her more and maybe get her number

 but when i came in she was sobbing or made noises like it she then asked to use my phone to call someone i unlocked it and gave it to her and she called who i think was her sister telling her to tell her father to pick her up at 6.30 (when the lesson ended )and she handed me my phone and thanked me i asked if she was okay and she said she was fine

that course got split into other multiple and we still ended up in the same group with a mixer of boys and girls we didn't talk ever since (about 3 weeks)

the lase lesson after it finished i talked to one of my friends (who doesn't know about the crush) and we parted ways and i went to the station to go home

after i waited for a bit my crush came to the station the station was empty and the night was beautiful with cool wind she was talking on the phone and after a bit she stopped talking and i was wondering if i should go talk to her but i thought while yes the setting was romantic and the station was empty i didn't want to come of as a creep or a perv so didn't talk to her and when my train came i left and she was still there

i don't know if she would be interested in me because i am muslim (not exactly muslim but don't wanna be homeless) and i don't know what to go",12Sep2019,1

698,"This is less of a rant and more of a call for help. 
Sorry to the mods if this isn't the place to ask for advice, please let me know and I'll remove the post.

Throwaway account because I want to avoid drama on my social media.

Context:

I turned 24 half a year ago and I've been living with 2 people that I wouldn't want to call parents anymore. A quarter of my life and my dreams have been ruined partly because I was unable to understand that the way my parents treated me all those years wasn't ""normal"" or ""typical parents"".

I was born through in vitro fertilization (IVF) because my mother couldn't have kids, so my parents have always been extremely controlling over me, as they ""feared"" for the life of their only child. My mother would not be able to handle another miscarriage so they treat me like I'm a nuclear bomb that could explode at any time.
That said, let me explain what I mean by ""extremely controlling"": 

- I was constantly told what to do, from the moment I wake up, to the moment I close my eyes to fall asleep. Everything. 24/7. I mean literally being told to go pee, told to brush my teeth, comb my hair, what clothes to wear, when to eat or drink (yes, I mean literally ""drink now. Okay, now continue eating""), when to say thanks, please, yes or no. I was told when I'm allowed to ask questions or when to respond to a question. I was yelled at, beaten and punished if any of the above wasn't followed.

- Our house is their house. My room is their room, my room has no door, never had, still doesn't have today. I didn't know what the definition of privacy meant until I hit 17 years. I wasn't allowed to stay up longer than 10pm at night, and again, was yelled at, beaten and punished if any of these issues were questioned about.

- My parent's tried to raise me as an entitled child to make up for the negativity. A lot of things were strictly done by my parents, like cooking, driving (+commuting), deciding who my friends are, paying for school/uni (we live in Switzerland, schools aren't that expensive), and the list goes on. They did that as part of their plan to show me ""how much they care about me"", and it worked. For years I thought that my parents do all these things because they love me, and those beatings and punishments were just to teach me how to be the perfect child.

- My parents responding to all the questions asked directly to me (doctor, family, friends). I never got to speak to a doctor, whenever someone came to me and asked me something like ""Hey, where does it hurt"" or ""Do you want some more soup"", either one of my parents would respond them for me, or I would turn/walk to one of them to ask where it hurt or ""do I want more soup?"". My parents would become my mouth and my words, I was not allowed to decide for myself, ever. 

Now, a lot of the points above make sense when regarding a child, like parents obviously need to cook the food for their baby, and of course you would drive your child to school. I just want to remind you all that ALL of the points above were happening until after I hit 18 years. The only reason why I broke out of this endless loop is because I got diagnosed with ADHD and aspergers pretty early on in life, and once I legally became an adult at 18 years, I was forced to visit a therapist on my own. It took months to realize that I have been brainwashed for years, and that no child or adult should be ever treated that way by their parents. 

Even though I learned what it meant to be ""free"" and independent, I never got to experience it as my parents would continue to be extremely strict up to this day. I had to comply with their demands or I would have to face the consequences. Even though it would've been the right thing to do, I would rather do what they tell me to do instead of being punished for the whole week for trying to change things up unsuccessfully. 
I was forced to learn 5 languages (English, French, Portuguese, Italian and Cantonese) which is probably the only thing that I'm grateful of, as it truly helped me in the future besides my knowledge of swiss dialect (german), but sadly it also meant that I had to visit 2 different schools every week (5 days obligatory school, 3 evenings a week in a portuguese school. I'm currently fluent in 6 (5? Does swiss dialect count?) languages.

Once I became 18, I had full access to the internet. It opened up many things, it truly opened my eyes as to what I was missing out on and what others were doing while I wasnt allowed to. Video games, the media, chatting (I was always told that chats and social media was evil and full of lies), basically the entire internet culture. Youtube was one of the websites I truly loved, as I could browse other people's video creations.
So I created my own channel. It really helped me with my communication skills, got me into video editing and art. After 6 years it grew well over 200'000 subscribers. 

From 18 to 24, I became severly depressed over the continuous attempts of my parents to control my life. Because of them, I had to give up on art (they made me believe that it was useless and I ended up seeing art as a chore rather than relaxing), I had to lay off my Youtube channel recently because I just couldn't find the time to work on videos due to my limited time allowed on the computer, I somehow got into several relationships, but ended up breaking up with all of them because I didn't know how to maintain a relationship with anyone for over a year. I adopted a cat without telling my parents and they ended up threatening me to kill the cat on a daily basis, punishments are getting more severe and more frequent, everything feels like it is getting worse and I ended up becoming suicidal. 

Why didn't I just move out? As mentioned before, I was forced to go to higher education schools, until I was 22. I wasn't gaining any money, I didn't even know how to move out, so it was impossible to move out with zero money. No family member was trustful, I have no friends in this country, all of my real friends I have met online are the only people that I can rely on and they all come from another country. 

I started a job 2 years ago and saved up on a lot of money, which is now the reason why I made this post: How do I move out? Where do I start, what am I supposed to look out for? I have never learned about how to live like an adult, so all of this is new grounds to me. If you have questions I'll gladly answer them.

They seek opportunities for professional development, take on complex work, and are team players. Except for one guy...he just kind of shows up. What's more frustrating is that I can tell he's an intelligent guy who'd really benefit from making an effort. All my other guys get great employee reviews and I make sure there's intensives (promotions, days off, etc) due to their performances. This guy I just can't get though.

I've posted stuff to deviantart, but I've never understood how people make money out of it outside of doing commissions (which I don't really want to do). I've seen websites where you make designs and people can buy it as a t-shirt, mug, ect., but you have to pay monthly to be able to post your stuff and I'm not sure about that kind of commitment. 

I've seen an artist's website where they wrote a story and made an online graphic novel out of it that you have to pay to keep reading. I'm currently working on a huge story that I'm very passionate about and thinking about doing that, but have no clue how to set it up. 

I've also thought about doing stuff with youtube, but I know animators and artists on youtube very rarely do well.

I have the time to do art, but not the confidence. I'm an OK artist, but I know there are many other's out there who are better. I want to do art because I love it, but at the same time, if I don't get any kind of return out of it, I feel like I'm wasting time that I could be putting into my home life and marriage.

I'm not expecting any kind of quick fix. I know it takes years for someone to even get recognized. I just have zero idea where to start.

I'm also interested in making my own custom pop figures (whether it's by hand or through 3D printing) and squishy makeovers. 

I just have all these things I'm interested in doing and have zero idea about the art world and how to navigate.

She's nosy, has no inside voice, is subtly racist towards all the black students in class, makes jokes in class even though no one ever laughs, acts like she's above everyone else, and is just plain awful.

The thing is that my dad is much more strict about attendance than my mom, so I would always use my mom’s empathy to my advantage. I know this is wrong but I cannot stop doing it, I’ve been in many many situations where I say this year will be different but it never is. My dad naturally feels helpless because I haven’t changed in all these years, we even have multiple serious conversations on how this can affect me and my future and it still doesn’t make a difference. So the reason I’m asking for advice is that this week I have missed 2 days of school because my dad is out of town for a week and I have convinced my mom that I am ill. She picked me up today and I than realized that she told my dad about the absences, this wouldn’t be so bad if I didn’t actually promise him that I would not do the thing I just did that week. I honestly have no idea how I can apologize to my dad at this point, I’ve done this so many times before but I really want him to know that I mean it this time.

So I’m starting to run into a problem at work. There’s a 50/50 chance that I will get called and asked to come in on days I’m not scheduled. I don’t know about you guys, but I plan my life around my set schedule and run errands, do chores, RELAX, etc. on my days off. So most of the time (unless they are calling about a future shift) I make up an excuse as to why I can’t come in. 

But now it’s getting old. They called me again today. I have things I need to get done and I’m not willing to come in. In the voicemail, the manager asked that I call back to let them know either way if I can or cannot come in. I don’t even want to call back because it’s pointless. The answer is no.

708,"I'm a shy, polite, sensitive 23 year old woman. I never want to upset anyone. Almost always willing to offer second chances. I feel like all this makes me a pushover.

Whenever I get into an argument with someone, rather than stand my ground or get mad at *them* for being rude, I immediately apologize. I say that I misunderstood the situation, I'm sorry I did/said that, I really care about them. Growing up, in fights with my parents I learned that arguing doesn't get me anywhere so I would just stop talking and for some reason *that's* what got to them. Now in a lot of arguments with other people I get so frustrated that I just give up and don't say anything. I also tend to become really emotional and will be as nice as possible out of fear that the other person (if I know them) won't want to be my friend or SO anymore.

With 90% of people, all this does is make them more angry with me. It's like the fact that I don't stand up for myself makes them lose all respect for me or not even care about me anymore. It hurts that others aren't as understanding with me. I think I just come across as fake or something when I act too nice, but it's not like that.

715,"So, I am gonna try to give as much info as I can.

I've worked in the horse industry for 10 years, since I was 15. In that time, I've been lucky to experience many different types of riding from racehorses to the ones who do big sliding stops and spins (Reiner's) to everything in between. I even owned my own business for a period of time.

I've taken a job as of late where I work for a big dinner theater company. The boss, also runs a business training horses off site. Thru the dinner theater we have to take care of the twenty some odd horses as well as we get opportunities to perform. When I first started working with them, I was working 40+ hrs a week there, being paid just above minimum wage, as well as putting in about 30 hrs a week helping on off-site farm but for free. Under the premise that I was learning.

Well I've done the same thing I was doing for free for money, and honestly it just became too much to juggle both and I ended up with very little time to myself.

Not to mention I commute over an hour.

When I stopped helping at the farm, there stopped any opportunities at the theater. Now I literally just get to do the basics. Cleaning stalls and horses. While everyone else gets taken to practice and put in the show, I'm taking care of horses. Not that I'm above doing that but I want to learn and progress 

Maybe, if I stick with it, or I start going back to do free labor, more opportunities will present themselves.

But, I'm kinda getting bored of the idea that I gotta do so much to maybe have the opportunity to ride a horse for an hour, when I've had jobs before where I've rode for 10 hours.

I could make the same or more just ""freelance"" training or teaching, which I truly enjoy doing a lot more than cleaning stalls! I just wanted to do this as an opportunity to learn, and it seems I've lost any chances to learn

So I guess, what I'm asking... Does it make sense to stick with it and keep doing twice as much work as everyone (I'm the only one doing a lot of the necessary tasks) hoping one day that the opportunity will come around back to me to be in the spotlight, or do I just count it up as a learning experience and move on?

Also I have the opportunity to travel abroad for a week in November to learn more, but I wouldn't be able to do that working this job as they don't give me vacation. Everyone else gets to ask for whatever days off but when I asked for one Saturday off (asked three weeks in advance) he told me that was fun but scheduled me anyways.",12Sep2019,1

I'm not antisocial, I have some good friends but I'm also not into being around with dozens of people, it just makes me uncomfortable, especially when I like to be the center of attention and that makes it harder for me. But that's not the problem. My mother always says I don't have any friends, I need to be more social and stuff. Most of my peers like to go to bars, smoke, take drugs, stay out super late and such stuff. While I... not so much, I arrive home at usually 9 PM and just relax with my phone, minding my own business. This is mostly the reasons my mother calls me antisocial. While they are there with the girls and stuff. Obviously, she doesn't want me to take drugs or anything like that but just be more ""social"" and be like them. Honestly, I think she should be careful what she wishes. The friends I go out with are like me. We all go home not so early, not so late. And we interact with each other really nice. We have the same interests, we don't get in arguments and just like each other's company. My other peers on other hand... I have tried befriending them, they immediately started making fun of me without even getting to know me. Of course, I defended myself but that's not the point.

718,"Is it normal for a friend to try to force me to make them such a high priority in their life that I am expected to close conversations every single time when I message them by the end of the day by saying bye instead of continuing a conversation naturally over days, and to also to be forced to not neglect contacting them for more than a day, let alone 1 or 2 weeks?

This friend literally wants me to go out of my way and inconvenience myself and my priorities in life to suit their needs in able to continue being their friend. They don't seem to understand how one can be so busy to not close a conversation by the end of the day or to not send a message to them for days for whatever reason. They seem to want a justifiable explanation in order to understand that there may be many reasons in one's life why one is delayed in replying to a message.

And also they have this thing with 'keeping score'. If I haven't messaged for a while, they feel like they can't message me because that would be 'chasing me up'. As if it is a game where you can't make a move until the other person does. They see all of this as disrespect especially because they have told me many times that this is a condition to being their friend. And they are so willing to stick by this rule they would even let the friendship fade away deeming me as 'unworthy'.

They want me to be like this 100% of the time. If I slip up once they get annoyed at me but won't tell me straight, just try to force me to guess until I become annoyed myself and it turns into a fall out.

My clothes and hair are neat and ordinary and I maintain good hygiene. Nothing abnormal that I could think of.

Yet, people keep assuming I’m a fucking moron.

In a conversation, if I say something that I feel is a natural remark or a sufficiently valuable addition to the conversation, people will occasionally freeze with looks of confusion and concern and try to explain the basic facts of the matter to me, as if I understand nothing. Valuable time is wasted when I reassure that yes, I know, I know, I am aware, I was not trying to claim that everyone should default to Y, I was just saying that when X is not a sensible, practical option, it is viable to resort to Y.

And the response is ”oh, yeah, that definitely makes sense”, as if the default assumption was that I just say stupid shit that makes no sense.

And this kind of thing isn’t politically or culturally loaded, it can be about the most basic, practical thing. In my new job, I was shown around my new duties in a seeminly random order, and I asked if there’s any tasks that I should prioritise over the others.

My instruction gave me that look of confusion and disgust, and asked what I meant. When I tried to elaborate, are there some tasks that need to be done before the others, she said no, all the tasks are equally important and I’m not allowed to neglect any of them.

Oh, but always make sure that the Stockholm shipments are done first, they’re first to leave in the morning.

I've been with my boyfriend for almost a year, and I am super paranoid about his relationship with his female roommate.

To start from the beginning of our relationship, he was paranoid about some of my close guy friends, but I always assured him it was nothing more than friends. He was a bit put off because he's not used to guys &amp; girls being casual friends. When I asked him about his roommate, he denied that they were friends and said she wasn't anything more than a roommate.

But... whenever I would go over, she would tell him all about her day, what plans she had with her friends, would ask him for clothing advice. He would go home for lunch and would constantly tell me things she would say while he was home, just bringing her up in convo. She would make comments about him never being home anymore, with claims of him saying she's never home.
Then I noticed some of her stuff in his room, tweezers and nail clippers of hers he uses that he ""just found in his room"" and I found one of her bobby pins behind his headboard when we had recently moved his room around.

The thing that is bothering me the most is that he has her phone number saved in his phone, but would deny having her phone number when his mom would ask him to text her. He claims he tried calling her once to get into his house and no one answered. I couldn't find any record of that call, which makes me think the story is made up. I remember a moment he made a very vague phone call to someone, and I swear I saw her name on the phone, but he says he doesn't remember that ever happening.

He has hidden texts from girls before. I found texts between two girls who he claimed were just his friends, later to tell me he had sexual history with them both. His stories are never straight and he seems to tell white lies all the time.

My co worker who also stopped working in August got a pay check as well. She emailed our former boss and asked what this was all about meanwhile - I already deposited the check and paid for things I needed for my move. They just sent me an email saying it was a mistake and asked me to send it back. What the fuck do I do? I just spent a fuck ton of money I thought was mine for my move. They really put me in a fucked up situation here.,12Sep2019,13
733,"On the outside my life seems to be on the upswing: I’m moving and starting school for an in demand tech career with minimal loans. However my life feels like it’s over. I don’t want to go into tech, but my bad life choices up until this point have made me skeptical that there’s a better option for me. I have dreams but they seem unlikely to happen because of both money and time commitment that isn’t practical at this point and not a safe bet. I’m so depressed by the state of the world.


Also I’ve just had a string of bad luck. It seems people don’t really like me or support me in My inner circle and my few friends keep me at arms length. I’m seriously single and can’t seem to get even a single date. I realize I’m not gorgeous or desirable looks wise but I do try. Plus I’d gotten sick this week and had a couple of bad luck incidents. I’ve literally broken down crying already twice today because I don’t want to do this anymore.


Tl:dr; i feel like my life is just over and nothing seems to work out for me. I don’t know why I’m never good enough for what I want, and I just can’t get it right.",12Sep2019,1
734,"I used to be dating this girl for a couple of months, we didn’t date for years or anything but we had been friends for over 2 years. I guess you could say I became kind of attached to her. Suffice to say the break up did not go cleanly and there was a lot of arguments and silent treatments but eventually we are here. Now we’ve settled are beef we no longer hate each other but we still don’t talk regularly. At this point I don’t even miss her or want her in any romantic sense, as a matter of fact I’d rather never see her again in my life tbh. The problem is since she broke up
With me my life has been in shambles. I mean my grades started dropping, I started pushing people way, I even started dabbling in drugs it’s just messed up. The problem is I don’t know what to do to get out of this funk. I tried apologizing to my ex, that didn’t fix things because I still feel terribly inside. I tried studying really hard in school, but that didn’t fix things because I’m still getting bad grades. Hell I even tried getting a rebound girl and I just got flat out rejected and left on delivered.

So at this point you have a straight A student who used to be set for top ten in his class, who now is getting Bs and Cs and drinking alcohol to drown his pain because he hasn’t the slightest self esteem anymore. What do I do, because at this point life seems so pointless. I never am able to live up to what I used to be and I can’t motivate my self to take on other extracurriculars or activities. It just seems like I’m trapped in this never ending cycle, and the harder I try to get out, the harder it pulls me in.",12Sep2019,1
735,"I'm a middle-class adult who trades Forex as a second income. I recently received $12,000 from my father-in-law to invest in it. Two months ago everything was going well and I gave him his monthly earnings. Today I lost everything, I burned the account and I don't know how to act.

He is a high ranking military man in the army and a very strict person, we get along excellent all the time, but in this kind of situations I don't know what to do. I haven't told my girlfriend yet either.

I can try to recover the money and pay him month by month without telling him anything, which would take me more than a year to get, but at the same time is a risk because it would be very heavy to have to pay my income this loss. From the beginning I made it clear that there is a risk, but I find it very difficult to express in such cases.

In what way can I talk to you or tell you what has happened, I am going completely crazy with this situation. The worst thing is that her complete rich family will see me differently... I suppose.",12Sep2019,3
736,"I met this girl at a bar about 5 months ago. We hit it off really well, and we ended up exchanging numbers. I never had the intention of dating her or falling in love again. I had recently gotten out of a toxic relationship, so I didn’t feel I was ready to move onto something new. I simply just got along with her really well and I enjoyed her company. We share many common interests and she’s one of the few people I feel I can be myself around without fear of being judged. 

Overtime, the more we got to know each other and the more spent time together, the more I started to realize that I really like her. Our conversations are never dull, and even when we disagree on something, we always find a middle ground and move onto a different topic as if nothing happened. We’ve connected far better than any other person I’ve met, and it really surprises me that I’ve met someone that’s as compatible with me as she is. It’s almost too good to be true at times. 

I’m not the type of person to fall in love easily. I have issues committing myself to someone for a long period of time. In fact, I’ve never been one to say “I love you” first. Maybe it’s because Ive never actually felt that way about anyone I’ve dated. But with this girl, the feeling is completely different. I can’t help but feel I’ve found something truly special. And I had a feeling she felt the same way too.

Surely enough, my intuition swerved me well, and eventually we both came forth and confessed our feelings for each other. Since then, we’ve been seeing each other exclusively, though not officially declaring ourselves as a couple. We’ve been like this for a little over a month now. Her birthday is coming up, and I was planning on asking her to be my girlfriend, officially, the day of. It seemed like the perfect time to do it.

Things have been going so well with her, and I can’t remember the last time I’ve been this genuinely happy with someone. I was certain of my decision to be with her and to commit myself to her wholeheartedly. And I was more than happy to put in that effort. That is until, today just a few hours ago, she calls me unexpectedly. 

I could tell in her voice she had been crying. I knew that whatever she was about to tell me, it wasn’t going to be something I wanted to hear.

“I’m sorry, but I’m feeling very insecure about myself right now and I feel that if I go forward with this, my insecurities will only seep into what we have and ruin it. I like you so much, and you’re the best guy I’ve ever had the pleasure of being with, and that’s why it scares me. I feel like we should take some time apart so that I can work on myself. I want to be in a better place for you, so that we can be as happy as possible together.” 

That’s pretty much the gist of what she said. It took me by complete surprise. It was so out of left field, I didn’t even know how to react to it. At first, my initial reaction was to try and change her mind. I poured my heart out to her, even went as far as to say that I’ve fallen in love with her. Maybe it wasn’t the time to say it then, but with the way she was ending things, I didn’t know if I’d ever speak to her again. I didn’t want to have that regret of never telling her how I feel about her.

Her insecurities boil down to her not being comfortable with her own body. She has a distorted body image of herself. And that boggles my mind, because she’s very slim and fit. Guys are always eyeing her, blowing up her DM’s desperate to take her out on a date. She’s also opened up about her previous relationships, and revealed that all of her exes have abused her emotionally, making her feel unworthy of being loved. She doesn’t see what I see in her. And that really breaks my heart. 

I don’t really know where I’m going with this, to be completely honest. I’ve fought like hell to not let her go so easily, but all my efforts are failing. I feel I have no option at this point but to let her go and give her the space she needs. It’s just so fucking hard, especially since things were going so well between us.  I’ve never had this much trouble letting go of someone before. 

I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this. I don’t expect any advice on how to get her back. I just didn’t have anyone to vent to, so I’m turning to the people on this subreddit. 

TL;DR The girl I have been dating just broke things off with me out of the blue. She wants to take time apart to work on her insecurities before jumping into a serious relationship.",12Sep2019,1

738,"I remember years ago I read this story of this guy who recently turned 18, was going into his senior year of high school, and met this girl over the summer who was an incoming freshman.. she was 14.

I guess guys naturally tend to be less mature at that age, so i guess they kinda evened our maturity wise..

anyways they met up over the summer and just talked.. would talk on the phone often..

once the school year began he would stop by after school at her house to talk..  they went to different schools.

anyways, after 3 months they kinda drifted apart.. there was never any intercourse, rape, or violence.. 

apparently there was a one time oral sex that happened, and some kissing, all of which was consensual..

although they stopped hanging out, they kept in touch and years later ended up being on good terms! 

She never told anyone because she didn't want anything to happen to him.

The time they were hanging out etc was over 10 years ago.

Interesting story, and it made me
wonder.. Is this something that where too much time has past to press charges?",12Sep2019,1
739,"So basically, I am a 25 year old female, and my mom is in her mid 50’s. We have a super close relationship and I talk to her almost every day, and she is pretty much my best friend. 

I am an only child with no close relatives other than my mom and my dad, and I am single, so that leaves either my friends or my mom to lean on when I have issues (not very close with my dad).

I have recently been battling some health issues for about a year. I had surgery to fix it, and despite the 95% success rate I think it failed and I’m still in a lot of pain. This has taken such a toll on my life both physically and emotionally, and I find myself going to my mom whenever I’m having a rough day.

I know this thing has taken a toll on her too, and she is very worried about me. I try to stay positive and feel terrible that I am dumping all my stress on her, as she’s told me there have been nights where she doesn’t sleep because she’s worried about me.

I think she knows I’m really unhappy right now (working a job I don’t enjoy, single and not happy about it, and this health issue isn’t helping). I really want to stop being selfish and worrying her, but sometimes I really need that support.

I also think that I get a bit of satisfaction out of this, having someone be worried about me and feeling bad for me. It’s kind of like when you’re a kid and enjoy staying home when you’re sick and having your parents take care of you and baby you. Obviously I am an adult, and I am not exaggerating my medical condition in any way, I am in pain every day (although it does not affect me performing my every day tasks) it’s this lingering pain that I am always aware of.

I really want to be more of an adult and deal with this because I don’t want to stress out my mom and decline her health as she’s getting older. But sometimes I really just want someone to talk to.

If anyone has any advice, that would be much appreciated. I don’t have the funds to afford therapy right now. :(",12Sep2019,3

745,"Hello Reddit

I have a friend in America who's currently homeless and in need of some help but I don't know enough about how America works to actually be helpful so i was hoping to maybe get some advice for him.

He used to live with his sister who had taken in the kids of someone else so they wouldn't have to go to foster care. My friend had a possession of controlled substance charge back in 2003 which seemed to be no problem to CPS at first, but now he had to leave the house with no notice. Not having any support, he went homeless.

Now he has help with $500 for housing but no one will take him. He has no verifiable income because the only work he can get are cash under the table jobs. He also has an eviction from 10 years ago when his father, who he's been living with, died and he couldn't pay the rent.

He just started going to college again but he can't sustain it while being homeless. The only time he can go to college and use their computers is during the day when he's gotta work if he finds work, so he's failing classes and is now on academic probation with his financial aid frozen.

Basically, things are not going great for him at the moment.. Do you have any suggestions for him to find a home and get his life back in order? He's in Washington.",12Sep2019,3

761,"I'm a 23 year old male from the UK

I'm having a lot of difficulty with loneliness. I transferred schools when I was 16. I had a lot of friends when I was at school, but I lost them all after the transfer. 

One of my friends even made a post on Facebook saying he missed me and it got likes from everyone I used to hang out with/my group of friends. 

I became friendless in my new school and I just went home after class (all students are allowed to at the ages of 16-18) and played video games by myself to compensate not having friends. I had a lot of people I could talk to which quickly turned into nobody to talk to. 

It eventually got to the point where I would feel pretty depressed and cry. I couldn't work out why, but I'm sure not having a single person to talk to is the main reason. 

A few years later, I got pretty sick and did poorly on my pre-university exams. I'm almost 24 and I've only recently gotten better. 

Through the time when I was 16 (almost 17) until now (almost 24) I've been friendless and lonely. 

I had eventually adapted to being alone when I reached about 19. Sometimes I really like that (bring alone) however, I've recently been feeling very lonely. 

I believe the reason for this is that I had so much bottled up inside of me that I started journal writing. It didn't really help. In fact, it made things worse because all my thoughts and feelings about my current situation, my past (including people I knew) and my future all came to the top of my head where before I used to ignore everything that was happening to me. 

I think I'm also craving affection. I've never had girlfriend, I've never been on a date, I've never had sex and I've never kissed a girl. 

I don't know what it is about me. I'm an average looking guy. I'm very skinny (50KG) so that doesn't help, but I'm working hard on it by going to the gym. 

I've also been told I'm a nice person. Not that nice guy phenomenon that we have these days, but just a kind person. Everybody who's ever known me says this. 

I've tried everything to go out and meet people. 

I'm part of a tennis club, but there are people who are 16 and everybody else is much older than me, at least 30. 

I tried that website/app called Meetup, but that's not going well. Most people are much older than me or the meetup is based around going to bars and I don't drink. 

I've tried Tinder, but that seems useless. I only got 1 match and she didn't say a word to for about 3 days. I eventually just closed my account because I was spending and aweful lot of time looking at profiles and making a decision on which way I should swipe, but I never got any matches. It felt so pointless and I've heard it's very common for people to experience what I've experienced. 

OkCupid was another platform I tried and that was useless, too. It's was same situation as Tinder. I spent about two full days working hard at it and I got nothing. 

I eventually went back in Facebook after 6 years. I made a new account and added so many I knew. It was pointless. Nobody asked how I was doing after all that time and when I messaged people we would have a very short conversation and they wouldn't even read my messages after they. 

I eventually deactivated my account because I felt even more lonely, especially when I saw how everybody else were moving on with their lifes, were in relationships and so on. 

My family won't help me either. I live with them, but they physically and emotionally abused me as a child until I was 16. 

My relationship with my family is better, but I really don't like my parents, especially my dad. I don't really want to get into it, but I don't plan on having them in my life once I graduate university and move out. If I ever had kids then I would be too afraid to leave my children alone with them. 

My question is: How do I get over this feeling of loneliness and wanting affection? 

I'm honestly looking for a way to resolve all this. I'm not giving up on anything. If I have to work harder to fix this issue then I will. I just don't know what my next move should be. 

Any advice, please? 

Thank you all for reading this. 

Tl;dr: I'm very lonely and despite trying everything I can't resolve the loneliness. What should my next step be?",12Sep2019,1

Would you pick love over your dreams? I’m at a crossroads in my life right now and I can pick 2 paths, go into the USMC and enter a new adventure, getting out and using the skills I gained for a lucrative civilian career, or stay behind, have a gap year and goto college, all the while staying with the one I love so so much. The military will forge me into a better person, a more disciplined and respectable person. My gf wants me to follow my dreams, saying she will support me no matter what I decide to do. But I know being away for an unknown amount of time is going to hurt her.  The best case scenario would be a long distance relationship for about 10 months, (including bootcamp) and then me getting stationed in San Diego, where we currently reside. The worst case scenario would be me being stationed away for the next 5 years. Which in my opinion will most certainly destroy us. If I lose this girl, I will regret it for the rest of my life. But if I don’t join the military, I will feel like a coward, and my dreams would be void.

768,"Hi, I’ve done some things that I think has made one of my supervisor dislike me a bit. The thing was that there is a trainee at work who said he thought he was ready to take on a shift on his own and he wanted my weekend shift coming up. In his defense I was the one who started the conversation because I asked him if he thought he was ready. So I was like “okay, you can have my weekend shift.” The shift swap has to go through approval so I figured if he wasn’t ready, the supervisor would let us know or just veto it. I don’t always work with this trainee as I only work 2-3 days a week. So I thought he had training maybe while I wasn’t there. The supervisor emails me saying that the trainee has had only really worked two shifts in the new position. She didn’t seem super happy that we did it and talked about it without her. I felt bad because I realized I probably should have just gone to her first.

771,"So I'm 23M and she's 22F. Met this girl a month ago and we've hung out a few times already before today.

She invited me for a drink earlier today so I met up with her and we chilled at the bar.  It was going great. She had to go do something with her parents but said she wanted to hangout more later in the night.

I said yea I'm all for it. Let's do it. Soon after we both left the bar she was texting me telling me I was ""sexy af"" and that she already missed me blah blah blah lol. 

But then 1 hour passes, then another... before I know it it's been 5 hours(!) without seeing her. She was still out doing things with her dad. She sent me snaps so I know she wasn't lying

At this point we've been talking  throughout the night. It's almost midnight. She said she wants to go swimming alone with me. I ask her where we're meeting up. After 15 minutes of no response I just head home and go to bed. 

She did tell me earlier that day that she has to be up early for work at 7 am the following morning. However, she also told me she wanted to see me again after the bar, and then again towards midnight. 

What's my next move? Why do you think she didn't tell me straight up that she couldn't make it? We've been talking a lot and things have been really moving forward. And then this hit me like a ton of bricks.

It honestly hurts because I actually liked this one.. what should I do next?",12Sep2019,2

We are acquaintances and the details don’t matter too much... however, I am in a position where I have next to no idea how she feels/would feel about me romantically. I want to just bite the bullet and ask her if she’d like to go out sometime, and the worst she could say is no thank you. But for some reason, now and in the past, I have sat idly by (sometimes for YEARS) because I am afraid to ask the person that I am interested in if they want to go out. (Seriously, I was really into this girl I went to high school with for many years and I never once told her, because I didn’t know if she felt the same. Now I will never know.) 

I would much rather just be able to tell if there was any chance at all - because if I could tell even in the slightest degree, I’d be way more comfortable taking that chance. 

I dont know why I am so afraid, because no one has harshly rejected me in the past and I have no reason to think she would. Rejection is rejection, but ultimately it’s something normal that I am totally able to handle. So what gives?

778," 

So, a while ago, I made a post about Catholicism. I delete many of the posts I make. There was one very deranged old woman who since that moment would not leave me alone. I do not want to mention her name, because it seems like I am starting to get rid of that plague, and I do not want that parasite to feel like I want her input or anything. So at first, she simply started commenting on my threads. Then she got out of hand, and started insinuating that I am not 19 (I am 19 years old in reality), and was an older man trying to groom kids. I reported her to reddit admins. After a while, they finally started taking action against that cockroach, so, while she still probably follows me around, she has cooled down with her schizophrenic accusations, and merely keeps her talk about religion. Even then, I ask that plague to leave me alone. Though she won't leave me alone, there is clearly some progress.

But the problem is, while this deranged idiot was still engaged in her hateful campaign against me, she motivated several people. Some have come to my private messages to write me creepy messages. Others continue to publicly harass me. One is this guy [u/A11U45](https://www.reddit.com/u/A11U45/) . He was convinced by that other woman that I was apparently an old man and was trying to groom kids or something. He follows me around and writes denigrating things on my posts. I have asked him to leave me alone, he won't. The other person is [u/furballin](https://www.reddit.com/u/furballin/) He employees the same tactic. He goes to where I make a post, seeks out people who respond to me, and then tells them unfounded rumors about me (e.g I am 30 year old man exploiting kids or something like that).

Blocking them does not help, because they keep harassing me by turning everyone who responds to me against me. These two are the ones I know. There were still others motivated by that plague that won't die (referring to her as a woman is an insult to women).

I reported them close to 100 times. Sometimes, reddit admins responded that they were planning on taking action or already took action, but these diseases still won't leave me alone. I cannot post a picture anymore. Because they keep screenshotting it, and analyzing how I look to ""prove"" that I am not a teenager.

This is clearly very harassing and needs to be put to an end. But reddit admins simply won't do anything. Reddit has become unsafe for me. How can I share anything about me anymore knowing that there are such creeps analyzing every post I ever make?",12Sep2019,0

784,"Alright, I’ll just out with it: when I was 14, I accidentally-on-purpose touched a girl’s breast at lunch in school one day. By accidentally-on-purpose, I mean that it was 100% intentional, but I made it seem like an accident. I’m fairly certain she noticed, and I’m also fairly certain she thought it was an accident (my fingers brushed her for like half a second, so it’s not like I was obviously copping a feel), but that doesn’t make it any better. It was a really horrific and awful thing to do. I keep thinking about it, and I hate myself for having done it. I can’t get over it. I’m 18 now, and in general, as a person, I have changed radically, but it’s still not so far in my past.

I don’t think there’s much I can do to actually make reparations here. I haven’t talked to that girl in years, and I’m pretty sure hitting her up out of the blue to apologize for groping her would just make her uncomfortable, especially since I’m guessing she doesn’t realize anything happened in the first place. (I could definitely be wrong about this, but from what I’ve heard from my female friends, their boobs get touched accidentally all the time. Heck, I’ve had times where I have actually accidentally touched them- and apologized profusely. Again, this is not to excuse my behavior or anything, but I simply don’t think she would remember it.)

I’m also going to donate a substantial amount of money to RAINN- not because I think it pays for my crimes, but if I can help anyone who was assaulted, it’ll be worth it.

So, anyway, I can’t move past this. I am consumed with guilt, and I don’t know what to do about it. How do I move on? Do I even deserve to move on? I have never done anything like this before besides that one time and will never do anything like it again, but am I now a sexual predator forever?

790,"I live in the US and I have no idea what to do about this. I'm 26, live with my parents as a live in caregiver for my mom. They can't afford a real nurse, so we make do as best as possible. Four years ago, we got new neighbors. I'm 90% sure that the children I hear playing in the backyard on the weekends/during the week are grandchildren. Two years ago I happened to be in the backyard when I hear a banging noise. My dogs were in the house asleep, and they came running out the dog door and started barking at the part of the fence the banging noise was coming from. It sounded an awful lot like a wiffle ball bat being hit against the fence (I was a kid once, I remember how boring going to grandma and grandpa's was) and then as soon as my dogs started to bark, the kid yells ""Grandma, the dogs are barking aGAiN!"" And then their hose comes over the fence, sweeps back and fourth three times, soaking my dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

I was beyond shocked. Before I moved back in, my parents were complaining about how someone kept reporting the dogs for nuisance barking. There is a city ordinance here that says unless a dog is barking for 7 consecutive minutes it's not considered nuisance, but they've filed a few reports about my parents. Reports that my dad has never been able to procure for me. Either my dad's lying about how much they're being reported, or he pulled it out of his butt so I'd bring the dogs in the minute they started barking.

&amp;#x200B;

This has become a problem. Today I was on the phone on hold when my dogs started barking. I call them inside, and get distracted from the phone call. A few minutes later they're back outside because I forget to close the dog door. Before I can call them in again, they come running in absolutely soaked from the head down mid-back. One of them is more wet, and I swear she thinks being sprayed with the hose is the most fun thing because she didn't start spending as much time in the backyard as she does now that she occasionally gets hosed. My problem is that it's going to be winter soon, and I have a feeling they're not going to stop just because it's cold outside.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? My parents have specifically asked me not to talk to them about it. Today I got pissed at them spraying my dogs, and when theirs wouldn't stop barking I yelled ""be quiet"" and waited a few minutes before I sprayed over the fence with our hose, but only after making sure both dogs were inside. I called the people you report this to, and they said I can't do it anonymously, and that it's now a whole criminal investigation process. Now I just want to knock on their door, ask about the kids, and ask if they're aware they're bored enough to be harassing my dogs when they're in the backyard. You know, like an adult? My dad is weird about this, and keeps telling me stuff like ""It's not bothering me any, so it's fine.""  Despite the fact he'll spend most of his time home with the backdoor open, just so he can yell at the dogs to stop barking. He does not understand how unhelpful this is. I just have to open the door and look at the dogs before they come inside. He just barks with them in human when they're doing it. I just want the neighbors to know that the kids are partially responsible for this, because before I moved in these dogs were the most well behaved angels. I can't even take the scared of kids rescue on walks anymore because being around children stresses her out now, which wasn't much of a problem before. My parents refuse to rehome the dogs, even though I think it would be in everyone's best interest.

&amp;#x200B;

799,"This will be long-ish, so I apologize in advance. If you actually read it towards the end, I appreciate it enormously.

For starters, I am 19 and male. Anyway, when I was 13 I had a traumatic event. Basically, I was molested, almost raped and abused in many ways by a group of other guys (most 17 to 19 y/o at that time). Note that I am straight, so that kind of thing happening to me...it had a lot of negative effects, to say the least, some of which are very active to this day. I spent years working on getting better, on diminishing the effect of what happened on my daily life (I could not tell my family about the event because of multiple reasons, so I had to deal with it myself, with the help of 1-2 close friends, but this is not that relevant.) and made some good progress. Still, I was lonely and had no serious relationship (the only time I had - or almost had one was with a girl that I had known ever since I was in kindergarten I think, who cheated on me the very next day after we were 'officially' together).

In any case, very early this year, I met this girl and we instantly clicked. We were both into the same things, would have endless subjects to talk about, we both made each other feel really good. We ended up becoming a couple. The first 2 months were wonderful and I seriously thought I was on the right path. At some point I told her about the trauma I mentioned earlier and it was one of the only three situations where I told it in detail. A while after, the relationship started spiralling into a living hell for me. She started getting controlling, expected me to spend my entire free time with her, gaslighted me without end, manipulated and blackmailed me emotionally. She also had no limits when it came to it. The worst thing was that she exploited the hell out of my trauma, especially when it came to the sexual aspect of the relationship. She'd always create really ugly situations pretty much every time we'd do it and she'd always manipulate me into thinking that I can't make her feel good, insult me and emotionally manipulate me until I'd be broken apart. Then she'd suddenly turn nice and supporting for a very short time and then the whole thing would start again and repeat. This thing happened dozens of times, it also happened that I'd have days when I'd not want to 'get private' just because of this aspect, but then the situation would get even worse.

By this point, everyone is probably asking why the hell I did not leave the relationship when this all started. There are multiple reasons: She actually managed to manipulate me into thinking that I am the one in the wrong in the whole thing (only realized I was not later on), she somehow made me think that she gave me more things than I did (materially speaking) and manipulated me into staying in that relationship, making me think I 'owed' her something. She even got his mother to start talking to me a lot, most of the talk being subtle manipulation that was supposed to keep me trapped into the relationship, which it did for some time. Not to mention, every time I'd stand my ground and fight back, she was very skilled at guilt tripping me...bad. She used any method to make me feel about bad myself out the blue and she basically created a wall around me that kept me blocked and while I was trapped, she emotionally abused me to her liking me. She even wanted to offer me tickets to a very expensive concert and a very expensive vacation (also for free) this summer, I tried my best to refuse, but she and her mother (who I have to mention, is quite rich) wouldn't budge. We had been in a relationship for a bit less than 5 months, but in that time frame I was brought from a point where I was confortable with myself to being completely wrecked. They wanted to tie me to them with that expensive concert + vacation, but somehow, at a point where I was so stressed I felt I'd literally die of my heart exploding (had very hard uni admission exam coming up and her emotional blackmailing was at an all time high) fate smiled upon me and offered me a way out. She crossed the line so badly after I took that exam that I exploded on the inside. I didn't react in any way in front of her, but let her know that I am not going to bow to her anymore and that I'm out. I cut the contact. She tried to start arguments through texts but I answered as neutrally and blandly as I could. She even messaged me one month later and told me a lot of things that accentuated damage, telling me that she was too kind for staying with me so long (back in the day she'd do anything to keep me trapped, but now she had changed her narrative completely to make me even more confused) and said other things to me that hit hard, like that I am never going to be able to sexually please anyone and other things like that.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been a month and a half since we broke up. I do not miss her and I most definitely do not want to see her face again, but the manipulation, the shaming, the insults, the gaslighting, the way she made my doubt myself...they turned me into what I was shortly after the trauma happened. My progress? Erased. It's been the first time in years when I had nightmares and flashbacks of the trauma. My paranoia and self-doubt is probably at its highest and all I can think of is the probability of her being right.

If anyone has read through all of this and can actually give me a piece of advice...I honestly don't even know how to thank you. Just to mention, for a certain amount of time, because of many reasons (one of which being having to move to another city for uni and all that) I won't be able to see a therapist or anyone of that kind, so I need suggestions on what I can do myself or with the help of friends.

800,"First off id like to say my thoughts and prayers go out to any who have suffered through this terrible act.  

My son attended preschool and is a bright and loving young boy, he loves playing with his peers  &amp; teachers at school. He is an innocent little kid who hasn’t been exposed to any abuse or neglect. He is my everything ! 

My son is now in kindergarten and is loving his new teacher and all his new friends. But something strange recently came up. 

Last year when my son attended preschool he was playing with one of his best friends who was a girl. He always came home and told me all the fun things him and his friend would have at preschool. One time they were playing outside when my son grabbed onto her and i guess pulled her pants down a little bit. The teachers spoke to me about the incident and i talked to my son that night about it. They we running outside when he tripped and tried grabbing her while falling and it pulled her pants down. 

Fast forward 8 months, my son and his best friend went to different kindergarten and life is great until a couple days ago i found out the girls parents have called child protective services and threaten to sue my child’s old preschool, the parents labeled my son a molester in a yelp review ! He is an innocent little boy who doesn’t have a clue what any of this means. Im enraged as this is just a case of children at play but the parents are taking it to far. 

Im not sure how to handle this, i am in contact with my son’s old preschool but I’m not sure how to go about dealing with the girls parents. 

Any advice is really appreciated !!",12Sep2019,388
801,"So I have this special needs cousin and we don’t know what he has maybe schizophrenia idk, thats what we’re assuming since the doctors in florida are so terrible. When I was 7 (he was 11 brain of a 4 year old) he sexually assaulted me, I was freaked out and didnt want to wake my grandparents and wrote a letter trying to get with police. They found it later and told my parents. Later on he’s been freaking out on me over the years and such, and physically abused me, his younger brothers, and my older sister. HE CHASED my sister with a bat once. I then got PTSD, anxiety, and depression from it and when Im around special needs kids it freaks me out because idk what they were going to do so I got frequent panic attacks. Later on (my moms &amp; my younger cousins birthday party)  we spent it with family, he lost to a wii game against me and accused me of cheating and tried to stab me, he got choked out by my dad because hes very protective with me since im the youngest and small. Then his aunt told him they were leaving and started calling her awful names and wished she would die, cops were called and since he was calm when they got there they did nothing, my aunt tried killing herself (didnt because of my youger cousin) Neither got baker acted, nor did my cousin get taken away for the cops here are VERY lazy and trashy.

802,"I will try to condence this as much as I can. Towards the beggining of the summer my boyfriend of Two years broke up with me. We had been fighting for a while and in hindsight I believe it might’ve been due to my untreated depression. Also in hindsight I regret treating him the way I did, I feel like he was the one and I just fucked it up. Well anyways sometime later after the break up during the summer he reached out to me and we tried to make it work, but he said he needed time to work on himself and we ended it about a month after it began. He said it wasn't my fault that time and it was really reassuring at the time. During our reconnection I was trying to get a therapist and figure out how to help myself, and it was going well. however things got real bad the other day and I had suicidal thoughts(let me clarify I will not act on my thoughts and I am seeking help) but I called him. He never picked up and remembered him telling me he would block my number as to not be tempted to reach out to me again. So I did something incredibly stupid(I've alreay beat myself up about this) but I showed up to his work. He was upset later and sent me an email that we are through and he doesn't care about me. Of course I was upset and I was confused, the last words we exchanged weren't hateful, he wanted to become friends. I called him again today and he answered and told me everything, that he doesn't care anymore but he isn't mad he wishes me well but all he remembers are the fights. We had initially decided to meet back up in january so that we could see where we were with eachother since he was working through things and I was too. But now that isn't going to happen and maybe it's for the best, at least I need to know it is. I still care for him but the things he said remind me how much I regret alianting him. So I'm asking for advice to accept it was my fault, that the relationship was wrong and how to move on, I need to do that I just don't know how. This is a person that I still love so how do I just accept everything? I feel like he was the one and I screwed it up.

803,"I noticed a while bac, that sometimes, for no reason at all, thoughts about suicide pop into my head. Like today, Im just walking home, looking at the forest to my right, and thinking ""what if I just go into the forest, and hang myself?"" I was immediately shaking the thought out of my head, but I couldnt help but notice, that this wasnt the first time I've thought about things like this. It just pops into my head every few days, for almost a year now. 
Im not depressed or anything, maybe a little lonely, but nothing serious. I've never cut myself, never had anxiety or panic attacks, no mental problems whatsoever, so I really dont know why is this happening. I know it doesnt sound like much, but before this started, I literally never thought about suicide, like ever, and know its in my head regularly.

Never forget the bloody, crying firemen who screamed about the bombs in the towers and the lobby.

Never forget the 2,300,000,000,000 dollars that was reported missing by Donald Rumsfeld the day before 9/11.

Never forget that the controller in charge of the Pentagon's budget was Doc Zakheim who lost the 2.3 trillion dollars by doing poor book keeping (lost 1.55 billion dollars, per day, for five years....)

Never forget that Dov Zakheim was also the CEO of Systems Planning Corporation in 2001 which manufactures Flight Termination Systems for commercial airliners so they can be remotely controlled by computers....

Never forget that the day after Rumsfeld mentioned missing 2.3 trillion dollars, a plane impacted the Office of Naval Intelligence at the Pentagon where the computers were kept which stored that information....over 100 budget analysts and accountants were killed and the money trail was lost.

Never forget that Larry Silverstein bought the entire WTC center lease in 2000 for a 15 million dollar bid (even though he was LOWER than other bidders).

Never forget that Larry Silverstein put a 3.5 BILLION dollar insurance policy on the towers against terrorist attacks in June 2001.....then 3 months later, both towers get hit by aircraft.

Never forget that Larry Silverstein sued his insurers (over 40 companies) to get paid double his limit, since each plane constitutes a separate attack...and never forget that Larry made 4.55 billion dollars so far, off of an initial investment of 15 million dollars.

Never forget that scientists and physicists at BYU found a type of explosive in every dust sample tested which was confirmed to be a type of Thermite. (Thermite produces liquid iron and is used to cut thick columns effectively and quietly).

Never forget that World Trade Center 7 fell at 5:20pm on 9/11 and the news tried to cover it up.....

Never forget that BBC, fox news and CNN reporters all misread scripts live on TV which announced WTC7 collapsing hours before it did.....indicating a prewritten narrative

Never forget that WTC 7 was 47 stories tall, yet NIST said that it collapsed ""at free fall acceleration for 2.25 seconds"".

Never forget high school physics and the definition of static equilibrium and conservation of momentum which would make it impossible for any structure to collapse at FREE FALL acceleration (impossible with out explosives or preweakening the structure )

Never forget that NORAD was running two drills on 9/11:. Vigilant Guardian and Vigilant Warrior

Never forget that these drills scrambled jets all over the country, and over the ocean and made it impossible for the pilots to intercept the hijacked jets in time once they were scrambled towards the hijackings.

Never forget that molten metal was found at ground zero days after the towers collapsed, and was also found under WTC7. And never forget that Kerosene and office furniture doesn't burn hot enough to phase change steel from solid to liquid.

Never forget that a van was pulled over trying to leave new York city, and contained illegal explosives and very suspicious occupants from Israel who were detained for 71 days, and then this story disappeared.

Never forget the thousands of Americans murdered by our government for money.

I think she's made a couple of ""romantic advances"", but I don't really know how she feels. What's the best way to figure out how she feels and tell her how I feel?",12Sep2019,0
816,"This post is longer than I expected so Tl;Dr at the bottom.

I met this girl my freshman year of high school in my geography class if there was one thing that anyone noticed about her it was that she was a mess. She would have anxiety attacks that were so bad that she would stop breathing completely and the teachers would have to call an ambulance for her; people got pretty annoyed by that and said some shitty things. She would also cry a lot in class and she was very depressed. The one thing that was probably the most disturbing about her was the self harm; she would cut her wrists quite frequently and her arms looked brutal. Despite all of this I still really liked her she was always very quiet around our peers but whenever the teacher would ask a question in class she would always be the first to raise her hand and answer the question and was SMART everyone in our class was so impressed, the way she understood the concepts that we talked about was far above the level of understanding that you would expect from a 9th grade student. She was also very passionate whenever we had class discussions she would usually get rather emotional but would still be able to brilliantly argue her point. She was also pretty quirky and hilarious and energetic when she was in her happier state, she was actually kinda adorable. 
As much as I liked her I didn’t bother to talk to bc I too was struggling with self harm and low confidence, I was 250lbs and had no friends. It also seemed like she had a few good friends already.
Sophomore year things went even further down hill from there. She lost all of her friends after they had a falling out and never made any new ones. They had been growing apart for years due to differences in world views (she was raised in a Muslim family and had become an atheist, they were raised as Christians and where still very devout Christians). After that she became very bitter and depressed and began self harming far more and more and became known as a psychotic mess by all of our cruel peers. Her grades started slipping and she was very lost. She attempted suicide at the beginning of the semester after that it was like a flip switched in her head: her grades started improving, at the end of sophomore year she became her class secretary for student government, became a Link Crew Leader, signed up for cross country, joined mock trial and became must more friendly and positive in general. 
Junior year was the year that we finally started talking to each other we both did mock trial and we would talk everyday on the bus to meets. She had made a complete 180 degree improvement. It made me begin to think that if she could do it so could I. I began trying to lose weight and try to ween myself off of self-harm. She was my biggest cheerleader I would text her whenever I felt like self harming and she would talk me through it she would tell me about ways that she gave up self harm. Whenever I felt like giving up she wouldn't let me. When we started talking more she started to open up to me about her life and I was impressed about how much she had overcome she was severely bullied as a child she was sexually assaulted at young age. That year was an amazing year for her she took all ap classes. She became one of the co-editors of the school newspaper, all of her teachers adored her and she seemed to be doing amazing. 
At the end of the school year she decided to try out for cheer. She hadn't done cheer since she was in the fourth grade but she had amazing voice projection and was pretty good at cartwheels so she figured that she would give it a try. The cheer coach for whatever reason was adamant that there had to be 25 girls and 25 ONLY. There were many girls who tried out who had no idea how to even do a very basic cartwheel but she was the only girl that the coach chose to cut from the team. The coach made them wait 10 days before learning the results she was so hurt. A few days later the coach approached her and encouraged her to come cheer them on at the games because she had the best voice projection of all of the girls who tried out. The coach never explained why she was the ONLY girl who was cut. 
After this she completely retreated back to her former self but worse. She completely gave up on herself she decided not to apply any colleges because the cheer tryout made her think that she must be worst applicant. She dropped out of all of the AP classes that she had planned on taking senior year. She became so depressed I didn't know what to say I had never seen her so hopeless and miserable. She committed suicide two weeks after the first day of senior year. 

I am devastated, I feel so lost now. She was my biggest inspiration that anyone could get better and now she is gone. When I first started my weitloss journey I weighed over 250lbs, I was able to get down 156lbs but these past two weeks I have relapsed back into binging and cutting. I now weight 167lbs. 
I don't know what to do or how to feel. Why did she commit suicide? It was one stupid cheer squad. 

Tl;Dr- my classmate made a major mental health recovery and inspired me to do the same but then she committed suicide after not making the cheer team and now I relapsed. What do I do?",12Sep2019,3
817,"For probably the past 2 years my sex drive has literally been non existent. 

When my boyfriend (27) and I started dating 5 years ago all I wanted was sex. I would even get upset if he wasn’t in the mood! I would drive over to his house after a late shift, pick him up, and give him a bj and then just drop him off back home or have sex in public places (like the woods). 

But now... I just... don’t have any desire whatsoever. And it’s not that I’m not attracted to him, he is incredibly handsome and has a nice body and everything... I don’t even fantasize about other men or anything. 

There’s been a couple times that we’ve attempted to get down and dirty and I will just psyche myself out during foreplay and start crying because I feel so bad. I don’t want him to think it’s him, because deep down in my heart it’s not, I just have no desire at all. 

Thankfully, he has been SO nice even though he is getting literally no action. He doesn’t pressure me or make me feel bad and I know that he’s not cheating. 

I’ve suggested seeing a therapist or something but I’m already afraid of how much that would cost. 

Has anyone experienced this? I mean it’s weird because I literally feel like I can go the rest of my life and not be sexual because the desire is just completely not there. I’ve tried to think of other guys thinking I’m just bored in the relationship but just no... nothing.",12Sep2019,1
818,"I'm currently 20 years old. At 15, i've started having some bad anxiety when i started HS. This has also affected me as i became a quieter and less social person. To put it shortly, at the moment i have no meaningful friendships, am somewhat socially awkward, and spend most of my time at home. But i'll be damned if anyone says i haven't tried.

I pushed myself to do mad embarassing shit, including lying down in the middle of town square, to get out of my ""comfort zone"". I've read books, meditated, nofapped, still force myself to talk to others. Go to the gym regularly, gotten buffer even. But at the end of the day, all i'm left with is awkward silence, treatment like i'm still a child, and being ignored. (Even my own parents often and i don't think they even realise, as they mostly mean well and were genuinely surprised when i brought this up) And don't forget slight clumsiness and wierd body language. Pretty much every longer social interaction makes me feel like a piece of shit, because they remind me of how bad my situation is.

I'm ready to become a man, and yet i can't even connect with most people on the most basic human level. The only ones who are interested in talking to me are girls online (for some reason i get along with them really well) and guys who are socially even lower than me. Here's the kicker though. I'm not trying to be condescending. But EVEN THOSE PEOPLE, who are clearly worse at small talk and all this stuff, somehow conjure up enough friends to regularly hang out with. Meanwhile i'm almost completely comfortable talking to very few, which are elementary classmates.

I realise this text is written in the spirit of a possibly uncomfortable person to be around, but it's because i'm pissed off and had enough. Irl i go by the rule treat others as you'd like to be treated, and even go out of my way to help (i love helping others).

WTF do i do? Online personality tests came out as INTP-A/INTP-T and mostly phlegmatic. After some thinking, i came to the conclusion that i am an ambivert leaning toward introversion, however used to love the positive spotlight back in ele school. That is when 95% people didn't treat me like some wierdo. I forgot how that feels. How do people do it? What am i supposed to do?  I feel stuck.",12Sep2019,5

This would effectively mean that whoever gets the job would be managing the other. Both of them agree it’s not really realistic to expect one to manage the other, so friend A suggested to our president that she and Friend B share the role. 

I was with Friend B earlier this week and she expressed to me that she does not think sharing the role is possible. She believes it would not work and would cause too much tension and confusion. 

Friend A approached me talking about the potential role and about sharing it with Friend B, when I said “well I don’t think Friend B wants to share the role”. This was new news to Friend A, who hadn’t yet heard that from Friend B- effectively, I split the beans on Friend B’s secret. I promptly told Friend A I really don’t want to be involved with this spicy meatball- please leave me out of it, that I didn’t really know the full landscape of what was going on and that it sounded like she and Friend B needed to have a conversation and clear up confusion. 

My question is: do I ‘get ahead of this’ and tell friend B that I split her secret? I’m not sure she would find out that I did, and I’m not sure if it would just serve to upset her. But I feel really guilty and like I betrayed her trust.

Recently I've been trying to socialize more/talk to other people at hangouts, parties, etc.   I've noticed that sometimes within the first 5 minutes of talking to someone, they begin telling me some very personal things about their lives (which is fine!). I'm a very good listener and always happy to hear other people's stories. However, it begins to make me uncomfortable because it seems like after they tell me some very personal things (e.g., past suicide attempts, addiction/family issues), it feels like I am then expected to also share some very personal things about myself. I wouldn't call myself a private person but I definitely don't feel comfortable telling even a friendly stranger my personal baggage. 

I may just be forcing this social pressure on myself. But even if that is the case, I can't help but feel like I'm weird for not wanting to open up. Also, I definitely don't want to overgeneralize.

825,"I (29F) have been working for my company for 4 years with essentially one other person, my direct supervisor and mentor (50's F).  We were very close during my first year at the job because it was just us, we saw each other every day and confided in each other about our problems.  I would have considered her a good friend.  Towards the end of 2015, there was a presidential election to end them all, and I was invited over to her house to watch the chaos unfold.  Enter husband, S.  I had met S once or twice before when he attended events and found him irritating, but harmless.  But it seems like he had other intentions this night.  

After the results of the election seemed imminent, I decided to take my leave.  S had taken a shower and stepped outside to smoke, I'm realizing now the timing of his smoke break could not have been better.  As I walked out the back door, he came around from the front door with *his* front door wide the fuck open and directly facing me.  He had on flannel pajama pants and his entire flaccid cock was outside of the gap.  I was shocked. I tried to avert my eyes and politely remove myself.  I started to walk towards my car and he followed.  He continued to pursue the conversation as I desperately tried to escape it.  He seemed to drag out the situation as long as he could.  I recall sitting in my drivers seat with my hand on the door as he continued to talk to me about the next time he would see me.  

I went back and forth for a while about whether it was intentional or not.  Of course, pajamas are soft, gaps happen.  But between the timing of his smoke break, the amount of dick that was out, and how long he pursued me, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was 100% intentional.  Even so, I wouldn't tell my boss.  How could I?  I could damage my job, I could ruin her marriage, I could out him as a sexual predator to his adult daughters. None of that is my place.  The #metoo movement has done wonders, but it was just too uncomfortable to bring up. So I held it in and decided if anything even remotely similar happens again, that I would blow him out of the water.

Fast forward to yesterday.  My boss tells me that S is no longer living at home with her.  They've separated and from the sound of it, he is not coming back.  She mentioned that they are still friendly.  

Should I tell her now?  Has anything changed?   Does she need to know?  Does she deserve to know?",12Sep2019,1

After, he said he wanted to see me again next week for a date so i was beyond thrilled.

Today he texted he wants nothing to do with me. Made excuses like ""i'm not over my ex, it's not you it's me"" but i dont believe it, i'm sure it was because i'm ugly and inexperienced.

This is the worst rejection i've ever felt. I haven't had sex since my last relationship 2 years ago, i don't want a hookup i did this because i had deep feelings and thought we would go somewhere.

Now i am just disgusted i was his one night stand...i feel dirty and i'm still in physical pain from it.

His last text was ""Maybe in the future"" but i was so mad i said ""There's no future, i'm blocking you.""

I honestly don't know how to cope, i feel a bit suicidal. Everything seems unbearable.",12Sep2019,0

830,"I know EVERYBODY asks this question here. I’m kind of in a weird situation and can’t tell if I’m reading into things or if I’m on the right track. I just started community college and there’s this really chill guy in my class. I’ve only had a few class related discussions with him and I ended up following him on Instagram. He specifically told me in class he doesn’t use social media so I thought I’d give it a try. He did never follow me back and is never active on social media, he’s liked maybe 2-3 things in the past week or so. 

The thing is, this guy is ALWAYS watching me. I don’t know if it’s because I’m ugly or he’s interested? 😂 I’ll just be focusing on my work and glance up at the teacher and catch him, as soon as I see him he looks away and it happens like that for the duration of class, an hour and 15 minutes. For the past 3 weeks after class we’d walk in opposite directions to our vehicles and I parked in the area I thought he’d parked and he started walking slowly in the direction I would usually go. So it’s like we switched?

His staring isn’t making me uncomfortable but I am curious as to why? I know he’s struggling with some formatting in class and was thinking I could offer my help? Maybe I could ask him if he’s staring at me because I did something to bother him? I could be reading into an empty situation but some feedback would be appreciated.",12Sep2019,2

I drank a lot this past weekend for a bachelor party and woke up still drunk and puked tons of acidic stuff out and then went back to sleep. I checked throat later at night cause it hurt and saw some red spots back of throat in right corner and uvula. Next day I hate some eggs that were a little hot and checked throat again at night and I had triple the red spots than I did before. My throat hurts a little bit but not so bad I can’t eat or swallow. 

Should I go to doctor or is this a combination of drinking heavily for 2 nights, eats tons of faulty chips/pizza, puking acid and then hot food on top of it?

835,"I've never done this before but I don't know how where to ask. I have recently discovered that I have many emotional and personal issues. I am 17 years old and I have a good life, go to a good school and am relatively liked by people and have friends. The problem is that I never learned how to share and express my feelings, I am used to bottling everything up inside. I don't share my feelings and problems with anybody - my parents, friends, nobody. I also am too afraid to ask for anything that I deserve and I rarely stand up for myself. I am a doormat and a people pleaser. I have low self esteem and rarely feel good about myself. I am scared that these problems are slowly ruining my relationships, alienating me from people, I always become grumpy and angry when something bothers me for a long time, but I don't tell anyone. There was a girl who I connected with deeply and we became best friends, I could tell her anything, but we dated(which was a mistake), which in turn created more personal problems and issues but the friendship is kind of broken now, I'm pretty sure we can't be friends again. (We've tried). So my question is - what can I do to combat these problems? I am really not sure - I can't talk to anybody about all this. See a psychologist? - I don't want to bother my parents with it and I don't want to make them give money for such things. I am sure that these problems can't be solved by myself. Here is the only place I can open up and ask for advice/help. If you could suggest what could I read/watch - youtube channels, subreddits that deal with these kinds of topics, books, that would be deeply appreciated. I hope that I have clarified myself enough and not just scattered random thoughts. If I don't combat these issues and try to solve them my life will worsen and I will continue alienating people, fuck things up because I don't have anyone to talk to for advice, missing out on oportunities and fun, being miserable and despising my situation and suffering inside.

I left my tech support call center job back in May since nearly every call I took was escalated and it simply was too draining for me. I had enough savings to give me about three months to find another job, and I was pretty confident I wouldn't have any problems, since there seemed to be plenty of openings. That hasn't been the case for me, and I've been ghosted or rejected by nearly every company I've applied for.

He refuses to go out and do social things such like going to a bar or party. He constantly complains about exercising (our friend group plays a lot of basketball). He claims that if I am home along and doing nothing, and he hits me up to hang out, I have literally no reason to not say yes and that if I do I am being a bad friend.

In the last 4 months he has really taken to “calling out” all of our flaws and telling us we r objectively bad friends. Even when we ask him to stop he continues to barrage us with reasons why we are not as considerate as he is.

He is impossible to reason with - when he believes he is right It is impossible to change his mind unless you pull up hard data that specifically proves him wrong.

Our shared 3rd (24m) best friend recently mentioned to me he was considering cutting off this toxic friend. He says the toxicity is too draining and that at a certain point we have to look out for our own happiness even if It comes at a cost to our depressed friend. This is coming from my Toxic friend’s first childhood friend.

843,"Sorry, I'm on phone, yadayadayada...
I'm 14 and in school (obviously).
Oh and before you start on the r/im14andthisisdeep jokes, I have diagnosed depression and anxiety, so I hope you can see how this not very drastic story really gets to me.

Ok, so. My best friend and I have known each other for as long as we've been alive (our parents knew each other before we were born.. etc) and we know everything about each other (I was the first one he told about being gay, I got into a huge fight with my parents and he came to my house just to see if I was ok).

We were in a very small group with 2 others, and we were all very close, but one day, without warning, he just moved groups. We still called every day and hung around a lot, but it was weird it just being the 3 of us. Then, the other 2 got into an argument and just stopped talking. This is when I decided to take my chance and go with my best friend.

I've had a rough past with groups and i don't trust people very easily, but just a few days into being with these lot, I felt at home. 
Although, from the start, I had a feeling they didn't like me, but I just brushed it off as me being paranoid and overthinking it.

Then, earlier today, I got a text from my best friend going something like this-
Me- Me
Friend- F
F-'I'm sorry but you can't be with us anymore.'
Me-'Huh?'
F-'Yeah, the others just don't like you that much.'
Me-'And you decide to tell me that now, after thinking I've finally found a group of people that I'm comfortable with?'
F-'Yeah sorry, you have to leave. We can still be friends, but I have to stick with this one now.'

During this entire conversation, my anxiety was really coming into play, but I was literally in the car on the way to dance so I couldn't make a fuss.

So, this is where I need help. I'm not blaming any of them, I think they thought they were doing the right thing by trying to keep me there and not feel uncomfortable, and they're all genuinely nice people, but I just feel like if they didn't want me there, they shouldn't have let me get my hopes up like that (my issues aren't exactly hidden either, that's literally what I get bullied about daily so idk).

And I really do want to stay friends with him, as we're so connected and we're if friends could be soulmates (can they?).

I've had like 5 panic attacks, and idk what to do, I literally have no friends anymore (I haven't really talked to the other 2 since) and I can't just make new ones as literally no one in the school seems to like me.

Tldr: My best friend of nearly 15 years pulled a Regina George and now I don't have anyone.

So, what do I do?

845,"Every relationship sex has been a huge issue.
My libido typically matches that of my companions(bi) but typically I'm scared and uncomfortable with sex and i don't know why. Oral sex is comforting to me giving and receiving.
I hate the pushyness and demanding role I kept getting thrusted  into that I have to perform and I hate it. 
Often times I can't stay hard. People are so upset with me when it comes to sex because I rarely finish as it takes me longer than most people (15 minutes is my fastest, 2 hours is longest) and I hate that. I'm a little uncomfortable with my body. I was picked on as a kid, I used to starve myself as a teen, I remember having abs and girls commented on this when I was 17 I believe and I recalled thinking I had 20-25 pounds or so I wanted to lose still. 
Overall sex makes me so uncomfortable, every relationship man or woman I have been with has  felt like they've pushed for sex sex sex so hard and I've felt backed into this suffocated corner where I can't even be who I am and I'm like this panic attack induced lab rat that is trying to survive. I hate it. I want to be like other people and enjoy sex and not have so many anxieties and anger when people freak out about it but I do. I hate when people ""plan"" sex and when it's simply demanded from a guy, as if guys aren't allowed to not be in the mood. Overall my experience with sex has been mediocre and has jilted me from wanted to meet other people in that capacity. Maybe friendship is all I really need in life? But I KNOW I have sexual needs, I KNOW i have romantic needs and I know deep down this all hurts a lot.



 I know what the first response is gonna be. To see a therapist, I'll let reddit know what I can afford that I'm just trying to manage to keep my job/afford to eat and manage my 60 hours a week rn oh and my car broke down recently let's hope that can get fixed and not be too expensive....

851,"So a bit of context. When i first joined my current job, i  quickly got along with this guy (we,ll call him bob). He was overall a nice guy (helpful, fun, and overall pleasant. Even during our company events, he would be fun to hang around and we had some good memories. But then the first red flag came up. Being the new guy on the job where training was very minimal, i had to ask people for help so that i would learn. Ontop of that, bob was the only person i could rely on since my other co workers were either in a different position or occupied (very small team). Heres where i noticed the first problem. We recently hired a new person, and like me, she asked questions to learn from the job. When she asked for help , bob would help. When i asked help, bob would be less helpful (noticed a big difference in the quality of help from bob). I said okay, i’ll focus on the task i know i can handle. Well my boss had a group meeting, and singled me out for having less work than everyone (now i couldn’t say anything at the time because the boss and bob were good friends). So i shut my mouth and went on with my job (i got back at them by keeping my talks to a minimal with them).


Fast forward to 8 months, i made some great strides in the company ( to the point where i am a unique asset). Me and bob are still good friends, but recently i noticed the second red flag. Every time i would talk to bob, he had some snarky remark (the worse one was when he announced to the office that i am not funny). I noticed that every other person had no problems with bob other than me. Then i questioned myself as to why he would act like this only to me. I had no answer. Ever since that event, i kept my conversations to a minimum  with bob. Today he started striking up conversation with me (friendly). I kept it minimal and outright just ignored the conversation.

861,"Hey everyone I'm going through the process of making a difficult decision right now and would appreciate honest advice and minimal criticism. 

I've always wanted a dog ever since I was young, but my parents were always against it. So I went through university and I got a full time position and became financially stable. I was also in a relationship for some time and the guy loved dogs so I thought maybe together we could go and get a dog since I was nervous about owning my first dog since I've never done it before. He was my first love but it ended up being unrequited, so I had to break up with him. At that point I realized I couldn't wait around anymore for a guy if I wanted a dog so I had to just do it. Eventually one of my friends let me know of a dog that needed a home and I met her and she was absolutely well behaved and wonderful. I had a roommate at the time who had grown up with dogs so she could give me advice on how to take care of it so I jumped on the opportunity pretty quickly. This was about 1.5 years ago. During this time I was the sole owner, I walked her almost every single day I've had her, fed, did everything to take care of her and only asked my room mate and friends to walk her if I absolutely couldn't that day. She really helped me through my break up, has shown me so much love and is my best friend and made me more active which I so very much appreciate. Now 1.5 years later my struggle with depression has become exceedingly worse, and there are some days when I have no motivation to do anything which includes taking my dog on walks. I also sometimes get angry when I go through my lows and sometimes she gets that anger thrown onto her (not in an abusive way but I'll yell at her for little things she does and I have a loud voice so I know it scares her) and I get into this very introverted state where I don't want to interact with anyone including her and I can just tell she feels neglected. Being the sole owner of her has really taken a toll on me and my mental health because of the huge amount of responsibility I have put on myself. I'm starting to think that maybe it's time I give her to somebody else that would be better suited to take care of her and start putting my energy into taking care of myself more since my depression has definitely debilitated me in the past before. I feel that maybe my decision to get her was rushed  looking back at it now in hindsight, but ultimately when I made the decision I did not forsee my depression coming back as frequently and strongly as it has in the past year. Plus I thought maybe a dog would actually help alleviate some of those feelings, since I've always felt this lack of love in my life. I also met some amazing friends at the dog park because I got her and they got me through my first break up so that was a wonderful upside to also taking my dog in. She is currently 3 years old and I keep asking myself if I can really handle probably 10 more years of this. I might have been slightly irresponsible for taking in a dog all by myself when I had no prior experience, but I have provided everything needed for my girl in the past 1.5 years and ultimately I am human and sometimes we don't think through every single thing rationally. 

I just need some opinions based on my current mental health struggles and wanting the best for my girl. Please withhold the criticism since I am already feeling very guilty and selfish right now for even thinking about giving her up when I promised I would take her in permanently.",12Sep2019,2

# how to help little brother with ADHD and anxiety ? (repost)

&amp;#x200B;

((((( REPOST SINCE I DIDINT GET ANY REPLIES )))))

So today I found out my little brother whois currently 12 years old, he is in high school, well in Mexico it's called high school i don't know about other countries. well the point is, he has severe anxiety, ADHD and early symptoms of depression. and today at school he stimulated his penis in class, nothing to severe, just rubbing himself, and i know he does this when he has an anxiety attack or so my mom told me. so some girls in his class noticed and told him to stop rubbing himself and he just kept doing it.

the school called my parents, they talked to the principal and the prefect? i think its called that. and told them that the girls felt ""harassed"".

now my parents are talking to him about this, and they told him that its ok to touch yourself, its normal and natural but there are times and places to do it.

so this is about today.

but...

i know he has been doing this since the daycare, he was so little and he would stimulate himself, when he was about 4 years old my parents took him to a psychiatrist and he has medication for his ADHD and anxiety. he has been doing this for a long time to cope with his anxiety and he doesn't seem to understand that he cant do it in public. even now he is 12 years old he doesn't quite get it, and i don't know why. he doesn't have mental retardation or autism, actually, he is just a normal 12-year-old boy, he is so smart but yet he has trouble in school because of his ADHD.

i want to help him, but i don't know how, i know people at that age can be harmful to others and now my parents are hoping he can get school again, they suspended him for about 3 days i think.

now i know that what happened today is due to him not taking his medication, don't get me wrong my parents always buy his medication and are constantly taking him to his psychiatrist, but here in Mexico ADHD is seen a not so normal thing, my parents struggle to find medication and its not even about the money, its because there isnt medication in Mexico! not a single one! its been about 2 months without the medication, and my parents dont know what to do, we cant buy in USA because we aren't citizens.

he has gone through a lot of medications and none seems to help with his anxiety, there is always that, he had Prozac, Vyvanse and others! but the thing is that there isnt in mexico right now! and even if there where we cant buy it because laws in mexico prohibit buying controlled meds from mail, like if we ordered it from mexico city they won't let it through the mail because its against the law!

please im desperate! what can i do for him? how can i talk to him?

and if you have any other meds you recommend or your own experiences please share so i can tell him what he can do.

Edit 1: I talked to my mom 10 mins ago and she told me it wasn't more than one girl that saw him. It was one girl and that girl told 4 other girls at recess.

He had meds like Prozac, Vyvanse,Ritalin,concerta and I don't remember the other names. But none has helped him right with his anxiety.

I know what he did was wrong and I don't know how to make him understand that he can't do it in public.

I don't know if he doesn't really get it or if his ADHD makes him have trouble with it.

My parents are currently talking to his psychiatrist to make an appointment because now they have to give the school papers or some kind of Prof that he isn't a danger for other students or some kind of sex pervert.",12Sep2019,2
866,"So I need help with this.
I've been best friends since 2nd grade with my best friend. But recently she's been not talking to me. She only messages me when she wants something. I would invite her out and she would stand me up to the point it hurt me. She's literally my only friend. I've helped her alot. And she did talk bad about me before. I don't know if she's using me or what. 
Should I just forget about her? Or keep the friendship going?

867,"I was on [r/depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/) and made a post about the causes of my depression and sadness. One girl responded and then we texted. We chat everyday and have talked about everything (goals, interests, politics, friends and family, favorites and much more). The problem is we have run out of things to chat about. Most days we just talk about how our days are going and if anything different happened.

868,"I am gonna keep this background short... So... Me and my girlfriend have known each other for almost three years and were really close during it! I never noticed her feelings before she confessed to me a year before... I wasn't feeling the same during that time! But, me and this guy started dating and... I wanted to tell her and my online sister... My OS, (Online Sis!) Took it well... My Gf didn't... She tried to kill herself... I felt it was my fault... But after three months, me and the guy broke up... After around a week, I told her and decided to give her a chance... She used to be so sweet and she still is! But... She... Started guilt tripping me... By threatening to not let me call her or to leave... She forces me to start everything.... Even when I ask... And if I don't... She says we won't then...

Then it became bigger... She hates my RLB, (Real Life Bestie!) Because RLB can hang out with me... She shows disdain towards RLB... She became more worse... Yesterday, me and her were jokingly arguing over who was better from BHA... I said Bakugo... She was insisting that it was Todoroki... But suddenly she went quiet and said she'll just go... Then left the chat, I begged her to come back and she texted me on another app... Threatening suicide... Saying I was probably smiling at the thought of her dying, (I wasn't, I was on the verge of tears..) And everything... I was sobbing when I went to the counselor's office... Worried to death... I always apologize during our fights.... I feel like I am just complaining... Is this normal?... Am I just being selfish?",12Sep2019,2

Once it got bad enough, both of us were kind of out of the mood. I thought it was a yeast infection but the discharge wasn’t necessarily clumpy, so I think it’s BV.

870,"Hi! I have a problem with my younger brother and i'm in search for some help. My brother is 6 years younger and his main hobby right now is playing video games; which would be fine if he wouldn't spend so much time doing it. He literally spends more that 50% of his day, right after school and homeworks playing video games. Soon i'll leave for collage, so i won't be around too much and i want to show him how cool real life actually is, and how much he should try lots of things out. I wouldn't normally have a problem with him doing it, but i see how it affects his behaviour, he is more easily irritated, when things don't go his way and once he hit the laptop because he lost on a game and got mad. Generally, he's a good kid, prety smart and well-spoken, but all his life is focused on this, and when i take it away or ask him tot take a break, he gets upset and i want to try and teach him some stuff before i leave. My parents divorced recently, so things are a little messy in the family. I was just wondering what could i do to show him that going out and trying things and having a good social life,  finding something real and constructive to focus on is so much better than living in his imaginary video game world?",12Sep2019,2

I get home from school at around 3:30 - 4:00, and usually I'm exhausted (the bus ride home is really stressful).

By the time I am finally finished all of my duties, it is 10:00. That leaves me a one hour window to use wifi since it goes off again at 11:00. Usually it is even later and most times I don't get wifi at all. I like to game and I am trying to continue to code, but it is hard to find time for this.

878,"Hi. Let me preface this - I don’t have an eating disorder.

Basically, I’d like to lose about 10-15 pounds. I started using an app to track my food, mostly to make sure I’m making myself eat healthy and being accountable for my food choices. 

I enjoy eating. I recently moved out on my own officially, so no more parent made meals or even college prepared meals. I’m ok at cooking, but not very good. Also on a very tight budget. So those two combined have led to me eating less and less frequently. 

When starting this app, I realized how little I’ve been eating. For example, today I’ve had all three meals and I’ve only hit 950 calories... out of 1450....  

The problem is I’m so used to these small meals, I physically feel super full. But, I know I can’t lose weight if I’m super under my calorie count and putting my body into trouble. I’ve started working out again, so I need more calories than if I didn’t.  Idk what to do... I love food but I can’t force myself to eat when I feel full. Help?",12Sep2019,2
879,"I basically don't know what to do with my life. I dropped out of school a few years ago due to being unable to pay and decided to leave the US because of not being a citizen my only option was to basically work as an illegal. Now I've been back in my home country for two years and can feel myself slowly but steadily falling deeper and deeper into depression. Basically all the friends, connections, and things I learned all of high school and college, abruptly disappeared. I have no friends, no money, I never go out and my parents are basically non-existent as emotional or financial support. I knew the transition would be difficult but I guess they weight of it was stronger than I anticipated. I've worked a number of random jobs the past year but each one just became a mind numbing depressing daily task until I eventually quit, plus the pay and hours are mostly horrible in my home third-world country. I'm thinking of going back to school mostly because it'll make it possible for me to make friends and hopefully look at my surroundings in a new light, but I also know it'll be 4 more years of poverty and I'll be 28 by the time I finish. Due to it being my home country I can take a loan and worry about the payment after graduation, the transportation and daily life however will most likely be quite difficult. I guess this last part is mostly just venting and making excuses I suppose. I know I'm young and I actually think quite highly of my ability to accomplish what I set my mind to. I just feel lost and can feel the confidence and overall excitement for life degrading, which is why I'm looking for advice. What should I do? Is it a good idea to go back to school? Should I do something else? Right now I spend my day entire playing a single competitive video game and it fells like my mood is utterly dependent on it, if I win I'm happy for a bit, if lose I get angrier than I used to, and even in-game I can notice my performance lacking due to a weaker hold on my emotional intelligence.",12Sep2019,1
880,"I've been so suicidal for so long it's literally made me numb to 99% of things. I can't even show real appreciation to all the people that show me love and support. I keep pushing away my friends and the love of my life. Hell, I'm such an asshole that the day I planned on killing myself, I got my best friend to try with me, I made plans with the girl that had my heart (knowing full well I wasn't going to live past that night), I made plans with my mom to have dinner the next day, I didn't even write a note saying goodbye to everyone. I didn't say thank you to everyone that helped me along the way, or continues to do so. I spent over 300$ on drugs, alc, and food the day I planned on killing myself. Now I've got 100$ in the bank, tons of bills, a car expense bc my truck just blew on the freeway yesterday, school, and I need to move out of my house and get more freedom or I'm scared I'll try and kill myself again.

I've got so many money problems, I've got school, a shitty job at McDonalds which humiliates me everyday, controlling parents, I've got to start selling again just to get by, I'm down to 3 good friends, the girl I love (and I may have fucked that up to the point where its ""too late"" to fix things), and 100$ in the bank. 

I feel like such a garbage human. She barely asks for anything, and I can't even give her basic respect sometimes. Like last night she was worrying about me (rightly so after the suicide attempt) and all she asked from me was to know I was okay and to tell her goodnight. I didn't even do that. I just fucking fell asleep on her. Like wtf is wrong with me? I take her for granted so much. And I think I've pushed her away too much. I've put her through too much. I've fucked up so much, I feel so bad for treating her the way I did. I'm crying thinking about what I put her through. I don't deserve someone as good and amazing as her. 

It just sucks that the moment I'm really ready to change she is done with my shit. It sucks that I'm such a selfish asshole all I could do was burn down my relationships with my friends, family, and the love of my life. Wtf is wrong with me? I need so much help.

884,"**TL;DR** Looking for some possible advice of changing my perspective of life. 

So almost a year ago I made an intentional choice of attempting to cheat on my wife. I had made tinder and a couple of other dating profiles while deployed overseas which eventually I was caught as most people are and should be, so I'm not looking for any hate on that part cause I already know I conducted scum bag behavior and am paying the price for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Before this all went down though for a long while I had thought I wanted a different life not being married to the women that I was (mostly in part due to being married for having a kid out of wedlock so we were married young), and I always toyed with the idea of possibly getting divorced, and well like they say be careful what you wish for because you might just get it.  Fast forward to now and I'm miserable I miss my wife and kids more than anything, and everyday I just feel empty, I have long drives to work and most of my thoughts are filled with suicide during that time hoping a semi runs into me.

&amp;#x200B;

I constantly think about the best way to do it, if I should hang myself, suffocation with the car, shoot myself, what kind of note should I leave, should I text someone right before I do it so the authorities can discover my body before anyone else has to. The only thing that drives me not to is seeing my kids on my day off but the other 5 days a week I'm numb and devoid of any feeling. I don't work out anymore, I hardly shower, I have to really push myself to eat, my house is a complete mess because I just don't care anymore. my life just feels like an unbreakable cycle of work, sleep, weekend with the kids that in the end has no point other than the sake of going through the motions. I hate feeling this way, and I feel stuck this way. I no longer have goals or anything I feel worth striving for.

885,"Ok so first off I am an adult. I feel like absolute garbage because I just turned 20 years old and my mom an her shitty husband still have complete control over me. They pay for my college and I live with my mom taking care of my three younger siblings (ages 5 and 6yo twins). I make breakfast, pick them up from school, do hw with them force vegetables down their throats, put them to bed. My mom treats me like a worthless pos. Anything that I do a little wrong she passive aggressively points out like I'm scum. (""There is an empty granola bar box in the cabinet!! Are the kids sneaking food? Oh, they couldn't be. It's too high for them to reach. How could an empty box get in here if the kids couldn't reach?!1!?) She's always ""sick"" with something so that I'm the asshole if I want her help. I love the kids but they are spoiled rotten demons. She constantly undermines my authority with them when they act lovingly toward me because it makes her feel threatened. She was ""sick"" again and one of the kids was bugging her and she said something about how she could die (wtf) and the girl said 'then fuckup1456 could take care of us'. She went on a tirade on how I don't even have a job and am lazy and irresponsible and wouldn't be able to. This is at the dinner table, eating the fucking healthy, balanced dinner I made, in front of all three kids. Like I didn't even say shit, I was just eating my chicken. 

She will never apologize or admit fault. I've been trying to arrange a playdate for months and she will not text the number I've given her because she's 'always busy'.  I have no life because I always need to be home with the kids because she works from 5am to 6. Being an english teacher. She isn't payed for more than 8 hrs but she doesn't come home. The kids are in bed by 6:30( they are always awake at like 5:30am at the latest so it's necessary). She literally spends less than half an hour a day with them and complains about how stressful they are. She is always insulting me offhand and playing it off as a joke.

I need to leave. I love the kids but I can't take care of three kids. My hair is falling out, my skin turned fucking yellow and I don't know why. I'm a full time student. I recently quit my job to have more time with the kids and am relying on my mother financially for everything. Even if I got my shit food-service job back I wouldn't have any time to see the kids at all with all the hours I'd need to work to cover rent and tuition. My grades aren't stellar anyway. I have no time to decide what I want to do with my future. I just don't know what to do. I had to go to this store yesterday to pick up food and there was this bridge and I just stood there with my arms full of bananas and truly considered jumping off of it. I know that my mom has no obligation to pay for my school or let me live with her but I dropped my whole life to help these kids and I can't do it on my own. We live in a shit town in the middle of nowhere and to leave I'd need to have money and a job lined up and I don't have either.

887,"I[F,21] am extremely empathetic towards people and very emotional. I become emotionally invested in all my friends and honestly just want to make everyone happy. Obviously I am very aware that is impossible but now my feelings of making everyone happy are impacting on my relationship with my boyfriend [M,23] and my mental health. 
I have a friend[F,23] who is very emotionally taxing, she tried to take her life on a night when she asked me if I was able to go over and see her. I was shattered and drained that evening so I told her sorry but maybe another night. When I found out that she had overdosed that night, I felt tremendous guilt and like I had failed her as a friend. I haven't known her for long, just over a year, but she told me that she cannot talk to anyone else about her issues, even her family, and that I seem to be the only one she can open up to. This puts so much pressure on me. She can't afford a therapist but I am beginning to feel like I am being used as a free one.

This evening I had to tell her that our plans for a sleepover were cancelled. My reasoning was that she was making me more emotionally drained than I could handle, however I told her that I was just too tired and PMT to be around people. But because of the last time I now get such bad anxiety that she will make another attempt... How the hell do I stop feeling this guilt?? 

I buy her things to keep her happy like drinks, snacks and cook her dinner when I go over or when she comes over, but this is impacting me financially. I am a student and she works full time. Though because of my niceties it is almost expected I get her things. She has started to make an effort in getting me the odd drink here and there, however I feel this is months worth of effort on my part. 
My boyfriend is getting angry at me for being so spineless and not telling her how it makes me feel and that I constantly complain about it and do nothing, but it is so horrible knowing what she went through, but knowing I have to be honest with her about how it is badly affecting me....

I just don't know if anyone could advise me on how I could go about telling her I can no longer afford (both money and emotionally) to keep being her go to? I just want to have friends where it works both ways - me feeling I could go to them with a problem too.

I took a parent loan to help her with tuition. She was suppose to be be paying me half the electric bill but hasn't for a few months. She works 3 part time jobs (delivery driver and restaurant hostess ) and most weeks it doesn't add up to 40 hours. She bought a new car last year, a bright colored Honda Civic that was one of a kind at the time. She likes Lilly Pulitzer and sometimes doesn't hesitate to spend money there. She also has spendt money on an annual Disney pass.  When I ask for the money for the bill she doesn't have it but can buy more clothes. Today she went and bought a muffler for her car so it would be unique again and was talking about a spoiler. We argued about it and as she walked out the door I told her if she buys the spoiler she will have 30 days to move out. There are other issues going on and arguments end up being personal attacks. She brought a dog home last year without asking and usually doesn't ask if I will watch her (I don't like dogs and we have cats). 

Am I wrong to issue that ultimtam? Perhaps some other suggestions? She had talked about moving on her own a few months ago and all I thought of was she didn't make enough to live on her own and she would be coming to me for help with the bills many months.",12Sep2019,3
892,"My sister is in primary school and there's a boy in class who consistently targets her. There have been countless times where he physically hurts her, which mum has reported to the school yet they either haven't done anything or they can't do anything (taking him out of class would disrupt his learning or some shit like that I'm not really sure). Some of the things this kid has done includes pushing, throwing sand and cornering my sister.

The main incident was where for whatever reason after school, he bolted straight towards her. She freaked and put her foot out and kicked him a bit and in response, he punched her arm and said, ""If you ever fucking doing that again, I'll punch you."" It's a bit of a grey area because she did make the first move, however when both kids were asked (separately) if they hurt each other, my sister admitted that she did hurt him first, however the other kid lied and said he didn't punch her (I have a photo to prove otherwise). Mum went to the school and informed the teacher about it, and the teacher told her to email the photo I took. Nothing else has been done about the incident. 

According to my sister, there's another girl in class he bullies but I'm not sure what the circumstances are or if anything's been done about it.

896,"

I had two narcotic discrepancies over the past two years that scared me because I had no idea they were happening so I started to document every single narcotic I was giving and even had documentation for when I wasted and returned narcotics. I was called in to review a discrepancy that I had and showed them documentation that I had actually returned the medication. 

I find it frustrating that the computer system is messed up and that I have to do so much extra work to keep documents of all my narcotics when no other nurse has had issues like I have with these alleged discrepancies. I suspect the first discrepancies did not happen either but I wasn’t keeping records like I am now. 

My friends say I should make a legal case against the hospital. The issue I am afraid of is that we are changing to new medication machines that will not let me print out a record of my narcotic activity so if these alleged discrepancies occur I can not protect myself. 

The computer system basically picks up the fact I pulled a narcotic but is too incompetent to document that I returned it back to the medication machine so it basically looks like I pulled a medication and didn’t give it to the patient so it looks like I am stealing drugs. Three instances of this and an employee is fired. NO ONE keeps documents like I do because it hasn’t happened to them. I feel targeted. If I didn’t document like I do I would have been fired because they take this very seriously and all believe the system is correct (which it SHOULD be... I stared this binder because I feared going to work every single day thinking I am an idiot who doesn’t document my narcotics correctly because we all believe this computer system is correct). This is ridiculous. I shouldn’t have to go to work in fear of being fired over a computer system failure.

898,"I'm a quiet person who usually sits alone during lunch at my school. However, a few weeks ago, a boy started sitting next to me at lunch.

 At first, I was glad to have someone to talk  to, but he's even more socially awkward than I am. I've been trying to make conversation with him to be nice. For example, today I asked him about a video game he was telling me about the other day. He told me several times he didn't know what that was until he said he did know it??

He's often quite repetitive and a private person, I guess that's the best words to put it. He'll say bye to me numerous times, and since then, he's asked me my last name twice. Today, he asked me if I had a YouTube channel or social media. I feel like he's been looking my name online and finding other people's social medias.(I don't use my full name online)I'm pretty sure he has a crush on me too. :/

He told me how he loved spicy food and I have a lot of stir-fried spicy noodles at home (the really spicy kind) so I invited him to come over. He also liked spider-man and anime (I do too) so I was going to show him my collections. Fast foward a couple hours and we finished our noodles and we were going to watch some anime on my computer or something and my dad walks in and tells him he needs to leave. He's cool with it though because I said I had something to do and that I could walk him to his bus home. After I am done with that, my dad tells me that what I did was very wrong and that he is going to have to tell my mom and the whole time I was like ""why?"" I did not really break any rules. I know that I should have asked first but the my dad was looking and me with such a serious face I thought I fucking murdered the cat by accident.

My mom came home and told me to get downstairs immediately. I was ready to get chewed out for not asking before hand because she took my phone and stuff but then she says ""Never invite a filthy n\*\*\*\*r over ever again"". It sounded so stereotypical and I have never heard her say that word before. She kept on going on about how I apparently ""hate"" white people (ignoring how my best friend since 4th grade is *white*) and that I keep on trying to lower my social class. She also accuses me of always ""staring"" at black men at the grocery store, on the street, and stuff like that and even goes so far to say that I flirt with them. I cannot begin to unpack this accusation because the guys she accused me of staring at were not only three times my age at but I AM NOT REMOTELY ATTRACTED TO MEN, I HAVE HAD A GIRLFRIEND FOR HALF A YEAR. And to top the final cherry on the racism cake, she told me I was grounded this weekend and could not see my step-brother.

For some context; on july 22cd my step-brother was supposed to move back to China to go to high school there with his family but due to the whole hong kong protests they decided to move back to the US and live in New York which is very far away from where I am currently living. My step-brother means so much to me and it breaks my heart a little bit because the only way we can communicate daily now is by text. I really miss him despite the fact that I tease him constantly and even though he is not my real brother I will be by his side to the absolute end.

The fact that she is taking away this very special moment away from me just to punish me for something that I do not deserve to be punished for makes me so angry. How do I meet my step-brother? Any advice?

tldr; my mom fails to realize that using outdated stereotypes and generalizing a whole group of people will not stop me from making friends with them, so she grounds me, making me unable to see my step-brother who I only get to see twice a year because he lives far away. Any advice?",12Sep2019,1
901,"
I just started my position at a new location a few days ago. I've been doing this job for a year now, but this is my first time at this particular location and with new people too, as it changes every year. 

I'd already met one of my co workers before, and she seemed super nice when we first met. Now, I'm getting the impression that she thinks I don't know how to do my job properly. 

Coworker 1: Debby* (the one I've met before) 
Coworker 2: Dawn* (the supervisor for the centre, but not my direct boss) 
Client: people I do my job for, also not my boss, but they can tell me how they'd like the job done. 
*Not their real names

Debby loves to tell me I'm doing everything wrong whenever she sees me working. ""oh, if I were you I'd do this differently, maybe you should try this..."" It sounds nice, but it's not her place to tell me how to do it and my clients told me to do it this way. I tried to explain it to her that this is how the clients wanted it, and she says they can see everything we do and won't be happy if I don't do it her way. 

So I started to do it her way as she said. Then Dawn tells me to do something else, completely contradicting what Debby told me. 

I haven't said anything confrontational about this so far, because I don't want to make enemies with the people I'll be working with this whole year. However, their constant criticism is stressing me out and making me dread going to work. 

What are some things I can say to them that will let them know I don't appreciate what they're doing but they won't feel threatened by it? 
I really hate having conversations like that and I don't want them to dislike me. What do I do?",12Sep2019,2
902,"So before we start, no I am not making some joke or anything and I further more am not one of those people who says their “depressed” either, but let me just explain my points and I want to hear from you guys what you think.

Disclaimer: I know it can be an episodic thing, so I’d like to state how I’m 15, because I know puberty can be very toll taking on emotions sometimes. 

Anyways to start off, for the past I’d say half a year now I feel like my life has been dropping slowly. I used to feel really happy, but now I feel like nothing is near normal. I have a bunch of issues socially, so at school it is hard to talk to people, but that doesn’t mean I don’t have friends. I see them and talk to them everyday, but it isn’t like anything important to list really, except for one thing. They call my sense of humor bad recently, and I cant say it isn’t I make stupid repetitive jokes and say the same few phrases cause I’m trying to not be replaced by them or anything but I’m not helping, in fact I feel like a burden on them. In school I still am doing academically great, but I don’t even care about that, it’s easy to remember and it doesn’t even provide me with anything new recently. All I ever wanna do really is go home and sleep, but it seems like that is rare to happen unless it is night. Everyday I wake up I feel like shit whether it’s 12 am or 9 pm I go to sleep. I just sometimes wish I could sleep for a whole few days and ignore everyone and responsibilities, or like listen to music and draw my heart out and pretend nothing even matters. Not to sound desperate or anything, but my love life sucks, I’ve been friendzoned before, and I do blame it on myself. I’m too awkward and can barely hold a conversation, and sometimes I can say the wrong things, alongside the slightly unattractive looks. (No I’m not an incel.)  I spend most of my days going through the same cycle of school, jerking off, gaming, and sleeping. I don’t feel like I have any purpose living right now if I wanna be brutally honest. In fact I feel like I am not gonna make it anywhere in the world because I have too many dreams that are far from reality, like I wish I could be just some famous youtuber spending my life making cash and doing what I love, but I know that’s not even close to happening, in fact I know half the reddit community probably does too. To end it all off before I type too much, I’m way too paranoid about things, like I care about everything people say, I only like certain social media posts, only post certain types of photos, and I follow what everyone else thinks, because I’m paranoid enough to believe everyone hates me, in fact I assume my dad, grandma, and stepmom sometimes do because they wanna send me to etiquette school even though I have good etiquette. I don’t even know if my friends want me to be around or anything and I just am so lost right now in life. 

Should I talk to a professional or something?

Anyone can ask me whatever as well, I’m willing to answer you on any questions regarding any situation in my life.",12Sep2019,2
903,"Hello! I lived with my grandparents, uncle, and my uncle's girlfriend for awhile. (Around 7 years.) Living conditions were genuinely horrible and everyone in that environment was abusive. (I finally moved 3 months ago!)
My uncle is a serious psychopath. He constantly made up scenarios in his head, told lies about and manipulated people, and did drugs. (One time he accused me of helping his gf cheat. Another time he said I snuck out of the house at 3am. Among other things.) He also used to constantly physically abuse his girlfriend, he even has a charge for domestic abuse by strangulation.
His girlfriend is toxic too but not nearly on the same level. He constantly goes through her phone and breaks her things, he yells at her all the time, etc.
Him and his gf had a baby fairly recently, around 6 months ago. The baby is special needs, and while I do not believe that she's in immediate danger, I feel like over time this stuff could really mess her up. (As it did to me.)
I feel like she should not be with that family. I am scared because I don't want anyone to go through that. But because there isn't immediate danger, I feel like it won't be taken seriously. Should I contact CPS? Can I do so anonymously? And if so, then how?",12Sep2019,2

908,"&amp;#x200B;

My cousin's son is in high school. He is friends with the daughter of a known sex offender (this girl's mother). They're not necessarily ""close"" but have the same friend group. This sex offender had a well-publicized case in our local news, went to prison for a few years, and has been on parole for just about three months. 

My cousin told me that her son knows that his friends, both male and female, spend time at this sex offender's house hanging out with the offender's daughter. This is against her parole agreement (I believe) as her crimes were committed against minors...16-17 year old boys who were actually her students when she was a teacher. My cousin's son has not himself been there, and he has no knowledge of any sexual or romantic contact between the offender and any of her daughter's friends.

I would like to submit an anonymous tip, but I'm concerned for multiple reasons:

1. My cousin won't report it as she herself doesn't want to get involved, predominantly because she doesn't want her son to get involved--she fears it coming back to them. If this were to somehow get back to them through me, I would feel horrible. 
2. I cannot confirm the veracity of this, at all. This is all coming to me word-of-mouth. There's a chance it could just be a rumor running around the school. I don't want this to somehow legally hurt me if I'm submitting false information. I don't want to be charged with supplying false information or something. I don't have much respect for sex offenders but I also don't want to potentially hurt this woman if she is genuinely abiding by her parole conditions and trying to rebuild her life.

At the same time, I myself am a victim of sexual abuse and feel a duty to report this if it is true before she abuses someone else.

There is a way I can submit an anonymous tip directly through the sex offender registry (Utah). I am concerned that I will still be traceable through my IP address and that the police will trace me if they determine my information to be false. I also don't want them to trace me back to my cousin and her child.

I'm considering either submitting the tip online from my university's public computer (although I'll be logged in through my account) or sending an anonymous letter through snail mail with no return address. Which method would be better to protect myself and my cousin?

Thank you.",12Sep2019,2

915,"So I posted in r/vent earlier about how I messed up and I was angry at myself. And that I had asked someone who makes oufuts for me to make a bridesmaids dress because at the time I genuinely couldn't afford to buy the dress and the bride was cool with me getting it made, in a style that suited me. Now this person has screwed me over by giving me an outfit that looked like it belonged in a costume party.

That person was my mum. She usually makes some really good stuff but, this, this was so so awful. I'm taking what she gave me and I am spending basically the entirety of my bank account to get the dress professionally alerted by a bridal store. Hell altered is the wrong word, for $400 they are taking the monstrosity my mum gave me and making an entire new dress out of it in under a week, the wedding is next Thursday. 

I am so damn grateful I found somewhere that could help me on such short notice. But because the outfit my mum gave is going to be so drastically altered I'm terrified of her finding out and asking why I did it. She is my lift to where the bride and bridesmaids are getting ready, I know she'll notice, I know she'll ask, and I have no idea how to tell her that I hated the outfit and had it drastically altered to actually look like a god damn bridesmaid dress. How the hell do I tell her all this?

TL;DR couldn't afford to buy bridesmaid dress, asked mum to make one. She makes me look like a fat monk. Spending $400 to essentially get a new dress made out her one. Don't know how to tell her I'm upset, disappointed, miserable and stressed because of her.",12Sep2019,0

927,"I’m 19.

I’m in my second semester of college, and I’m gradually slipping.

Some background is that growing up, there was immense pressure to be academically perfect. I was very bookish and studied well so balancing grades and life was alright. My parents pushed me into medical school and for their sake, I tried for a few months but left when I realised my true passion was in another course.

Now in that other course, I’m studying my favourite subjects and learning things that fascinate me to my core. Not only that, but I’ve made lovely friends, joined interesting clubs. But everything is falling apart.

I’m missing quizzes because I’m struggling to stay up to date with the website notifications, I haven’t been to the majority classes in this one subject because a person in that class is making me severely uncomfortable. I missed two laboratory practicals and quizzes in another elective and in a recent group assignment, I not even half-assed it. At the beginning of said group assignment, things were alright. I reached out to the other members, sharing various emails, so we could all delegate topics/ask or answer questions, then we all branched out to do our own thing. What follows felt like the breaking point, the cherry on top.

Some more background information is that a lot happened throughout the first and second semester. A benign tumour I had removed in 2016 returned. I started receiving regular treatment for another very visible condition to conceal it as best as I can. I made an appointment with a counsellor after wavering between suicidal and depressive emotions for a few years. Not so bad, I can stay afloat. Then, my brother-in-law came on to me quite heavily, saying the most disgusting and grooming-like things. I told my sister and that messed up things for her between them. I had to move out and now my parents are paying two rents which is too expensive, one for her when I was staying with her and one for my new place. On top of that, she told me not to tell them why I wanted to move out so they were under the impression that it was to focus on studies. 

How all of those things made me feel is indescribable. It’s like I’m carrying a bag that gets heavier and heavier, whilst someone repeatedly punches me in the stomach. I constantly feel nauseous and I hate the thoughts of disappointing my parents. I’m already putting so much strain on them for medical bills and as an international student, my fees are crazy expensive. I got back into really bad habits of starving, binging and purging. Hurting myself, smoking, drinking. 

But I love the course I’m doing so I’m trying to pull myself together. I’m not one for focusing on the bad stuff that happens to me and I hate putting myself.

I looked back on the group discussion forum after the due date to realise that I had misunderstood various parts of the assignment but because it was beyond the due date, the rest of the group submitted their parts alone. Which I understand! Turns out, there were some other things I had to do which I did not realise. I read the assignment instructions over and over so it really was me misinterpreting some of the instructions. The assignment, by the way, was about drugs and pop culture.

Even though it was past the due date, I still wanted to post an apology and something resembling a final piece on my part. I knew my lack of effort wouldn’t take away from other people’s grades but even still, I figured it would be a good thing to do.
 I said sorry for my lack of participation, I said that I’d understand if it wasn’t included in the end. It was mostly me apologising, owning up to my irresponsibility and mentioning that I hoped someone would email me given that we had corresponding before. I know when I make mistakes so I happily called myself out on it. I thought that what I said wouldn’t even be responded to, it was just an apology and a re-worded version of my previous submissions for the assignments.

928,"My wife (43f) and I (40m) recently had a baby (he's almost 4 months old), and when we go anywhere people do the usual how old is he, and tell us what a blessing they are and how quickly they grow up, etc. 

The issue that I have is random people will touch him. It doesn't bother us as much when they touch his feet, but we really don't want people touching his hands or face. 

He's a baby, he puts his hands in his mouth and you're touching his hands, I have no clue where your hands have been or what else you have touched. 

I don't want strangers touching him in general, add in that cold and flu season is coming and I really don't want people touching him. 

What's a polite way of asking people to keep their hands to themselves?",12Sep2019,2

932," Huge rant describing his usual behavior:  

&amp;#x200B;

 My father is emotionally abusive, has been physically abusive with my mom in the past.  He is obviously not right in the head but I'm unsure if he is neurotic or fills in another category. I'm also kinda neurotic but when i get periods of not having to deal with him and the constant stress his presence causes i get much better.   


&amp;#x200B;

*   He was physically and emotionally abused by his father since he was a small child and left home at 20 to travel to our country. When he was a little child a ladder fell on him and hit him in the head, causing him to become mute for a while. I don't know how young he was nor how long it lasted but it was definitely more than a few days.   


&amp;#x200B;

*   He is constantly complaining and cursing At least a few times every five minutes, all day long. He complains for my hair (says  its disheveled when im just curly and have always been, its the same discussion every time) for my shoes (if i put on new sneakers he says i shouldn't because ill fuck them up , if i use older shoes,says i look like a beggar/dirty as fuck/random insult, if i try a different kind of shoes he comes up with different hurtful ""jokes""/comparisons for what i look like)  for my clothes (says they are dirty when they are not/ im crazy for using a sweater with this weather/ if i put on a hoodie i look like a criminal/i put on a skirt i look like a whore. Says my sibling smells bad when they don't.Etc  


&amp;#x200B;

* Says i never cook and its a disgrace there are three women at home and none cook, when in fact we  all cook for ourselves because everyday, any time we make food for him as he asks he berates is and says its disgusting even if he afterwards eats it all behind our backs. 
* If there is nothing he can complain about us, he complainsabout other people or objects. Curses  at the red light everytime,  curses because he has to spend more than 2 minutes looking for a parking spot everyday, a d always says "" the same fucking shit everyday "" which is kind of ironic. 

&amp;#x200B;

*  He is over controlling. If i make food and start eating it before cleaning the pan he starts yelling and asking if I'm going to leave it dirty and why do i always make a fucking mess. He stands next to me when i cook to complain because I'm not using enough oil to fry an egg when he just saw me pour a bunch of oil on the pan.
*  His hobby is looking at tinder and is more or less popular between women his age but as he swipes he berates them "" shes so fucking ugly, fucking cow, fucking midget, fucking insert racist slur"".  His conversations  dont get very far because after just a couple messages exchanged he takes the chance to complain about how we make his life hell, how we only talk to him for money WHICH IS A HUGE LIE, or to talk shit about my mom. 
*   He constantly calls my siblings and i useless, a shame, a burden, idiots, pigs, etc.  He contradicts himself, asks and complains for you to do x, Next time he will complain because you did x. He demands i do laundry everyday even if there is only two shirts and a pair of pants. I work an study and most of the time i leave home at 6am and get there at 10pm but he acts as if i dont nothing and only yells because i left a tupperware on the sink but didn clean it immediately.  Like there cant be anything on the sink for more than 10 min because hell start yelling about how the sink is full of shit when there is literally a tupperware and a fork or something similar.    


He contradicts himself:  


*  He insults my older sister for being fat and sedentary and insults me for doing diets and exercising at the gym (says its for whores, fags and  Good for nothings) . 
* If he buys groceries and we dont eat them fast enough he complains about how we let food rot and says he wint buy more and if we finish it fast he complains about how we are ravenous and nothing lasts and he wont buy more.    

*  There are moments when hes calm and i can have bits of conversation here and there but he also seems incredibly... Dumb? I don't know how to explain it, he is an entrepreneur and has always been, setting small and medium business here and there, and is handy and creative and likes yardwork, so he is not enterely stupid. It seems he can't hold complex conversation most of the time, or understand the complex issues in their entire depth.  Reminds me a lot of D. Trump, maybe slightly less moronic  but just so you get an idea.     

* Most of the things he complains about or the discussions we have are recurring, like i have been telling you, he repeats constantly and has done  for 20+ years. Its like fucking sysyphus.  

*  If i make a mistake like dropping something he yells at me, if he drops something somehow it is my fault, 
* He pushes me to get me out of the way.  

* When i have been sick and in pain he humiliates me while watching me contort in pain.  
* He might have just yelled and insulted me and five minutes later he shouts and asks me to come see whatever he's seeing on tv that excites him ( a baby lamb or whatever)  switches as  if nothing has happened.
*  A psychologist once told us he had multiple personality but im not sure of the validity of that diagnosis. 
*  A mri scan showed he had ""irritative cores"" in the brain, my sister has parietal lobe epilepsy and I think he does too, although they dont experience seizures.   

*   He is very cheap despite having a decent income. For example, When i was in highschool (2015) he would sent me off everyday with the equivalent to 0.50 cents of a dollar, which is still very little in my country , that was supposed to cover my transport but only the going, not the coming. He knew it wasnt enough to eat or come back.  
He is not poor,every year he flies to his home country in europe and spends a few months there without the need to work.  
*  He also hates my actual partner despite not knowing him at all. I help him set his tinder everytime he forgets or gets confused by his phone but i (have to hide and be careful everytime i go for a walk or out with my partner because if he ever sees us he makes a hug and stressful deal out of it. I  have never been able to introduce a partner to him because of how he acts, I also cant be seen hanging out with male friends (i get called a whore) and sometimes even female friends. Everybody has something wrong.So yeah, he just creates weird ideas in his head about how wrong is everything and everybody and projects them onto the world even if contrary to evidence and facts. It is very frustrating.  

*   My extended family has never believed us because he acts normal in front of them, like yeah they realize he is very closed off to some things, or can be very cheap, but he still really tones it down so no one believes the abuse and only blames us for how damaged and dysfunctional my siblings and i are.   

* I remember being pre kinder age and hiding when i heard him arriving home because he scared me the fuck off. He also ""playfully"" abused me physically when i was a kid.  Have you ever, maybe as a kid, hugged too hard or squeezed a baby animal just because you could? Like you were petting a cat but then pulled its tail or held it down still knowing it would hurt it just because it gave you a rush and you could get away with it? It felt he was doing that to me.    


 I do have plans of leaving asap when im done with college. Life with him is hell, my siblings and i all suffer from depression and anxiety, my little sister has TOC , I suffer from Dermatillomania/skin picking disorder, my jaw is so tight i have tooth decay/bruxism, night terrors are common and i often have nightmares with him.   


   TL;DR. My father is abusive , dumb, a control freak, kinda delusional, mean, has weird behaviours and is very negative and id like to know in which category of mental or personality disorders he might fall just so i can get some guidance or clarity about it.",12Sep2019,1
933,"hey I need your help here because right now I'm lost and feel terrible, before I go in to what happened I just want everyone to know what I did was wrong and I hate myself for it, I can't stop thinking about it. I'm 21/m I went drinking with my friend who is a  19/f. she's a lesbian and has a girlfriend.  lets take it back to two weeks prior, me, her and her female friend  went clubbing.  I  become completely black out drunk, (she was drunk too) at this time I never kissed a girl,  she knew this of me for years, well we ended up kissing. I only remembered  little flashbacks kissing with tongue, kissing her cheeks, I was grabbing her ass and  her laughing. She was also  kissing her female friend who she was in a sexual relationship in the past.  the next day I couldn't remember how things lead to the act of us kissing I thought I forced myself on her I felt terrible for what I did, the next day I apologised but  she told me and it turns we was out the club and i had my hand around her, in that moment she asked  ""Callumjohn do you want your first kiss"" i can't remember saying yes or no to this but obviously I did because she wouldn't of done it.
So now recently this time it was just me and her clubbing  throughout the night we was talking about different topics, just having a a good time and laughing. We had food and drinks in this restaurant, this is all we planned to do but we was having so much fun, both of us didn't want it to end so we had the idea to pay half for a room in a hotel and going clubbing, we went to two clubs,  by the time we got to the first club, we was both very intoxicated, I admit she drinks more than me, I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinking alcohol,  I know for a fact I was more wasted. In the first club we kept on drinking and talking, we had cool pictures in the Photo Booth, so we started doing funny poses in the booth, I ended up giving her a kiss on the cheek but suddenly  I ended up kissing her on the lips couple of times, I don't know why I did it, but part of me things i thought it was okay due to last time, i know it's wrong. i was doing the same exact things we did last time, but i think she was okay with it before due to it being my first. the second club we went to, nothing bad happened we just talked and danced till the club closed,  she didn't end up staying in the hotel with me, I got a taxi to the hotel room and she got one to her house. The next day I got told  by our mutual friend, that she texted her and asked for her advice about it, the mutual friend told me I made her really uncomfortable,  people in the club was coming up to her and asking her if she was okay with me, she was so uncomfortable   she didn't want to stay in the hotel with me.  she couldn't tell me this  herself because she knows I'd be upset with myself, she knows how it would make me feel I feel terrible and hate myself.  I apologised to her, she said ""I'm not mad or upset, I think it was just a case of too much alcohol and things just went a little far, nothing has changed, nothing will be different and awkward between us, just so you know all in all I still had a really good night""
so by that message it looks like I'm forgiven but I question do I deserve forgiveness? would you forgive me?  please guys tell me am I thinking too much ? or I'm not and I don't deserve her friendship. any advice would be appreciated.

936,"I have a stick and poke tattoo on my shoulder that I've done in my high-school. It is not too big, 2x2 cm but it is quite dark. It just looks horrible, like I was in prison. I hate to wear tank tops, I hate question what is this, I am so tired of explaining. Even if I dress up, I can't feel feminine if I can see that tattoo. I really want to cover it up, but everything that I tried to draw or sketch with pen over that tattoo looked too big or too dark. I want it feminine and minimal as possible, and I can't achieve it for ages. I went to few tattoo studios but I was offered something huge or something that wouldn't fit on that body part.

937,"I had everything I needed. I was showered with love. I was not spoiled with materialistic possessions. My childhood was as perfect as it could have ever been. I had good friends, fun classmates and no troubles whatsoever. And despite all of that, I have been failing miserably for the past 5 years. And after the last 3 years of utter complete failure, I can't shake the guilt of failing while having such supporting parents whom provided a lovely environment and really gave me the perfect opportunity for a happy life. And yet I failed.

I'm at my wits end. Failed university 3 years in a row. 3 years, with 3 different reasons, with core culprit me myself and I. No excuses, first year I had tasted the delicious fruit of freedom. Failure was all my fault, nothing else needs to be said. I change courses, thought I would like this better, I was wrong. However it shouldn't have any impact on if I like it or not. I should just pass and change again with the credits I could get. But nothing still, I fail totally again, however this time self inflicted anxiety and depression (I lied to my parents that i passed 1st semesters, which i didn't and put immense pressure on myself) played a grand role. Mental health was down to an equivalent of 1hp. I was suicidal and fucked up my physique, by not eating, not exercising and not taking hygienic care because I just didn't care anymore. I really don't blame myself for failing the 2nd semester( in the 2nd attempt of another course's first year) in the mental and physical state I was in. Nor did my parents. After failing a whole year it really took all the way to start of next semester for me to spill the beans. And my parents weren't mad, definitely disappointed (though they didn't want to say it) and were just glad I told them. 

Then the year I would set it all right, the year of me finally changing and being a full fledged grownup. I get back and the start of semester went great, had a healthy balance between studying and free time. All until I became sick and skipped a day. And suddenly my world fell apart. I slipped back in depression hell. ""What was the point of waking up early, i can just learn these things myself"" were my thoughts. And quickly as a time bomb ticking, I fell behind and failed first semester for the 3rd time. However I was optimistic enough to get through second semester. (This time I was honest in failing everything, so no inflicted pressure I guess). Again second semester starts great, goes well, until I slip into my depression habit and my life just falls apart. Failed 2nd semester. I studied but didn't have enough time to fix it during summer retake exams. And thus I failed my full 3rd year of uni. 

That was my last chance, not because my parents won't support me, but because I lost all my student credits. Can't enroll until I get them back. The only way to get them back is to wait, in my case I'd have to wait 4-5 years. 

I don't blame anyone else except for myself. I have really hit rock bottom. I have buried myself so far down and there's no way out. I'm depressed yet surprisingly I do have an ""optimistic"" view if you will on the future. However the biggest thing on my mind is how much of a burden I must be to my parents. Money doesn't just grow for the trees for us. If my father stops working, we're done for. I feel so so incredibly guilty for basically being a waste of money and my mind can't take it. I have to break it to them tomorrow that I failed and won't be able to enroll anymore. I can't stand it, I can't break their heart again. If I hear my father sighs in a way he only does when he's really worried I will burst into tears and hate myself even more. The only good thing about my situation currently is that I don't have any suicidal thoughts. I am though constantly contemplating running away, however I am too burdened by guilt to even contemplate it. 

(I typed this in a hurry and as a way of venting, and I'm no native English speaker so sorry for any mistakes)

tl;dr: I failed uni 3 times in a row and am feeling (rightfully so) extremely guilty to the point of it being my only thoughts. Also if you have any advice how to break it to my parents that I failed my last chance, please write anything down you think might help me!

&amp;#x200B;

So any advice is welcome but I do want to add that it did already quite help to collect my thoughts after typing this.",12Sep2019,3

942,"So, I'm a freshman and so is everyone I sit with at lunch. They're what people would call the ""anime kids"" ""the gays"" etc. You know, weird kids but not THAT weird? I fit in with them pretty well, we all get along, whatever. I've been in school for a few weeks now and everyday we'd see this person walk by.

My friend (we'll call Andrea) would compliment her everyday, like, i like your bag or your hair is nice. Today she sat with us. She told us she was a trans female, we didn't have a problem with her. She was pretty quiet most of the time.

She made a joke about how she hangs with freshmen because ""the upperclassmen are all busy being fuckboys."" We laughed and I realized she wasn't a sophomore. That put me off, since I don't tend to get along with people older than me if that's understandable? I have a soph friend and that's it.

Also, she spoke in this ""shy anime girl"" kind of voice. Like fake stuttering, nervous giggling, etc. That also put me off.

But anyways lunch ends and she asks for our information. i give her my insta, and she messages me after school.

At first it was normal, we exchange snaps. Then after about 15 messages she sends:  
""luv u &lt;3""

""i mean what""

This was really creepy to me. Keep in mind at lunch she spoke about 3 sentences. I'd spoken to her, for, around 15 minutes max? And she's a junior (maybe even senior, didn't specify)?

I'm sure it's a friend thing, i tell my friends i love them too, but how do i deal with her being too clingy? I don't know if it's internalized transphobia being creeped out by her but, I am. And I regret giving her my information so quick, I just didn't want to say no because I didn't really have a reason to not say yes.

at this point i just wanna ignore her but now she has permission to sit with us, so she will. everyday. i'm thinking about moving to this other group but i literally know just one of them slightly so it'd be awkward. Sorry if this seems paranoid but I reallyyyy regret speaking to her.

So yeah. And to clarify I don't really want to pursue a friendship either, like i said, the vibes i get are weird. maybe it's me being dramatic, sorry if so.",12Sep2019,1

948,So to give some backstory I am 13 and for most of my life I thought that I was an only child until last year when my mom broke it to me that my dad had had 2 daughters in the 1980s (from different wives) I didn't really think about it too much until I went to see my dad last year and asked him about it. He said that he hasn't had any contact with them in years and only told me base information like their names. I just got too curious and so when he was in the shower I went into his phone and got one of their phone numbers (I know that that is violating his privacy and I shouldn't have done it). I have this number now in my phone for my half sister and as much as I want to meet and talk to her I also don't know what I would say or if I should even call at all. One more piece I should add is that my dad has told me that he doesn't want us to have any interaction. What should I do.,12Sep2019,2
950,So I'm 14 years old and I'm a super shy. So in one of my classes there is this girl who has been saying hi to me a lot. And just recently talked me a lot and she is super nice and cute but I'm very shy and have a hard time making friends. I like her a lot and I need some advice on the steps I should take to make her like me. I think she already does because she just look at me smiled and now she is super nice to me and likes to talk to me. Also please remember that I'm only 14 and only a freshman in highschool.,12Sep2019,1
951,"Hi, everyone. 

I’m in a bit of an emotional predicament here. I’m a recent college grad who’s been working as an assistant for the university I attend for the last year and a half. I graduated May 2019.

This is a student worker position, but I’ve been able to work under a contract ever since I graduated.

My boss is the Marketing Director and I believe we’ve had a very good working relationship. I’ve been able to work part time at my university and had a summer internship on the side as well. 

Things had been going well. My summer internship had been extended and I was able to continue to work at the university. 

I’m aware that because this is a student position and I’m under a contract, I should be looking for a full time job. However, since my internship had been extended, I wasn’t actively looking for anything full time. 

My boss has been very supportive of my internship and has occasionally asked if I’ve considered applying to full time positions. Since things have been going really well at my internship, I have been hoping to receive a full time offer at the end. 

This is the answer I’ve always given my boss. If I didn’t receive an offer, of course I would apply to a full time jobs. 

Three weeks ago, the university held a job fair for student positions across campus. My boss held a booth at the job fair for other positions available within our department. When I told her I would accompany her, she was caught off guard, reacted strangely, and said it was unnecessary.

I didn’t think much of it until a week later when a coworker found a copy of a cover letter  for an assistant addressed to my boss. The letter explained they had met at the job fair and she was interested in applying for my position.

I was shocked, embarrassed, and incredibly hurt. 

A week ago, my boss casually mentioned that she hoped to hire somebody else so that I may train her until I found a full time job. By Friday, she told me she had already hired someone and she starts next Tuesday. 

I understand that my boss is very busy and needs someone at the office at least a few hours everyday. But, why did she try to keep things hidden from me? I would’ve understood. 

I’m also hurt because her last assistant was allowed to stay on the job at least a year after she graduated. I never met her, so maybe she just liked her better than me?

To make matters even more hurtful, I made sure to actively advertise the job fair to our students and make a flyer that showcases why working for our department was fun and exciting.

I know I’ve been a good assistant and completed all my tasks despite the amount of hours I work. I’ve always seen my boss as a friend and mentor, so ever since I found out about this, I’ve been feeling really low and questioning whether or not I failed in my position somehow.

It feels like I’m being pushed out of a job, even though I can technically still stay. As though, she really just wants me to leave. 

I want to be angry, but I mostly feel sad and depressed. Two weeks ago (before she told me but after she advertised the job) she let me know of a full time job available with her friend. Last week, she let me know of another.

I’ve interviewed for one of the jobs and it went very smoothly. They told me my boss spoke very highly of me, which I appreciate, but also confuses me even more.  After all, my internship hasn’t ended and I expressed my plan to job search after it did. 

Things have been normal around the office. In fact, I’ve tried to be extra cheerful, but when I get home all I feel is the need to cry. 

My question is this: Am I wrong to feel this way? Why do I feel like I’ve been betrayed?

I don’t think my boss dislikes me and maybe she just needs extra help, but why not talk to me first and let me know that she planned to hire my replacement? Why did she try to hide it? 

I want to quit, but mostly because I don’t want to be bitter towards a job that provided me good opportunities. And honestly, acting like I’m not hurt is kind of messing with my mental health. Before this whole thing, I thought of my boss as someone larger than life. And I think that’s why it hurts to know she went through the hassle of hiding something that directly affects me. 

Also, I looked up my replacement on LinkedIn and it says she was hired in August. It looks like my boss has been planning to hire my replacement for a while now. 

Sorry, if this is too long for reddit, too emotional, or just plain ridiculous.",12Sep2019,2

953,My car was hit while I was in my workplace today. I didnf even notice until I got home bc I was in such a rush to go home and take a nap (long day).

Aside from PRAYING my work camera caught it... what else can I do to try to track this jerk off,12Sep2019,2
955,"Me and one of my friends are both in high school (I'm a junior, he's a sophomore) and we both have been sort of starting a band together. I play drums and he sings/plays piano. Although our jam sessions and rehearsals go well, I really don't enjoy it. He only wants to play blues songs, but I want to play more heavy rock and metal. He never agrees with any songs I want cover together unless it's like billy joel or something. Idk what to do, he's super nice to me and has a great personality, but I know he would be very upset if I told him that I want to break away, especially since we were already having trouble finding a guitar and bass player. I don't know what to do.",12Sep2019,1
956,"hello fellow reddit readers. so within the last month my life has turned upside fucking down and i feel like im walking through hell. My boyfriend just recently moved to China for college and im stuck in the lovely hell hole state of Virginia. His college just recently started up and we’ve been talking less and less. The people i know in real like keep saying things like “its not going to work out” “break up with him its not worth it” I am completely head over heels for this boy. i love him and i miss him. Its almost been a month and im still crying myself to sleep over the fact that hes thousands of miles away.

any ideas on how to cope with this/ brush off the toxic fuckers?",12Sep2019,0

959,"Hello! I know this sounds absolutely bonkers, but I'm 20/F and have always had a desire to drink another's blood as part of a bonding type thing. I'm not superstitious or anything, and it's not a fetish. 

I just learned 2 weeks ago that my 19/M friend from college ""[has] an obsession with vampires and for some reason [would] rather be the one being the blood bank."" He doesn't have any diseases and has provided recent documents proving so, and I'm fully willing to follow through, but it keeps passing my mind, what if he thinks he wants it but doesn't?

I am afraid that if he actually doesn't want it, and realizes it too late, then I'll be in the awkward situation of him having this mental image of me that he is no longer interested in, but afraid of.

What do I do?",12Sep2019,0
