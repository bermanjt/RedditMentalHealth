0," I am in hot shit with my university's conduct office. I am pretty confident that I am going to get a 6 month suspension due to a second drug (marijuana) violation as an on campus student. I wanted to know if it was possible to dropout before the sanction is issued to avoid anything going on record and affecting my future application to another college. I suppose if that does not work I also would like to know what my odds of being accepted into another university. 

Sidenote: 

I definitely cant't go home, I am from a Nigerian house hold so I'm definitely living in exile from this point on. 

I am not sure what I'm going to do, so far i figured  I'm going to need to get a better job (currently part time at Ross, I'll try looking for a bar-tending gig or something of the sort), and a place to live. 

My life has definitely hit a low patch and I am not sure what to do next.",03Apr2019,0
1,"Best friend of 5+ years:

2,"Some time ago, I saw a glimpse of my classmate's forearm; it was full of fresh-looking cuts. I thought it was just from cats when I saw it, but decided to ask him what happened to his arm. He just pulled his sleeve down and did the ""shush"" gesture. I haven't asked him again about it, but I'm kind of worried about him now. We're not close. We've only talked maybe five times for the whole four years we've been classmates. He has a lot of friends, and I see him go out and have fun and party (through other classmates' and his own instagram stories). I don't know if they know about it.

6,"So I have a teacher that everyone in the school loves. I thought he was not bad, and he always made it seem like he liked and respected me, but lately he’s been kind of mean. He would call me out in class and kind of make fun of me, or when I’d make a comment or an opinion he’d butt heads with me on it and I don’t even wanna talk in class anymore. I told him where I wanted to go to college and he undermined it because it’s in an area where he doesn’t like the weather. One time I mentioned something he was doing reminded me of something else in my life and he got really offended. It wasn’t even offensive it was just a comment of correlation and the fact he got upset by it was hurtful to me because it was something important to me. I also tried to take a creative risk on a project and I thought he was on board,  but then I heard he was complaining about me and my project to another class and assumed that it was going badly even though it was going really well.

8,"Post is a bit long, but the title sums up the gist. Going into the full story though:

ADHD and anxiety disorders both runs in my family, unfortunately I suffer from both. Mostly it's because the latter, I overthink everything I do. Not just to the point I feel paralyzed and pathetic about everything I do, but I've even made myself seriously ill on multiple occasions from overthinking.

Along with those aspects, I also suffer from depression - which I know results in a mixture of personal issues both myself and my loved ones face, along with my anxiety fueled overthinking and my fear of failure.

For a long time I've neglected to seek professional help, mostly because of the issues my loved ones face and thinking in comparison my own issues and fears don't matter - I'm just being pathetic. But recently I've been looking into professional help - I've started seeing a therapist provided by school, and now am working on getting insurance to see one outside of school as well.

I'm at wits end, all I do is drive myself insane. I'm tired of being my own punching bag - picking apart every decision I make or the failures I have experienced. But I don't know how to stop dragging myself down.

I've tried some anxiety medication before my mom has for herself (with her permission), to an extent it's helped. Although I've used it on a few occasions, I'm extremely wary of starting medication I'm not prescribed for yet. I'm also wary in general about immediately turning to medication to solve my problems, as I've had bad experiences with ADHD medication and see how badly reliance on medication has effected several family members of my own.

I'm willing to resort to medication if it's the last and only thing that CAN help me stop bombarding myself - my anxiety and depression has not only had a massive negative effect on my schoolwork and overall energy, but has also resulted in pushing away any and every person who does care about me. I can't, and refuse to live my life paralyzed and in fear anymore!

But like I said, medication is my last resort. Does anyone have any other suggestions which can possibly help?

11,"I’m a college student at my local college and I’m failing my math class. There is absolutely no way I can bring this grade up, so I’m going to drop the class so it won’t effect my GPA. My original life plan was to graduate from CC with an associates in general studies in the spring and then go to a university in the fall and get my bachelors. Well, as you can probably guess, my plan is screwed up now as I won’t be able to graduate from CC. Instead, I’m debating on whether to just transfer the credits I do have to a university and retaking the class at the university.

I’m also beginning to realize that I cannot afford university and if I do decide to attend, it is likely I will be in debt the rest of my life. I guess my question is, should I continue my education or end it? Im afraid that if I don’t get a college degree, I will not be successful in life and will be working in fast-food the rest of my life. I’m completely distraught right now.

13,"So I'm 25 turning 26 in July. I've just learned a few things like

-How to strategically build towards wealth. 

-How to properly exercise my body for longterm health. 

-How to address past traumas and move on.

-Stop doing things that hurt my present/future

-Love is the main thing. Nothing will make you happy unless you love yourself and love others first.

To name a few. 


Issue is...I feel like 25 is kinda late to realize these things and 26 is kinda late to develop in them. I know that there's never a better time than now. I just feel like I missed out on my late teens and early 20's by being so depressed.

18,"I’m a 16 year old student who has spent most of my life feeling incomplete. A lot of the time, depressed. 

It wasn’t until November of 2017 that I started dating my first and only serious girlfriend. She was a childhood friend of mine that I had known since kindergarten. We became better friends freshman year and became even closer during the first quarter of sophomore year. Then we started dating since we both knew we had crushes on each other.

The rest of that school year was like no other. I fell in love with this girl. I still am in love with her. Never have I met someone who understood and admired me so well, and never had I met someone who I admired and understood so well. We had all of the same interests, similar morals and principles, life philosophies. We both appreciated the same things from one another. We fell fuckin head over heels for each other. We told one another how much we wanted to spend our lives together. Fantasized about what we wanted to do together for the rest of our days.

But then... junior year, life started getting down on her. Her parents force her to prepare for college even though she doesn’t want to go. Her parents force her to take tough classes that she can’t keep up with. They force her to get a job regardless of the fact that she is busy with being in a band, doing dogsledding, and massive amounts of school work all week. (Her and I started a band together and also she does legitimate dogsledding. It’s badass. Both music and dogsledding are passions of hers, so she never wants to give them up)

Her mental state starts dwindling. She starts to be unhappy. 

Unhappy. Something neither of us ever were since we started being together. I do my best to always try to make her happy, to be there, to spend time with her when she’s available. Literally anything. Anything that could help her vent her feelings or that I could assist with. Anything.

She starts treating me worse. We kiss less, we don’t hang out as much. She doesn’t compliment me or flirt like she used to. She doesn’t initiate conversation. She doesn’t offer to spend time together ever. The only times we then see each other are when we are around other friends. 

I start to worry more and more over time, becoming concerned she doesn’t love me anymore. I become paranoid. She actively cancels on me just to stay at home alone or hang out with other guy friends of hers. 

I start to become jealous and nervous. That she doesn’t love me anymore.

Of course all of this was over the course of like three months. 

Then, in January, after I have another emotional breakdown worrying that she doesn’t love me anymore, she breaks up with me.

For the next five days, she doesn’t respond to any of my texts. She just dropped me, no negotiation. Nothing. It’s. Over. 

The one time my life felt like it was a happy thing to have... it was over. 

As you know, it’s March now, and I still haven’t been able to stop myself from bothering her. I just want to try again. I just want to show her that I’ve learned my mistakes. That it’s worth trying again. 

I’ve gone through stages of begging her to come back, and of resentment, where I have nothing but anger left.

I have to see her every day. And because we’re in a band together that we both were cofounders of and we both have a passion for music and want to do it for a living, we have to communicate and collaborate weekly.

I still have feelings for her. More now than I think I ever have, and I didn’t think that was possible.

Right now, I’m in a stage where I think I’m considering suicide. 

We never had any fights. Only the breakup. After the breakup, she only allowed me to talk to her about our relationship for limited amounts of time (the longest being 20 minutes). She’s never given me a chance to sit down with her and just shoot the shit.

Most of the time, and currently right now, she just ignores me. As if nothing we had together mattered or meant anything. 

I can’t take it.

I wanted to spend my life with her. 

I have never met someone that I’ve always wanted to be around and never be able to get sick of other than her. I know for a fact that she is the one for me. I know it sounds stupid but I know she’s the one.

What I want to know is if I’m being one of those psycho exes that get posted on all kinds of subreddits that people make fun of all the time. Am I just a stupid kid? Or should I keep fighting for the one person who has ever made me happy? ",03Apr2019,1

20,"So three of us live in a house together that we are renting. There is my girlfriend Amber, Liz (all names changed), and myself.

We generally try to split household responsibilities but I find I'm often the one stuck doing some of the things regularly. Our first year living together, Amber was a bit messy and our (different at the time) roommate and I got stuck cleaning. Once our previous roomie moved and Liz moved in, Amber got much better about cleaning up after herself. Somehow, Amber would make catastrophic messes in the kitchen when cooking and would never clean up afterwards with the exception of doing her dishes. But like I said, she turned it around and got a lot better about it.

Moving forward, it turns out Liz is now the messy one. We didn't notice it much the first few months, except for with the dishes. She was used to always using dishwashers her whole life, but we don't use the one at our house. We have a nice drying rack and don't have the need for the dishwasher. Liz said she would adapt. She cleans up all her dishes, but unfortunately, not well. I often have to rewash them. In the beginning, I honestly thought it was just my OCD causing me to nitpick. But then Amber started noticing too. We never said anything since it wasn't every dish and we wanted things to just go smoothly since we are all on a super friendly basis.

Over time, Liz started getting more careless with her messes. Tons of crumbs and other food pieces seem to end up on the floor and all over the counters/stove literally every time after she's in the kitchen. Furthermore, she eats a lot of cereal. She often eats on the couch in the living room (we eat in the living room often) so there's frequently a few pieces of cereal between the kitchen and the living room. And there are often chip and popcorn crumbs all over the couch.

Fast forward to now, it's still a consistent issue. On top of that, I'm the only one who consistently cleans the floors - both the carpet (everywhere is carpeted except the kitchen) and the kitchen floor. Amber despises vacuuming with a passion while I love vacuuming (I know, I'm weird). Liz is indifferent. It's gotten to the point where I have to vacuum if I expect to have clean floors and I also have to scrub the kitchen floors.

Part of our agreement when moving in together was that I would handle maintaining the yard since both of them hate yard work. I knocked off a small amount from my share of the rent to compensate for my added labor. I'm increasingly frustrated with doing more than everyone. Amber is pulling her own weight more and more but I want to get her on board with cleaning the floors and bathrooms too.

Amber and I have agreed we need to talk to Liz and we've talked about doing it for the past few weeks. And it's finally come to a head. I left a note on our white board on our refrigerator saying that we need to have a family meeting to talk about some issues and for everyone to think of any issues they have. I tried to word it as best as I could so it wouldn't sound too ominous. Liz is a bit nervous but I'm trying to act cool so she doesn't freak out since these aren't ""end of the world"" issues. They are just things that need to change.

So my question here is: When we all sit to talk, how do I address these issues without sounding like I'm attacking Amber and Liz? It's mostly Liz I'm worried about since most of the issues are with her but both of them can be thoughtless (not cleaning the lint screen on the dryer, putting off taking out the trash/recycling, cleaning the downstairs shared bathroom that guests use, etc). We are about to renew our lease for another year together, so we don't want to go into this year harboring any resentment. 

Thank you in advance. ",03Apr2019,1
21,"I have a bit of a problem here and need help determining if it’s best I leave this company. 

To make it short and sweet: I work in Sales as a support/assistant. I support two regional sales managers (sales reps). I’ve been here for almost half a year and the company itself is relatively new and it’s small. My job is to free up 40% of the sales reps time so they can go get new business. I quote, I process orders, easy enough. 

Here’s the problem. My work won’t hire anyone even though we’re understaffed in several departments because of the “budget”. That includes sales, so I’m constantly covering for sales reps and doing their job. Now, from being close with someone in sales, I’ve come to learn that their base pay is 60k. Commission makes it well over 100k for them. I make 30k after taxes. 

And us sales assistants? We don’t get commission. Even if we carry a sale from beginning to end - nothing. It all goes to the reps. 

Adding on to that, I wasn’t trained. Keep in mind I told my company from the beginning that I don’t have experience in the industry, and they said it was fine. They plopped me in my cube and basically said good luck. 

Well I did get really lucky and was referred by a friend who works here who was able to teach me from beginning to end. They’re in a different department entirely and wasn’t told to train me, they just did. The company said this position is so new and they didn’t have it in their budget to hire someone to train officially. It’s wild. That was the beginning red flag. 

Fast forward to now. That past month and a half I’ve been covering a sales rep 2-3 times a week. Doing way more than what was outlined when I took the job. It’s non stop flow from customers and calls and because I wasn’t trained properly - I get so stressed I have mental breakdowns every time I cover. My next job is to cover for 3 sales reps an entire week as our company has an event coming up for them. 

I brought this up to my boss who said such is life as a sales assistant in this company, and has done nothing about it. I asked for a slight pay bump because I’m working so hard and am basically a sales rep when I cover that I feel I should be compensated for it but that was rejected. 

To add on top of all of this, I’m getting bullied by one of the sales reps I cover. He’s shady, disrespectful to me, and makes illegal deals and they KNOW this and won’t fire him because he’s been with the company for 10 years and makes it good money. That’s another issue I brought up where my boss said, “There’s always going to be assholes at every job you go to.” 

I really feel like I’m working so hard and doing my best but my job won’t hire anyone and won’t compensate me for doing a role that is above my responsibilities too often. What should I do here? I’ve been under the weather many times in the past couple months, and my mental health is going down the drain. Should I stick it through? Is it worth it?

23,"I know the title sounds bad. But please hear me out. And I understand this post and any advice is morally ambiguous at best.

Small backstory: A few years ago my (23F) grandma's (70sF) health started declining and my mom (40sF) convinced gma to hire at home caregivers (gma was still living on her own). Since then, gma's health has rapidly gone down, and we now own a family/generational home to help take care of gma these last couple of years (or however long). 


We have had one caregiver, lets name her Judith, who has been working for my gma since the beginning.


Onto the issue: Judith (40sF), for lack of better phrasing, constantly is the victim, loves drama (mostly starting it), and is kinda mentally...fragile. Other notes about her:

* Talks shit about the other caregivers and purposefully tries to find things they've done wrong.
* Unable to problem solve. Even problems she's dealt with before.
* Enjoys bending the rules, but gets complains if other caregivers do so. Or even the company she works for.
* Brings personal issues to work. Including asking my family for money.
* And believes that everyone is against her. Anything done by another caregiver or new policy at the company, its all a personal attack against her.

My mom is at the end of her rope and wants Judith gone. Due to Judith's mental fragility, how can my family convince Judith to quit and have Judith think it's her idea?

31,"My (15F) dad yells at me sometimes. I just got into a huge fight with him and I'm crying as I'm writing this. He doesn't yell at me all the time, but it's a couple of times a month. He yells at my little brother (13) more than me. He's usually calm, but sometimes he just loses it. Last summer in another state, my brother accidentally said ""f\*\*\*"" and my dad hit him while he was still in the driver's seat, and then stopped the car, opened the door, dragged him out, and hit him maybe 3 or 4 times. He's never hit me, but he screams. I have phone videos of him doing it, 3 videos - one of him raising his voice at my brother to finish his homework, one of him losing it when he found out my brother ate too much junk food, and one I took today because he wanted me to hold a magnifying glass so he could get a splinter out (but I'm squeamish, which he knows, so I didn't want to, but he forced me to anyway and got mad when the glass wobbled). About 10 minutes ago we were in the kitchen and we started to fight, and I started to cry. He said I was a chickenshit, that I was making things up, that normal adults yell, that I was bullshitting my story. I wish I brought my phone down to record it. 

However, I can't report him to the domestic abuse hotline. He's a husband and I can't do that to my mom. Not to mention that he makes most of the money, so we'd be on our own. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know if this even counts as abuse because he's never physically hurt me. Please tell me what to do.",03Apr2019,3

33,"Hi,

So we live in a condo complex and have to park our extra vehicles about a 5 minute walk from the house. We move the truck specifically a minimum of once every two weeks for street sweeping, but I also park my vehicle in the same location so I keep an eye on things throughout the week. I drove by to check on the truck, someone has left a propane grill on the back of the truck. The truck is a flatbed so someone or some people took some effort to getting it up there. 

These people offloaded their unwanted grill onto our property. I think it's kind of funny but my husband is pissed. He wants to leave the grill, push it off the back of the truck and move the truck, for someone else to deal with.  I want to get rid of it properly (don't know how yet), but my husband is all for dropping it where it is as it's not our trash and our responsibility.

Any advice or advice accessories on the propane grill?",03Apr2019,1

35,"so today one of my friends, who we'll call Abin, who isn't necessarily in my group of close friends told his phone number to someone in the hallway during dismissal, and my friends and I just so happened to overhear. My one friend (i use that term lightly when referring to this individual), let's call him Landon, wrote down the phone number. My other close friend, let's call her Yesibel, did the same. My girlfriend, who we'll call GF, was also there. So after they wrote down the phone number, Landon and Yesibel had the amazing idea to ""Prank call the number."" Now I'll admit, at first I didn't say anything to stop them, in fact, they might've thought that I supported their endeavors, and I regret not having set the record straight, but no, I didn't support them and I didn't let them know.

So, sometime after school they both prank called the number. According to Yesibel, when she called a little girl picked up. Abin has a little sister. A 9-year-old little sister. Anyway, a little girl picked up said ""hello"", and then after that, the phone was swiftly taken and an older woman started speaking, I suspect that this was Abin's mom. So Yesibel says something along the lines of ""Hello ma'am, would you like to take a survey today?"" in a mock British accent. The woman replies ""depends on what kind of survey it is."" She then hangs up.

When Landon called, he just took everything way too far. Once again, the little girl picked up, and he said: ""Hello, this is n-word incorporated, would you like to purchase an n-word?"" To (presumably) a nine-year-old girl. I don't really know what happened after that, cause at this point I was very very angry. This was all being discussed on a group chat, so I expressed my concerns. My girlfriend told me that it was fine and that I didn't have to worry about it because I didn't do anything, but the people who did partake in the calls weren't willing to admit that they were wrong. So I tried to tell them that what they were doing was wrong and that it ""was not fine"", and it ""was not okay.""

Yesibel left the group chat and my GF kicked me from it. I asked Yesibel to add me back, but she said: ""I'd have to ask GF."" I responded with ""wtf, are you serious??"" I was enraged. Yesibel was still acting as if she did nothing wrong and still hasn't admitted it. I told her that what she did was a clear invasion of privacy and she just shifted the blame to GF. I was so annoyed. It went a little like this:

**ME**: we can sweep it under the rug for now or whatever

**Yesibel**: \*sends meme\*

**ME:** but what will happen will happen

**Yesibel:** \*sends meme\* I think you should apologize even if you believe you're correct

**ME:** no, I'm not going to apologize

**Yesibel:** \*sends meme\*

**ME**: if we're not actually going to talk about this, and how you guys were clearly in the wrong, I'm not going to apologize. And, oh, would you look at that, that's the consensus we came to, so yeah. No.

**Yesibel:** you're showing signs of infallibility

**ME**: no, it's just objectively wrong to invade someone's privacy

**Yesibel:** (referring to GF) regardless just apologize even if she is wrong

ME: I guess I'll just apologize to defuse the situation. Plus, I don't want to lose GF

GF didn't even engage in the prank calls, and yet Yesibel still said: ""even is **she is** wrong"". She still won't acknowledge how she was wrong, while I apologized for ""causing a scene"" and ""making it a bigger issue than it needed to be."" I hope that they get exposed, honestly. What they did was wrong.

What should I do, Yesibel isn't even willing to talk about it and I have to see her at school tomorrow. HELP!!",03Apr2019,1
36,"Sorry for formatting/rulebreaking errors as this is the first time I've posted seriously outside of hobby-focused subreddits.

I am 24 years old with two children aged 1.5 and 7 years old. My girlfriend and I are able to barely make it by, having just enough to cover all of our family's necessities. However, as any respectable parent should, I want to be able to provide more and allow us to live more comfortably by continuing education, or simply being able to get a better job.

However I am currently locked into my current job for two reasons:

1. We have no relatives available who are able to watch the kids and have since hired a babysitter (who has luckily catered to my schedule) and
2. My current job has me work an alternated schedule of 72 hours in 6 days straight followed by 7 days off (then repeated), which I don't have to pay the babysitter for as I will have the kids.

I currently cannot leave this dead-end position because of how convenient it is for us at the moment, but I don't want to be here forever and don't know where to look for a way to get out of this situation. My only idea at the moment is to spend the next couple of years trying to get a Bachelor's or something in order to get a better job.
My biggest fear right now is to undergo any kind of emergency that I will not be financially prepared for. We aren't able to save for much of an emergency fund and would probably be screwed if something big were to happen.

Any advice on what steps to take next in this situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for any help.

37,"  My coworker (let’s call her Emily) and I both started within a few months of each other, back in the middle of 2017. Although we were both in the same department, she and her boss (call him Fred, I guess) were based in the corporate office, and I was (am) based in another state. She was brought on as the hopeful apprentice to Fred in anticipation of his retirement. 
Fred’s post in corporate gave him a lot of leverage. Many critical documents were built and controlled by him alone. He knew how to manipulate his superiors with false impressions of his “unique” abilities, and there are few I know who could beat him in a game of ass-kissing. He was a Golden Boy in every sense of the word. 
When Emily joined the team, her on-boarding included a week long visit to all non-corporate locations, which Fred insisted he accompany her on. Their first stop was my location, and Fred wasted no time in making his complete lack of boundaries clear. In a meeting with all the location’s managers and myself, Fred introduced Emily to everyone as our department’s newest member and assured the room that she “wasn’t just hired because she looks good”. 
I mention this because, for me, it was significant enough to believe without question the accusations I would later hear. Of course, there were several other strong indicators, but you get my drift. 
Going into the last 3 or 4 months of 2017, Emily opened up about how Fred treated her both to myself and our other coworker (I’ll call her Mackenzie, also at my location), who also worked closely with Fred. His unprofessionalism was notable from Mackenzie’s perspective, but no physical contact (for Mackenzie) happened until the team trip in January when he touched her (M’s) waist while she tied her shoe. Small, but still significant in characterizing the behavior he deemed acceptable. 
In late 2017, (before the trip) knowing our mutual boss, “George” was a good hearted family man, we encouraged Emily to tell him the treatment she had endured since starting under Fred. At the time I had no concerns about whether George would have her back. It seemed like a no-brainer. Fred clearly had creepy tendencies he didn’t hide in public, who can guess what he did behind closed doors. 
George did not immediately react or take action that we knew of. Nothing changed, no one was spoken to. 
To corroborate Emily’s experience, Mackenzie told George (her actual boss, who was Emily and my’s boss’s boss) about what had happened to her. Still, all we heard was the Fred said he “thought that kind of touching was ok to do” when confronted with the concern. 
After that, months of abuse/assault went by, and Emily gave up hope that George was in the process of  pursuing justice or truth in any form. She finally broke down in the car with him, his wife’s and Mackenzie on the way home from dinner one night, crying, not knowing what to do to solve this problem. George told her to write everything Fred had done to her down and submit to HR. She already had it documented in a journal, so after typing it up and submitting it to HR, an investigation was started.
 I was questioned, everyone was. Fred was “fired” (but kept on payroll as a consultant as we found out when George used the department’s FedEx account to send something to his home address *months* later— the company more or less admitted to keeping him on as a consultant) and a search for his replacement began. In the meantime, the system that had been established and frequently (3-5times/week) used for sending project updates to corporate for approval was eroded because everyone (mgmt = 100% men) was afraid to be in a room alone with Emily, who was the facilitator and note taker during inspections. Because our projects are time sensitive, many tests were thrown in the garbage as a result of the desire to avoid this believed risk (Emily making up more abuse stories), potentially wasting thousands of “tax deductible” dollars. 
This behavior was one of many indicators that they saw her as a fraud, as someone who lied just to get their Golden Boy fired. Months of being subject to textbook retaliation, of being treated as a nuisance (rather than an asset), started to make Emily understandably bitter.
We met as a team for a few days again this March 2019, after which Emily and Mackenzie were reported to 
HR for being “negative” during the trip. From my perspective (someone who’s openly critical of
procedures and our inconsistent/incomplete pattern of communication) they were not negative, they were simply asking real questions that cost our department time/money over the year. I asked equally critical/persistent questions and *no one reported me*. 
Regardless, their supposed negative questions (which were honestly pertinent and non-aggressive) was enough to give HR leverage to give Emily a hard choice (resign or we’ll make you). 
George made it clear to HR and management that he couldn’t have a presence like her or Mackenzie on the team. Luckily Mackenzie’s degree opened up an opportunity in another department, but Emily is being effectively forced to leave. I don’t know what the terms are, so hopefully she’s getting some pay off for this abuse, but I can’t look at my bosses the same. 
Ultimately, Emily is being removed from a toxic dynamic that was unwilling to give her the justice she deserved and I am relieved for that. But every day I show up to work for someone who either doesn’t believe or doesn’t care about the abuse someone went through under their watch. George has never let me personally down, but every day it gets harder to justify working for someone with such a huge blind spot. If I came to him with concerns like this, I need to know he’d have my back, or at least that he’d want to. 
Of course, we are not allowed to talk about it, but I still have to physically bite my lip all the time not to ask. I can’t live the rest of my life pretending like nothing happened, like management didn’t let my friend down in the biggest way. 
I know it’s too much to ask to sit down and hear his (George’s) side of the story, but how am I supposed to sleep at night without at least trying to hash it out? The nausea grows with each new day. 
I just want to talk to him, but I feel like his guard is always up (of course) and I will never get the true story. With all the horrifying sh*t I’ve heard from Emily, I need to know:  What would compel a manager to react (or not react) in the way that he did?? I need to hear what made him feel like this was the right course of action. How can I trust his judgement with anything else if this is how he handles sexual abuse?? I don’t know what to do. No tldr",03Apr2019,2

I’ve brought these things up to her but she blows it off and says screw big corporations. 


I know if she chooses to do illegal things, I’m not her mom and what she does is her responsibility. But I know when we are at the mall in a few days, she will plan on shoplifting.

45,"This may get a confusing, but trust that I'm explaining this as plainly as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 17-year-old girl who is about to graduate high school. I will be starting college soon, and have many desires and reasons to apply for a job. I managed to convince my mom (who is a divorced, single, working parent) to let me get a job a little earlier than she'd like (she wanted me to wait until summer,  but I have many things I want to save money for that occur before summer). However, because of my younger brother (the 6-year-old), it may be difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

Because our mom is always working, either my older brother (18) or I must stay home to babysit. At the same time, my brother is a part-timer and has a schedule that's never the same (his hours aren't set to be the same everyday/week, except for the fact that he doesn't work mornings). He doesn't think I'll manage to find a job flexible enough to work for both of us. I agree with him.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure we can afford to pay someone else to babysit our little brother. If I get a job, I'll have to be lucky enough to find an extremely flexible job (which I doubt I'll find) or one of us will have to bring him to work with us. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to know is if it's possible to bring a 6-year-old boy to work? Is that appropriate? Getting a job is something I feel I absolutely \*must\* do \*now\*--it cannot wait. I don't want to be dependent on my mom all the time, especially since she rarely ever gives me money (I consider even $10 to be a lot). I'm willing to pay my phone bill (which my mother seemed to like, and is probably the main reason she gave me permission to get a job now rather than later) amongst other things.

&amp;#x200B;

Or should we look to formal childcare options? We can ask family, but they all work too. Again, paying someone to babysit him is out of the question--we can't afford that as of right now.

&amp;#x200B;

If things absolute don't work (based off the responses I get from you guys), I'll consider giving up and waiting until summer. If my brother worked mornings (he could if he wanted) I'd be able to get a job without these worries--should I try to convince him to switch from afternoon/evening shifts to morning?

48,"I struggle to make friends, a lot.

I started using Meetup, I didn't really connect with anyone but there was a group that went to all the places I enjoy going so it was great just to have a decent social life again with opportunity to meet new people while out with them too.

A while after I joined a guy joined and he became a popular core member of the group very quickly.

I started dating this guy, it was intense and I got swept up in it, but he started becoming emotionally abusive - not severe, but that's because I wasn't just taking it, the result was arguments and eventually I called him out. He dumped me as soon as I pointed out his behaviour was abusive (his ex wife had apparently accused him of the same, he decided I was being flippant and he said he had a rule not to date anyone who accused him of that again). 

So good riddens to him, but it meant losing that Meetup group too because he was so much part of that group - even if I could avoid nights where he was out it would have still felt like going out with his friends, I'd still not know what he'd told them, also two weeks after we broke up he started dating someone else in the group too. 

As well as losing this Meetup group, which was perfect for me in that they went all the places I like going...it also means problems going to to any of those places now. For one going anywhere alone makes me look like a pathetic loser (I've tried, it's horrible) but there's risk of running into my ex and running into that group while I'm on my own so I'd look like even more of a loser. I've been going to this same bar for twenty years, the club's are the only clubs I'd want to go to in town, I can't go to see any decent bands locally in case I run into this group. Meetup is also out of the question too because all the group's intermingle. 

It feels like he's 'won' which feels so desperately unfair when he was abusive to me, it's been eight months but I just can't make new friends let alone find a big group to go to these places to again. So it's loss of a social group but also loss of a social life, and in my thirties with my difficulty in making new friends it's not being dramatic to say it feels like the loss of my social life all together.

My dad was diagnosed with cancer and was getting really sick at that time so I got a second, better paying job at a fast food place to help support my sister and I. I’m in high school so my options were limited, and now I feel like I’m burnt out. My dad passed away on New Year’s Eve, and I had worked a double shift and 8 hours shifts the days leading up to his death. Now when I go to work all I feel is guilt and dread. I used to be able to work 12+ hour days, and now I can barely get through my 5 hour shifts. I’ve left my first job “temporarily” and I only work 2 days max at my other job. It’s still too much for me right now, and I want to quit both places permanently. I really like my coworkers and my bosses, but I just need to start fresh. Do you think it’s okay to take a break from working? I’ve saved a lot, and I’m going to try to get an on campus job when I start college next year. I think I just want to start new on all fronts.

55,"So i took the day off to help out my 5 month pregnant wife with our second child. I cleaned the house did the dishes cleaned out the fridge of old rotting food. Then a breaker went out due to we need to have an electrician come to the house and fix the wiring since the wiring is made for a house with 1960s appliances and not 2019. Well i let my wife know she tells her bro who comes to the house takes out the old breaker and we go to home depot to buy a new one. While going there my wife calls and then says we should just fix that breaker and sell the house yet she knows damn well even if we do sell the house we need to fix the things incase we cant sell it for our own piece of mind. So i tell her we will talk about that later right now is not a good time. So after that she calls back and says that the breaker will cost 100 dollars and im like breakers dont cost that much with a bye and click. Once she gets home she see that me and her brother are trying to fix it but she decides she want to tell some stupid story about the crazy neighbor. I tell her nobody cares about the stupid story at the moment we just care about getting this done before it gets dark and most of the house will have no power. Of  course she get all upset thinking things will work, when we figure its not going to work and the electrician needs to come and put a bandaid on it till he has an opening to do it.
So after that the wife leaves to drop of her bro she comes back and then is total mad at me. Saying i was and asshole to her on the phone and on front of brother but when i tell her her bro was calling her a witch in the car shes like oh thats a nickname he has for me. And then when i try talking to her no mater what im the bad guy i was slowly getting more and more upset. I feel like this pregnancy has totally made her a crazy person. Its like everything i do for her is not appreciated and then when im annoyed at her im the one thats wrong. And then when i talk to her again she sees it but is not saying sorry, more like well its your fault that i felt that way. How in the fuck is it my fault when she let her mind think i was giving her an attitude. So at the end of the talk she said she wanted a divorce. Now im all pissed off not knowing what to do. A part of me loves her and another part of me is like fuck it im done with this shit no mater what i do ill be the bad guy.

68,"**About Me**

I've been in my position, managing $80 million (in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry), since last Feb, so, a bit over a year. 

I manage the top 3 accounts in my company, well, number 2, 3, &amp; 4. (Not #1)

My Director emailed me a meeting request last week, while I was working from home, but it was an oddly specific meeting outline req. It had such a specific agenda *(for us just to chat about)* going thru all of my accounts with certain inquiries. 


I was a bit worried, so the following day, I asked what was up? Were we preparing for something? I was told No, nothing was being prepped for. Just that they see that there was a lot going on &amp; wanted to see if they could help me push things along internally at all. Also it was a refresher for them, for when  the Sr. Team inquired about how the account's were going, my Director would be informed, vs. not knowing how to answer.

That seemed reasonable to me. So I *was* cautiously optimistic moving forward. And now this email comes out where the Director is saying they'll be out of office until lunchhour tmrw, to all us account managers.  Odd.  Not a customer meeting, as all of us acct managers won't be with you, also, you've never told us you'd be in offsite meetings before?

*Some more details:*
A big event that occured about 7 months into my being in the role, where one of my accounts chose to drop/cancel (or to transition) a massive part of our business to a competitor late last year. *Although that was due to us not being competitive in our offer vs. the competitors; rather than my ability to sell, or have connections.* 


Outside of this, my accounts are on track; I'm in customer meetings, my monthly forecasts are on point &amp; I am growing my business with new listings over Last Year.



- Where I feel I might be ""being judged"" is the fact that I'm the type to always keep my Director informed. Or bounce ideas off of them. I do this, as I've heard that some sales folk don't advise their senior team at all. So their in the dark, and always having to be the one to ask. Or that when Sr. Teams arent informed, they risk assuming your job isn't being completed. So that's not me. I do mention, if ever any concern with my level of detail,  I'm happy to reel it back in. To which they say, no &amp; they would tell me if it was too much. So, perhaps not this?


- The other piece is that I always throw a channel on my youtube while I work. If not music, then sometimes fitness or travel ones. I'm not necessarily watching them, say 95% of the time, but they are on in the background. I don't know... it is like white noise to me. But perhaps my IT team flagged the fact that YouTube is sometimes on my computer? I've not received any warnings or, any concerns that my job isn't getting done. But I am still considering this as being a negative?


I make a decent buck, I like my colleagues and I also have a good boss. So I am getting paranoid that they are seeing where my accounts are at, so when they get someone new, they know where to take off from.

Now for some background info, in May of 2018 my parents saw a few cuts on my wrist. After that plus a few other events, they took me to see a therapist. It was pretty much a waste of money. I am way too much of a private person to tell anyone anything, and from May-September I was pretty miserable.

80,"This is going to be kind of long so I'm sorry about that. Where to start. I'm f18 and I have crazy anger issues. It started honestly all the way back since I can remember. My dad and his mother (my grandmother) both have crazy anger issues and I became like them. When I was younger, my grandma  was crazy about our house being clean. She would scream and hit me and lock me in rooms until it was to her standards. She pulled my hair and told my dad things and he spanked and screamed at me as well all of the time. So when my grandma got paralyzed and lost her ""power"" I picked up alot of these horrible habits. 

I yell at my sibling all of the time. I scream until the entire house is clean, and even then I'm not satisfied. I only sometimes hit them, but it happens. My mom and dad have both tried without success to get me to stop, but I can't. And it's even harder when my dad tells me to stop being so controlling, all the while he screams at everyone to this day, just like I do now, too. 

It's eating me up. I can't live like this anymore. I try to be conscious of my actions and thoughts. But if anything doesn't go my way, I go crazy. And even though I'm aware that what I'm doing is wrong (even as I'm doing it) I can't stop. My mom always tells me to just be conscious, but I can't stop even if I'm aware of what I'm doing. I don't want to be like this anymore. I get so mad when I don't get my way that I say horrible things to everyone, including my mother, which is absolutely disgusting.

 I am so disgusted with myself, and yet the cycle continues.  Anger management isn't an option because I can't afford it, and my parents don't believe in it. They say to just stop, but for some reason any trigger angers me to the point of screaming like a mental person. 

The worst thing is that I'm only 18. I'm so young and I boss around my parents, my sibling, my grandmother. I tell everyone to shut up and punish my younger brothers if I don't get my way. I can't do this anymore. I need help. ",03Apr2019,1

94,"Hi everyone, just trying to get some advice on how to handle being in a relationship with someone that always seems to think everything is a competition. Everyday I get the same “what I do is harder than what you do.” in different situations. It’s very frustrating to hear constant bragging, complaining, and competitive comments based upon life and school. I just wanna be able to not get frustrated or annoyed easily when these conversations arise. 

I’ve tried to come at the comments with general unbiased responses to hopefully disperse the competitive tension or come at them with a different perspective on the specific situation. But it feels like all of that effort isn’t doing anything. It’s starting to affect my relationship and how I view my partner, I know it isn’t something they’re doing on purpose, but I would like to find a way to reduce the frustration I feel when these conversations come up. 

Any advice is much appreciated. ",03Apr2019,1
95,"Bit of background. I am working in an industrial supply store and have been since I was 18. I am now 23 and really hating my job. Everything started out okay, but my boss has always had an...interesting dynamic with me. He always seems to be harder on me than other employees and treat me differently.

I am on minimum wage and have been since I started. Every mandatory minimum wage pay rise has been updated a minimum of 6 months after they should. I have asked for pay increases before but been shot down because 'you make too many mistakes, try again later"".

My boss is regularly short tempered with me and yells at or condescends me for mistakes he would laugh at if anyone else made. He recently implied that I was responsible for the company not making enough money this month, even though there is no way that could possibly be my fault, it was just a slow month, it happens every year.

I made a mistake once that cost us around $20 and he actually made me give him the cash, which is illegal here, because he didn't feel that he should have to cover. I would have offered to pay for it, have he not forced it out of me.

Today is the real kicker though, maybe because it is fresh. I tipped over a tub full of screws of different sizes and as I was sorting them out he came down and told me that I was a ""fucking idiot"" and that I need to take the screws home and sort them in my time, because he won't pay me to fix something so stupid. If he would do this with anyone in the store I wouldn't have a problem but he absolutely would only be this way with me.

The only reason I haven't already applied for more work is because I've been suffering some mental health issues lately, and am receiving therapy but don't feel that I'm ready right now for such a change in my life, but honestly I don't know how much more of this (illegal) bullshit I can handle.",03Apr2019,4

I only see her a couple times a year, for a week or so at a time. We all have a ton of fun together, and right now everything is cool.

It's so easy to text or FB, though, so I'm trying to avoid that... nothing good would ever come of saying anything to anyone. This family TALKS too, so instant bad news the moment anything slips. They're all great, but they sure do talk...

100,"Hello, I'm 17. I eat healthy, have a consistent bedtime, have a social life, and I work out. I am not obese or even slightly overweight or underweight. Starting from last summer, I have been trying to accomplish many goals that I believe can help propel me towards the future that I want, and I had made tremendous progress during the summer. Then, I still suffered from the sleepiness issue, and I stayed away from my friends and family as much as possible to get my work done. I also wasted a lot of time just sitting around in an attempt to do my work. During this time, I was incredibly stressed out. This was not the way that I wanted to live, so I decided to make a change and hang out more. However, this had side effects. Due to my increased sociability I no longer had time to slowly trudge through my work with my tiredness and poor focus. This only worsened when school started and seven hours were suddenly cut from my day. Every day I tried to make the big change of waking up energized and giving everything my fullest, but with my busier schedule and sleepiness, I just couldn't get anything done. This is gone on from midway through August until now. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong and why I am so tired. My lack of progress makes me feel like a failure, and it feels like a pain to see my girlfriend and friends knowing that I have failed to achieve my goals.

116,"I write a weekly opinion column for my college newspaper. All of the staff (including me) are students. I've been working there for several months, and I enjoy it so much that I hoped to ascend the ranks and earn a position on the editorial board someday.

In my time there, I have gained the favor of the editor-in-chief (also a student). I'll call her Chloe. She's a wonderful boss (personable, corrects my mistakes without being condescending, always has time for my questions, etc.). She trusts that I always form my opinions based on solid research, unlike many of the other columnists. Just a few days ago she said that she's ""been waiting on a columnist like me to come around,"" and she even asked me to work for student media over summer break. 

The second-in-command (let's call her Emily) is much less pleasant. I've only ever interacted with her a couple of times, but each time she's been very stand-offish. She doesn't agree with my opinions (which is totally fine), but she frequently makes unnecessary, rude, passive-aggressive comments about my writing. For example, I was really excited the first time I got a response from a reader. As I was telling Chloe, Emily (across the room, not part of the conversation at all) rolled her eyes and huffed, ""Well I'm not surprised considering the kinds of opinions *you* have."" When I said that the reader’s feedback was actually positive, she pretended not to hear and ignored me. (Chloe, on the other hand, seemed genuinely happy for me).

Anyway, fast forward to last week. Without going into too much detail, I wrote an opinion column that critiqued the college for applying an unnecessary chemical product to the campus grounds, since the product’s environmental hazards haven’t been tested and are “unknown” (according to the manufacturer). Using the product (or anything like it) also goes against the college’s official policy and environmental protocols. Students hate the product so much that Chloe is actually the one who suggested I write my weekly opinion article on it (I normally come up with my topics on my own).

Immediately I received a lot of positive responses from students and professors who agree with my stance. 

But soon I started getting backlash from college officials. They contacted me and demanded an apology for publishing “inaccurate information.” My article was pulled from the website (by Emily, I later learned), and all the sudden people (professors and students) were emailing me asking why they couldn’t find my article online.

Emily called me and chewed me out, telling me that “I need to do more research next time” and how my argument “is just completely trashed.” We went back and forth for a while but eventually hung up.

So I talked to Chloe and showed her my sources. She listened to me and decided to put the article back up. I responded to the college officials and respectfully declined to retract my article, saying that I made no false claims. They pretty much backed down and said ok, but they insisted on knowing the person I interviewed for my article.

I was satisfied. I hadn’t spoken to anyone, and all my sources were trustworthy (official college handbooks/guidelines, manufacturer’s chemical safety information).

I drafted a response and set up a meeting with Chloe to go over it. Out of nowhere, Emily said she also wanted “in on this.” She asked to talk to Chloe alone before our meeting, and she shut the door behind her so I wouldn’t hear what was said.

When the meeting began, Emily was very rude, condescending, and disrespectful. She yelled at me and kept cutting me off mid-sentence (to tell me that what I had to say was “irrelevant”), all while Chloe listened but did nothing to calm Emily down. Emily accused me of purposely deceiving readers and being inconsistent, and she even took my laptop and looked through my emails (without permission, I had it open to show one of my sources in MS Word). She blamed me for not having an official statement from the college, saying that “there’s the *handbooks* and then there are *sources*. Like people. Research isn’t enough.” Everything about the way she treated me was hostile and completely unprofessional.

Emily is demanding that I reach out to the officials and ask for a public statement regarding the product. She wants my article removed, and a public disclaimer/correction in the next issue of the newspaper. Chloe is just kinda going with all this to appease Emily. She fully supports me when Emily isn’t involved.

I thought I could let this all go until I saw this week’s article. It’s only half-way published, with the rest “available to read online.” This has never happened to any other columnist (even before I started working there), so it doesn’t feel like a coincidence.

I feel like I’ve been going in circles. Emily’s toxic behavior towards me has crossed a line, especially if she's preventing me from being published (as I suspect). Her demands just seem to be pointlessly making things worse, considering the whole thing seems to have blown over with the original complainants. I don't want Emily's disclaimer to make me out to be a liar. I’m an opinion columnist, not a reporter. 

I can’t work under someone who deliberately undermines me, calls me at home to yell at and berate me, and disrespects me in the workplace.

I don’t think I could confront Emily directly. I would like to talk to Chloe in person, but I’m worried that Emily will intrude in the meeting like she did already. And I wouldn’t know what to say. There’s no point in filing a report, since Chloe saw how Emily treated me and did nothing. Emily also has seniority—she’s been there significantly longer than I have. I thought about resigning, but I love this job the work that I do so much. 

What do I do?

122,"Hey Reddit, you wonderful little website that's always been there for me in times like these. I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this in, and this is probably going to come off as a long ramble, but I need to voice these thoughts somewhere, even if its simply to the 7 people who see this post.

Enough beating around the bush.

I'm 17 years old, and am a senior in high school. I've got 4-5 months before I go off to college, and recently, I've been thinking about my childhood more than ever. I'm really gonna miss it, Reddit. I'm gonna miss Minecraft LAN parties with friends that lasted until our parents forced us to go to sleep. I'm gonna miss binging Mythbusters for hours on end every Saturday morning, no worries weighing me down. I'm gonna miss the exuberance that came with simply just being a kid, the knowledge that the rest of the world was only for the ""adults"", and I didn't have to confront it. 

I've been thinking about my own mortality more than ever recently, and the way that time forces us to live our lives. 4 months ago, I was in the midst of applying to colleges, and thought, ""4 months from now I'll know where I'm going to college. That's a long way away though, it'll take a while to get here."" Now I'm sitting here, 4 months later, knowing where I'm going to college, and wondering if that's what my whole life is going to feel like. Now I'm thinking, ""Oh, being 30 is a long way away from now, it'll take absolutely *forever* for it to get here."" But deep down, I know that when I'm 30, I'll be looking back at the past 13 years and wondering where the hell they went. Of course, I want to make them as enjoyable as possible, and I will, but it doesn't change the fact that they're 13 years I will never get back. I'll be 13 years closer to my day of death, if I even live to be 30, because who knows? I could die of a heart attack or aneurysm writing this post, and nobody would even read this. 

&amp;nbsp;

As much as I joke about depression and dying, I'm really scared, Reddit.

I'm scared of not accomplishing the goals I have set for myself. I'm scared of not getting everything I can out of my life, because its the only one I have. I'm scared of simply experiencing life, instead of truly living. I'm scared that I'll look back and see that I wasted years and years on fruitless endeavors, years I'll never, ever, get back.

**Fuck**. I'm scared of death. As stupid as it sounds, I **don't** want to die. But on the contrary, I'm afraid of seeing the people around me die as I age. I want to live as a 17 year old forever. I want to hold on to it, I never want to let go of the exuberance that defined being a kid. I want to experience this one fleeting moment forever. 

&amp;nbsp;

But I know I can't. Time will rip it away from me, regardless of what it is. 

I'm tearing up at this point, lol. To everyone who's made it this far, thank you. I'll end it here. I love you all. I just need some advice.

I just found out my sister is living in a hoarding situation- bags of garbage you can barely get through, garbage outside, too many cats.... it’s not as much hoarding as it is living in literal trash. I know she’s been depressed. She’s also had some health problems. But she is married to a physically able man and has a teenage boy. No one is doing anything about it, the trash just keeps piling up. My dad and I are trying to figure out what to do. Ultimately, I know my sister and her husband would have to accept any help we would offer. She physically is unable to do it herself.  I keep thinking, there must be a company who could come in and take care of this. Maybe dad and I could pay for it. But then I think- her husband is physically able to do this. And even if we spent our own money to take care of things, who’s to say things won’t get bad again? My sister is finally getting the medical care she needs, as well as some mental health care. She’s starting on an antidepressant. She still will not be physically recovered to do the work this house needs for several months. When speaking to our father, she said it had gotten like this because of the health problems she’s been having for many months. (Her husband is perfectly able to do anything the house would have needed while she’s been unwell, but apparently his 35 hour a week job keeps him too busy.)I am beyond stressed and frustrated, and unsure of what to do. I’m also concerned because there is a minor in the home, and I know there are serious legal considerations about raising a child in this environment. I myself am unable to take care of it. I was in an accident recently, and this kind of physical labor would mess me up for a long time. I also work 50 hours a week, and have 2 school-aged children of my own. (And a house of my own to take care of.) I am so incredibly heartbroken right now, imagining my sister living in actual squalor. We’ve never been super close, but she’s my sister and I love her. I feel a bit responsible for her since we lost our mom over a decade ago. She’s a grown woman, older than me, but has had struggles forming friendships and relating to people. I believe she is on the spectrum. She doesn’t really have anyone, except her husband, who seems pretty much useless. 

I just don’t know what to do or where to start. I’m completely overwhelmed by this whole situation, but I know I have to do something.",03Apr2019,2
127,"My current living situation is less than desirable: my roommate is a sociopath. She lacks empathy, she thinks she's more deserving than others, and she can't stand reasonable boundaries and being told ""no"". She does whatever she wants, whenever she wants, makes as much noise as she wants, and feels perfectly justified in her actions because she simply refuses/cannot empathize with other people's basic human needs like sleep. Any time I try to establish a more accommodating living environment from her, she throws a tantrum. She either mumbles to herself and avoids eye contact and wanders off, complains that ""she pays rent"" so she gets to do whatever she wants, or just flat out ignores me. She often plays unreasonably loud music at all hours, slams cabinets, and has people over and smokes a ton of weed (illegal and stinky) and has loud conversations in the common area (right next to my bedroom).

I've tried communicating with her multiple times through multiple platforms and nothing does anything. I've reported her to the front office. They don't give a single shit.

She was randomly assigned to me as a roommate. Trust me, if I'd known this person, I wouldn't even talk to them, let alone choose to live with them.

I know the most reasonable outcome is for me to just move out, but I'm very short on funds right now. I just got a new job two weeks ago and I'm looking for a new apartment. In the mean time, I'm trying to get the front office to do a SINGLE THING about the situation. I have a documented police case against the noise, documented the harassment, reported her for her horribleness multiple times. I just feel fucking helpless.

Any time I try to confront her at this point, I know she's just going to act ridiculous and not actually do what I need, and it's going to make me very anxious and I'll just shake and freak out for hours after (that's due my own past trauma). I'm just kind of at my wits end. Is my only option to bide my time until I just get out? Is there anything I can do to make the front office give a shit and get SOMEthing done?? What are my options?

I wish I talked to more girls, and my friends approached women, I wish I played truth or dare, dumb shit teenagers do. I wish my friends were trying to outdo each other with the next crazy move, and I wish I went to parties. I wish I was popular. I know for a fact I am very charismatic (I've got a big smile ;)), but I am not very popular at school. Probably because I created a terrible first impression (my hormones went a bit crazy at the start of seventh grade) But outside of school, I make people smile very easily (The girl working at the movie theaters seemed into me, and she was cute) But I'm not even close to that.

131,"So this needs quite a bit of backstory.
I dated my ex for 4.5 years, and my current boyfriend was our friend during those 4.5. My ex then went and cheated on me, and broke up with me over a span of a month. I was devastated I thought I’d be with this guy forever.  The only friend that stayed there during the whole breakup was my boyfriend. Most of my friends abandoned me for my ex. At this point I have severe trust issues. My mom wants me to do tinder so I try it. None of that works out. Casual dating isn’t my thing. 
So eventually ~ a month after a hard breakup for me my friend (later bf) breaks up with his girlfriend who was going to leave him at the end of summer anyways. A couple days later we decide us going to see the movie will be a date. I know this is soon. I didn’t expect it to work out fully to be honest. My mom thinks this I’m out of his league and that he’s just trying to get in my pants. She doesn’t like that he’s still in high school (got held back due to his school not cooperating his education with a surgery a couple years prior) so he has to do an extra year. He also didn’t  have a drivers license yet (neither did I). So I see why she might not like him on the surface. 
It may not be the “smartest”  thing but we got through our breakups together and I realized my ex was an abusive asshole, because I was surprised to be treated nicely on a consistent basis, and he was happy to not be used for sex anymore. I don’t think I could of gotten over my ex without him. He’s amazing and treats me like a princess but my mom still borderline hates him for no reason. I think it’s because he’s not as charismatic (manipulative) as my ex. I want my mom to like him because I love him so much. 
I want to tell her we are engaged, but i know she won’t approve so i guess I will wait. My dad is iffy on him but he wants me to make my choices myself. My mom thinks I should “live “ and be single. I think she’s projecting what she wants/wanted on to me. How do I convince my mom he’s a good guy? ",03Apr2019,1

Im mainly really insecure about being controlling after the whole thing with our last roomate that i feel like all his friends secretly hate me and think i control him and what not so i hate when he tells them hes not playing games because of me some nights even though its true id rather him just say hes tired or something. does this sound bad or am i overthinking.??",03Apr2019,1

I had no idea that it was the last time I would hear her voice.

139,"I’m a 23 year old trans college dropout with $9,000 in student loans who’s about to get fired from my longest-held job. 

I moved out of my parents hyper-religious household at the age of 19  to move closer to my University and finally have the freedom to live my own life. I majored in computer science because even though I didn’t care much for the subject, I had spent a few years in high school working with my father in his IT company and because the major paid well.

For the next 2 years I continued to work with my fathers company and for a non-profit doing IT (where I currently work at today). The longer I went to school, the more I struggled with it. Throughout high school, I always struggled with math, but I did not realize how this would bite me in the ass during college. The further I got into upper divs, the more clueless I felt in the major. I always felt like I was playing catch up with my peers and I began to become disillusioned with the major as a whole. 

Instead of focusing on my studies at this point,  I spent most of my free time getting high on weed and making music. I was writing songs, producing for myself and other artists, playing at open mics. I had played music all my life and had always dreamed of being able to live off of my art. 

By the end of my 4th year at university (I was going to have to take a 5th year). I felt so unmotivated with school and so energized by music, that I decided to drop out and pursue it with everything I had.

After dropping out, I came out to my family as trans, was not accepted  by them and lost the IT gig I had with my fathers company. I spent the next 2 years working IT at the non-profit as a day job and continued posting covers and original songs on social media, and performing at local shows but I never really gained any traction. During this time I feel like I stopped investing outside energy in IT and my skills began to atrophy as a result. 

One of my coworkers/ex-friends who I brought into the company has slowly taken over more and more of my responsibilities and now no one at our small office really asks me to do anything substantial. He graduated with a CS degree and outperforms me in graphic design, video editing, and coding. Finances are really tight for our company right now and everyone in the office is treating me weird. I’m pretty sure that I’m about to fired very soon for poor performance and I’m freaking out. 

At the beginning of this year it also finally hit me that music is probably not going to work out, and I have been crippled by anxiety of the future and regret of my past decisions. So much so, that I haven’t slept through the night in months. 

I feel like I just exist at work only to come home and begin dreading the start of the next day. It feels like an endless cycle. I haven’t even produced any finished songs in the past 4 months. 

I have lost all confidence in myself as person and feel like I have forgotten how to do both IT and music production. Once I get fired, I feel like I no longer have the skills to get another IT job. 

Idk how to start getting my life back together.....

143,"I recently just got a job because I'm currently a college student and I decided having a job would be beneficial for me for my everyday finances such as food &amp; etc... So I got a part-time job at a local Tacobell. First few times were okay, worked 6 hour shifts for three times a week. I thought I could handle it, having school and all, but I never realized how crazy it would be for me. They schedule me sporadically. It's never consistent. I thought I could handle working and going to school. I'm either at work or at school, have no free time, I have school twice a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10am to 8:50 and I'm scheduled to work everyday I'm not in school except for one. (Sometimes they schedule me to work until 12am and I feel somewhere down the line, if I don't say anything, they'd start scheduling me until 2am) Sometimes I'd have to call off and have someone else work for me if I have to go to school for office hours, club events, and etc. They schedule me around 30-32 hours a week when I'd only prefer around 20. Plus trying to juggle time with loved ones also comes to play. Education is very important to me, but I feel like my job is somewhat making it hard for me due to the hours they give me. I don't want to seem rude or demanding because my co-workers and managers have been really nice to me and have been good to work with, but juggling all of that has been a lot. I'm very introverted and have trouble speaking my mind and being an inconvenience, so I don't really know what to say to my manager. I don't want to seem too much, because I already called out twice due to college reasons such as open house and meeting with a professor. 

Any advice?

TLDR: Got a new job plus with being a full time student, they schedule me a lot of hours than I can handle and not consistent. Having a hard time juggling work, school, and relationships.

144,"After a little fight my boyfriend of three years just broke and told me that he always tried to be brave in front of me, but he was actually a coward. He told me he had been hiding from me that he wants to have sex with other people. He talked to his psychologist and she told him that he had to face it. He told me he’s satisfied with our sex life and that he doesn’t think about anyone else romantically but that he still wants to do it. He tried to ignore it, but it kept coming back and he was really afraid of telling me because he knew I wouldn’t agree, but he said he couldn’t keep it anymore.
I asked and he said he never cheated and never would, that he promised to himself he would be faithful and he did. I told him, as he expected, that I wasn’t ok with that and probably never will. He said he knew and that was why he was so afraid of telling me, because it would mean we had to break up, since he couldn’t deny who he was.
I asked if he wanted to continue the relationship in spite of knowing I would never agree to that, also if he thought it was right and if it would work out. He said he did want to continue the relationship, but he knew it wouldn’t be right and would probably not work out since it would change everything.
I told him that if he didn’t think it would be right, then we should break up. He just cried. I stood up to leave but just started crying and calling myself stupid (because I actually thought we were going to get married and grow old together yada yada). I turned to him and said: I actually thought we’d end up together, he replied “me too”, then he stood still and just said “what did I just lose?” And cried. That broke me, I told him to shut up and left. I’ve never felt pain like this, I love that man, we really were best friends as well as a couple, I really thought we were starting to build our lives together.
I came home and talked to my mom, she said that even though she understood I was sad, at least my bf was honest, and I agree.
He sent me a couple of texts saying “I can’t. I can’t throw all of this away” “I needed to tell you but I don’t need that in my life. I love and need you”
I sent him a voice note: “I know this isn’t your fault. And I appreciate you were honest and always faithful in our relationship. Thank you. But you can’t deny who you are and neither can I, and sadly what you look for in a relationship isn’t compatible with what I look for, this isn’t throwing something away, it wasn’t going to work out. I would like to offer you my friendship but I can’t, I had never been this sad. I’m going to stay away for a while, I have a lot of things to do and a lot of things to focus on. Love, stop. I asked you if you thought that it’d be right to continue with our relationship and you said no, and that was honest. And truth be told, I don’t think it would be right either, because I will always think I’m taking away a part of you, and that’s something I will never do. Perhaps when I feel a little better we could be friends or something, but not right now, I need time. I really wish you the best, I hope everything goes well with your mom (his mom is sick right now) you know I love her a lot, and keep up with school, ok? (He’s been struggling with school lately).

146,"Hi, Reddit. I am in desperate need of advice. I am a happily freshly engaged woman, attempting to marry my best friend. We would like to get married September 21st of this year, so fairly quickly. I am completely content with a courthouse wedding, in fact I prefer it for many reasons.
A.) Money. I think weddings really are a huge waste of money. We don’t have a ton of money and we are getting our first place together. I think the money should be invested there instead. Our families will not be helping financially. 
B.) Time. We don’t have the time to plan an elaborate wedding. We both work way too much and the time constraint makes it really hard to find venues/vendors/etc. Also, he comes from a religious background, so we’ve never even spent the night together, which is getting super old. 🤣
C.) The main problem is my stress/anxiety. I’ve only been engaged for 2~ weeks and I have never been so stressed out in my life. I’m also a very shy person and don’t feel comfortable being the center of attention.
My fiancé at least wants to do something small. I agreed to compromise and have a very small ceremony with 30 or less guests and we’re both content with that. 
 Problem is, that’s not good enough for his family. They want us married in their church, with premarital counseling (my future MIL said I need this due to my poor upbringing and lack of healthy relationships in my life - ouch) and at least 200 guests. I have never been so stressed out before. I want it to go my way, but everyone is going to hate me by the end of this, maybe even my fiancé. Do I suck it up and deal with it or do it my way and piss everyone else off?

I did not want to let him go because In the past he has been unfaithful when he was in another state. After that happened we broke up for a short amount of time then got back together and he left the traveling to be with me for a little while and is just now going back to get that extra money like said before. He said it was only 10 days he’d be gone and that’s it. So I let him go and do it. 

A few days in now, I get a random notification on my phone from Facebook saying, “ (his name) has removed your anniversary date.” So of course I freak out and call him and question why he’d remove it. In his response he said that he got a notification from Facebook letting him know that it had been awhile since he had updated his settings. So then I proceeded to ask him why he would make our relationship private to the public. He told me it was an accident. That he didn’t mean to set it as that. And I’m thinking, “how the fuck do you mistake something like that?” There is a reason you don’t want my name on your Facebook. I don’t believe your excuses. You wouldn’t just all of a sudden decide to try and make your profile private. Does anyone have an idea of what he’s trying to do? 

I know this might seem dumb to some and that I shouldn’t get upset over something so small, the reason I do though, is because I’m trying to guard my heart. So I don’t get hurt. ",03Apr2019,1

162,I’m a kid in high school and around the middle of the year I start talking to this girl I went to school with since 6th grade. I learned quickly we had the same teachers but different periods and we discussed how we both hated our teachers. I thought we were really hitting it off and I thought I liked her. I decided by the end of March that I would wait until the end of school to try to get into a relationship with her. Fast forward a few days later and today she announces on her social media that she started dating this other kid who I never knew about. I’m so devastated and I don’t know what to do. I was in a relationship previously a few years ago and it was the greatest time of my life but it ended so poorly and I haven’t been the same since. What should I do anymore? I’m so confused and depressed and just wanna be happy again. ,03Apr2019,1
163,"The last three years of my life have been filled with a lot of loss. I lost my job, I lost my drive for art in a big way, I lost my aunt who I was close to, I had a deep betrayal by someone I thought was close friend, I lost my uncle, I lost another aunt, my dog was just diagnosed with cancer and I don't have the money to pay for treatment on top of everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

The past year I've found a new job where no one appreciates anything i have to say. No one respects me me creatively and it just further killed my drive. I took this job thinking okay get back into art, but everyday its half customer service here....(I took this job to leave retail management no more customers...) I have to answer a phone or a door, or having my boss ruin my designs, send me his, ask for my opinion, have him say my opinion doesn't matter before asking me to fix his stuff anyway. Its good money, but i feel so unfulfilled and its devastating everyday to be told my someone who complained that I used Illustrator for too many things (because he couldn't edit in powerpoint).... 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just at my breaking point there. I don't know sometimes how to get through the days. I came in one day and my boss went through a bunch of files the night before and crashed one program and didn't bother to close it.... It ruined a few things. I had to pretend I didn't know he was remotely accessing my things.... Nothing felt safe at my desk anymore. I take my lunches in my car because it feels like thats only place where I can be alone there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been withdrawing from so many great friendships. I find them exhausting, i find everything that isn't my room exhausting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried to just try to cope with everything. But now my dog, thats one of the few safe things in this world. How do I cope with just feeling awful. I keep having these mini-break downs.  I'm in the middle of a relationship that s lovely, he's lovely but I feel my mood seeping in more and more each day. While it was relief to come home and vent, i felt like I was talking too much or I was filling everything with my negative feelings. I don't want him or anyone else in my life to know how bad i feel. 

&amp;#x200B;

I worry about my parents getting older. I think about my mom being alone. I think about my day commuting these long days into the city. I'm just thinking if something happens what do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

I sat in my car the other day I called my dead aunts number, it wasn't in service. I knew this and just dialed again and cried.  Then I drove home and acted like I stopped to buy some dog food. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry. I don't know what advice I was looking for. I guess I'm trying to figure out where do I start piecing things back together.  How do i get on track to better place mentally...?",03Apr2019,10
164,"I've never really been one with a temper at all, I've always been pretty reserved, cheerful, not easily upset, I've never had too hard of a time keeping my feelings to myself. But lately, some things, people, emotions, memories from my past are coming back up again, childhood trauma that I must have compartmentalized and I'm starting to remember again. 

I didn't realize at first but I'm starting to have a hard time coping with all of this stuff going on. I find that every time I think of the past and the person responsible for it, I get so angry and upset that I need a few moments to physically stop to calm myself down and try to think about something else. I get reminded of it so often too. I caught myself starting to act out a few times already, but luckily I was able to calm down before I did anything stupid.

This started a few weeks ago after a seemingly insignificant interaction with this person that seemed a little too familiar (we'd been on pretty good terms at that point) and the memories just started accumulating from there. We live in the same house but we don't actually see each other that often. A few days ago there was a pretty huge and awful argument, me getting the brunt of some pretty awful accusations and verbal abuse. Long story short, we'd sort of made up after, me probably being more forgiving and lenient than they deserved, I just didn't want to debate or talk about it anymore. But since then, what used to be just a slight feeling of irritation when they were around turned into these just sudden flashes of red hot anger.

I get so upset about it and I don't really know what to do about it. On one hand, I don't want to just repress it again as I did in the past, so maybe I need to just feel it. On the other hand, anger for me is just such an ugly state of mind I don't want to feel it at all. I'm at a loss on what to do here, and maybe I need therapy but I want to give it a few more days. Honestly, right now I'd just really appreciate any advice on how to cope with whatever the hell I'm experiencing. ",03Apr2019,1

167,"So I’m using a different account to err on the side of caution. Here’s the background:

I’m good friends with this girl, but we’re just friends. We’ve known each other for a while and have a few mutual friends. One of those people is her boyfriend, who she currently lives with along with his parents. They’ve only been dating maybe 8 months, been living together for the better portion of that. When they first hooked up I didn’t really know him at all but a few other people we both knew did, and at one point I was over his house with her to help her fix something and had an opportunity to talk to him. Here’s where it gets unsettling.

For starters, his room is FILLED with clown-related art and paraphernalia. They also have this weird thing of going to events together with clown makeup on, he got her into doing that. Next, he’s borderline obsessed with horror films, specifically related to serial killers and extremely grotesque forms of violence and violent sexual acts. He also enjoys documentaries related to the subject and according to her its pretty much the majority of what he watches. One of the clown posters in his room is John Wayne Gacy, and he often does his clown make up in the same style.

The scary part? She told me at one point that he had a history of mental illness, to the point of having been institutionalized for it, for over a year. I’m not sure exactly when that was or exactly what he was diagnosed with, nor do I know if he takes any kind of meds. 

She also has a habit of talking to me about her relationship issues. I try not to read into this too much, but the short of it that I’ve managed to piece together is that he’s impulsive, apathetic, and detached, but at other times hyperactive, charming, and crudely comedic. He also posts these very odd videos that characterize a seriously messed up, sadistic sense of humor. Some of them also mimic or reenact scenes from horror movies. Nothing about directly killing people or pretending to, though there are implications and allusions to this. One in particular was a spot on recreation of the Would You F**k Me? scene from SotL which was highly unsettling.

Some of their fights have largely been about his personal issues in juxtaposition to her own. She’s been in an abusive relationship before but in ways that were much more obvious and direct, and she broke it off.
I worry this is a much more subtle thing and that he could suddenly snap, or that he may already have and is just putting on an air of sanity or something.

Now I may be just paranoid, which is why I’m coming here, but this particular recipe of serial killer obsession and history of mental illness makes me fear for her safety.
His parents are almost never there, which only adds to it.

What do you guys think? What should I do?I fear confronting her about it will make her not trust me and withdraw. I’ve considered approaching someone else we both know, but I’m not sure if I’m even correct in my fears. I need advice.",03Apr2019,2

No replies to my snapchats, texts, or phone calls. So i had the police go to her place and check on her. Granted i might have jumped the gun but in my mind better to be safe than sorry. So after the officer that made contact with her called me and told me his findings i get a text from her saying ""youre going to regret that"".

171,"I just started this job but it’s not looking good. I think I’m being underpaid for the work. It’s different from the job description and I thought I was qualified/ filled all the requirements ( I even checked off on added bonuses) but now I’ve been working a few weeks and while it’s not actually that much work, they’ve asked me to do more stuff. Like I can do the work technically but they’ve just given me responsibility for it, more than I’m comfortable taking as someone so inexperienced. It’s just a bad feeling I won’t be able to in the future because I don’t have anyone teaching me this stuff, even in school. Which I wouldn’t totally have minded but I don’t really have anyone teaching me or ‘showing me the ropes’ at the job (it was advertised as a entry level position that I could learn and grow from as there would be others/ there was not). Also I think my boss is inexperienced/ young too so I almost don’t blame him I think this is new for both of us so I feel kinda bad for letting him down. But from what I’ve learned in school and from what I’ve learned from this job just isn’t adding up to something good. My friends are telling me too. 

Also I’m young (F18) and this isn’t really a career I want, more of a safety net thing/ extra income thing so career and financial wise I’m totally safe from risk I think. I just wanted the experience because it seemed like a great opportunity as something related to what I want to eventually do and it still kinda is, but I’m wondering now if it’s even worth it. I can afford rent and stuff and look for other jobs (I have great parents/ savings and education/ other experience) but I really wanted this job. I think if I stayed it would eventually payoff but I’d have to really dedicate myself and I feel like there is just so much I want to do and this job doesn’t offer it, so long term isn’t what I’m looking at. 

I high-key just wanna get fired so the decision is made for me. And I don’t think it would look so bad on me, I just wouldn’t put it on my resume but then again - I’m just too inexperienced in this stuff.  Also I’m DEAThly TERRIFIED to quit a job (my FIRST job ever!) I just started, I really really want it but I don’t know if can handle it. I go to a demanding college that’s just going to get harder.

174,"He told me about how his dad used to molest him, and his mom didnt care. He lives with his mom now, and she has a lot of boyfriends who molest my friend. He's been raped countless times, and he tells me that it's no big deal because he's used to it. He's FtM transgender btw.

He texted me saying that one of the boyfriends is taking him somewhere, and he told me about what occurs during these trips. I can't take this, he means everything to me and I can't stand him being hurt. I don't know where he is right now.

I don't know what I should do. He gets CPS called on him super frequently (20+ times before) and they never seem to do anything. They go to his house, they've seen literal crack in his kitchen, pictures and recordings of his abuse, and they just don't fucking care. And when they leave, he gets beat by his mom worse than normal, and gets locked in a closet for days. 

He keeps insisting that he's fine. He asks me why I think this is so bad, and I don't know how to explain to someone why being raped by family and abused to the point of broken ribs is inexcusable and not an okay thing.

I'm just so lost. The system isn't helping him. When he turns 16 in a year I'll be in college and out of the house, and I'm thinking about convincing him to get emancipated or married or anything to get him out to come live with me.

175,"I’m not sure what to do, this just happened:

its raining and it’s night time, yet I just saw with my own two eyes someone about 6 feet 4 inches tall, thin, wearing  a sand colored overcoat with the hood up, couldn’t make out the face but could see that it was male and white, not youthful or elderly. Dude was standing in the opposite lane of a two lane road on the edge of a rusted out town as it transitions to my rural hometown. He was a little bit past a bend where people speed and go into the opposite lane. I was going the proper speed in the right lane (American), yet instead of getting out of the way he stared at me with his arms at his sides. At this point I became extremely frightened because, after originally believing he was walking back to his house down the street from a neighbor’s, I couldn’t deduce any reason for why he would be standing in the street with his arms at his sides staring at me as I approached. In my moment of fear I didn’t hit the high beams to illuminate his face; unfortunately I had just turned them off. I drove past fairly quickly in the right lane and even though he was closer to my lane than the edge of the road, he didn’t move as I drove past. I sped away in fear that he would turn around, and maybe fire a gun at me or something. But ultimately I decided to turn around about 30 seconds later, as I was driving back to the spot I saw another car that had to have seen him but they didn’t understand or didn’t want to listen to my nonverbal hand signals to stop. However I never saw the guy despite driving past two more times. I’m fuckin spooked.

I checked my credit report today and saw that my accounts open with the government for my student loans (about $5,000) had appeared as “closed” and that the explanation is “charge off/sent to collections.” When I click on the account info, it does show that I have a balance with them, but the account containing the debt itself is closed. I owed the school itself about $2,000 on top of my loans (charges that should not be there and are the fault of damage caused by my roommate, but I’m done trying to challenge that) and that was sent to a collections agency that shows the debt itself is from the university and not the government for student loans. Today I got an updated review of my credit that shows my credit score went up and that the collections account had been removed. There’s no account for collections on the report showing that it has been closed, written off, etc., it just looks like it’s completely disappeared. 

I’m hesitant to get in touch with the US Department of Education over my student loans because I don’t want them to “re-open” my loan accounts and force me to wait longer to go back to school because I have to pay off the debt beforehand.

We flirt a lot when we work with each other like teasing each other and what not and I definitely get the vibe she is into me. We can also have good regular conversations. Ive definitely noticed she goes out of her way to be around me and she always looks for ways to make fun of me and talk to me and stuff but I can tell it’s in a flirtatious manner and it’s sort of how we operate and I like it.

There are probably 7 reasons why i feel depressed most of the time and a big part of it ties into loneliness i have Aspergers, all i want is someone that i can be really close with and love and they love me back whether that be a significant other or a really good friend or whatever, it feels like no one loves me and im really lonely, i go outside alot to try and meet people also whenever im in public i hit on girls get their number etc. Whenever i get a girls number though they always end up ghosting me, i never thought of myself as average or below average looking, and i have a amazing personality, and based around the people im around it seems as im good at comedy, i have influences such as Danny mullen, Bill burr etc. And i have many hobbies and skills, and i smile at people all the time and geniunely act happy around people

But deep down eating away at my heart is this void of loneliness. I don't know what to do i cry about it alot, one time i accidentally cried about it in public got those peoples numbers after talking to them, but later they still turned me down to hang out even though i showed confidence and great personality traits

I try my best to make other people happy, if i can make someone happy even for just one damn minute it can justify everything and it makes me feel really good inside, Im a Giver.
I've been taken advantage of, which is normal it happens

It just feels like every human connection i have, Aside from my mom (love you mom) haha is ingeniune i can point at times where it felt real, but everytime i try and get close to people they always pull away ESPECIALLY when i talk about my feelings, Because oh Im Supposed to be the one to be there for people lord forbid i reach out for help.

All I want is a connection with someone. 

Someone that Says I Love you
Someone that cares about me and my mental health
Someone who wants to spend time with me
Someone who wants me to grow as a individual
Someone who wants to grow as a individual 
And someone who'd also like these same attributes from me^

I try my best to seek out people but idk man i just get super down about myself, And people sense that and they dont want some fucking (excuse me) depressed Angsty teenager.

I feel like ive tried everything at this point to not be lonely, Thats a big reason apart of my circumstanial depression, i feel like if i had someone id not be as sad as id usually be,

One time i had a best friend and he made me feel happier and different about the world
He just grew apart and wanted better things

Being a aspie its hard to sometimes understand what people are thinking in certain situations socially

Im just sick and tired of not being socially accepted by anyone. And I don't go to a real high school. I do my education in a different way, so don't say the people around me suck and that in a few years they will be gone, because thats not true i dont go to high school


Ive just tried every single thing i feel like i could, ive prayed alot to god asking him to bring someone into my life, but it just never happens, and sometimes when i see couples holding hands, or good friends smiling and being happy and having fun and seeming like good geniune people it gets me really emotional, That i dont have something like that, ive found myself almost crying or actually crying in public because of it


Anyways any advice? This is my last resort, we all just need love in this world regardless if people wanna say it or not
I just don't know what i could do to stop being so lonely and depressed, I do reach out. I do reach out to tons of people people i know and people i dont know.",03Apr2019,0
191,"G'day everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in year 11 at a all boys school in Australia. I do not really go out or get invited to parties and gaths much. Most of the kids my age go out to get pissed or go to parties to get popularity and attention and I really don't like that. I am usually doing my own thing. (Photography, science, etc) and I can feel a bit lonely sometimes. I have friends who I hang out with but not many female friends and no one who I can really discuss my interests with. My question is for people who have gone to Uni and College. Do you meet many people with similar interests or is it quite a similar environment to high school?

I'm still about 85 pounds less than I was before I lost the 100 but I just can't seem to stick to healthy eating.

I know for a fact I wanna do entertainment or something in music or fashion or something artistic in the future. I just kept business in my life so I can have a good backup plan and hopefully have something to fall back into if that art side doesn't work. I've been pretty artistic even throughout my life (played 6 instruments in my life, love movies, love music and art). I guess what I need right now is advice. How do I know if I'm happy and how do I know if pursuing music/media/film/fashion/art in general is gonna make me happy.

194,"I just want to leave my life behind. Sell all of my things, pack the necessities in my car and just drive. I have a fiancé that I am truly in love with, a full time job that supports us both and I am genuinely happy. But I can’t shake the feeling of just wanting to go and start fresh. I have this feeling that I am missing out on life. I’m only 20 and I have my own car and apartment and bills to pay and I love it, I honestly love supporting myself and being an adult. 

But my friends that are the same age as me are still living with parents and going to school or working part time and they have so much free time and nearly no responsibilities. I can’t help but be envious of their free time and lack of worry and ability to up and do things without much thought of things like getting time off work or being home to make dinner for and spend time with their SO. They’re just free, doing what they want and being happy. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m very happy with where I am right now but I have this feeling inside me that’s a mixture of regret, anxiety and hopelessness that I’ve rushed into life way too fast. I’ve been having thoughts of downgrading my car and changing to part time work so I can have more freedom but I can’t bring myself to do it because of my pride. I’m proud of myself for being able to afford a brand new car and an apartment and groceries and my parents are proud of me for it too, and that matter a lot. 

I don’t know what to do. Should I sell my car and get a more moderate vehicle, quit my job and work part time? Or just stick it out and see where I am in a few years?

We have had a sort of on/off relationship to the point where I’m not sure if we’re even dating anymore. I don’t know. The rest of this will probably be me just listing a bunch of shit I need advice on.

So for starters, we’ll start off strong. We’ll be in a great place, going out, hanging out, all that. He will cook me dinner, say he loves me and that he never wants us to be apart. He says it doesn’t matter what anyone thinks about us. Then the next day it’s as if something on him snaps.
He’ll scream and yell at me, blame me for things I have absolutely no control over. He will tell me that I’m the cause of his problems, and that he’d be better off without me. He will leave, won’t talk to me for weeks. Then the moment I make progress in moving on, he’s back.
Again, he will tell me that his life would be hell without me. That he doesn’t know where or what he’d be doing without me. 

I don’t know what to do. He just left for the third time in the last couple months. I’m scared to leave because I don’t know a life without him in it. Whether he’s mad or happy he’s always been there. I really don’t know how, (if I do) to break up with him. I’m not sure I can.

197,"Hello, I'm still a teenager in high school(16) and currently I'm going through a slight identity crisis. It's been emotionally draining and it's making me confused about who I am and who'll I'll be.

It started about a year ago when I began getting into punk culture. As I learned more about it the more I liked it. The ethics, the clothing, the way of life, most things about it really. So of course I start expressing it myself, specifically the clothes and ethics(not going extreme with the ethics). Eventually I started questioning myself a lot. Asking if I was really this way, if I should continue. I sort of ignored that voice in my head and I just continued. I've tried telling myself to just be me and not care about being punk but I cant bring myself to do it.

Another thing that I'm having problems with is doing things that bring actual happiness. At the moment I'm getting into shirt making. Which is more of a hobby than a passion but one if the reasons I keep doing it, is because I could make money off it. Its creative, I enjoy it, so I thought it would be good. But again, it's more of a hobby than a passion. I like doing it for myself but I feel that I dont really have a purpose for it otherwise. And making shirts for other people is definitely a purpose to keep doing it. I'm still paying attention to my actual passions it's just that shirt making is taking priority. It doesn't really make me happy in the first place which....also makes it emotionally draining. I dont feel like it's my strongsuit or anything I'm just doing it because I might have a purpose to keep doing and I'm interested in it.

In general, I'm pretty fucking confused about myself. I dont want to live a lie and I want do things that make me happy.

Apologies for any grammar mistakes or bad explanations, I'd be happy to elaborate if needed.

199,"First of all, sorry for any mistake, English is not my first language.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been one year that I moved away from my country to live on the other side of the world. It was my own decision, and my parents were not so happy about it,  for obvious reasons, but let me go anyway (I am 28yo).

Once here I found a job, at first it was not that bad, but now I hate it. The company is doing really bad (because of the boss bad decisions) and many colleagues already left. I am very frustrated, do a lot of overtime work (also on weekends) and feel my self esteem getting lower, as I get a really low pay compared to my experience/academics.

I am stuck here because of one single reason: **visa sponsor**. By quitting I should leave the country within 15 days. Finding another place willing to sponsor a visa is really hard, and would take a lot of time.

While here I met this amazing guy, who became my boyfriend. Last summer he came to live with me and we will move to a bigger place at the end of this month. Since the beginning of our relationship we have been talking about marriage, maybe by the end of this year.

Last week my dad was diagnosed with cancer and has to go under treatment.  I am devastated and would like to go back to help my family and support them during this hard time. But going would mean quitting my job (can't get more than 5 days off here), losing my visa and leaving my bf by himself doing all the moving. 

So, my bf asked me to marry him. If we marry he will become my visa sponsor, meaning I can leave my job without getting kicked out of the country. I could go to help my parents and come back whenever I want. By having a spouse visa I would find a new (and hopefully better) job more easily. The marrying process is long and I need to get some documents sent from my home country, it would take around 2 months, so I could move to the new place with my bf as well.

In short, marrying only has pros, no cons. 

BUT, in this situation, **how can I tell my parents I am going to marry in a foreign country?** I am afraid this is gonna break their heart and worsen my dad situation. Also, **what if they think we are marrying only for the visa issue?** 

I feel so stressed and confused, sitting here at my desk, doing a job I hate and choosing furniture whilst all this situation.

I wish it was just a nightmare...

We live in a apartment residential area with two people and we stay in the same room, one of the people that I live with is a close friend of mine who happens to be a heavy smoker, and the other does not smoke at all. Two days ago my close friend decided to go out and smoke a blunt, he came in the room shortly after (usually he takes long walks) and we told him he was strongly smelling like weed. Now our teacher lives just above us within the apartment, and it was time to head on there because it was time to study. So we walked in and right after a minute as we settle down she smells the weed. She kept quiet, however she proceeds to exit as she tries to make a phone call as she walks downstairs to our apartment so she can gather evidence from where the smell is coming from.  Apparently she made a call to the principal telling her that she suspects the two of us are doing drugs (being a close friend I am automatically put into his situation). The following day we are called into the principals office first thing in the morning and the two of us are sent to do a drug test. Mind the last time I smoked was three weeks ago with him and I took like 3-4 puffs. So we did a urine test and were sent home, however the results coming back will determine weather we are going to school or getting expelled.

I still talked to him a few times afterwards but haven’t seen him since as I’ve been to busy and both of us have to have a parent to transport us if we did want to see each other.

I talked to him during the weekend and it was a nice chat with him. This morning he’s just asked if I would like to get back with him! I don’t know what to say I like him but just as a friend. Below is the message I composed in notes but I’m not sure if it’d be ok to send ⬇️

214,"I just recently broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years. We’ve known each other for a good 7 years more or less and I had never been more in love in my life. We were young when we started dating and we pretty much grew together as a couple, with her helping me through my rough childhood issues and issues with my family and eventually helping me get out of the terrible living situation I was in with my mom. I also helped her through some really dark times in her life where she struggled with depression and self harm and kept her from falling back into it for a long time. 

A month ago we broke up because I’d fallen into one of the worst depressions I’ve ever been in. It got me kicked out of my college for not having good enough grades and kept me from going out, working and having any fun even though I tried as much as I could for her. She said she left me because she just couldn’t help me anymore and wanted me to better myself etc. days after we broke up her and a really good college friend of mine started dating and she told me they’d been flirting back and forth for pretty much my whole slump and that made everything worse for me honestly. It got bad enough to the point where I attempted suicide a few times even. 

I ended up telling her what was going on with me and it was a pretty emotional talk, I didn’t attempt it to get her back or anything I was just so hurt and confused I had no idea what to do. Anyways we ended up with me agreeing that I wouldn’t try to hurt myself or anything and she reassured me that she would always be there for me, we were still best friends, and all that. Since we had that agreement she hasn’t bothered to talk to me, hasn’t really been nice or anything towards me either. I haven’t really bothered to try and talk to her about it because I always get the same response of “I know” or “I’m sorry” no matter what I say.  Our relationship was getting more and more serious and close to the point of me proposing before it ended like this so it’s really hard for me to just cut her off like she’s done with me. She also kind of really fucked me up because even though it’s been a month I feel so scared to fall in love again because this could happen again no matter how serious the relationship seems to be. 

Basically what I’m beginning to think is that maybe she never really thought I was the one for her like I thought and that after we broke up she pretty much doesn’t want me in her life at all and is purposely trying to drive me away which sucks because now that she’s doing this I’ve been recently pulling myself out of this slump. I’m dumb and still in love with her and don’t want her out of my life but I feel like trash and like I don’t matter whenever I talk to her. Her family (who I’m really really close with) tells me to just give it time and she’ll see what she did wrong, my friends tell me to just drop her because of what she did to me and to try and move on but she’s constantly randomly giving me false hope of chances of us getting back together by saying she still loves and cares for me and acting normal when we do talk from time to time. I just need help or an answer from someone who doesn’t know us personally because I don’t know who to believe or what to think that’s happening.

I am gonna give you some background story for how this question came up for me. I am 25(M) never been romantically engaged with another person in my life and suddenly 1 year ago something switched. I met this girl in my work and long story short 1 year later i am the best possible me, lost 110 pounds, started working out and looking after myself.  


Thing is that this girl isn't in any way romantically invested in me. She sees me as a friend and only gives so much to hold on and keep me invested in her. This past year i have told her like 3 times that i like her and even told her that i am in love with her and never actually gotten the answer ""I see you as a friend"" the best i got was ""I can't specify the nature of our relationship"".


If i am honest to myself, the past year in her own way exploited my will to give her everything i got in order to boost her ego and never actually saw me in any another way but as a friend. I don't say she doesn't care about me but not in the way i want her to.

Coming to the present day, i am leaving work for a better and only have 3 days in my previous work. I have gone no contact and really helped a lot this past 3-4 weeks but i can't keep it up any more. I am afraid i am gonna leave and forget all about me. I am afraid i am gonna leave and mean nothing to her. I am afraid i have invested so much into her that i can't just let her go. I am afraid like a 15 year old that i will never feel the same way for anyone else. I feel like shot and it’s the only thing I am thinking about!


I do know that all this is unreasonable and if i actually go no contact it will help me eventually (as it has already) but i don't get why should it be that difficult? and if the time comes and actually find someone that feels the same way about me as i do how am i going to handle the possibility of breaking up and leting her go? When i cannot handle the ""break up"" with someone i never actually was with.


**TL/DR:** Fell in love with a girl in my work, told her 3 times this past year. Kept hanging out. About to leave work while in no contact with her. Cannot handle it. Life question about how do you manage to let somebody you love go? What would i do if i was in an actual relationship with her? Why do we make life so hard when is everything is much more simple!

217,"So, I lost my job the other day. I got fired after 5 weeks because they felt that I wouldn't cope well under pressure. He said that I was too kind and had a 'good soul' but he felt like he needed to 'protect me' too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am. It's been three working days and I've applied for 8 jobs. I live in a rural town in Australia, there's not a lot here. I have a diploma in beauty therapy, five years in retail, two years in sales including outbound sales, and six months in sales management. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been so lost lately because I feel like I'm doing all that I can but still I'm drowning. I contacted two job agencies, but when I went to the interview they both said that in this town, there's nothing for someone like me. They said that I'm very unique in the sense that I'm very ambitious, but there's just nothing here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I applied for two jobs in the city, five hours away from here. I got a callback from both and after screening me, they said that they wanted to meet with me in-person. Both of these positions would lead to great things and they fit my personality so well, but the problem is that if I move away, I'll be saying goodbye to the love of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yesterday my father died from stage 4 cancer. I’m currently 21 and he left when I was around 10 and would occasionally call on my birthday and holiday but that stopped when I was 14 when my brother told him to stop calling him that he was dead to us. Fast forward to last month. I get a message from my half sister that I never met that he has a month to live and if we want to see him we can. So we decided to go see him. I expected to be a short 10 minute conversation and us making peace but it turned into a 3 hour conversation that went pretty well and I’m glad we had it. He died yesterday and funeral will be in a couple days. What I’m worried about is I don’t know any of my other side of the family(and I don’t want to know them) but they seem to know everything about me and my brother. Have any of you guys went through something like this. How was it like meeting your family that you don’t know for the first time?",03Apr2019,1
219,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

This situation has a lot of backstory, but I'm not going to go too much into detail. Basically, I've been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years, let's call him Josh. 2 years into dating, he developed a friendship with this girl we will name Kat. Well, their friendship got closer and closer and I became suspicious of it (they would go to the gym together alone, he gave her shoulder massages, he would go to her apartment alone, and just hang out one on one a lot which isn't terrible, but I had a lot of insecurity issues at the time). It all came to an ugly head one night when he broke up with me - that night, he went over to her house and got drunk and spent the night at her house. I don't believe they did anything, because he told me he didn't, and I don't think either of them are those kinds of people (Josh is too prideful to cheat, if that makes sense). The next day, Kat told him that she had feelings for him. Josh told her he still loved me and was going to ask for me back because he made a huge mistake and only liked her as a friend. He asked for me back, and we've been dating ever since.

&amp;#x200B;

Their friendship eventually disintegrated afterwards. I didn't make it any easier though - once I heard she admitted she had feelings for him, I told our mutual group of friends because I was traumatized by the break up and she had confirmed what I believed to be true - that there were ulterior motives in the friendship, so I vented to everyone who would listen (how I seem to cope with things...not necessarily a good thing). I made a complete ass out of myself to our group of friends - getting drunk and talking shit about her, snooping through Josh's phone and reading their texts and overanalyzing everything, countless ""talks"" about trust and what their friendship meant to them, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole time this was happening, Josh told me that he was not willing to give up a friend \[Kat\] to fuel my insecurity. He said he had no feelings for her that were beyond friendly (but I think he has an issue with emotional \[not physically or sexually explicit\] cheating on me with his female friends by letting them get too close to him and letting them confide in him and not creating those boundaries). I guess that lines up with him telling her that he didn't have feelings for her in the 24 hours we were broken up, but his reluctance to cut someone out of his life that I was uncomfortable with made me feel terrible. It's something we still work on with his female friends.

&amp;#x200B;

This whole series of events happened 2 years ago. I haven't talked to this girl since (we tried to be friends, and she cut it off because it was weird and forced). I still think about this girl all the time and how she tried to sabotage my relationship. I have blocked on all social media, but she still comes across my mind every now and then. I want to just forget about this whole situation and move on, but I haven't been able to. I have had counseling on the subject and tried to work through it and it just hasn't worked. I still think about her and get anxious and it feels like a weird fascination I have (I'm probably making it sound weirder than it is).

&amp;#x200B;

I should mention that I have been dumped in a previous relationship for the girl that was ""just a friend,"" and it was really traumatic for me. I think that this situation may relate to that somehow. Any advice you have on getting through this would be appreciated. Thanks.

221,"I am gonna get married to my girl next month and because I will have additional responsibilities, I took a new job which paid me more. I was told that I will be on 2 months probation. I'm a software engineer.

1) One month in the job, which I thought I was doing well and going on, I realised I have not been doing up to the mark and maybe asked to leave.

2) I took time on few tasks. (I was new to the work, It took me time to understand the company's way of working)

3) My basics were also a bit flawed. 

I spoke to the manager and he dismissed me saying 'It doesn't matter to us if you're new or not, you need to get the work done'. The people too are rude to me and assume I don't know anything.

My manager is revising my salary although he said 'I don't have the confidence to tell you if you will be retained or not'. He told me 'Just work your best, don't worry too much and if anything you will be given a notice, but I need to see good work in this month'. He also said me indirectly that he might not ask me to leave at the end of probation period.

What do I do? Do I work and prove myself? The pay is good and I need it as I have responsibilities now or do I search looking for a new job? Searching a job takes time and is scary. (Because I am not single anymore, I want to be financially good).

It is also true I am not on par with other people right now. I also feel its unfair to compare me with people who are already 2-3 years in the company and they have much solid understanding of their code base. My manager dismisses this.

224,"I stupidly knocked over a glass of water near a power outlet and this caused the circuit breaker switch (for power outlets throughout the flat) to flick. There wasn't much water on the wall directly above the outlet so I assumed that the water had landed on the power bank (plugged into the socket) and had caused the trip. I removed the power bank and flicked the switch of the circuit breaker back on. Everything seemed ok as other socket appliances came back on around the flat. The socket near where the water was spilt started to make a slight crackling sound after a couple of minutes (with nothing plugged in and both switches on the outlet off). I then flicked the circuit breaker switch myself as I did not want to leave it like this. 

I noticed a small gap between the outlet fascia and the wall and thought that perhaps a few drops had snuck in that.

I figure that I at least want to leave that circuit isolated until it dries out but I wonder how long this will take. I am also wondering if I need to get an electrician to take a look.

225,"I recently bought some GP tickets (Gold Pass) to the new Avengers Movie. These Gold Pass tickets are extremely expensive, but the tickets get you into access to a private lounge before the movie, a personal waiter that brings you platters/main courses/wines, and extremely roomy seats (as big as a bed). I don't really watch Marvel movies but got peer-pressured into it by friends, which I didn't mind because I barely spend money on myself and decided it'd be a nice break from university. It originally started out as a small group of us that were getting this Gold Pass tickets to it, but one friend (CB) really wanted to join along with his little brother. He was originally going because he had two free ticket passes (which he got by questionable means), but he saw we were all going to it and asked if someone could pay for the tickets for him and his brother and he'd ""surely find a way to make it back to the person"". I reluctantly volunteered because had the most money out of anyone there (none of them are good at saving their money). We all agreed that it made more sense for one person to buy all the tickets and for everyone to pay him back. The tickets go out extremely fast at this place, and it'd be impossible to get multiple seats together in one row. So given that, I was the one that had to pay for everyone's tickets ($415.25). I stayed up till one in the morning and snagged the best release day tickets in the house; middle row and nearly the entire column. I wanted the middle seat because I paid for everything, and no one disagreed. Both my best friends, want to sit next to me and I want to sit next to them, and the group understood. SO here's where the problem came up.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on the 5th seat in the row (4th and 5th seat are closest to the middle), my best friend from high school is next to me on the 4th seat - a common friend of ours is on the 3rd seat. Before my other best friend could claim a seat the CB says ""Well I'd like a seat next to my brother. I will take seat 6, (brother) would be okay with seat 7. Would be more ideal for us to seat more centre, but this arrangement will be fine for us imo.""

&amp;#x200B;

He hasn't paid me back for his or his brother's seat, a few other people have and I'm certain the rest of the people will end up paying me before the movie releases but I'm not sure CB'll give me back the money they owe even a week after the movie. He's still a friend and I don't want to lose the friendship, but he's still annoying and I don't want to sit next to him during the entire movie.

Just trying to get some perspective on this. During the 1980s our class teacher used to get changed in front of us at the swimming baths. We saw him fully naked. Big, hairy cock and all.

I’m adamant that this was the wrong thing to do. We never saw any other teachers naked, just this one.

I’ve recently discussed it with my friends and they have dismissed it as it being a sign of the times. As he was not erect he got nothing from the situation. Because he was naked for the same reason we were, it’s all fine.

Without going much into the details, I've tried pursuing her, got rejected, then we tried to stay as friends, which was going well (we became very close), but I wanted something more between us. As I didn't want to jeopardize anything, I told her I still had feelings for her and that I needed to give myself space from her. (In hindsight, that itself jeopardized our friendship) We don't speak with each other online nor when we hangout with our mutual friends. 

I really miss her everyday, but I don't know if talking to her or standing with my decision to give space is the best thing to do. I really want to meet with her or talk to her, but I still have feelings for her.

How are you all doing today? I am coming to this sub because I feel a bit lost right now. I am 19 and in college. Studying math has carried me through a decent academic career thus far, but I'm not too shy to admit that I'm not talented. I used to have big dreams, wanting to be admired for greatness and being a cool guy in general. Now, things seem much more meek for my future. I have two whole wasted semesters where I only passed 3 classes, and I am getting really good grades now, but it doesn't matter because of the time and units that leave my academic record in shambles. I have friends in similar/same fields doing really well and at better schools. I would love to do the same, but I think that I can't because I am so behind now. I could really use some anecdotal motivation to keep pursuing a PhD, as a doctorate has been a childhood aspiration for me. It just seems so far off, and, dare I say it, I get hopeless as fuck dreaming about my dreams. I have no friends around me at all most of the year. I occupy my free time trying to get people to like me, so I 'tutor' (for lack of better words) anyone that is willing to seek my help. Last week I dropped acid partially in hopes of recouping some optimism, but I just feel inadequate still. I have the discipline and attention to do pretty well, but I don't have fun anymore and have lost passion all around the board, so my will feels dead.

I don't want to get anyone down; I hope you all are OK yourselves. Smile for inner peace and love; it will be felt in the world. I'll do the same.

I come from a Latin American nation that is typically conservative in values and culture, the Church is a huge part of everyone's daily life and Christian ideals are usually drilled into our heads from a very early age. I go to mass, try and go to confession as much as I can, and I would call myself a Christian. Of course being a Christian comes with a healthy (or so I would say) adverse attitude towards the occult, or anything that goes against the teachings of the Lord. Now here's my conundrum, there's this girl, roughly my age or older who's a friend of a friend and lives maybe an hour or two away from me. She's a cosplayer, insanely beautiful, and very ""alternative"" when it comes to her image and what she believes. Not too long ago she posted a picture (she looked gorgeous of course), but under it in the comments someone had asked if she was truly a ""Satanist"" and she answered ""of course, and all the world's issues would be resolved if everyone was"". Now I know more then the typical Boomer about the practices of modern satanism and it's philosophy so I knew better than to chalk it up to child sacrifice in the middle of a salt pentagram (could be wrong tho). She linked her Tumblr to her insta bio, and curiosity got the best of me, I click on the link and I'm immediately bombarded with images and posts speaking about the occult, paganism, witchcraft etc. and a few provacative pictures of herself. I kept on scrolling through her feed until I stopped at a text post where she delves into what she truly believes in, and just reading what she had written filled me with the most intense sense of dread BUT at the very same time this feeling of euphoria and pleasure, almost like the most sensual body high I've ever experienced in my life. The feeling reminded me of that blanket feeling I get whenever I trip on very good shrooms (yes, I'm a psychonaut, I use them recreationally and enjoy it). And now anytime she appears on my feed I get that same mixed feeling of dread and physical euphoria running up and down my body. I've never felt this way before and I don't know if it's so much about her and her physical attributes as it is her beliefs and the occultism she seems to foster. Here's the thing, I should be repulsed by it all, so why am I feeling the way I am?

259,"Hello there! I recently was volunteered by my father to watch the house of someone he works with. She has 7 cats, 4 chinchillas, and 2 fish, so when I first toured the house, I wasn't expecting it to be so spotless I could eat off the floor.

My problem is that it's been heavily implied that I stay over night when I'm taking care of her furry family. The house is filthy; as you would expect there's plenty of cat hair tumbleweeds, but besides that there's caked on dirt and god knows what all over the floor. When I arrived for the first day there were soiled sheets on the couches and floors near door frames, the general atmosphere was dingy and musky. Usually I wouldn't complain about the smell in a situation like this (once again, SEVEN CATS), but I was so bothered by the deep ingrained scent of cat loss that I couldn't sleep. I even resorted to sleeping with a bandana over my nose and mouth that'd I had doused in lavender essential oil. 

If I was only watching the cats for a few days, I wouldn't do anything beyond what was expected of me. The woman I'm sitting for seems to have kept her house in this state (as sad as it is) for a while and form the looks of it, she likes that status of her mess. But I'm not watching it for a few days, I'm going to be here for a MONTH!

It's only Day 2 and I'm incredibly uncomfortable. I typically house and pet sit for close friends and family, so this is the first time I'm sitting for someone I don't really know. 

I don't know how far I should go in cleaning the place. On one hand, it's not my job (oh, I'm not getting paid to watch the house either) to clean beyond picking up after the cats and myself, and this is someone else's house, with their personal belongings. But I'm going to be here for a month! How much should I leverage my own personal comfort against the personal space of the person I'm sorting for? I'm at a loss.

265,"Hi reddit I'm a 18yo Female currently doing my first year of undergraduate at a local university. Because the university is local I'm staying at home for now. However, my family has been and is still psychologically abusive which has pushed me to try move out.

My family has always been weird. They swear at me constantly, yell and even threaten to kick me out. This has been going on for a while. I'll give background on some of the key events that have led to my actions now. 


Background

When I was in primary school I started suffering from depression, anxiety and started self harming. I spoke to my school about it, they called my parents in and my parents reacted with anger. They told me it's all in my head, I'm doing it only for attention and that I was selfish and trying to get them into trouble. From then on I didn't rally discuss my mental health with them and even as a 12 year old started realising something was amiss.

In the years between then and the next major incident we fought constantly. They threatened to send me to a reformatory (basically juvi) for ridiculous things like not cleaning my room when told to or fighting with my sibling.

The next major event which stuck with me is this: In grade 8, when I was 14, I started showing symptoms of severe clinical depression. My school councilor diagnosed me and called my parents in. They didn't even send me to a psychiatrist or counciling until a year later, when I was 15. They only did this because I tried to commit suicide multiple times and they were tired of me ""pulling stunts for attention"", I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety and medicated. They didn't change the way they treated me, and I was still considered and told I was an attention seeking child.

Between then and now they took me off my meds when I was 16 because they couldn't afford it, despite medical aid completely covering it. In grade 11 I came top of five of my subjects and got academic honours, represented my province or region for hockey as I've done since grade 7, or when I was 13, I even got a scholarship for my grade 11 and final years of school because of my work. In my final year of school last year I came top of all of my subjects, top of my grade, played for my region and premier club hockey.


Now:

I'm doing my first year at university on a partial academic scholarship, my university doesn't give full rides. I'm apart of my universities premier hockey side and still playing for my region. When I got my scholarship, about a third of my tuition, my mom researched my universities scholarships and told me I should have worked harder to get a higher scholarship award.
My parents and I fight every single day, they swear at me as they always have, but now they're telling me to f*** off out of their house. I spend weekends away from home because of the fighting and how much stress my home beings to me.

Because of that I went to my student wellness centre. Told them everything, more than I've provided here has happened, they were shocked at how normal the abuse I face in my house has become to me. They told me to apply for financial aid to get out of my house, and wrote supporting documents which call my home abusive, describe me as having depression and an inferiority complex due to my home environments negative psychological impact on me which will inevitably affect my performance in other aspects of my life, like university.

Last week I told my parents I applied for financial aid, their immediate reaction was to state: ""did you tell them tall stories that we've been abusing you"". I was shocked, because clearly they have a guilty conscience about it and know they've messed me up. But they don't want to admit it. 

I handed everything in today, my appeal letter, the supporting documents and financial aid said they'd get back to me in a week or two. I'm nervous. I love my parents, but they've been abusive and everyone around me knows it and has encouraged me to move out.

I don't know how to break it to then that I'll be moving out if I get financial aid? They clearly resent the idea, even though they keep telling me to move out. If I get financial aid should I even tell them? Should I just move out and not tell them how I secured aid? Should I try to keep the relationship with them going, because it'll probably be healthier if I move out, and I'd still depend on them for medical aid because my country only has private ones, I'd also like to keep them in my life because they're my parents, I love them but know I can't live with their constant fights, name calling and psychological abuse.

Tdlr: I may or may not get financial aid and move out of my abusive home environment. How do I break it to my parents when I have no way to predict how they'll react, or should I even try do so? ",03Apr2019,2
266,"I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her, she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit.

268,"Hello. Firstly, English is not my first language, so I apologize in advanced for any errors and this will be long. TL;DR at the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my situation: I am currently pursuing my postgraduate degree and I'm mostly self - funded. I work a part time job that pays enough for me to get by on my own monthly. I'm by no means living a luxurious life for a student, but I feel that what I already have is just enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning my parents told me about a postgraduate student funding being open for application. I won't mind getting the extra money if I can, but what's currently stopping me from applying is that one of the conditions stated that priority will be given to students coming from low-income families.  I can still apply for it, but this means that this funding is targeted for those who are REALLY in need of financial aid, and I don't feel myself belonging to that category. I'm in a dilemma because my parents are telling me to 'just go for it' but I feel guilty when I think that there could be another student out there having a tight financial situation and my application just ruins their chances of getting aid out of poor luck or something. Yes I know this sounds nitpicky, but this has always been how I deal with things like this. Previously I had skipped free food giveaways for students because I thought some broke and hungry guy out there won't get to eat if I take the free food that could have been his only meal for the day (while I can still afford several on my own). I'm sorry if I sound like I'm trying to humblebrag, I really am not. I just hope it clarifies how I'm viewing my current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, this whole thing is happening during a rather stressful time for me. I'll be having a mid-term exam tomorrow and don't plan on leaving my room until then to study, but applying for the funding would require me to go to some offices to get student status confirmation etc etc. It's damn tedious, I have no other days to do that as I'll be traveling home the day after, I won't be back to campus for a whole week and the application closes by the time I return to campus. This application only opens once a year and this is my only chance to do it as I'll be graduating next year and no longer eligible. Having the extra money will of course be great especially at the start of semesters as I have to settle all my tuition fees at once, but I'll be having a long break this July and plan to go back to doing my freelancing while working my part time job as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that it's my decision to make, but I also know that my parents will be making faces and might even bring it up occasionally after I tell them I'm not applying. I've just had a call from my mom who was freaking out a bit after I told her (over text) that I won't have the time to take care of the papers and will just have to pass. Don't get me wrong, I love my parents; they are good people who just want the best for their child and please don't tell me otherwise. But we've been in a similar situation before and it seems to me that they don't really understand my 'what if someone needs this more than I do' stance. How would you handle this if you're in my place?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Parents want me to apply for financial aid, I don't want to out of moral dilemma and time constraints.",03Apr2019,1

I broke up with my ex couple of months ago, it is a long story and i won't get into detail but we both had fights here and there and there were external factors influencing us. She was originally from the US but stayed here in Europe with me with a certain visa.  


We were both very honest about our feelings and past experiences, after her father dad around the age of 12 she started to have very bad depression was was thinking of killing herself every single day. She went on SSRI from the age of 13-19. She thought about killing herself a lot of times, but says that her mother still being alive is keeping her from doing that, but right now she does not care. She says that she still has that ''feeling'' of feeling depressed and of wanting to die, she went to professionals, was on medication, etc. I've been with her for around a year and 4 months and there were times when she had bad suicidal thoughts of just wanting to end it and what the point was, she would not move out of bed for the entire day, and she would not eat. This same behavior also happend when she was here with me in Europe.  She recently contacted me through a certain platform saying she misses me, i was in shock because we went totally no-contact for around a month and a half.   


I do not know her current situation in detail but i know she is in a rbnb, has one friend near her but she dislikes her now because she prioritizes her boyfriend over her, so she is cutting contact. She says that ''it's over'' for her and that she is tired of waiting another year to experience the same depression. She apologised to me and mentioned that when she was mad, she thought she was mad but in reality she said she was in the wrong for fighting againt me. She just keeps saying that she had these thoughts ever since she was 12 years old, and now she is finally done with it. She is not going to kill herself right now she said, but soon.   


I tried saying everything to her, that i did not think she was ''disgusting'' or that i ''hated'' her, even though i did not say those things in recent conversations. I try to be as supportive as possible and even tried to explain how it was for me, she said she still loved me but knew this was very selfish of her, but that she had to do this. I told her i would talk to her every single day and said that there is always hope and that there are people out there that care. But she does not care and she is pretty determined and i'm very scared. But she keeps responding with self-loathing texts saying things such as ''it was such a mistake that a terrible person like me went with a guy like you'' and stuff like that.   


What does a ex-boyfriend do in this kind of situation, she says that she still has pictures of me saved and stalks me on a certain forum and that she just still loves me. I do not want anything to happen to her, i would be seriously devistated.   


tl;dr: me and my ex had to break up couple of months ago, she suddenly texts me that she is finally done living and that the time is coming to an end soon.

273,"I'm 20. My ex-girlfriend is 22. I had sexual experiences before, but she was the first girl I slept with. She was the first girl I had a long-term relationship with. We dated for 2 years.

The break up was 4 months ago and it was pretty rough.

I can look at pictures of her without feeling that much pain. It doesn't ruin my mood. I can think of the time we had and the happy moments we had are still happy to me, but I also know that the break up was probably for the better, even though I should have been the one that did it, and not her.

But 2 things fuck me up.

The first thing is jealousy. In my country we have a holiday that consists of people waring costumes, drinking a lot of alcohol and pretty much sleeping around. During these days I wasn't able to do anything, because I couldn't stop thinking about the question if she has sex with another guy. Afterwards I visited the homepage of her uni (small one) to see if they uploaded pictures of their students because of their costumes. I searched through all the pictures. I wanted to see if she had a ""slutty"" costume or if she already had something with another guy (holding hands or something). Luckily for my psych they didn't have a picture of her, most likely because she either did not wear a costume or because she wasn't there. But I can't stop thinking about this. I'm so scared of her having sex with another guy. I don't know why it is so extreme, maybe because she was the first (and still is the only) girl I had sex with ?

And the second thing is me worrying about her. She had a lot of issues. Schizophrenia, borderline, bipolar. She broke up during a manic episode. And usually when bipolar people come out a manic episode they heavily regret what they did during the manic episode. They for example buy things for thousands of dollar, give away all their money, they have a lot of sex without protection (Which is of course pretty bad for my first issue) and other stuff. It's not that rare that they commit suicide once they are out of the manic episode. These episodes can last from 1 week to multiple months. During the relationship, whenever we had fights, she would say that she would commit suicide if the relationship would ever end (Yes I know, emotional blackmailing.). She even said that a few weeks before she got into her manic episode and before she broke up. So I think there is a really high chance she will commit suicide, and it gets even worse because she tried to commit suicide 2 times in the past, before we started dating, and guess who was there for her and called the ambulance ? That was me. And now I'm scared that she feels too much shame and regret to contact me after her manic episode. After the break up I messaged her and told her she can contact me whenever she needs help, but I'm not sure if she will do it.

How do I deal with these 2 things ? How did you deal with them ?",03Apr2019,1

ive had depression for a couple years, but lately it's been very serious. actively harmful thoughts have begun cropping up, and im worried i might act on them soon if i dont get help.

ever since i first learned i was depressed, my friends have been my only source of happiness, and my only real reason to live. i could never look forward to my future or anything.

this changed when i started dating a friend of 5 years. he gave me a brand new hope for the future, and a new kind of joy. recently, though, i realized that he's been mentally abusive and controlling. now, i'm not even sure if he's still faithful to me. he very well could be cheating as i type this. a couple days ago, he told me that he loves someone else and talked about how perfect and attractive they are, but today said that he wasnt thinking straight due to the heat. i then learned that this same someone said ""i love you"" to him just yesterday. these conversations marked the first time in forever i thought of cutting myself. maybe thats an overreaction, i dont know.

until now, the worst its gotten is ""i could jump in front of this truck and everything would be over"" without ever really considering it, but now ive noticed ive started thinking things like ""this isnt worth it anymore, its just spiraling deeper and deeper"" or ""maybe if i cut myself, the pain will take my mind off things for a while,"" and i've started crying a lot more than before. i'm on antidepressants, but they aren't working anymore. ive also tried helplines, but they dont help me at all. the only thing i havent turned to is drugs, and i think im getting close to them, too.

I want environmental issues to be taken seriously, I want people to not blame assault victims for ""asking for it"" and say the deserved it if they dresses provocatively. I don't want to ever see my friends getting arrested for being at a party where man and women are present. I don't want prices of food going up hourly, and our currency taking a hit so badly that minimum wage is 100 dollars a month now. I don't want to be at war with the world, I hate that everyone hates us and our leaders seem to hate everyone. I'm sick of corruption and powerful rich people not caring about other people's lives. 

I'm just sick of it... 

I have a chance to go abroad for my studies starting this fall. My family will have to give me their entire savings to make this happen, and I will have to live off of water and bread most likely. Or, I could stay another year and try and get a better offer... It's just that I really don't know if I can take another year of this. Nobody knows what'll happen in a year. A war could break out, we could become the next Venezuela. Or, things might get better - I don't know how that might be the case, but let's just say it might. I don't know what I'll do if things get worst though. I don't want to live anymore if they get worse, I'm already 25 and I've never lived because I've spend all my life hiding from the outside because I hate everything out there. I just want a chance to live, be free, just for one fucking day. I'm crying writing this, because most people won't undertstand how it feels to be trapped your whole life and knowing this is not the way a person should live. 

I want very simple things. I want to go to the cinema, and dress how I want to and how I want to dress is wearing jeans and a t-shirt. No head covering scarfs, no long dress on top, no covering your hair and arms... I just want to be free. I want to travel and see places. (I can't because a) very strict and restricted visa requirements and b) can't ravel without a male guardian's permission (father or husband).) I want to go to a concert for music that I actually listen to, I want to be able to sing and post them online (women can't be singers - it's illegal and you will get in trouble if you post it online, if you're found out as one girl got in trouble for posting herself dancing on insta! ) 

I don't have the balls to run away, mostly because I'm holding on to hope that things might get better... I just wanna die so I don't have to live through this. I don't know what else to do... I also really can't trust therapists, otherwise I would be talking to a professional. One I went to told me I was delusional and too in love with western culture that it was clouding my judgement and I was developing behavioral issues. Like, fuck you! Just because I think everyone deserves to love who they are and who they want makes me sick ? And oh god, the ones that suggest you get closer to god ... STFU. 

sorry, this was a rant and I maybe even didn't ask for advice... I mean, I kind of am. I don't know if I hsould wait out the year or just leave everything and run away from this all... I keep thinking, I hung in there for 25 years, I can wait another just to maybe find a better option - but what if there is no better option? ",03Apr2019,2

I really don’t want to lose my therapist, I’ve been working with them for over a year now and I’ve become a bit attached.

278,"Hi guys, I guess I'm flocking to Reddit whenever I experience minor moments of inner conflict now.... Kidding! I just don't want to ask my friends because I've been avoiding their texts for a couple hours now.

It's currently about 2am. I have a doctor's appointment at 10am and plan to wake up at 8am. At the latest, I can even get up at 9am.

The problem is, I tried to sleep by midnight (which would've allowed me to get adequate sleep), but I failed. I blame this on my plummeting sleep schedule from the last 3 days. I decided to pull an all-nighter (which, in hindsight, I now realize as a dumb idea) due to the fact that I have an almost impossible time waking up with any less than 8-10 hours of sleep (I can function just fine on less, it's fighting off the desire to slip back into sleep that's difficult).

I've functioned fairly well on 0 sleep (though I must admit that I've knocked out in public several times doing this) in the past, so I can brush off the sleepiness I'm experiencing now. Or... give in and go to sleep.

280,"Hi.
Lot going on in my head, not sure if this is the right place to ask, but hoping someone has some pointers or could even put me in the direction of the right group.
I’ve always been something of a loner, and by and large I’m okay with that - I had a good childhood and family life, no real drama there, and am blessed with a good set of friends around me, but I’ve always had trouble with romantic relationships. I believe it’s mostly a confidence issue, and I am known to massively overthink and overanalyse situations to the point that it gets in the way of my happiness (more on that later). I’m 34, I’ve only had a few real relationships (the longest being six months), and up until the last few months have had no physical activity barring light kissing in my life. 
Mostly because in my head I overthink these things, it has definitely been the cause of other relationships breaking down, and due to the trust and emotional attachment I need to form with someone to even try anything more, I can overinvest and overdevelop a relationship in my head to accommodate or perhaps compensate for this.
For nearly two months now I’ve been seeing this amazing girl who’s shown an amazing well of patience with this part of me, and other issues that pop up due to my lack of experience in relationships. We’ve developed well past anywhere I’d been before, into the new and exciting realms of sexual touching, but even at this after several minutes I feel out of my depth and almost scared, being brutally honest with myself, about what to do next. My brain can’t switch off, I’m amazingly attracted to this girl emotionally and physically, but there’s still this big barrier that I can’t quite work out how to get around it. I trust her completely, we can talk quite openly and honestly about this, which in and of itself is a massive deal for me, but I’m worried this block in my head could be something more. I’m fairly confident it’s not anything in the way of a porn addiction (given that’s my only other sexual experience) which I did read into just in case, but I am known to be quite anxious from time to time so we’re wondering if there’s perhaps something mentally going on there, so I’m looking into counselling. This girl means so much to me and is genuinely trying to help, but I feel I need to be actively doing what I can to make her feel appreciated and trying to make myself ‘better’ for her. Well, for me as well I suppose. I’m very aware I’m developing a codependency here already, and want to make sure it’s on the right terms and is reciprocated, so I want to do everything I can to be in the right mindset and that I don’t unburden her needlessly. 
Just wondering if anyone has any advice or resources that could help? Can’t imagine I’m the only person on the internet who’s been through this. 
Many thanks in advance. ",03Apr2019,1

Hey, so I don’t quite understand this situation and I don’t know how to rectify it, any advice would be appreciated (sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile).

So me and my mother were watching TV together last night when she brings up her friends boyfriend, in short she says he has a great personality even though he’s ugly, cause “he’s this short, 5ft little thing”. She has mentioned how she thinks short men are ugly in the past and I’ve brushed it off but recently I’ve been self conscious about my height (17 year old male, I’m 5foot and a bit, haven’t fully measured). So I got upset and left quietly to my room, after a bit I came out of my room and told her that what she said hurt my feelings and told her why (I have anger issues so I am trying very hard to approach things respectfully and open mindedly, as I have learnt in therapy). Anyway, she says I’m attacking her for her opinion and I ask her why she is getting angry over something she said that hurt me, and after this she started crying, I retreated to my room immediately and heard her crying for another 20 minutes. We haven’t spoken since (24 hours) either. Please help, did I do something wrong and how can I fix this, I’m just learning these skills from my therapist to tackle these situations politely and it all went to shit, I don’t know if I did it wrong.

285,"I (26f) have had a nice childhood until I was eleven. My parents then got very focussed on school results. They had transferred me at 12yo to a different class and lower level education without telling me (because of my “study attitude”) and that changed our relationship. They would only talk about school work and were very strict. I started lashing out by not putting any effort in highschool, skipping class and just had minimal conversations with them eventhough I obvs still lived in the same house. Passed with minimal effort. Got diagnosed with ADD/ADHD at 17 (hence my wrong “study attitude”). By the time I was 18 I went travelling and then lived in a closeby city. I visited them maybe once every 3-4 months. My sisters have a good relationship with my parents (I am the youngest) but always state that I had “different parents” as they treated me very different. I rocked my uni studies (4.0GPA) as I was highly motivated to show everyone I could do anything I wanted if I set my mind to it. The relationship with my parents was better as I was performing well from an eduction perspective. However, I never felt safe to share. I just shared my study accomplishments as I knew they would appreciate it. 

After my studies, I started working for a big global corporate. I had a highly responsible job, with a lot of international travel, great salary, super competitive. I worked 60 hour weeks and got completely absorbed by the job. I was close to a burnout when my closest friend commited suicide. I was devastated and couldn’t work anymore. I had to take a lot of time to recover (luckily my long term bf could cover costs) and have now started a simple job for some cash and to get on my feet again. I saw my parents sporadically in this period because I didn’t feel safe with them and my dad doesn’t say much and my mom mostly talked about herself. My oldest sister was a big support for me, as was my bf. 

I have thought recently about doing a new study to become a primary school teacher. I have loads of experience working with kids (9 years scout leader) and love explaining, singing, group dynamics, and find it so important to listen to kids, take them seriously, and see what they need. Everyone I talk to tells me they think it is a great idea and that the job totally fits me. Especially my friends who work as teachers themselves. 

These past few months I have tried to work on getting a better relationship with my parents. I go to see them more often en share more. My mom asked my bf how she could improve contact and he told her to listen more and not give unsolicited advice. She did that once in a conversation and it was nice. 

Yesterday I went over and decided to share my idea of becoming a teacher. They told me it is a terrible idea. (They are both teachers). My mom told me I don’t have what it takes and I couldn’t handle it. (My mom can’t handle it herself and constantly has fallouts with colleagues as she is seen as a difficult colleague to work with). I told her I felt as if she was projecting on me but she got angry about that and said that as a mother she needs to be able to say this and that she was just being honest. That I didn’t understand how hard it was to work in Education. My dad told me it was going to be very hard to work &amp; study at the same time and that I would get a burnout again. I was just flabbergasted. They show me no support, and completely crush me. 
I am just left wondering if they don’t see my strengths? Don’t really know me? Can’t look further than their own experiences? Think I am utterly weak? 

I just feel so sad. And this is a feeling I have had time and time again after seeing them. It just makes me feel worthless. 

Should I stop reaching out to them? Just stay with my positive network of friends and avoid being alone in a room with my parents? ",03Apr2019,1
287,"Long winded post inbound. I don't use reddit, and this is a throwaway. I'm used to shit on the internet but please be kind as this is one of my most sensitive topics atm.

Few things first,

I'm 15(m)

Girl (12)f

I'm currently in my freshman year of high school, but this started in middle school.

   This whole thing started in middle school, the school I went to combined grades like this. I first noticed her the first day of 8th grade year.  We would exchange flirtatious gestures pretty frequently. But it was never enough for me to be 100% certain that she liked me. (probably just me having low self confidence, still do but I'm better about it now).  Anyway, fast forward to spring, its the play. Me being the introvert I am, join the tech crew. I got to do the lighting and sound crew. At the end of one of the rehearsals, when their names were announced as they bowed, she asked if she could point out my job and be the one to give me the shout out. Of course, the drama teacher said no. Maybe I'm just too hopeful but that kinda seems like a flirting tactic. Idk. 

   Few weeks later, I build up the courage to ask her out. As you can guess, she says no. I took it really well, and just told myself, well you'll move on. But it wasn't just the rejection that my brain had to deal with... No.. People who I once called friends began telling me how wrong it was that I would want to date her. And how ""she's just a kid"". That one really resonated as I never even thought of age as a problem. However, something I noted as interesting was none of the girls had a problem with it, they actually told me we would have made a cute couple. Which confused me even more. I simply took it as because one of the boys had bad luck with her sister that that was the reason he was so against it. Gossip in middle school passes quickly so, it was forgotten and things were normal a few weeks later. 

She still was sending me a few signals, things like try to make random eye contact and maintain it, mostly subtle things. This confused me even more because I just asked her out and figured that would be the definitive answer if she liked me or not. Another fast forward to our school trip, the entire seven hour bus ride there, she would look back right at me and as soon as I looked she would look away. Not much happened on our school trip because we weren't in the same groups, but she did say Hi to me which was odd and out of the ordinary. On the bus ride back, she started talking to me, and even made comment about whether my name was my x or y (my good friends name), when she clearly knew my name was x because of the attempted shoutout she gave me during the play. Oh and don't worry the same ""friends"" who gave me shit for asking her out waltzed in on this one too. Making her obviously uncomfortable and move seats. We got back to school, and had about a month left. 

 I was told she was leaving the school and thought, yay bittersweet moment. But before then I had a month still. Sorry I'm becoming delirious its fucking 2 am. Anyways, new electives are chosen and theres a knitting elective, which she takes. One lunch period I was just sitting there on my phone, like a true 2000s degenerate, messaging on discord to my friends. When all of a sudden her group of friends and her come up and sit at the same table as me, when all the other tables were open.. I look up and say hi, thats about it after that its silent and we are all just awkwardly sitting there. When she says ""You wanna join?"". I politely decline because I'm not about to make a fool of my self by showing my presumed horrid knitting skills or get put into some kind of trap. I comment on how good they are and then silence. She then randomly says ""please don't judge us"" and I say no, I don't have judgements to pass other than the fact that they're good. 

 Lunch shortly ended and nothing happened for the rest of that year. 

  But, this year, she stayed, which shocked me. I thought she was leaving, so I moved on to another girl, my friends cousin who (turned out to be a catfish, girl was real and her cousin but didn't know who I was.) First school event of the year, I notice she is still doing the eye contact thing. I enjoy the attention, but am still confused. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Fast forward again, few months into the year a friend starts calling me an annoying nickname, of course she picks up on this and starts doing it, but instead of just saying something like ""Hi (dumb nickname)"", she keeps asking, almost like she's trying to keep a convo going, like, literally I quote ""Hi ""nickname"", hows life, hi nickname hows school. But, I was so afraid of talking to her and looking like a creep that I just shut down and didn't say much other than giggle a bit. ( i still want to go back and punch myself in the fucking face) anyways. That's about it, I really don't know what to do at this point. I'm stuck, I don't think I should ask her out, but I also wanna follow her on instagram to see what she does when I do. But I'm also worried she may stop doing anything IRL.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know any advice is appreciated, just please, don't call me a ""freak"", ""

"", or weirdo. You're not original. I've been told it all by the same 3 people who I now despise. If you do think theres something wrong with a 12 and 15 year olds (3 years age gap, 2 grades.) Let me know respectfully.

299,"Throughout my life I’ve had reoccurring nightmares, but a few years ago they went away. However, a year or so ago I started getting really terrifying reoccurring nightmares where I was sexually assaulted (sometimes it lead to rape, sometimes it did not).

The part that terrifies me the most, is that the assaulter changes in every dream. It’s always a man I consider close to me or look up to (dad, boyfriend, friend, teacher, etc.).

These dreams are usually really surrealist, where it gets weirder as the dream goes on. I drown, am eaten alive, as I’m running away the halls become abstract mazes (common), I shrink, etc.

Compared to other reoccurring nightmares I have, these feel incredibly real. I wake up in physical pain in places I was touched/violated. I become afraid of the assaulter in real life even though I know it was a dream.

I’ve never been sexually assaulted by a man before; and I don’t understand why this keeps happening. I have been sexually assaulted by a woman before, which lead to internalized misogyny for awhile, however I’m practically over that now.

I’m in college right now and can’t afford to see a psychologist. The counsellor here was a woman who tried to make me admit that I hate and distrust men (she was really crazy) which is not the case, my friend group here is mostly males.

Then my mom is gonna come home at like 6 or 7 because she always does extra hours even though we have a great income and of course, she's gonna agree with my dad because she has stockholme on him and she knows that he's the main income provider and she'll probably live a pretty shit life without him, so that's why she's not leaving this alcoholic psychopath in denial. I'm genuinely scared of my parents at this point, what do I do? This school year has been really fucking shit, I've had bad grades since pretty much 3rd grade, I skip a lot because I can't fucking stand being at school anymore and I always fight with my parents.

301,"Alright, I'll try to keep this almost year-long story, short and summarized. So Ive liked this guy (let's call him George) since the beginning of the year. We sat together in science, and one day he asked me out and I didn't FUCKING realize it like the dumbass that I am. So I went on, thinking's he wasn't interested. Then another guy comes along (lets call him Stephan or sum shit) and shows complete blatant interest. I, in turn, was slightly interested back. Here's the mother fuckin' kicker- George and Stephan are friends. I did not know this, but they are. Now George recently told me that Stephan only is depressed and wants to fuck, so I wasn't interested anymore. I have no more feelings at all for Stephan, but now that I'm back to George and not being an idiot, he feels like a second choice and that is NOT what he is. He is the sweetest, smartest, most generous person I have ever met, and he's funny. Tell me that you find that in a guy regularly. Me and George have been hanging out recently, he never lets me pay by saying ""Thats not how this works"", and he's so sweet. He does not think it's a date (i wish it was). I have this other friend, lets call her Ruby, and she is friends with George. She says ""There's no way he doesn't like you- He looks at you A LOT and he tries to talk to you every chance he gets. He talks about you and gets all flustered when you start to walk over"". Then later on, I asked her, ""Then why does he make fun of me all the time?"" Ruby said ""It's him flirting, just in his own George way"". So yesterday I was leaving his car and grabbing my stuff, and I said ""You know that I'm your favorite crackhead"" and he just looked all flustered it was adorable. But when I'm with him, it doesn't feel like he acts that way. What do you guys think? what should I do? Should I give him time or space or should I make the next move? Thanks &lt;3",03Apr2019,0

I recently saw a few articles and studies about introverts, HSP´s(\*Highly Sensitive Person\*) and and it literally blew my mind. I found peace and sort of happiness, i found answers i´ve been searching for many many years. Ever since i was a little kid i´ve been extremly sensitive, i cried and got that huge lump in my stomach as soon as something hurt or i got stressed or when i got put up aginst the spot... i cried...and cried...and cried. I have extremly high standars which i´ve had hundreds of people including my family commenting and complaining about it´s no big deal, it´s fine etc...but my brain has always says the opposite. I get extremly mad at myself when i´m not performing good enough. Even if it is good or enough my brain has set the bar and i still get mad at myself for making as much as simple small mistake. About 30 minutes ago i saw an article about introverts. Then I saw an article about HSP which also had a test. I did the test and after after evry question my jaw dropped more and more untill it hit the ground. It felt like the articles and studies were about me, then....I felt the weirdest feeling ever. I felt like peace and happiness like i´ve never felt it before. I found out about why i´m like this. I see no one else being like me so i thought i was insane somethimes or just very special. I´ve never liked talking about me being highly sensitive and about my high standards but this literally blew my mind. I sat in my chair with my jaw dropping to the ground and then I  just sat there thinking about myself. I found answers, I felt inner peace sort of. \*Shifu taught me!\*

I like boobs, and it normally doesn't affect things much. But sometimes, when I have a really significant crush on someone, I become not only obsessed with their boobs, but I have this sort of jealousy of their girl friends who get to see them. I know it's completely wrong (and I've tried so hard to think of ways around it), but I have this slight anger that it would be so easy for them to show me, but they don't. I realise thinking like this is damaging , controlling and wrong. I don't have a right to see their bodies, but I feel like I do, and I can't shake it. If I find out there was a situation where I *could* have seen their boobs and I wasn't in the right place at the right time, I basically have a full-blown panic attack and can't breathe properly for several minutes. If I cut contact with the person, the bad feelings go within a few days, but I want to work through the problem, I don't want to have to cut contact with everyone I develop a serious crush on. This has happened maybe 5 or 6 times in my life. I know I need to see a psychologist, but has anyone else experienced this, and do you have any advice/just want to talk about things to share experiences? It would be great to find out I'm not the only one

She did admit to having a currently failing relationship and having a crush on me as well for a few months. We ended the night with a nice long hug and said our goodbyes. A phone call a day later while sober confirmed that what was said that night was true and she needs time to figure things out. She did say that the way I am as a man is what she is looking for.

Now, I am not the best at dealing with these situations as I have been cheated on before and spent the last 5 years just minding my own business. I haven't felt this way for over 10 years towards anyone and I am giddy with joy over the news but at the same time I am respecting her current situation and not trying to convince her to dump the boyfriend.

For about a year now, I've been using ritalin aka methyfenidate for my attention deficit disorder (ADD, not ADHD) and I have a problem with dealing with the so called hangover that occurs when is wears off.

This hangover is becoming so strong that I need to use the Wim Hof breathing method to gain control over my frustrations. So far I haven't seen any post on how to deal with this and how to deal with those rapid and difficult thoughts. Sometimes I drink a beer when it wears off, which makes me very relaxed and calm most times. On school days I use 30/40mg twice (once in the morning and once in the afternoon).

317,"To start, I'm a college freshman, and I double on viola and violin for various ensembles.

There’s a theatre group in Cape Cod, the [College Light Opera Company](http://www.collegelightoperacompany.com) that holds an 11 week season through the summer, playing one show per week. I was invited by my orch director to join the pit orchestra as it’s viola player, as they needed one. My room and board, mileage, etc is completely paid for, and I’d get a stipend at the end of the summer. I just would need to submit audition materials and that sort of stuff. The thing is, is that it’s the entire summer. It runs from June 7 to August 25, one day before the fall semester begins. So save for maybe 3 weeks after finals I’m gone. And it makes me anxious because I’ve never had a roommate before (I commute to school), and I’m very quiet and what not so I feel like it would be tough making friends I guess (it’s not as easy as “being sociable”). Granted, I’ve never been to Cape Cod so I have no clue how it’d turn out. It looks amazing, since I love playing and being outside, but what I get from going there I feel like I’m sacrificing something at home. And that’s what is making me so anxious about this: whatever decision I make, I’m making a sacrifice, and I’m unsure which is the better one. And it feels like I would have to rush around right before school starts with driving, unpacking, etc. so I sort of would be tired from the getgo. I wish there was a way to only leave for maybe half the time, though ofc once I’m locked into the contract I’m in. I realize that, esp. as a science major this might be one of the last times I could feasibly commit so much time to playing, but I really don’t know if I’m letting my anxiety get to me, or if it really isn’t for me. I have to let my teacher know by the end of Wednesday or Thursday at the ABSOLUTE latest and I still am so unsure, I feel like I haven’t had time to really think, what with stress from school and what not.

323,"Hi,

When I was 19, I enrolled in a degree in cost engineering, I was doing really well in my degree and about a year and a half in I managed to get full time work at one of the largest builders in my city (This particular builder in my city has a reputation for being one of the better builders to work for in terms of salaries, work life balance, benefits etc.).

Pretty much from the get go I was thrown in the deep end and given a lot of responsibility, and less supervision than I would have liked (If i missed something in the specifications or drawings, I could cost the company hundreds of thousands of dollars). The work was incredibly stressful and during the less busy parts of the year I was doing 45 hours a week and when it was busy I was doing 70 or 80 hours a week. Some of the hours I was doing was due to me being new and taking longer to do things, but the senior members were still doing 50 or 60 hours. About six or seven months in I was fully burnt out and what little passion I had for construction had gone and I subsequently resigned from my job and transferred into a teaching degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since resigning I have started to doubt my decision, mainly due to my earning power being greatly diminished. In my previous field of study salaries start at about 40k (what I earned) and would have capped out at about 200k 10 years in, however if I worked my way up management, it could get up to 300 or even 400k (these salaries are really rare, so its unlikely I would ever earn this.)   
Whereas a teachers salary starts at 70k and caps out at 100k, unless you become a head of department or principal in which case its about 115. I am certain that I would like teaching more, as I get one well with children and have always enjoyed teaching people, however this is a massive blow to my earning potential. My head is saying go back to cost engineering for the money and prestige, whereas my heart is saying to go into teaching, as I will find the work more fulfilling, less stressful and less life consuming and the salary still isn't bad. 

The other thing that concerns me is my age. I am 22 and will be starting my course in July, so when I graduate I will be 25 years old. All my friends already have degrees and are working and I will be starting again. apologies for the incoherence of my post, I've been a little depressed recently and have been drinking. What do you guys &amp; gals recommend? Thanks in advance.

325,"I'm really agitated and having trouble thinking, so sorry if this post is a bit out of order or lacking a few details, I'm just trying to get all the important information down.

I'm an 18 year old male (19 in 2 weeks) living in a small town (1,500 people). High school dropout, unemployed, need out of my current town.

I dropped out of high school because I felt the staff were targeting me, and those who weren't had higher expectations for me than others because I was the ""smart kid."" Expectations that I either wasn't able to or at the time was too stressed to meet.

I've always had trouble thinking for myself, figuring out how to do things that wasn't explicitly stated somewhere on the internet or a handbook, but academically I was incredibly smart. I lack critical thinking, but I retained information like a sponge. I was one of those kids that slept through class and aced every test. ACT composite of 29. (Highest in my school that year.)

I live with my grandmother, and we live off of government income of less than $900 a month for the both of us. That pays for our electricity, propane, internet, food, etc. We occasionally have enough left for a pizza, it's tight.

I was employed when I was in school. A little backstory; our town has a community building, court house, jailhouse, and public transportation all under the same IT department. My job was to assist the IT Director for all of this. My job title was Network Administrator. I did well, I liked it, but I when I couldn't handle the pressure from school anymore. I stopped going to school, and my job required me to be in school or I can't be at work, so that as well. I eventually quit my job.

All of that would NOT be an issue, it's what I did next that solidified me in this rut. After quitting school and work, I spoke to some of the school staff, my employers, etc and got that job back. Which was great, however, I was still stressed, and emotionally unstable. It lasted about another month and I did the same thing again. This time I completely ghosted everyone and everything. I never went back to school, work, etc, and I didn't tell anyone a thing. I used and completely blew my second chance at employment.

Now I have a reputation with the only youth job assistance whatever you call it program. In this small town, every employer knows what I did, and I can't get another chance with the youth program because I dropped out of high school.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all of my story that I can really recall right now, so now what I want to do and what I have.

I want to get out of my current town, for that I need money, for money I need a job, and I need to get a job online. I'm still insanely gifted with tech and am willing to learn and do research in similar fields. Once I get out, I want to get my Diploma or GED if I can't make some kind of a deal with a school in another area. If I land myself an okay job either still online, or in this new area, I want to use my financial background and ACT scores to get myself some kind of scholarship to an ""okay"" college. Nothing special.

What I have right now is a lot of time; I can spend basically all of my time invested into some kind of online work. I have decent internet speeds so anything involving download/upload of large files won't be an issue; and I have all of my technical knowledge. Also, my mother has saved $1,000 to give me to invest in getting my drivers license and a car.

For reference ; I'm 25/F, VERY healthy

Awake at 5:00am, workout from 530-7am

Work from 8:00am to 5:00pm

Dinner and a bit of reading/crochet until I sleep at 8:30pm. I keep this schedule five working days a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how not be so exhausted? My days also feel VERY long because I'm just sitting and watching, I have three more months of this until she leaves!

TL;DR In training just sitting and watching her work, absolutely exhausted by 1-2:00pm, days feel really long, any advice?",03Apr2019,1
327,"Hey guys, I recently had a chat with someone in the industry regarding a potential role I'm about to take on. They basically told me that there's been harassment allegations pertaining to my manager, who I'll be working directly under if I do take on the role. 

&amp;#x200B;

Won't go into details (throwaway account to ensure anonymity), but apparently there has been more than one instance reported and is an issue that has been raised around last year as well. At the same time, the person who informed me of this got their information sourced from an entity which I would not label as the most legitimate or most credible. This entity stated that their information was derived from past workers under him who had gone to them regarding their situation with him. Apart from the harassment claims, they stated that their attempts to quit and leave the job resulted in him threatening to end their career (the industry we're in is fairly small and he has a certain level of clout). 

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't personally know anyone who has previously worked under him, but am trying to find out the veracity of the situation, given that I've had prior interactions with him in the time he took to train me in preparation for the role (which I basically already accepted at the start before all the training). In these interactions, he's always been really nice, helpful and conscious of what he says (in terms of ensuring no offence is taken), but of course I know this doesn't render him incapable of acting in the above stated capacities. That being said, I wouldn't say I know him well.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm torn right now between giving the benefit of the doubt to him and not wasting the (fairly significant) amount of time he's spent training me versus playing it safe rather than sorry. I've been really conflicted about this and am at the last leg of my training right now - I'm supposed to start work in May so am trying to decide what I should do. 

&amp;#x200B;

tldr Possible harassment issues raised against my boss, but I'm unable to verify these claims and he's always been a really decent person so far (tho this doesn't necessarily mean he's done nth) and has spent quite some time training me for the role so I'm unsure of whether to pull out of this role before I officially start.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance for any advice and help!

We broke up as first because of family pressure and outside influence, and a whole lot of rumors. Neither of us wanted to, but we didn't have much of a choice. A few months pass, and I end up spiraling into a bit of a depression, although I didn't know at the time. Through some circumstance, we ended up back in contact and I said some things that in the moment made sense, but looking back, I said them in an act of self destruction. I basically told her to fuck off, for her own sake. I didn't want to do that, but I did. Now, I want to make things right, but I don't know how and if I even can.

334,"I've been friends with Savannah for a year. I sometimes get upset because she can be needlessly blunt and it at terms hurts my feelings, but I think I might just be oversensitive. We live in Korea and for the time being, we're the closest friends we've got.

I do have one other friend, Sarah, who lives an hour away. Savannah and I hung out with her and another one of her friends last weekend. During the whole thing, she seemed checked out and barely talked to any of us. Sarah's friend started asking a question and Savannah raised her voice at her. At one point, Sarah and her friend stopped talking to her altogether.

Then a few new people moved to our neighborhood. We welcomed them and helped them move in. Savannah kept telling long stories and I could tell they were bored, and now I feel like they won't want to hang out with us/me.

Then we started a group chat because 10 more people moved to our area. We still haven't met them yet. One girl who moved here is from North Dakota. Savannah is from South Dakota, but I sometimes mix it up with North because my great grandma is from ND. I was excited and pointed out in a group chat that Savannah is from ND, which was wrong, I admit, but Savannah replied: ""I AM NOT FROM NORTH DAKOTA"" essentially yelling at me in the group chat in front of people I haven't even met yet. I felt so embarrassed. Is it my fault, though? I apologized right away. Idk why it's really bothering me now, but I guess I just want to make new friends and I'm antsy/sensitive. ",03Apr2019,3

i think another reason why i feel useless is because i have a habit of comparing myself to others, and seeing all my friends working and earning money adds on to my concerns because they are out there spending their time wisely, while i still have no idea what to do with my life.",03Apr2019,1

341,"Alright, so a little background. I’m an 18/y F headed to art school about two hours away from home, graduating HS in two months. I’ve been friends with Z since sixth grade (so basically six years of my life) and I’ve always been somewhat on the fence about it. We just sort of became friends and stuck together by accident, but I don’t consider Z a best friend. We haven’t seen eachother outside of school for a year or two because I’ve been trying to distance myself. Z is someone with a lot of mental health struggles that have only been amplified since they came out as trans, and he misses tons of school and uses mental health / being trans as excuses for EVERYTHING. Now, at risk of sounding like a jerk, I have to explain about Z’s artistic-educational situation, meaning that he can do art, but it’s nothing special. He has no passion or drive. I asked him why he wanted to go to art school, and he said “Well, I don’t really have anything else I like so...” (which irritated me, as someone who has a goal to accomplish through my art.) Z has a horrible GPA and general hatred for school. He fails about two classes per semester and recently was at risk of not graduating due to all the days he misses and his bad grades. 

I applied to my dream school back in November and got in very quickly. As soon as I got in, said school suddenly became Z’s number one choice as well. He waited until the last minute (late February) to apply to my school despite that, and only applied to one other school because his parents forced him. Yesterday, he got admitted (by some miracle) to the other school with a decent scholarship— but he’s decided to wait to hear back from my school. 

Every teacher he trusts in our highschool has explained what a bad idea this is, and that my school has already mostly finalized their admissions, so the likelyhood of him getting a yes before decision day is slim and he should accept the offer from the other school before he loses it. Z gets angry whenever anybody tries to explain this to him, or the many other suggestions I’ve made (ie, stay and go to community college for a bit to help your mental health before you jump into school, go into another field you’re more passionate about, etc.) He believes that going to this school is magically going to solve all his issues and make his life great. I believe he’s so deadset on this school because I’m going there, and he has always followed me, ever since the sixth grade. 

I have no issue with people from my school going to the same college as me— I have an issue with someone who is going to cling to me and not let me have my own experiences / a new section of my life going to the same college as me. 

Even though the chance seems low, I don’t know what to do if he gets in. I feel like a horrible person for wishing he won’t, but I truly can’t deal with him for another four years. Please help me out, I need advice! ",03Apr2019,1
343,"Okay so basically I have been friends with this person for around 3 years or so we became best friends in high school and we became even closer after she came out to me as being transgender and I’ve always been there and her for me also. so anyway, she’s always been paranoid about things whether it was people looking at her, judging her or people talking shit about her and the supposed ‘haters’. Whether it was Instagram posts and other things there was always something to do with these ‘people’ and this one night we hung out and took some LSD and I didn’t realise til after that if you’re not in a good headspace that you really shouldn’t be taking the drug and for me I was in a really good place at the time but she didn’t tell me that she hadn’t been in the best way and she was flipping acting strange, I mean we both were but she was talking about jumping out windows and all sorts of random stuff, luckily I was really mellow that I could talk her out of it... so anyway we start to mellow out and can finally understand the concept of time and what the time is again because there was a stage where I kept asking what the time was and asking whether that meant it was late or not. SO ANYWAY we’re laying down and she turns over to me and says” I knew it was you all along you’re the one who has been hacking me” “it all makes sense now” and she was fully convinced that I had been hacking her Facebook and her phone and laptop so I had to fully convince her why that was such a silly idea and who could be bothered??? so anyway we end up falling asleep at like 6am and we both wake up at about 9 and chill because we’re still feeling a bit out of it. she tells me about this theory of hers that her dad is out to get her and that he’s poisoned the down stirs water to kill her and that when she leaves water bottles around the house that she immediately changes the water because her dad might’ve put something in there to kill her....she’s had these kinds of delusions and thoughts for ages but she’s never really talked about them to me fully before and I had no idea what to say except convince her that she’s being silly and that she should be laughing at how ridiculous it sounds because it does! coming back to why I’m writing this post,,,,, today she texts me asking if I knew where to get some LSD and I couldn’t respond because I was at work so after I finish I quickly pull out my phone and there’s a paragraph saying that she ‘found out’ I had talked shit about her and that I had for some reason taken her resume to copy it and use it for my own and for that reason she’s going to cut contact with me.....

344,"Honestly, I would like to know from a third perspective what could she be thinking.

So two weeks back I met this girl on the train. She was in the same wagon as me. At first I hadn’t seen her but as the driver announced a problem up ahead and we were all forced to get out sooner than we wanted because the train would continue forward no more, I saw her.

I didn’t say anything at the time but I’ve seen this episode before. Everyone was forced to take a taxi home. I started talking with the rest of the passengers in hopes of sharing a cab with someone. She ended up living literally 3 minutes away from my place. So we took a cab together. Fast forward the taxi ride and I got her number after she suggested we should grab a coffee sometime.

I texted her I believe 2 days later. She didn’t answer in the text so I called a week later. She was very kind and sweet in the call and said that she didn’t have money in her phone so she couldn’t text back. A poor excuse in my eyes but we move forward.

As I wait another week for her call and share this story with a few friends, they suggested I should go grab a coffee from the place she works (she told me where she worked in the taxi ride).

And this is the present. I went by to take a coffee, around 8.30 pm and asked her if wanted to take a wild ride when she finished her shift with me home with my Bugatti Vey- the train!

So I go by a few hours later as she closes up the store. We go to the train station and what do you know, the train has to stop, again, sooner than we wanted due to a fallen TREE in the rails. Yeah, second time with this girl.

ANYWAY, throughout our entire conversation she laughs, touches me gently etc, we’re having a good time and she seems interested in me, at least in my eyes. So as the announcer says that the train will stop, I suggest we take a taxi home again. She told me that she had no cash in hand and she didn’t want me paying again (I paid the first time because why not). She insisted that she didn’t want to pay and this is when it happened!

“I’ll call my boyfriend to come pick me up” she said.

I managed not to act surprised to but to hell I was!
I insisted that we should take a taxi but she insisted that she didn’t want me paying. So her boyfriend ended up picking her up as she kindly asked me not to wait him with her because “you know”, he’d get jealous. So off I went.

To get a few things straight:

What boyfriend amigo?
You had a boyfriend this whole time?
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?
Why you asked me out for a coffee?
Why are you telling me now?
Why you acting so sweet and nice and you’re touching me every change you get?
I know you know what you’re doing is wrong, so why are you doing it?
And if you know all this why are you telling me?
Am I supposed to call you again for a coffee?
Are you about to break up with your boyfriend and you want me as a backup?
Hello?

Okay, I’m sorry but I’m a logical person (like most men I guess) and there is no logic to this. What she does makes no sense if she has a boyfriend. What am I supposed to do now?

Reddit, enlighten me!

TL;DR: I met this very kind and sweet girl on a cab that seemed clearly interested in me. Got her number after she suggested we should grab a coffee. Fast forward everything and we take the train to go home (we live close) and she tells me she has a boyfriend. Like hello?",03Apr2019,1
345,"On a throwaway here.. I work for a very large IT company, I'm in a team of about 15 people that come from varying demographics. but predominantly male. There's about 4 of us who are in our late 20's who naturally get along due to common interests and there's a lot of joking and sh*t talking back and forth which is fine, we tend to push the boundaries with what we say but it's always good natured and never gets too personal (well at least I thought so). There's one guy in my team who is your typical bodybuilder jock douchebag, he fancies himself as a ladies man and always talking about his conquests, he's arrogant but I tolerate him, until today when he made some comments about my girlfriend.

What happened was that we were talking about our plans for the weekend, I said I was going to the movies with my girlfriend. The bodybuilder (let's call him Rob), asks me how we met. I told him we met through Tinder. His first comment, ""I'm on Tinder, I would've matched with her for sure"" I let it go somewhat and just playfully responded quietly with, ""she wouldn't like you , you're ugly"", he asked what her first name is, her name is a common name from the country she's from originally, after saying that to him he goes, ""oh in that case I DEFINITELY would've matched with her!"". Implying that girls from that country are easy, which to me is an incredibly racist generalisation.

By this point I'm pissed off and in a state of shock somewhat that I'm hearing this BS from colleagues, especially in front of my entire team. Another guy in my team, John who was sitting next to me misheard what I said and thought I called my own girlfriend ugly. I told him pretty firmly that's not what I said and not to talk about my girlfriend, he was quick to apologise. Rob on the other hand keeps pushing it and says ""I'll find her on Instagram let's have a look"", I responded with , ""that's my partner you're talking about, keep going and I'm going to get pissed off"". The encounter ended with that, there was some nervous/awkward laughter from the rest of my team that heard the whole thing, the vibe was very confrontational which obviously isn't common in our workplace, I'm usually pretty upbeat and jovial, I just packed my stuff and left without saying anything to anyone.

This was 3 hours ago, I'm still furious but unsure if I could've handled it better or if I should've just said nothing and shrugged it off. On one hand I'm still fairly new in this team and hate to rock the boat, on the other hand those comments are crossing the line, workplace or not you don't talk about someone's partner like they're some potential conquest.

350,"	Hello, Reddit users. Here is a message from a student lives in Hong Kong. As the title had mentioned, I'm looking for advice on saving my home town. Before i begin, let me apologize for my poor English. Here is some background introduction about what happening in Hong Kong.

	Before 1997, Hong Kong was a colony of British. After being transferred to Mainland China, which commonly known as the handover of Hong Kong, Mainland China had signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration. In the declaration, not only did the Mainland China was not allowed to interrupt Hong Kong's law, the economic system(Capitalism), the judicial system, etc but also imposed a policy about not changing anything for 50 years in Hong Kong. This means that Hong Kong will remain unchanged for 50 years in all aspects and remain the situation of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong (港人自港), high-autonomy (高度自治) and the one country two systems.

	So what happened to Hong Kong that cause me, a student, to write this message and seek for help in here.  In last week, the chief executor proposed Surrender of fugitive offenders agreements. In these agreements,  the mainland government can officially accuse and arrest Hong Kong citizens from Hong Kong to China. However, it is not the first time for China accuse Hong Kong citizen. In December 2015, there are 5 staff of Causeway Bay Books went missing (The Causeway Bay Books disappearances). It was widely believed that the booksellers were detained in China as they were gone missing in China. The most believed reason why the booksellers were 'being missing' is because they were selling books that are banned in China. I had been to the bookstore before the sellers being missing, and yes, there are some sensitive books about negative things happened in China. The mainland government sued the booksellers with Drink-driving. 

	If you staying updated with the China news, it is not the first time for the government detained Chinese citizens. The most popular one, the Nobel peace prize winner, Liu Xiaobo. Another example of suppressing freedom of speech like Xinjiang re-education camps, 709 Crackdown, and more more examples. 

	I do not want my home becoming places like that and I do not want to be unable to speak freely when I grow up or even next week. Therefore, I choose to ask for advice here when I still have the freedom, the right and the chances to do what I think is right and to protect my home town.

	Here are some questions that I want to ask and seek for advice

1. How can I do to raise the awareness of the younger generation on Hong Kong future and the relation between China and Hong Kong? Most Hong Kong people seem not to give a shi\* on what had happened in the society and the only care their own life.

2. Is there anything besides protest that can create an effect on protecting freedom of speech in Hong Kong?

	I am really sorry that some information might not be well-described and might be misleading. I will be really appreciated if you can correct me. Finally, Thank You for reading this long passage, it really helps me to express my opinion cause I can't find anyone to share.",03Apr2019,1
351,"Hi all. First time poster here. I'm on mobile, so sorry for any format issues there.  

So I've (21M) been with my girlfriend (20F) for about a year now, and we're great. Saving the paragraph about how great we are as its not relevant, some quick backstory. 
1.) We hang out only at my house and other places, never at her's. 
2.) Because of 1, she's met my parents/some family at holidays and birthdays, but I haven't met anyone from her side. Basically I pick her up/drop her off and thats as close to her house as I get. 
3.) Her brother (upper 20s/early 30s?) got married last year not too late after we started dating.  I'm not sure about before but since the wedding he's lived like 5 minutes from her house.  I've dropped her off there a few times and its literally just turning left instead of right at the last turn. 
4.) She and her brother were pretty close growing up from what I've been told. As you can tell there's an age gap so after he moved out eventually that changed a little but they kept in contact via phone and the fact that he lived 5 minutes away, seeing him at church, etc. 
5.) Her parents went out of town for a bit towards November I believe and she didn't to be alone in the house that long so she and her uncle (who had a pickup truck) moved her bed to her brother's house for the time being. She ended up sleeping there here and there for reasons that aren't relevant up until a little before Christmas or so, and then she stopped for another not relevant reason.

Now that all the backstory is out if the way, I can get into the part I need help with.  So when she would go to her brother's to spend the night(s), she'd bring clothes and other stuff in a suitcase.  Obviously she left one day for whatever reason, and left her bed, her suitcase, and her laptop at her brother's.  Around Christmas, she needed a few things and she realized that they were in the suitcase, so she texted him and tried to pick it up/have him drop it off at her house at some point.  

After no response for a few days, she tried again to schedule what should be a really easy ""yea come over I get home from work at 8"" or ""i dropped it off at the house mom has it"" situation.    Again, no response.  She tried contacting his wife to also no response. 

We're into the middle/back end of January now.  She's been texting/calling both of them here and there to get her stuff back (she needed more from the suitcase and after sleeping on a couch for 2 months she was really missing her bed).  Still, no response.  

We hit February now, and she's continuing to contact both of them as well as asking her family if they know what's going on.  Someone tells her that they have been out in Washington D.C. for the last few weeks and that they're going to the Super Bowl now.  I went out of town with my family over break, and while it was fun and all that, I didn't ignore everyone in the world because of it.  I understand wanting to live in the moment and all that, but at this point it had been ~2 months since she'd heard from him last. 

Anyway, he comes home at some point in later February/early March because he came over while she was at work to hang out with the family for a little bit.  While there he dropped off her laptop. Great, now we just need the bed and the suitcase and for him/his wife to respond to literally anything. 

2 weeks ago or so, my girlfriend and her brother hung out for a few hours on day.  I know they drove around but I'm not sure what else.  I asked her if she mentioned all this and she asked/told him that she needs her stuff back several times and he kept saying stuff like ""yea I know"" or ""we'll figure it out later"" and other blowoff garbage.

So for the last few months she has been calling/texting him here and there and more frequently as time goes on.  Recently she has borrowed her parents phones to see if he'd respond to them and nothing so far.  I suggested she do the *67 or  whatever it is that blocks your number (maybe he'd answer if he didn't see it was her?) and she got the voicemail.  I told her she can borrow my phone if she wants to but she doesn't want to, at least not yet.  

While I'm glad that she at least got her computer back, there's some stuff that's decently important in that suitcase that I can't just run to Walgreen's for.  And she definitely needs her bed back as its still messing with her neck/back. Like I mentioned above, the suitcase should be a 5 minute anytime exchange that should have happened months ago.  I understand that wouldn't have worked while they were out of town so obviously they get a pass for that.  But what makes me upset is the fact that both him and his wife have ignored my girlfriend for going on 4 months now.  The bed exchange I can understand taking longer, as it involves a 3rd person (her uncle and his pickup truck) to schedule around. 

In theory, the next time she's seeing him in person is Easter.   Ideally he gives her at least the suitcase before then, but based on his track record I doubt it.  So the next best option is that he brings at least the suitcase on Easter.  She's still trying to get a hold of both of them via her phone at the moment, and I think she said she'll try and borrow her parents phones a few more times too.  

So basically, now what?  This clearly isn't working after 4 months.  As far as she knows she didn't do anything to piss him off into ignoring her like this.   I'm also aware of the old thing where married people are busy and such, but sending a few texts in 4 months isn't hard.

I'm as removed from the situation as you can get, nor am I about to go over to his house and start picking locks(although I have joked about it). Has anyone had anything similar happen like this before?  If so, how did you get everything figured out?  Is there anything I/my girlfriend/her parents should do?  I just want her to be happy.  And this whole thing is causing her so much stress between not getting her stuff back and how shitty he's being to her.

TL;DR - My girlfriend left some stuff at her brother's house back in December.  He's been ghosting her ever since, and when she saw him in person a few weeks ago he kept dodging the questions about when she can get it back.",03Apr2019,1
352,"Been aiming to do dentistry, worked as a dental assistant for 3 months and I enjoyed it. At the start however, I felt faint twice after watching an operation/tooth extraction on separate occasions. It wasn't that bad so I slowly pushed myself to watch more invasive procedures and I thought I had gotten over it as I haven't felt faint in the last 2 months. 

I went on to do another internship at another dental clinic, just to shadow a doctor. One hour into the job, an old lady came in to get an extraction. The doctor gripped the extraction forceps a bit too hard and the tooth cracked leaving just the root of the tooth inside the gums. At this point I felt myself get a bit panicked and once I saw the ""digging tool"" come out I closed my eyes but still, I started feeling dizzy again. This time it was a lot worse. Not only were my vision and hearing gone but my head was spinning so bad I fell on the floor and knocked down some trays. The nurse and doctor were obviously shocked and helped me back up on my feet. Then I started gagging and my breakfast almost came back up (luckily it didn't lmao). The nurse brought me to the toilet and let me sit down for a while. After about half an hour I felt more normal. 

The doctor asked me to go back to rest so I cried my way back home. Felt so bad for troubling the doctor and nurses and embarrassed that I reacted that way. 

I'm really conflicted cos on one hand I really want to do dentistry and I know this is possible to overcome this but on the other hand, that was really a horrible experience (I probably have never felt that sick to my stomach as I did then) and I'm so scared it happens again.

TL;DR Fainted/felt really sick after watching something gory-ish at work in a dental clinic. I want to be a dentist but I'm scared if I want to get over my fear of gore I will have to put myself through that several more times. ",03Apr2019,1
353,"I hate to rant because everything I feel doesn't half add up to the pain my partner feels, but after a long time, I feel I just need to put down in words how I feel.  
I'm looking for others to talk to about how they cope with their partners anxiety and/or depression.  
My other half has suffered from both over the last 3 years and I struggle keeping my cool with it. I know it sounds horrible, because I know he doesn't want to suffer and doesn't want to be down - but he is.  


I personally feel like I've dealt with it very well over the last three years, I've not reached out to any one, I've told noone what he goes through and I've always tried to help (We've done headspace, Calm, Youtube meditation, keeping a diary, talking about what makes him sad, pros and cons, everything I can think of i've tried, but if you can think of anything else please tell me)  


Today we we're meant to go on a night out, I asked 100 times if he wanted to. Everytime I was met with 'I don't know'. I said fine we'll stay in and watch a movie/program have food and relax. Then he'd want to go out and I would say 'we'll have a good time, we'll do THIS and THAT... blah blah.'   
It's our last week in the area we're staying while travelling and I don't want him to regret missing out, but I'm not going to forced him out either.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, we got to the end of the street on our way out and he decided he didn't want to walk in to the town, (but we could if I wanted to, he said of course) which sent me over the top. (I feel horrible but couldn't take it anymore).  
I said to head back home and he stormed off.  


We're in a foreign country, and my anxious, depressed boyfriend walked off on his own in the middle of the night. (My brain is going all over the place)  
I was a mess. I found him 5 minutes down the road, walking towards the town centre he didnt want to go to. Managed to drag him home but not happily.  


I've asked him to see a doctor, because I'm honestly on the other side of the world, with just him and can't deal with it alone anymore. But he won't budge 'they'll just put me on pills, I don't need a doctor, I'll be fine'   
I can't go behind his back and talk to his family members because I don't wont to worry them. His mum knows he feels down at times but sons away from home and she probably feels even more helpless than me. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anybody has any advice for me that'd be fantastic. I don't want to tell him my emotions because I know it doesn't help his mental health, but my health is being tested every day - and I don't know how I can help him anymore. ",03Apr2019,41

356,"My fiancé and I are looking for a house to rent in mid May. We found one we loved and were originally quoted $200 pet fee for our husky. Our husky is very small- like 35 lbs. I wrote this on the application where it asked for weight. After I applied and paid the application fee ($50) I get an email saying the owner is concerned about the dog but has approved the application and they would draft the lease with a $300 pet fee. That’s fine, whatever. Most places have a 2-300 pet fee. 

Then I get an email yesterday that the owner is concerned because huskies are usually very big dogs and now wants a $400 non refundable pet fee. I can understand being concerned about damage but since the fee is non refundable what’s the point of increasing it? I would pay for damages if the dog caused damages. And he’s concerned about huskies being big? I wrote on the application that she’s 35 lbs.

357,"Wanted to consult with the wisdom of the mass and maybe get a nice idea for a big issue in life

Story is -

My parents are divorced and my dad has no money and no job. He is trying for years to make money on the internet but the truth is me and my sister are funding him (He is 65).

He has a crazy and evil mom that have plenty of money but they are not in touch for about 10 years.

Why not? Because 10 years ago, in 2 years, he declared bankruptcy, had been involved in a car crush, had an heart attack and lung cancer (I shit you not) so he came to her asking for money and she said no. He said that he doesn't have a place to stay and she said that your kids can help you with this (as we did)

My dad also has a sister that didn't help him as well. She is a dentist with tons of money. My dad is hurt so he doesn't want to talk to her so they speak on the phone for 5 minutes twice a year, at each other's Birthday.

So my grandma is 89 years old and I don't know when but she will probably die soon. The will says that all the money and houses are going only to my dads sister.

The rich dentist will get it all while her broke brother gets nothing.!

Now you know the story - What would you do?

I will be happy if my dad gets half of the will

Looking forward for creative ideas

Recently, I received a great job offer. I have chosen to accept this job offer. The company is offering employer-paid health insurance. I am already insured by my mother, who is in a employee-paid insurance program. I can remain insured through her program until I am 26 (USA).

Is there any advantage to remaining insured through my mother or should I opt to go with my employer's insurance?

I get into a mode of noticing every small thing they do from there on out of my peripheral vision if they are in the same space as me. If were in different rooms ill hear the bed creaking, steps, doors opening. Stuff i don't usually hear. 
The problem is that each of these things tenses me up and i end up being in a state of heightened alertness which increases tenseness because of the anticipation of said sounds, small movements. 
Ill just see them move their head a bit or take a cup of water and ill tense up.

I am a resident in MA. I previously had my unrestricted LTC-class A meaning I could carry a gune with me in most places in public loaded.  About a month ago my dad and I got into a heated argument on the phone and he ended up being concerned for my safety and called the police.  After he called I decided what a great time to get drunk and so I did. About 2 hours later ( I'm wikid sensitive to alcohol) I am passed put on the couch and the police come in my door put me on a stretcher and take me away as well as take away all my guns and my licence. At this point I get taken to the hospital for evaluation. My dad is telling the doctors if he knew it would be this big of a deal he would not have called, and while I was unhappy with him for other reasons I am not mad at him for calling the cops as it was with good intentions however, neither of us expected the ramifications. I ended up having to stay  from Friday Night -Monday morning at a psych ward until an on staff physiologist could see me on Monday. He saw me, we spoke for 5 minutes and he let me out after realizing there was no need for me to be there.
What is the specific way I go about reinstating my licence. I did get a letter saying my licence has been suspended indefinitely. 
Any SPECIFIC advice is appreciated. If ""get a lawyer"" is the response do I go through GOAL or another organization? Is there any specific group or company that specializes in this?

 My family are almost bankrupt, but we are still surviving. I am a uni student that can’t move out due to my parents ‘better judgement’ and my boyfriends family aren’t keen on the idea too. I live in a house of 6 adults with 4 bedrooms and we are always on top of each other. My mum has a lot of baggage and she lets everybody know in the way she acts. Sometimes her behaviour can be justified but a lot of the time she just needs to grow the hell up. I am being seen as an adult more and a more in the family which gives me an opportunity to tell people when I think what they’re doing is not right but that doesn’t mean they listen to me. 

My dad gets super defensive, then turns it into an argument and then he tells me to lower my voice when I try and tell him how he acts makes me upset, and my mother is equally defensive and doesn’t listen but she is more accepting than my father. My father just doesn’t apologise for anything and to be quite frank I wouldn’t want someone like him as a husband. 

My mother has a lot of issues too so both are flawed, as everyone is. They don’t talk to each other when they’re annoyed and act like children and all they do is slag each other off to me. I can’t even tell them to shut up and grow up because in their self-cantered minds, that’s offensive. I have deadlines to meet at uni and I am most of the time, helping my mum or my dad or doing chores instead of working. How do I tell them they need to grow up or move on because I’m tired of their crap? I’m worried if I do that, they won’t try due to apathy, but go on about how the other has issues. 

I know it’s not the worst situation but it’s very annoying and I’m about to snap and tell them some very hard truths that they won’t like me for. Any advice on how to even deal with it for my own sanity?

365,"**CONTENT WARNING:**
I will mention my childhood sexual abuse as I feel it may have had an impact on how I see myself sexually

Also this will be quite lengthy so please bear with me

I will start with the first time I really encountered homosexuality for the first real time. Even though I have a gay uncle that I heard murmurs about, I was still oblivious to other sexualities really untill I saw the ""Lincoln Lovers"" episode of American Dad, as silly as that sounds now. Around this time and before,  I was enduring my brother's sexual and verbal abuse. He would call me all sorts of slurs which I will spare. That episode put all of this into context and i became extremely paranoid that I might be gay. I watched everything I did, how I slept, how I talked, how I reacted, all in the naive pursuit of not being gay; Not because I myself thought it was a bad thing, but because I was told by my brother it was, Ironic, I know. 

After he was caught by our mother, and the abuse stopped, I was left in this storm of confusion. I struggled with the question of my sexuality most intensely here. In middle school I really remember telling my mother I liked a girl so that she wouldn't think I was gay, despite her telling me time and time again that she would be okay if I was. I never really feeling any attraction in middle school. I don't know how this sub handles discussion of masturbation, but I did it often, however never to porn oddly. I think back to this period and I don't really knew if I thought of myself as a straight guy. 

Then came High School:
During freshman year and sophomore year I really became more introverted, and honestly bitter towards all the couples around me. Again no attraction as I remember.

Then I moved to my father's in the middle of BFE. I introduced to  straight porn during the summer. Then I felt my first crush, well two crushes, one a girl and the other a guy who looked a bit like my brother. That was a confusing period for me, in retrospect I felt enamored with both of them. Then there were several other girls I crushed on, and a couple of guys, both of whom looked nothing like my brother, although I to this day doubt the authenticity of that attraction. After High school my porn consumption skyrocketed which may have been the reason I eventually found gay porn which over the summer became  go to.  I at this point was still confused and I never really got any better at socializing and all that so I have yet to get into a relationship with either gender, hell I'm still a virgin.

The story continues during a particular rough period in my life. I was feeling lonely and hopeless , so I posted on 4chan's LGBT board looking for someone. Well I found someone who at least pretended to be interested in me. Problem was he lived in Canada and I lived in the U.S.. so we texted and video chatted over Discord and I responded to his advances, however I recall one time while we RP'd after I was done I thought to myself while reading what he was typing "" what is this! I don't want this, regardless I kept going untill eventually he ghosted me and then came back and blocked me. 

The long and short of it is that sometimes  I feel like I'm attracted to guys, or at least I think I am, and sometimes I don't.  Sometimes they disgust me , but so do women. I don't know where I stand...

367," 

A few years ago my friends (best friend at the time and another close friend) were in our last year of high school.

There was this girl I was really into and I told them that I like her (this girl was part of our friend group). It was all good and my best friend at the time told me that he was not going to make a move or anything and that he would wing-man me.

However, a few weeks later he started being really flirtatious towards her, but I didn't think much of it. This continually escalated and the other close friend also started helping him make moves on this girl (That I liked and was trying to be with).

Fast forward, they did a lot of sexual things which absolutely broke my heart and completely isolated me from the group, and treated me as a joke. It made me feel absolutely shit for a very long time. And it was only last year that they really apologized for what happened.

I tried to accept their apology, and I really try to trust them but I just can't seem to, and I genuinely doubt their friendship.

I now have a girlfriend and I can't even bear the thought of introducing her to them. It's not the worst thing in the world but I have had a few negative dreams involving this whole situation.

So the question is, can and should I trust them? I honestly feel like just moving on and hanging out with my other friends (I have plenty of other really good friends now) and eventually stopping contact with them, because I have tried for months if not years and I just can't see them as friends anymore. Is this decision justified? Or am I letting my emotions take control?

371,"Hi Me (22m) and my siblings (20m &amp; 19f) live in a house together with the three of us. I have an older brother who is in the military and he is on a mission since the beginning of this year. When I was around 8 years old my mother left the house and we didn't know why. We lived with our father and my mother stopped by every week or every other week to clean or cook. My father had to take care of the 4 of us while my mom was mostly away.. he had always hoped they would end up back together and they were never legally divorced.   


It had been very hard for us since we had no parental figures to be our guide in life/education, because my father was always working and was rarely at home and my mother only came once in a while. My older brother was in the military so most of the time he wasn't home either. I sort of had to be the leading figure at home as a teen and had to care for my brother and sister. It started to get even harder when my dad began to have money issues, I was in school and had a part time job and my dad was asking money from me. I couldn't handle it, got in a depression and started to skip classes and eventually drop out of college.  My siblings and I had no one to tell what to do or make us go to school so eventually my brother and my sister also started skipping classes and eventually drop out of school and college. We were all pretty lost in life and just doing whatever we liked (working, partying, drugs). 

&amp;#x200B;

In 2016 our mother suddenly died in a car accident on her way to work and it was a big shock. My sister got in a big depression and it was a turning point for me and my brother. We started getting a better job and working full time. One year in my dad had fallen in love with a woman and last year they married and they decided to get a place together 2 hours driving from where we live in a totally different town. Me and my siblings are now living in this house and pay a fee each month to my dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the problem we can't seem to get some order in our lives. The house is a mess, I am the one who does most of the things in the house. Their room is a total mess, which I don't mind, because I don't have to live there, but it shows that they don't have it in order either. We all do our own laundry, but I am the only one who does it actively. I tried to just not do anything for a week and a half to see if they'd clean anything up out of themselves. The house ended up being one BIG mess and I cleaned it all up. I don't want to have to always ask them to do something I just want them to do it for themselves. If I see any of their stuff I just dump it in their room, but I don't want to have to do that day in and day out. Cooking isn't really going great either we have different schedules and we all end up eating our own meals anyways. We have had several meetings (talks) about this subject, and for a while it goes great, but after sometime it just goes back the same again and I don't know what to do about it.

372,"So my GF and I have been together for almost 6 years, and in that time, she has grown and changed a lot (as have I).  She has gone through a lot of different phases in her life, overcome a physically abusive upbringing, abandonment, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

She and I have been living together for about a year and a half now, and there were things I knew about the relationship going in.  She's messy, disorganized, can be a little clingy... I was prepared for all of that.  But the thing that I guess I was in denial about up until now is how incredibly self-destructive her behavior is.  In almost any given situation where she needs to accomplish something or get something done, she does the opposite, completely torpedoing any chance at success and throwing away the opportunity to further her life in some way.  I'll give a few examples...

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest one is with her college.  She's in school right now, and she's on academic probation for getting a 1.99 GPA last semester.   She's not stupid, she just doesn't do her homework or go to class reliably, and because of that her grades slipped.  She has had CONSTANT issues with school due to her anxiety and depression, and to be fair, she DOES have severe anxiety and depression.  I get that, and I'm empathetic to it.  But if she doesn't get above a 2.0 GPA this semester, she'll be kicked out of school and won't be able to re-enroll for at least 4 semesters.  She only pays her bills right now with her loan money, and I doubt she could make enough as a minimum wage employee to make ends meet, so she'd have to move out and I'd have to figure things out.... 

&amp;#x200B;

So you would assume, as I would, that given all of this she would be ON IT this semester.  But she isn't.  All semester she constantly ""gets sick"" sometimes with actual symptoms, sometimes.... less so.  But it has led to her constantly missing classes.  Fast forward to the last two and a half weeks, and she has had a pretty bad cough and on and off fever, which has led to her not going to class.  For two and a half fucking weeks.  She's fallen behind in all of her classes as a result.  She does have access to a special program for students with anxiety and depressive disorders that will allow her to catch up and allows her to not take as much heat for it, but this is LITERALLY what happened last fucking semester.  And now she's doing it again.  

&amp;#x200B;

Second example.  So money for us is always pretty tight because of her.  She often mismanages her money and doesn't have enough near the end of the semester to cover her bills.  It's led to me having to pay for a ton of her bills, and draining much of my savings.  Coming up to the end of this semester, it's the same thing again.  We found out about a month ago that she has at least $800 in lost checks that the state is holding, that she could get by filling out a form and mailing it to the courthouse.  That's all she has to do.  She barely works (one shift every other week if that), and her financial issues are causing both of us enormous hardship.  But she still won't track down the form, fill it out, and send it in.  It's been four weeks, and I'm CONSTANTLY on her about it.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm just at my wits end.  If she gets kicked out of school, I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore.  She just constantly sabotages herself by seeing exactly what she needs to do and doing the literal opposite thing.  Need to get to sleep early to get up for class?  Stay up til 3.  Need to get homework done to get caught up?  Faff about and blow it off.  Need to save up money or bring in more cash to pay bills?  Mismanage your money, don't work, and just sit on easy money from the state.  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like it's ruining her life, and mine by extension.  We have so much history, but I just don't know how I can keep justifying the impact this relationship is having on my life.  I feel like I'm going to drown in her bad decisions.  The thing is, because so much of it is based off real issues like depression and anxiety, but at some point I just have to look at what's happening to me, and my living arrangements.  I've tried to talk her through it, tried to get her to go to therapy, and honestly just had screaming matches with her about it.  Still nothing changes.

373,"Just a little background: I stopped talking to him when I was 16 because we got into a fight about how he treated me and my brother. He told me I wasnt his daughter (figuratively) and I was like ""okay cool"" and hung up. I suffer from anxiety, I've been in and out of hospitals for depression and ""suicidal thoughts"", and I've been diagnosed with PTSD from his abuse. I literally dont remember most of 2nd-4th grade outside of school thing. Hes also cornered me on my walk to highschool but I didnt call the police because I was scared and I was only a block away from my school. 

Recently hes been knocking on my door every day several times, I assume its cause he wants to ""fix things"". He knows I dont want to talk to him, so hell knock and then stand back so I cant see him through the doors window (obviously hes still manipulative). I know its him though cause I checked through a separate window where he couldnt see me. I live alone and I'm terrified to talk to him alone, he has anger issues and I've worked to hard to build myself up from him. But he keeps comming by my house and I'm scared if I keep ignoring him he might do something. I dont know what kind of person he is now but I'm not convinced hes changed. I'm more afraid for my pets while I'm gone to be honest. I go to the library a lot to study and I'll spend hours there, anything could happen. It could be anxiety but im scared hell break in and take them or something. 

I dont want to get the police involved because my brother still talks to my dad and he keeps trying to get me to talk to him because ""hes changed, he loves you, he misses you"". My brother was too young to remember and most of my dads abuse was race based (I'm lighter) so I got the short end of the stick. My brother and I just started getting along (we never have, guess why?) And I dont want to ruin that relationship. 

I'm thinking about leaving notes with my neighbors. But I'm not sure how often anyone is home, or is that would do anything? What would you guys do? I think he just left and I feel like I want to cry. He leaves for Arizona (many many states away) soon so I dont know if theres an event horizon or if hell just give up. 

Tldr: abusive dad keeps comming to my house trying to talk. The police arnt an option (yet), they are the very last step. I'm scared for my pets while I'm away from my house, how do I deal with him comming by so often? What do I do if I see him in public?

374,"So my plan is to become a police officer. Before I do so I want to get a degree in either psychology or accounting. With a degree I can go places in a police department. Also I have to be 21 before applying to become a police officer.  So why waste that time. I hope to go into the FBI, but that’s a dream rather than a reality. Main question- Why not criminal justice degree? Because those are a dime a dozen in that department and you will basically learn doing police work that you would getting that degree. So.....

Why psychology?- 

Helps you understand what is going through someone’s mind. Also, if I end up in a wheelchair than I can become a psychologist, or police psychologist. 

Why accounting?-

Helps with white collar crime cases. (Non-violent financially motivated crime). And if I end up in a wheelchair than I can become a accountant. 

I honestly can’t decide after months. 

Accounting will help a lot more for the job, but becoming an accountant if something goes off plans isn’t the best back up plan because I would not have any experience really in that area. 

Psychology won’t be as useful on the job, but becoming a psychologist if things go off plan, becoming a psychologist sounds like a much better back up plan. ",03Apr2019,1

376,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to start with some background information to please take into consideration. I'm a 19 year old guys studying abroad but I also go home pretty frequently. I mentioned the asian part because some of my moms traits can be explained through the stereotype(which is pretty accurate for asians moms ngl.) I've had the thought of her being emotionally abusive for some time lurking at the back of my head but recently I think it's time to ask about it.

I've known that my mom has loved me too much. She was very overprotective and has had high expectations for me. She's really stuck her neck out for me over the years and I am eternally grateful. I do love her a lot. However there were some early warning signs along the years that i kind of picked up on. I knew my dad made some stupid decisions 12 years ago, if what my mom said was true, he cheated on her once, he didn't stick up for her when his family verballed abused her and he wasted money. He has since then worked very hard for the family and has been a great dad ever since. However, they have always had big blowouts, very one sided with my mom yelling at him and my dad kind of nodding along. She once indirectly threatened him with suicide and many times with divorce. She's also pretty much brainwashed me into thinking my dad was bad until I realized for myself that he wasn't, unfortunately my younger brother holds her beliefs firmly.

My mother and i used to joke about how I'd live with her for life and visited my girlfriend on the weekends. She actually recorded it once and often reminded me regularly about it. Although I kinda knew she'd cash in on it one day. Just now when i was chatting with my brother, i offhandedly mentioned how ""when i live by myself.."" and she immediately freaked out calling me a bad son, that she knew why jackie chan didnt leave his fortune for his kids and said that she'd pretty much stop talking to me in the future. Over the years, I've realized that she has always made me and my dad the villain in every disagreement and always threatended suicide and divorce whenever she got really upset. She always starts arguments over casual comments, digs up our sins from years ago and talks that way to my brother as well. To be honest, it hurts me, a lot. She insists to talk to me everyday when I'm abroad and kiss me on the mouth (which is weird).

TL:DR at bottom

So I’m 16 now and love in the states. My mom and dad are now divorced and really hate each other as do opposing sides of the family. On my dads side there is a heritage of military service (My father in the army, my grandfather in the Air Force, and my great grandfather as well I think) and I’ve always thought about enlisting in any branch except navy. I opted out of my SAT and took the ASVAB instead. It is something that I want to do for heritage and also patriotism.
 
However when expressing this to my mother she berated me with insults. Telling me “I would disown you if you ever went military” and saying “I would rather hear you tell me you are gay then joining the army” (She is very homophobic as you can see also not the word she used but I don’t like saying the word she called it) and it has me really rattled mentally.

I have decent grades (3.2 GPA) and she wants me to be the first person on her side of the family to go to college. What should I do/say now? This happened last night and I haven’t talked to her since. ",03Apr2019,1

383,"I work in mid-sized office supply company doing marketing.  I was hired in June 2017 and have been ""considered"" management ever since I got here.  Now, when I say that, here is what I mean:  

• I am one of the few salaried employees here    
• I participate in all executive meetings but am the only ""manager"" without a staff, I do all marketing myself   
• I cannot participate in employee events, partake in raffles, or anything that normal employees would benefit from, I am typically part of the staff that organizes and works the events (along with the other department heads)  
• My boss (the C.O.O. [who practically runs this company due to the empty suit at C.E.O. being an elderly man]) often refers to me as ""Director of Marketing"" when it is convenient, but my ""official"" title is Marketing Coordinator.  When I say she refers to me as such when it is convenient, I mean, when introducing me to prospective clients or partners   

I am certain I get paid less than every other ""manager"" here, which is alright, I am significantly younger than all of them.  I'm in my late 20's.  i am expected to wear many hats that expand well beyond the scope of ""Marketing Coordinator"" or even, ""Marketing Director"".  I draft million dollar proposals and draw up contracts when we land such clientele.  At the same time, I am doing administrative work that should be done by office managers or receptionists, such as maintaining the phone and email list.  I do IT work as primary keeper of our company website.  The list literally goes on and on ... 

***Here's the thing ...***  

Our collective boss, the C.O.O. and the only person I personally answer to, is a raging ruthless bitch.  I mean, had I looked at this company's glassdoor before interviewing and getting the job, I'd of seen literally tons of negative reviews specifically about her.  She is the worst kind of boss, I mean, if anyone recorded her there could easily be a lawsuit here at any day.  She is rude, makes personal insults, sexually harasses some people (like me, but never too crazy), screams at the top of her lungs in peoples faces in front of the general employee pool - I mean, just a nightmare.  A nightmare.  

Lately, shes been battling cancer and while that's humbled her some on most days, she still holds this insanely high level of intimidation and causes tension just being around people based solely on her reputation from beforehand.  Now, she still has her days to remind us all who she really is deep down, with the screaming, pinning managers against each other, personally insulting employees and thinking she's funny during Christmas parties, etc..  

This job has caused me to fall into a depression, I can't say for SURE it's the ONLY thing but I am certain it is one of the things that has caused me to be depressed.  I rarely do anything anymore, and part of it has to do with her, and the other part is the hour+ long commute to work, and the hour+ long commute home.  All in all my work day is between 10 and 11 hours, and I am doing things I never wanted to do, and being paid too little to do it.  I have been here almost 2 years and haven't been given a review or a raise due to her illness being a major excuse in not sitting down for a review (as well as HR informing me, ""we aren't that kind of business"" when I asked about yearly reviews.  She alluded to the fact that it's because of my boss).  

What I really ***WANT*** to do, is quit, and take the time to find a new job.  However, I know that is ***NOT*** the smart thing to do, at all.  I don't have a lot of personal time remaining due to some things that have come up early this year, so applying in the few hours I have to myself after my 11 hour work day (while depressed and not wanting to do anything when I get home) is hard for me to focus on doing.  It will be even harder when I get an interview and can't take time off to go to it.  It just seems like I am stuck.  I'd like some advice...",03Apr2019,1
384,"So I've been deeply attracted to my best friend for more than two years now, but the thing is, she doesn't see me the same way and she isn't really into relationships. I'd like to think that avoiding her might fix things but behind my attempts of trying to be with her, we do have a genuine friendship and I don't want to lose that. I don't always start conversations with her because I'm into her, I start conversations because she's my friend as well.

Despite getting along and being great friends, it just feels like torture sometimes. It feels like torture to be close to her and know her so well but not actually being able to ""be with her"".

It's been a couple years now and I've confessed to her a few times already, but it's always the same. She just doesn't want anything in between us, and of course I would never force her into anything.

I do understand where she's coming from, I think. And I think the only problem here is me. I just want to get rid of these feelings. I just want to be her best friend without feeling anything else. I don't want to subconsciously, automatically, instinctively try to be with her anymore. I'm just so tired and I want to get rid of these feelings. All my attempts in trying to get rid of these feelings just end up with me relapsing back to square one. Whenever I think I've made progress in moving on, I just snap and just feel those emotions again with more intensity. It's like a never-ending cycle of emotions and I'm tired...

Just so you know, I never forced her into anything, she's my friend after all. I just try to keep these things to myself because I don't want her worrying about anything. I just want to reach a state where I can just be her best friend without wanting anything else...

So I’ve got this issue about myself that has been bothering me and I want to fix. 

I have a good work friend who talks about things like she’s the only one to feel this/that way. She’ll use phrases like “oh well, I’m the kind of girl” a. lot.

If I try to relate, or jive with what she’s saying like I do understand to a degree. I’m shot down, like I couldn’t possibly understand 

Sometimes it’s about depression (of which we both suffer), today it was music. She told her boyfriend that I thought one of his favorite bands sounded like wind chimes, he got upset at this apparently. 

“He doesn’t like it when people joke about his favorite bands. People like him, who love music. It’s like their life”

Roommate 1 = T, Roommate 2 = S, Me = ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 


So my roommates are very passive aggressive people who do not apologize. They yelled at you for no reason? Welp don’t expect an apology, and you’re supposed to act like they did nothing wrong or else you’re the bad guy. Not super healthy, and I’ve felt pent up with the way they deal with issues, but I just decided to live with it. I’m only here another 2 months.


This morning I went to use the bathroom and locked the door behind me (I like privacy). I was in there for two minutes (7:40-7:42 a.m.) - I watch the time in the morning so I am respectful of my roommates, and I hear banging on the door. Well the fan is on and the following conversation ensued:


Me: “I can’t hear you, text me!”


T (over text): “S needs to get in there, she has a class at 8 a.m.”


Me (over text): “Okay I just got in here so gimme a sec”


S (over text): “I need to leave”


I then proceeded to unlock the door and go back to doing my business with a sliding door shut between us. As I said I like my privacy, so I am not really able to use the bathroom anymore, try as I might for a long time. I give up and wash my hands. T is still in the bathroom (hence my lack of bathroom use), and turns towards me and starts talking to me like I’m a three year old.


T: “You need to stop locking the bathroom door when you use the bathroom. You’ve made us late multiple times and you take forever in there.”


In my mind: I usually lock the door for 5-10 minutes in the morning for privacy. My roommates each spend more than an hour in the bathroom each morning, getting ready, putting on makeup, playing music and usually waking me up as my door is right across from the bathroom. Generally, almost all things they could be doing in their rooms. I give them their space and almost never knock on the door when it is closed/locked to give them privacy. They usually knock on the door after a few minutes of my using the restroom.


Me: “Please don’t yell at me or talk to me in that way or I won’t listen”


T (doesn’t change the way she was speaking to me): “You’re inconveniencing all of us by locking the door in the morning and you need to stop. You were in there for 20 min—“


Me: “I was in there for so long because you guys knocked a minute after I got in here and literally scared the shit back inside me. I usually only lock the door for 5-10 minutes.”


T (shaking her head as soon as I started speaking): “No you take forever and you need to stop locking the door.”


In my mind: She has no idea I actually watch the time from when I get in to make sure I’m not in there too long (sometimes I just sit because I get distracted by my phone). But she wouldn’t believe me if I told her.


Me: I tried telling her to calm down as she was yelling, and I said “We can’t talk if you’re just going to yell at me.”


T: She storms out of the bathroom, refusing to hear me and yelling “Just stop locking the bathroom!” Over and over again.


So, clearly I am living with two girls who are passive aggressive and don’t say anything until they blow up at you. T can’t even have a conversation about an issue without yelling at me, talking over me and not actually hearing what I have to say. It makes me uncomfortable because I know they just talk badly about me to other people or each other whenever they have an issue because that’s what they do when they have an issue with each other. Newsflash: they never resolve any issues among each other.


They take up the bathroom for more than an hour every morning and then continue to use it after that hour to fix makeup, brush teeth, and use the toilet. I’m just kind of wondering what I do in this situation now. T will literally ignore me as a “punishment” until she has gotten over the situation, and I know when she is over it not by her coming and talking to me, but by her not blocking me from seeing her location on FindMyFriends - yeah when I first got into disagreements with her it took awhile to figure this out. S will “stay out of it,” but will continue to talk badly about me to T or anyone who will listen. And then there’s me, who is looking to fix myself through reddit advice: hello.


I have a couple options:


1. I could forgo my need for privacy, leave the door unlocked, close the sliding door to the toilet room (heh toilet room), and attempt to use the bathroom for all instances. Maybe try to reschedule my poops around their schedules lol. Maybe become permanently constipated who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 


2. I could literally write down what time I get into the bathroom and what time I leave for a week. This sounds passive aggressive as hell, but then send T my “time card” at the end of the week. I literally only take 5-10 minutes because I’m trying to be respectful.


3. I could send the two roommates a group text just apologizing for taking up time in the bathroom, I wish someone had said something sooner, my need for privacy and how I usually try to watch the clock. Then say, if I’m limiting my time in the bathroom I’d ask that you guys do the same. You are both in the bathroom for sometimes more than an hour each morning and putting on makeup/styling hair can be done in our respective rooms. (This will get attitude and backlash because they are selfish and have been doing this for years, they won’t change for me. They make fun of me for getting ready in my room).


These two girls literally use the toilet with the door open, and while that’s good for them - it makes me uncomfortable. They make me feel like my wanting privacy is weird and wrong, and then don’t try to talk to me about it but yell at me to change something about myself. I know it’s silly, but I just felt really disrespected in the morning.


Obviously my roommates don’t like my choices, so I’m looking to you guys. I know it seems stupid but please just tell me what to do. I am uncomfortable living here and in this situation. Any advice?",03Apr2019,1

The temple has an email group which the head teacher uses to communicate with us, and X has been responding to these emails in a concerning way. X kind of rambles about people stealing X's energy and messing up X's spiritual balance. It's a Buddhist temple so there are lots of Buddhist terms thrown in there too, but not in a coherent way that (to my knowledge) adheres to any established Buddhist tradition . X also mentions certain people by name as specifically doing these things-- but as far as I know they're not from the temple. I'm not sure who they are but I did find people with similar names in a similar academic to that which X is in. I'm not an expert at all, but to give you my impression, X seems paranoid. 

I'm mostly concerned about whether X is a danger. In person, X is very nice, if a little eccentric. But the emails X sends seem to be more hostile. X is afraid that ""ignorant"" people are unbalancing X's energy and undoing all of X's work on x's-self. What should i do?

I need some advice!

Grammar, spelling and layout apologies. 

A bit of back story. I was diagnosed with a non-malignant brain tumour over a year ago. Yes, great not cancer But holy shit this thing causes me so many problems.  It's on my left temporal lobe, on my communication, speech, memory, u know the necessities. I struggle with the above things daily. Guess what tho, most people I know, including my family (partner excluded-great supporter) don't see or choose not to see the negative ways it affects me. Example, tumour induced vomiting and seizures is obviously the flu or a bug. 

So left completely frustrated I start poking around, like where can I get help. Last night we went to a brain tumour support group. Super glad I went. My problem however is that I am the only one with non-malignant.  I don't know what's happening except for upcoming MRIs. The others know what's going on even if it is awful.

This setting scares me, my biggest fault altho being super compassionate is having difficulty being around sick people. Like I couldn't even see my grandma when she was around in care because it was so overwhelming, all the sadness and loneliness made me cry. Not sure if I am afraid to get close to people because they may die. I don't really know what my question is, maybe I just need to hear that it's OK to feel this way. In a way I don't feel sick enough, like maybe I should just be thankful it's not cancer. 

The group was great and likely no one but me felt this way.  They welcomed me whole heartedly.

I cannot work because I am a liability.  My old coworkers, I am still employed there, despite being great friends while I was there have all but dried up (a few exceptions). I am in my early 40's and maybe retired after having professional careers.

397,"Hey /r/Advice,

&amp;#x200B;

Last year I took most of my savings from a few years of working well over full-time in a situation I was pretty generally unhappy with, but overall really comfortable and secure, and flipped my life on its head. I went traveling with no specific plan besides to see as much as I could, and maybe look for happiness outside of the small corner of Louisiana I spent most of my life in.

&amp;#x200B;

The long story short is that I fell in love with traveling and living abroad. I decided to try again for a bachelor's degree so that I could feasibly (and legally) live abroad, and I'm actually currently studying in a university in Taipei, Taiwan and loving it. Again, though, I find myself romanticizing about owning a home that I can move around.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the money I was saving originally was meant to go towards turning a van, a bus, a box truck, or something like that into a mobile home. Like what /r/vandwellers and Skoolies are up to. But, it's pretty clear now that being restricted to roads isn't very suitable to me. I gave some consideration to houseboats, but their maintenance and limitations... and hurricanes in Louisiana all led me to rule them out over land-based options in the past. Now, some kind of house boat actually seems to have a lot of harmony between something I've always wanted and something I didn't realize I needed!

&amp;#x200B;

I think about this kind of thing a lot, but boats and travel by sea are very much outside of my sphere of knowledge. I don't really know how to approach it all. Here are some general questions I have regarding houseboats:

&amp;#x200B;

* Assuming I want to be able to take this houseboat from country to country, how can I make sure the thing can actually survive that kind of journey? What are the smallest ""house-like"" boats that can actually do that?
* Again, I don't know much of anything about this: How perilous is it to take a vessel like a house boat from, say, Taiwan to Japan or South Korea?
* In the spirit of the last question: Are ""travelers"" able to ""sail into"" another country with their own boat? Is it much different from flying between countries?
* Do you have any idea what the cost of living in a houseboat in other countries is like? Is it typically more or less than life on shore? Is there a practical/easy way to compare the two on a country-by-country basis?
* What about the cost of traveling from one country to another by sea, or the time it would take to do that? I'm sure it depends on the kind of boat, but I have no frame of reference.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to do some basic looking into this stuff a few different times, but most of the discourse on it seems to basically boil down to someone saying ""It's great!"" or ""It's awful!"" and not much detail. I've seen similar things regarding it being way too expensive or ridiculously cheap.",03Apr2019,1
398,"Long story short I take a lot of pride in my work. I do whatever I can do go above and beyond what is expected of me. The position I'm in at my company can impact a lot of other people, so when I do good work lots of other employee's lives are a little bit better. 

My company places absolutely no value on me. My boss nor his boss have no interest in how hard I work. I have no future here and I'm severely underpaid. I am looking for another job. 

But working really hard and receiving no appreciation is extremely depressing. It makes my depression worse and throws off my whole life. It makes me lazy at work, so I start screwing up, then everyone notices and yells at me. It makes me depressed at home too.

So how do I disconnect how my company values me and how I value myself? How do I accept that they will not appreciate verbally or monetarily any of the hard work I do? I want to feel good about what I do, knowing that I might have made someone else's life a little better, even if no one else appreciates it. ",03Apr2019,1
399,"To provide some context, I am a first semester college student who started in the spring as I was away for military training in the fall. I came home and enrolled in my first classes at a state university and am currently an Undeclared major who is working towards the engineering program. 

I am facing several issues right now causing me some anxiety the past few weeks starting with the fact that the methods of learning are very different from high school. I expected this but not quite to this degree, I am adjusting to numerous online programs and textbooks that aren't as easy to navigate as a traditional paper textbook which isn't a huge deal I just simply need to mess around with it and become familiar with it. However my grades are not the greatest as of now (passing everything but probably some low Bs or even a C in a class) and I am realizing my study tactics aren't working well for me, for example: I took many pages of notes on my last exam and pulled a 71 which was heavily discouraging. 

As someone who didnt struggle much in High school except with a class or two senior year, I have been feeling very down questioning my major and wondering if I'm even smart enough to pursue  engineering. I have been having doubts about my goals and I have heard this is very normal as a freshmen but I can't help but feel pretty anxious. 

I feel I'm off on the wrong foot with the semester and Im worried starting out with a very average- or a little lower than- GPA this early will kinda screw me over. ",03Apr2019,1
400,"Just like it says, my brother (21, who I live with) introduced me (23) to his friend almost a year and a half ago, who I immediately noticed was my definition of very attractive. Met him a couple more times and realized wow, this guy is awesome. He had a girlfriend and he was my brother’s friend, so it was a moot point and I quickly pushed it down into the abyss of emotions and ideas that I don’t want to deal with where it festered and grew without my permission. 

I had a fling with another guy for a while, maybe 8 months or so, and that ended a month or two ago. Turns out, that was the key to keeping my secret crush locked away. Fast forward to last weekend, when I commented on one of the depressing/funny memes he put on Facebook with “who hurt you lol” and ten minutes later, my messenger goes off. Cue a long conversation of insights and advice and exchanged compliments, etc. and it was like the dam broke loose. Now I’m full on smitten with the guy, beyond doubt. My friend suggested I mention it to my brother because maybe my brother will say go for it, which is not exactly what happened. My brother didn’t really say anything one way or the other. Maybe I made a mistake and now it’s going to make things awkward? I used to occasionally hang out with him and his friends when they would come over, or we’d go somewhere together, whatever. Can I still do that now that my brother knows? I told him if he wasn’t cool with it, then I wouldn’t mention it to Friend, but I feel super anxious. Someone point me in a direction that’s outside of my own head please, any advice is welcome here.



TL;DR I’ve been crushing on my brother’s friend for a long time, realized I’m totally smitten with the guy. Told my brother in the hopes he might say go for it, but he didn’t say anything good or bad. Now I’m worried I made everything weird.",03Apr2019,1
402,"So I've got a friend that over the past half year has really become one of my best friends. We get along extremely well and are similar in so many uncanny ways, and every time we hang out it's a lot of fun and filled with laughter.
 
I unfortunately got really insecure and started having some really toxic behaviors when she got another friend that she liked hanging out with more. It all led up to a fight this past Friday night and after a couple days of silence she sent me a text Monday morning saying she didn't think we should be friends anymore and gave me her reasons, but she wasn't even willing to discuss it, which is the hardest part to me. She's always been an amazing friend and I hate how bad of a friend I have been of late, but even so we've always gotten along so well outside of my stupid jealousy. She's a very loyal person with only a few friends, so discarding a friendship isn't something she would do lightly.

During that silence I really took a look at myself and hated who I was becoming, and something in me just finally broke, or maybe fixed itself, and I realized that none of this was worth all the pain and anger, and so I just accepted that this other person was in her life and I shouldn't be jealous about that. I really feel like I sorted through most of what was causing the toxicity, but I'm really scared it's too late. This friendship means a lot to me, and I don't want to lose it, and it will really hurt if I get no closure.

Right now I'm just giving it a little space before I reach out again and I'm hoping this will somehow blow over, but I'm afraid it won't. There's a lot of hurt and anger wrapped up in all of this. I certainly know that I can live my life and be happy without her as a friend, but I know the quality of my life will still be better with her in it, and I believe I'm finally at a point again where I could say that I would do the same for her. The friendship really means a lot to me, and the fact that she chose me as one of the the few people she's willing to give friendship to means even more, so losing this would be really hard.

Is there any saving this friendship?

404,"Reddit I need you help because I don't know what to do about this issue.

Basicially my class teacher prefers two girls from my class over the rest of the entire class. 
Examples: they get to leave earlier, he tells them the exam answers DURING the exam, they can just go to every 'doctors appointment' they want (without having to hand in excuses) and they can say whatever they want without getting consequences, while other students get punished for saying the exact same thing!

This isn't a 'maybe the those girls are better in school that's why' or 'you're just imagining it' situation. This  is real and it matters because he's my teacher in like 7 of our subjects so he basically decides about my whole future.

The whole class of 30 people agrees on this ( and we're not 12-14 anymore most of us are 17-20). 

We can't talk to him because he'll deny it, he already denies it even though it's so obvious.
We can't go to the director because she made it pretty clear, that she doesn't care and I don't know what else to do.

( if you're still somehow wondering how this  is an issue: I study and get everything right and my grades still aren't as  good as theirs  and believe they never study and have to ask me every 2 minutes what we're talking about.

406,"Is there anything I can do about this? I love my job but Jesus I can’t deal with the unprofessional..

I work at a franchised hotel. The only employees are the front desk staff (me,) housekeepers and breakfast attendants. Then there’s just the maintenance guy, my manager and the owners.

So before I get into him illegally not paying us for hours worked by changing our time cards, here are a few other examples: 

I have seen him smoke weed on the property.. He told me they do not hire males because they’re not as smart or clean. ..He sleeps on the job on top of a table in the back, even when it is just him on duty. ..I have witnessed him lie to the owners about staying a room a few nights for free, and then going as far as to blame an innocent coworker! He has forgotten about multiple interviews and didn’t want to come in so he made me do them. He also does not do his job well whatsoever and he NEVER listens or even pays any attention to you when you try to ask him something. He doesn’t remember anyone’s availability/requested days off and doesn’t bother writing it down so the schedule is always incorrect. He’ll show up for only an hour a day and leave a mess for you to clean up behind him. He left me alone for two hours on my very first day because well, he doesn’t gaf. And not only that but the owners don’t see any of it and what they do see they let him get away with. 

So, not only does he let his girlfriend (also a front desk employee) get special privileges by showing up 30 minutes late or more every single day, but me and my coworker are convinced he is also changing our time cards. This is not just so he can hide the fact that his wife needs to be let go, but so that me and my coworkers don’t go over in our hours. 

The max hours we can get is like, 36. Anywhere too close to 40 and the owners go ballistic. So, me and my coworker have noticed that our pay is not adding up correctly, but we have no way of viewing our time cards. On top of that my manager accidentally let it slip to me yesterday that he cuts  people’s hours when they get too close!

I literally could go on.

407,"So I’ve been seeing this guy for a few weeks now and thinks seemed to be going well.

Things have been weird with me and him ever since and we’ve barely spoke and he’s blanked my last message. I don’t know how to go about sorting this out. 
I could either
1. Message him upfront being like ‘I dunno if I’m overthinking things or did the other night make things awkward between us?’ 
2. Just wait until he messages me, if he doesn’t then fair enough, that’s that?

408,"I’m devastated and would like some objective feedback. 

Backstory: My son, “Jack”, was born when me and his father, “Ben”, were 23 and 21 respectively. I am now 40. We were both alcoholics at the time. Obviously I stopped drinking when I was pregnant. Ben did not. I didn’t drink much for the year or so after Jack was born, but Ben and I had a messy breakup and I was bartending at the time. I started drinking heavily. I dated horrible, abusive men. Jack spent a lot of time with my parents and cousin. Ben racked up so many DUI’s that he still does not have a license. I had undiagnosed bipolar disorder and was diagnosed when I was 30. Before diagnosis I was really angry and would rage frequently. Sometimes at my Jack. I was short and snappy with him, always irritable, and absorbed in my own bullshit with these abusive men. Ben seemed put out any time he had to “watch” his son and Jack hated him. Jack really doesn’t talk to Ben and he’s only seen him 3 times in the past year and a half. 

So in 2010 I was diagnosed and medicated. It calmed me down a bit but I was still investing most of my emotional time in men, men Jack absolutely hated 
I finally got my shit together in 2015 after a six week day program at a psychiatric hospital. I stopped dating and haven’t dated much since. 

I spent most of my off time devoted to making up all the years I was a terrible mother.  I cooked and did everything I could for him. I bought him pretty much anything he wanted, despite my low income and no child support. My parents also spoiled the shit out of him. The only thing I asked him to do was take out the trash, fold the towels, and put the dishes away and he wouldn’t do that half of the time. I showed him how to do laundry and clean his bathroom, how to wash dishes, things he’d need to know as an adult. He refused to do any of it and I felt so guilty I let him get away with it.

His father on the other hand was living it up. I will say he’s a hard worker but his Facebook page was plastered with pics of him wasted with all of his friends. He had a full time job and was bartending. He would drunk dial Jack at midnight on a Sunday but mostly didn’t call him at all. 

Anyway, it was like pulling teeth to get Jack to do anything, like going to the dentist, the doctor, the grocery store,drivers ed, family parties, you name it. It was a fight every time and it’s not like I could physically make him go. I could take his computer away and he would just go in my room and take it back. He would buy games using my PayPal without asking. He once punched the wall for me not allowing him to do something. 

His father doesn’t put up with any nonsense whatsoever and Jack is a bit intimidated by him. He would call Jack and tell him to shape up, and he would for a short period of time and then it was back to normal. 

Monday was the last straw for me. I told Jack to get in the car because he was having his first behind the wheel driving lesson. He is 16 and he is overdue for a license. He refused. He said he didn’t want a license and didn’t care that I needed him to get a job. 

I told him I was under a lot of pressure, I’m starting a new job, I’m in the middle of a medication change, I want to move within the next year and am trying to get the house ready. I still struggle with a lot of depression and I need his help, I need for him to do the few things I asked him to do and a bit more to help get the house ready.

He coldly told me he didn’t care. Said he didn’t care about anything at all. I believed him. He hardly talked to me and would close his bedroom door in my face. He expected me to drop everything for him all the time, which I did. 

I finally snapped and told him he was going to live with his father. I called Ben and made him a deal. I said he didn’t have to pay me back child support if he took Jack, and he immediately agreed. 

Jack didn’t want to go and I told him he didn’t have a choice. I’d threatened him with going to live with his dad before, and he would do what he was supposed to for a week and then back to normal. This time he said he’d do all the things I’d asked of him and I said I know he wouldn’t and to pack up his stuff because we were going to his dads the next day. 

And that’s exactly what happened. His dad lives in a one bedroom apartment above the bar he works at, which is located in a cool little town with a lot of restaurants and things to do. Jack will have no problem getting a job he can walk to. His cousin/best friend is a 10 min walk away. It’s not the worst place to live. But Ben is still a heavy drinker. He has no tv or WiFi because he’s never home. He has one plate and one pan. I don’t think he even has a bath towel for Jack. He didn’t have a trash can until yesterday. He has to take an Uber to do laundry. He has no AC and summer is around the corner. His neighbors smoke and the smell seeps into the apartment. Jack is now living the bachelor life. 

And you know what? I’m not doing anything to help them. I chauffeured Ben around until about 2 years ago, taking him to run errands and to court. I obviously bent over backward for Jack. I cried and cried when I dropped Jack off. I feel so guilty but I’m tired of being taken advantage of by the two of them. 

I did take them to Walmart for them to get food and a trash can. I looked at Bens empty kitchen and my first instinct was to run and get dishes and silverware for them. Nope. I’m not doing it. They can make plates out of tin foil if need be. It’s time for them to grow up. I know Ben isn’t a fit father. I’m not sure I’m a fit mother either but I know the only person Jack will listen to is Ben. Ben will tell Jack to scrub the toilet with a toothbrush and Jack would do it. He’ll go to driving school, he’ll get a job. Learn basic life skills. 

I’m devastated. Coming home to an empty house is one of the worst things I’ve ever felt. I texted Jack goodnight and told him I loved him. He didn’t respond. Which is typically for him but still hurt. I think I made the right choice but can’t help but think if I was the mother I should’ve been in the first place we wouldn’t be in this position.

I moved into this apartment in june of 2018 and I immediately noticed my roomates 13 yr old dachshund shits in the kitchen once (sometimes twice a day). He takes her on walks but honestly not everyday, and she's an elderly dog so she obviously needs more attention.  


There were so many weird annoying roommate things that he would do that I had to continue to approach him about that I didn't even really get to talk to him about the dog until like a month in. He tried reflecting responsibility and told me I was ""trying to change his lifestyle"", because I asked him to help me organize the clutter of books and papers in the apartment he hasnt used since he graduated. 

He got really emotional in the middle of the conversation and yelled about how he ""never wanated the dog and how he only inherited her after his grandma died, and how he's just waiting for her to die"", and then ran out the room.

After I told him that ""changing your lifestyle"" (to use his term) is a concession required when you have roommates, he sorta kinda started helping out.   


But dog poop still everyday.

after 6 more months of me sending him texts every so often reminding him of his responsibilities I finally really pressed him on it. which turned into a blow out after he  started saying I just wanted him to put the dog down.  


He told the landlord that I told him to kill his dog. YO, never once did I even insinuate that. 

  
He claims he cant walk the dog because he works 60 hours a week, between three part time jobs. our rent shares are like, less than $500 a month. 

  
I gave him practical suggestions like: hiring a dog walker, or using dog diapers.   


He has since then, 3 months ago, bought diapers he put on her once for 20 mins and then never again.

420,"Hi all, so I have a friend that I met in nursing school. I was somewhat of a loner and she was friends with a lot of our class. She was best friends with one girl specifically so I always came second, which didn't bother me, honestly I was more concerned with passing than making friends. 

Fast forward: we all graduate. This best friend of hers starts pulling back and doing her own thing, along with every one else. Because of this, we become a lot closer. I work two jobs and have a boyfriend, so I'm usually busy, but I also appreciate alone time. This girl, consistently needs to be in contact, wants to hangout every day, gets upset when I don't respond etc, I feel like her boyfriend. 

She doesn't have a job, so she has a lot of free time. I passed boards in October, she still hasn't after two attempts and is reasonably upset about it. My thing: I get super annoyed with her, she doesn't work, her parents support her, and they allow her to buy what ever the hell she wants, she goes on vacation all the time, new clothes, fancy stuff, etc, she complains a lot about how depressed she is. She has all the time in the world to study but just doesn't. On top of it, she has a boyfriend from a foreign country that clearly only wants to date her for papers and talks to other girls with her knowing about it, but she won't leave him, which also contributes to her sadness. 

In December, my ex boyfriend hung himself, following that 4 other people I know have passed away. I said before, I passed my boards (mention that I studied every day including Christmas for a year to pass that stupid test), but the state STILL hasn't issued me my license so I'm still unable to work as an RN (super annoying). All of this has me depressed.

It sounds ignorant, but I can't help but feel irritated when she whines about her problems, because if she took control, they could be fixed. Perhaps I'm sitting here feeling sorry for myself, but a lot of what depresses me are things that I have no control over, which results in me sitting here annoyed as shit whenever she bitches. I don't wana be that ignorant person that feels like their problems top others, but in this case, listening to her sometimes has me thinking ""stop being a baby and take control of your life"". 

Last week she sent a text when I was working after I missed her call that she wishes I'd call her back and its normal for friends to chat regularly and it blew me off my chair. She's called every day since and I tell myself to text her to tell her I just need time for myself but haven't brought myself to do it, because I know it'll open up the gates for contact and I just don't want to talk to her. Sometimes when we hang out it is fun, but she's super intense about our friendship to the point where it's almost childish. 

&amp;#x200B;

My point: has anyone had a similar situation happen? how do you take a break from a friend or how do you break up with a friend? I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I'm a very relaxed person and her intensity is too much. Again, I feel like a neglectful boyfriend with an overbearing/high maintenance girlfriend.

421,"I work as a lifeguard at a YMCA, after a couple months and finishing the lifeguard training course we started doing yearly drills. One of the drills involves someone unexpectedly acting liking they are having a seizure or drowning in which we got to jump in and get them out via a back board within a minute thirty seconds. I figured it was all fine or dandy since I knew everything I was supposed to I could name different types of rescues show how to do them just fine. The problem is I snap under pressure really easy. I failed the drill when I froze up in the moment. After two failed drills I have to do the lifeguard class again but I don't think it will be a problem because it doesn't really put any pressure on me but even if I do pass I wonder that if something actually happened I might freeze again and unlike the drill it might cost a life.

425,"Hey guys I'm not sure if this is the best place, but I'm looking for advice on dealing with a recruiter that is kind of being an asshole.

Recruiters are common in my field, so I'm used to dealing with them, but one is running me the wrong way.

A couple of weeks ago a recruiter reached out with an opportunity to interview at a company, and after discussing my background briefly he asked the absolute lowest salary that would get me in the door for an interview. I asked what range the position offered and he said ""Well there is no range I just want to know your baseline needs."" 

Okay... Well, I had an offer from another company at a certain salary, so I proposed a salary at about 10% below that current offer (I didn't want to work for the company that sent the offer, so I was okay with a slight deduction).

He says, ""Look, that's outside of their range, they won't interview you if that's the lowest you'll take."" Red flag number one. I understand that no one wants to go first in a salary discussion, but he clearly lied. I say, ""Okay, what's the lowest salary I have to expect to get an interview?"" And he proposes a number about 10% below my initial request.

I say ""Well, it's lower than I'd like but salary isn't everything, and if that's just what gets me in the door, I'm comfortable with that."" I said this expecting to be able to negotiate, seeing as how he framed it as the ""lowest to get me in the door."" Perhaps I shouldn't have accepted the interview at the number that I did, but I expected there to be room to negotiate if the company liked me in the interview.

Well, the recruiter submits me for the position and CC's me on the email chain, saying ""Hardhitter007 is very excited to pursue this opportunity and is only seeking a salary of X"", where X is the salary that he proposed. That rubbed me the wrong way, because I felt that his wording was disingenuous to our discussion.

Fast forward to the interview, the recruiter calls me before I walk in, wishes me luck, and tells me to call him after. I do the interview, felt that I absolutely crushed it, discussed with the panel that my experience exceeded what their looking for, and then I leave. I call the recruiter and he says ""Great! So you'll be all over their offer at X salary if they send it to you, right?""

I respond, ""Well, I feel that I did well and am qualified enough to counter at a higher salary dependent on what other benefits etc the offer entails.""

He flips out, calls me a primadonna, and suggests that I'm threating his integrity. I told him that I felt comfortable negotiating because the salary that he and I discussed was supposed to be my baseline, and I felt that my interview and experience warranted more than my absolute baseline.

He says that I was locked in to that baseline salary because that was how he submitted me to the company. That was the biggest red flag. He's implying that I should lock myself in to a salary before an interview without knowing any details of the job, any other benefits, etc, and then suggests that I'm baiting and switching the company if I counter.

The next day, he contacts me to inform me that the VP of the company (who was present for my interview) thought very highly of me and wanted me to interview with a more senior position in a different department of the company. This request, to me, validated that I should have been able to negotiate above my baseline if I were offered the other position. (I understand that some jobs have salary caps and that they have to fit with the internal equity of the company, but the recruiter never proposed a maximum salary for the position, he simply said I wouldn't get an interview if I didn't tell him that my base necessity for pay was X).

However, he began to rant again after this offer telling me that as I get closer to the next interview he and I need to have another discussion about salary, so that I can ""stop being a primadonna"" and ""stop threatening his integrity.""

Am I wrong for sensing red flags here? He is accusing me of being dishonest and baiting and switching the company, however I feel that he is bullying me into a lower wage, and making me feel the need to lock myself into a salary before I even interview. I feel like he's trying to take advantage of me and guarantee himself a payday by undervaluing me to the company.

429,"The past few days I haven’t been able to stop thinking about a girl I used to know

Long story short, last year I met a girl that I was convinced was the girl of my dreams. That phase wore off eventually as we really got to know eachother better and see eachother’s flaws and problems, but those feelings I felt were some of the strongest I’ve felt in my life; stronger than my feelings for an ex girlfriend of nearly two years (sounds terrible, I know). Things didn’t exactly work out between us. She had just been ending a relationship with her ex, so I was unfortunately the inevitable rebound. She swears that didn’t mean I meant nothing to her, she was just at a rough point in her life and she couldn’t be fully invested in me the way I was with her.

This may very well have been bullshit, as she was a notorious bullshit artist. She lied about pretty much everything she could to everybody she could. 

After a rough period of her and I not getting along we decided that we could still be friends, and I honestly felt that the connection her and I had meant it would be a waste to not be in eachother’s lives, even if it wasn’t as a couple. Fast forward a few months and no matter how nice it was being her friend again, I couldn’t stop finding out about lies she was telling me or other people. As much as I liked this girl, I couldn’t give my time and thought to a person that made it almost impossible to trust every other thing they said. One of these things being that she hooked up with a coworker, a coworker she had complained to me and her manager in the past that he sexually harassed people and was a pig. Turns out at some point she had been texting him to hook up, and he came to me about it cuz he heard that her and I might have been something. I also believe she secretly messaged the ex boyfriend of a girl I had been seeing at the time and told him that she was getting with me when the two of them were still together, but I don’t have proof of that.

Long story short, this is a girl that made me the happiest man in the world, then the most miserable. I consistently, even though she assured me this wasn’t the case, felt like she never gave a damn about me. She says she suffers from clinically diagnosed anxiety and depression, regularly sees a therapist, and had even been checked into some sort of psyche ward. I still believe she’s a special girl deep down, and that all she needs to do is figure herself out and straighten out the kind of person she wants to be and she’ll finally be the person I envision her as. I don’t know how much her mental disorders affect her behavior in terms of lying, manipulating, and using people, and I don’t know if that’s who she really is at heart or not, but I don’t believe so. 

Cutting all ties with her and anybody else involved in that part of my life was by far the best decision I’ve made and I am finally able to live my life without metaphorically looking over my shoulder all the time. I know less than a year is probably not enough time for any major changes of heart or character to take place, but I still can’t help shake this feeling that what happened between us wasn’t all there is. Is it worth texting her? Am I just gonna put myself up to disappointment? Am I gonna heal some wounds between us and improve some parts of our lives by making things right? Has she totally moved on and doesn’t give a shit or would a message from me mean something to her?

Let's starts by saying that around 7 years ago I got run over by a car. Technically, it was against a car. A car didn't see me crossing. And the idiot I was I didnt run further to dodge, but skidded to a stop which resulted in me slamming against the side of the car with my knees. My knees took the full brunt of the impact. They were swollen that day, but school didn't deem it necessary to send me to a hospital nor did my parents think of doing that.

Ever since that my knees hurt after walking a bit. And even one of my friends pointed out I stumble instead of walking properly recently actually. So yeah, weak knees.

I did go to the doctor for it last year. She deemed it fine since the pain lessens after I rest up for a bit. She also couldn't find anything wrong with my knees.

I know some information about their home and have seen it first hand. They lock the children in their bedrooms for as long as 12 hours at a time. They get sent to bed at 7 PM. The children's mother, my ex, is aware of this and has lied to dcfs about previous cases involving the children to cover for the father. That's not the worst if it.

The mother and I while dating one time were planning on having some friends over on a weekend her and I were going to have the kids. I told her I was against it because they would be over late at night and her son likes to stay up till 2 am asking for water and the bathroom. She told me in a text that she would give him melatonin to get him to sleep. I told her that she cannot do that because that's drugging your child. 

The children didnt come that weekend or ever again because we had split up not long after that weekend. The last time I saw her she came into my trailer with her key to get the rest of her things knowing full well that i had a 12 hour shift that night and had been working for over a week strait. 

When she came she brought her ex husband wife, her current boyfriend, her son, and the kids grandma. I personally felt threatened by this but I'm glad I had my mother waiting for her and ready to wake me up if she showed up like this. 

While they were here they threatened me and my mother either with a call to dcfs or if we called dcfs after everything was said and done. Anyway I feel obligated to call dcfs but I'm hesitant on doing so because the parents could say I hit their children or worse to dcfs or authorities.

I have a complete history of my texts between me and my ex and I made it very clear multiple times that I could not hit her children regardless of whether or not her and her ex husband gave me permission. 

I want to give this information to dcfs but if I do so it doesnt matter if it's done anonymously or not they could try to accuse me of doing something I didnt do or hurting me and my family.

So recently my GF had some traumatic things happen to her. I didn't respond the correct way I should have to the issue and we wound up ending it. However, the next day when we met up to exchange some things we basically said how we still loved each other more than anything. We agreed to remain together but take a break from physically seeing each other so she can deal with these issues and better herself from it.

She did say we can talk, even on a daily basis. So this was a rule differing from anything I've seen on other posts. I have figured out most of the issues dwelled from me only dwelling on negativity not positity. I told her how I want to be there for her and support her through it all and she genuinely seems to understand that. But she she said she does want space to seek counseling and better herself so we can eventually start dating again. I know I have changed her life for the better and we have bonded and experienced so much more than any of our past relationships, especially on her part! She still says when we message each other she loves me , and loves me more than anything.

I miss her so badly and know she is the one that I would want to spend my life with. I want to know how to get her back into my life and rekindle what we had but make it better. My mom believes she will come around eventually. Has anyone had anything similar play out and work out? Or what should I be doing?

A little background: I am a divorced father of two. A 4 year old and 6 year old. My kids are my world and what I live for. I schedule around my time with them and make an effort to see them as much as possible. My ex-wife and I have a 50-50 custody split so I do get them quite frequently. My ex and I have a somewhat interesting relationship. We get along well enough for the most part and try to focus our efforts on the children and talk about little else. 

I had never had huge issues with my ex until the last month or so. I feel they mostly stem from my current girlfriend trying to interject herself into the raising of my kids more than she should. My kids adore her and she does a lot for both of them. She's great with them and I could not ask for anything more in that aspect. She does however get easily agitated if she is doing something for the kids that my ex has neglected to do for whatever reason be it not enough time or just simply forgot or whatever. My girlfriend's need to get agitated has in turn made things stressful on me as I feel very much like maybe she should back off a bit on getting so mad about every petty little thing. I've told her numerous times if she doesn't think she can handle it then I understand and we can figure something else out.

She has demanded to know who I have talked to throughout the day and has been frequently checking my Snapchat score to make sure it aligns with what I tell her. This behavior to me is immature and infuriating. I'm just straight up annoyed with it and have tried to reassure her but am starting to get irritable about it. It's every night. She knows the password to my phone. I'm not trying to hide anything. I'm not talking to anyone or cheating on her. Apparently she still doesn't believe me. I don't feel like I care about any of this petty drama at all it's beneath me and what my priorities are. 

I care a lot about my girlfriend. She's great to be around and has helped me get through some of the hardest times of my life (she was there when I got divorced and helped through it). She's great with my kids and they love her. My family likes her. She's generally been good to me.

451,"I'm nearing the end of my senior year at high school and I would love to regain my old friends, whom I did wrong and severed our relationship as a result, as we all are likely never going to see each other again. To most of these friends I've sent an acknowledgement email that I was sorry for what happened and told them they can reach me out whenever they need to.

With my first crush however I think that such a simple apology wouldn't cut. I had a crush on this girl for the first 3 years. After opening up to her and getting rejected, I was unable to process this and became mean against her. Be the continuous persuasions, talking behind her back against her friends or drunk calling her, I've did terrible things against her and I am still to this day terribly sorry about it. After facing the reality I finally distanced myself from her and since 1.5 years I've hadn't a proper talk or interaction with her (we are classmates)

Before opening to her however we were best friends. I am aware that it can never be the same (and I don't want it to be the same, I still don't know of my feelings), but I also don't want us to graduate as total strangers after having so much in common.

I don't have any idea on how to express her these thoughts and would really love it if you could help me salvage a friendship out of this situation.

452,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for eight months, and I love her. When we arrived at college (we go to the same school) I met this other girl, who was actually the first friend I made at college. Me and her went on a trip to Utah with our school, and I thought she was very attractive. After the trip we didn’t talk much, we only said hi to each other around campus. But now we have a class together and we’ve also been cast in the same show (we’re theatre kids). Her and I are great friends, and we’ve been having a lot of fun at rehearsals and class, but she’s definitely not interested in me because she’s in a relationship too, but I feel like everyday something happens that brings me closer. For example, there’s this one improv scene that we have together, and at one rehearsal it resulted in me holding her very close in my arms, in which the director laughed and said “ooh this just turned into a love story!” Of course I liked that in the moment, but at the same time I hate that it happened because this needs to stop. It’s come to the point where I’ve started to write “NO” on my hand whenever I’m around her to remind myself to stop.
I don’t want to take any steps further because I’m not interested in her at all—I just think she’s attractive. I know it’s common for a guy to be in a relationship, he later becomes friends with another girl, thinks she’s attractive, but doesn’t do anything because his heart belongs to someone else. That’s the situation I’m in. I love my girlfriend with all my heart and she’ll always be the one that I want.
Like I said, I don’t want anything to do with this girl romantically. She’s a great friend, and I’m probably only feeling like this because we’ve just been spending more time at rehearsals and class together. But I want these feelings to go away.

Any advice?

My daughter is 17, has had her license a year. Drives a car that already has some damage (she's a teen after all). Today, she backed into someone in a parking lot. She has a scratch on her bumper but since it's an older car I probably wouldn't even care. Other driver (adult) has a ""fist size dent"" in his front quarter-panel. 

She was smart and they exchanged information (she gave him my phone, copies of insurance, took pics, etc). I have been texting with the other driver. I have her side, I asked for his: They both said said she pulled into a parking spot, and as he tried to go past her, she backed out to straighten up her parking job and backed into him. She did not see him. He did not honk or make any movement to avoid.

I know parking lot accidents are typically no fault. I feel like they are both at fault. She should have looked both ways and slowed down, but he could clearly see her backing out and did not yield. She hit him on the front corner of his car (not the middle or rear).

He is taking his car in tomorrow for an estimate. It's not a super nice car - just a normal run of the mill car. I can't imagine the damage to be much.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is - I would prefer to settle this outside of insurance, but if he claims damage and says it's her fault and I don't pay he will file a claim with her/my insurance. Rates go up (especially since she's a teen). I don't think I should have to pay, I don't think it was entirely her fault, and she has some minor damage too. So, do I pay, so I wait and see how much, do I dispute it, do I file a claim with his insurance for her damage? It would be nice if we could just say - hey - both parties were wrong - cover your own damage and move on but it doesn't seem other driver is going to go that way. What do I do?

Hi,

I'm an 18 year old male who has never really struggled with mental health before, except bad hypochondria (health anxiety); but recently have been having real issues in that I have an awful fear that certain intrusive thoughts i have, and some feelings I get are symptoms of a personality disorder. I've never really thought about them before, but now i have, i'm terrified i do have a personality disorder. Before I list some thoughts, some context to my life is that I haven't really had much attention when it comes to friends at school, or in my home; my parents never gave me a lot of attention as a kid, and I've never really been a popular kid at school; but I've always really been an attention seeker and i'm worried it's developed into something worse. Some thoughts/feelings i have that worry me are as follows;

1. Although this has improved in the last year, i sometimes have intrusive thoughts like ""I would get so much attention if I were hospitalised, or x happened, or y event occurred and i was involved."" - i get these semi-regularly, normally when someone i care about isn't giving me much attention and they usually do. It is worth noting i don't want to be hospitalised, or involved in a bad event, and would never purposely try to get these events to happen to me for attention, i don't have urges to and i don't want to - but the intrusive thought about how much attention i would get is there. This has gotten a lot better over recent months, while before i thought nothing of them, now the more i think about it the more i hate myself for it, i don't want to have these thoughts, and hate myself when they come into my brain.
2. Sometimes i have irrational feelings, for example i get jealous when my girlfriend makes new friends or talks to other people, male or female; i think the foundation of this, is again, the attention issue - i get melancholic because the attention isn't on me, in the past, this is often when thought number one above would pop up into my brain, but i would never attempt to do things like that to get me attention, and i would never bring it up to my partner.
3. It is worth mentioning i am not suicidal, or depressed; i don't have urges to self harm or hurt myself for attention and i recognise that doing so is extremely manipulative - but i'm scared these thoughts i have are a lesser version of a personality disorder like borderline.
4. I used to constantly require reassurance of my ex; i would want her to tell me she loves me a lot, and i would want her to reassure me i was attractive - i was only 16 at the time of this relationship, and i've grown out of this and don't do this in my current relationship, i have since matured and gotten more self-confident and don't need constant reassurance from my current partner.

These thoughts/feelings used to be more amplified when i was in my first relationship, i was in-love and felt a lot of emotions i never really had felt before, and as a result, these things were worse than they are now, in my second relationship, with a girl i also love. I like to think i have matured a little bit and these things have gotten better, but i still sometimes have these thoughts, that, before a couple of weeks ago, i never thought anything of. I don't know if this desire for attention is a personal disorder, or if it's just emotional immaturity/attention seeking. I really would appreciate some help, as I've been really concerned about this lately. Is this a personality disorder, does this make me manipulative, or is it just attention-seeking the result of emotional immaturity?",03Apr2019,0
477,"I need advice on a guy I’m dating.

Ive known him for eighteen months now. He had a really bad breakup late 2017 with his fiancé of three years. We confessed about liking each other but he said he’s not ready to get into a serious relationship. I was fine with that and we just hang out casually until he says one day that we’re dating. This is a big deal because he was very firm about not dating around. He said how dating for him is a serious thing and it would mean that he has plans of eventually taking it into the next level.

We lived together for a few months. No sex or physical intimacy save for the usual hand holding and cheek kisses. At one point he said he has fallen in love with me but just can’t bring himself to commit into a relationship right away because he is still not over his ex. He is also clinically diagnosed with depression and his episodes can get very intense. 

He has been very honest and I appreciate that. We both know that even though we like each other, the timing just sucks.

To make things worse, I have now moved into another state because of work. We are three time zones away from each other and it has been especially hard to talk. We chat from time to time. When I’m lucky, we get to talk over the phone once a week. 

I am at a point where I will shamelessly admit that I am very much in love with this person. I have tried and failed many times to forget him but all it takes is one text from him and I’m back to where I started. All of our friends who know of our situation look at me with pity. I always tell them it’s the timing that sucks. I know he cares for me a lot. He’s just not well enough. I understand him even without trying but I can’t deny that I get upset whenever we schedule a call and he will forget about it. It happened one too many times it came to a point that I get surprised when he actually calls.

He is apologetic and I know he hates being the reason why I get upset. I can’t even get upset forever because I know he tries. It’s just that I am not his priority and we both know that.

He makes me so happy and yet he’s also the reason why my heart breaks each time. Everyone is telling me to step away from this situation and in as much as I know that’s the only logical way, it hurts me so much to do it as well.

I am not going to ask what I should do. Instead, please give me advice on how to deal with this. :(",03Apr2019,1
478,"Context: I’ve been with my boyfriend for over a year. We have had our ups and downs, but overall he is a great guy. He hasn’t ever cheated on me, but he has some some small “white lies” because he thinks it’ll avoid an argument. (Example. His ex from a long time ago texted him Happy Birthday, and he deletes it. Later he restored his phone and the text came up. He said he didn’t want to tell me because he thought it would make me mad or cause an argument. I’d rather him just be honest rather than lie.)

There are 2 ex’s that are relentless about contacting him. Texting “Hey baby! I miss you! How’s it going babe?” And liking mine and his social media posts. It became creepy and intrusive so I blocked them both, and asked him to do the same. He agrees. 

Months go by and it’s finally radio silence from the ex’s. It’s sooooo peaceful. Then ex #1 sends him a message on FB. We both thought that was odd since he blocked them. He sent an explanation saying he no longer wanted contact, then blocked her. Everything was cool...

We travel to Ireland for a week, and he proposes to me. It wasn’t very romantic because he told me before hand that he was going to do it. And where. I wasn’t very surprised. But I was happy. We post on social media and get a ton of nice reactions from everyone. Everyone is very happy, and his mom welcomes me to the family. We are in bliss. 

24 hours later ex#2 comments “Congratulations!” On him changing his status on FB. It creeped us out because he hasn’t spoken to her in over 1.5 years. I asked why she was able to comment if he has blocked her. 

He said “I thought I did... I guess i didn’t.”

That was literally one small thing I asked him to do, is block those 2 ex’s. He didn’t. I’m furious and upset that he lied to me about blocking them, I took my ring off. I told him if i can’t trust him to simply block 2 toxic people I can’t trust him to move forward with us without him lying. I made him sleep in the guest bedroom last night, and I plan to ask him to stay in there for a while. I’ve refused to say I love you back to him, I am just in utter disgust. 

He said he is going to make it right and propose again, making it more surprising and romantic. 

I know it might seem like I am overreacting. But these two girls have been stalking us and making our relationship HELL for a year. I just simply wanted him to block them. And he didn’t. He says he is going to make it right.

I’ve tried a ton of things to change this but I’m at a point where nothing has worked and I am freaking exhausted. I fall asleep very easily, but I wake up feeling as though I didn’t sleep at all. Some nights, I wake up often throughout the night and some nights I sleep till morning but again, feel as though I didn’t sleep. I have what I would describe as loud and disruptive dreams.

I’ve tried changing our bed (we found the most comfortable mattress topper and it is amazing), our sheets, blankets, temperature in the room, tv on or off, meditation, taking a bubble bath right beforehand,  taking a shower, my husband has tried melatonin. The list goes on. It’s starting to impact my day to day productivity and with twin five year olds, you kinda need all the energy you can get. Some weeks are worse than others and sleep deprivation hits where I do dumb things because I am way too tired, like putting my instapot lid on a burner and then turning the burner on, because, you know, that makes sense. Or I tried to put a can of refried beans in the dishwasher to cook. Lol. My husband also suffers from horrible sleep but he has a hard time falling asleep and staying that way. Are there any other tips or tricks or some sort of freaking magic to get good, quality sleep? ",03Apr2019,1

I’m married and I am absolutely, unabashedly in love with my wife. We have a great sex life, we can always talk to one another, we never fight... it’s perfect, truly.

But there’s a woman at my work who seems to have gotten my attention and I’m frustrated by my lack of ability to quell my attraction to this woman. 

Were I not already committed to my beautiful and perfect wife, this woman would be my type to a fault. 

She’s brunette, beautiful face, and she fills out her uniform very well (not an easy feat as a cop with a bulletproof vest on). 

And naturally she’s been partnered with me on the job for the next two weeks while my regular partner is on leave. This has made my job both more difficult and enjoyable, but I am EXTREMELY steadfast in my monogamous beliefs and I will never act on my... I dunno, lusting, I guess? 

Besides which, she’s also a good friend of mine. Unfortunately, she’s a good friend I find utterly attractive in every single way imaginable and it is really eating me up that I’m doing something very wrong by having this crush on someone that isn’t my wife.

490,"I’m a moderator on a subreddit that, through my main account. I have a user being rather difficult, for instance he’s literally daring me to permanently ban him, and I don’t really want to do that. 

I gave this user a temporary suspension, on two weeks, and this user seems rather snake bitten about this. His rule violation was for targeting another user, and I told him of the rules, 1 week for any attacks against another user. 

I alternatively gave him a proposition, he could issue an apology to the other user, and have the temporary lifted upon the targeted user verifying that the apology happened, and whether they accept it or not. 

Naughty user, instead declared “make if two weeks because you’re a POS!” 

So, I happily obliged. Then, he went bananas, and immediately started attempting to appeal that. Buddy, you directed a rule violation towards me! 

He got in a stalemate where he demanded that I go back to the original temporary, and I kept saying no. He asked about my original offer with apologizing, I informed him that deal is effectively off the table, and he’d have to wait out the 14 days. 

Still he persists, he then resorts to daring me to permanently ban him. I’m hesitant because he was a good contributor who played by the rules. He’s clearly upset about something in regards to the subreddit, but would rather be difficult instead of offering criticism. 

I gave him a mute, and I’m considering having to manually reissue the mute when the 72 hours are up, all the way until his suspension expires. 

For those who might claim I’m too soft, I try to meet people half way, but one thing I don’t like, is people who throw my goodwill back into my face.

I'm female and currently live abroad for uni (college) I didn't know alot of people but quickly made friends, but this one particular friend (met through mutual friends and ex) i've known for almost a yr now, has a crush on me. 

Friends don’t like him as he can be boring or extremely rude to them (anti-social to girls). Actually is a genuinely nice guy, we talk a lot, he’s funny, but after midnight I won’t respond or open messages because he’ll “Jokingly” get graphic about the things he’ll do to me or wants to do to me. Really don’t like that, he calls me ""innocent"" and himself ""Dirty"", i’d tell him to stop, and get advice from mutual friends, he finds out then gets mad, so I've stopped getting advice from them.

He wants me to open up more, talk about things i’m not comfortable with (Found out from mutual friend he wants me to do this because I’ll depend feelings for him or something idk)

Found out recently he’s depressed but I make him feel happy, this breaks my heart I really hope this isn’ true. I’m trying my best to not lead him, I don’t hang out with him on his own, I’ve stopped messaging him which made me sad at first but then it made me a lot more social, but he makes me feel guilty for this, now he do stuff that reminds me of my ex (toxic relationship). 

I want to simply and directly tell him I don’t like him. I just don’t want to hurt him or for him to become defensive and blame me for ‘leading him on’ which majority of our mutual friends and himself have done before.

493,"For background: I’m [25F] studying information systems and for my thesis i have to make an mobile app/website. There are 2 professors in my story. Mr. Larry and Mr. Mark. Mr. Larry [29M] is young professor, really smart, follows rules so he’s strict but not scary. He’s my thesis advisor. He is my thesis advisor. Mr. Mark [40+? M] pushes students to the very limit, very strict and scary. He is my panel chair (or jury chairman? Idk how you call it in other countries). We have 2 semesters to do our thesis. First semester we write documentation for our app/website and we are NOT allowed to change features then second semester we have to develop it. We cannot change anything in documentation &amp; a feature being too hard to code is not an excuse. 


I chose Mr. Larry as my advisor because everyone said he’s a good professor and he really is. Plus we’re both close in age since I’m an older college student due to difficult past. He and I grew friendly. I thought he’d have my back as an advisor. When I was writing documentation for the app I made sure to include features that I knew how to code but he kept sayin I needed more to pass. Or that i HAVE TO make a mobile app AND a website because its required. I complied with everything. 

I passed my documentation but then now I find out that my app is TWICE AS BIG as everyone else’s. Mr.Larry was a panelist for them and he PASSED them, some only doing websites with no mobile app. He even told others to REMOVE features because theirs was too big. Why did he make me ADD more to mine to make it twice as big? I don’t even have much experience with mobile apps (i originally just wanted a web responsive website) but he really told me it was required. :( 

Im so mad and upset. Im a really sickly person too so I cant stress myself out but IM REALLY STRESSING OUT. Im not prepared and to change would need Mr.Marks approval but Mr. Mark is known to RARELY grant those. 

Mr. Larry and I grew friendly. He knows Im sickly, he knows about my difficult past (getting sick a lot due to stress. Mental health issues), he knows I just want to graduate and get a job already at my age. I panicked and cried today. I’m starting to feel extremely sick and Im worried about ending up in a hospital again &amp; further delaying graduating. I have debt from previous hospitalizations. He knows all this :( Some classmates have said he’s kind of a creep to girls but I didn’t want to believe that. He does chat in our group chat (along with other advisees) about how hes single, nice guy etc... its a little odd but he jokes around with students like that, he still keeps respectable distance.

TL;DR: My boyfriend \[21, M\] and I \[20,F\] have been dating for over a year. I love him so much and I honestly can't imagine life without him... but his parents are becoming more and more of an issue everyday. They're completely against him dating outside his tribe and if they find any solid evidence we're dating, his relationship with his parents could be severed completely, he could get kicked out, and god only knows what else. It's been a year of panic and secrets and I can feel my patience beginning to slip...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a second generation immigrant, mixed race - half black and half white. My dad was born and raised on the U.S. east coast, and my mom immigrated to America from Sweden in her 20's. His parents immigrated to America from Myanmar, and a specific tribe in that region as well. He's 'technically' a first generation immigrant (he was born there too, but brought to the US at a very young age).

&amp;#x200B;

My own parents, having been an interracial relationship themselves, are incredibly accepting of everyone I've brought into my life race wise. Even past that, they're just generally very positive, empathetic, and welcoming people. I'm very lucky and grateful to have been brought up in the environment I was. His parents don't have the same mindset... their children are relatively forbidden from dating anyone who isn't from their specific tribe, within their specific culture, and of their specific race. I'm a hugggee no-go for him in his parent's eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this, our relationship has been kept hidden from his family. I don't park my car by his house. When his mom comes home I have to hide in the closet. Or escape through a bedroom window. Or sneak out the back and climb the fence. I've been so close to being caught countless times. He can't even leave his house for long periods of time without getting spammed with aggressive calls and texts from his mom. On his 20th birthday I set up an event with all our friends to celebrate and he TOLD her he would be gone for the night, she gave the go ahead then harassed their neighborhood friend the following morning with questions and threatened to call the police. I have done everything I can to get in her good graces. I help him clean their house, I've helped them at work, I full on decorated their house for Christmas. I've bought her little gifts just for the hell of it. But even after all that, she told his sister that she hoped we weren't actually dating because that would be inexcusable. He's thought about moving out, but is currently paying the entirety of his college tuition on his own and trying to work of a BA. It would be incredibly inconvenient for him to move out right now.

507,"Ok so this may be a long post so I’m sorry in advance. I’m a junior in college and I’m majoring in computer science. Towards the end of winter quarter my friend, let’s call her Kate, invited me to work on some programming challenges for class. I agreed and we decided to meet up at the lab. 

We worked on some programming assignments until I started getting a headache. I told her about my discomfort and she suggested that i smoke some weed. I agreed and invited her to join me and she accepted my invitation. So we go to a park near our campus and start smoking a bit. Then we start talking about random stuff until we get to her ex. 

Now Kate’s ex, in my opinion, was a real piece of work. He had cheated on her several times which resulted in him having a kid and then he ended up killing himself. Now of course Kate was upset that he killed himself cause I assume she still kind of had feelings for him. She was saying stuff like, “idk why I was even tripping for him” and stuff like that, although I could still kind of sense that she had feelings for him. So after all that, we head back to my dorm and start talking more. I had a few drinks that we both shared as we talked and we were both slightly tipsy. This is where things start to pick up. 

So I’m a huge fan of the Dragon Ball franchise as it helped me a lot when I lost some people who were close to me and really helped me (and is still helping me) with my depression. Let’s just keep this in mind for now. 

So as we were talking, she started bringing up school and such. She was telling me that she was failing two of her classes and she was gonna be here for more than 4 years. I told her that I wasn’t doing so hot in school either, but told her that there’s no shame in taking more than 4 years and that as long as she graduates she’ll be fine and that she shouldn’t worry about how long it will take. I then grabbed her hand with both of mine and looked her in the eye and told her, “it’s gonna be ok” and I had her repeat it to me. In my mind I was honestly just trying to be a good friend. Then she started holding my hand and hugging my arm. I didn’t really think anything of this because I just thought she was hugging me to say thanks or something. Now this is where I start being a huge dork. 

So I was telling her how dragon ball helped me with a lot of things and told her that I wanted to show her a clip that always helps me when I’m struggling. I showed her [this clip](https://youtu.be/5prSzpaFHzc) and we both watched it. In the clip, they are recounting goku’s life and gohan talks about how he will always remember goku walking forward towards Freeza. That scene really resonated with me and I thought if I showed it to Kate, she’d feel inspired too. 

After we watched that clip I told her that, “I want to be just like goku. I want people to know everything is going to be ok and feel comfort when I’m around and that I honestly want to make people happy.” Kate looked at me and said, “You’d be so good for me” which took me off guard for a bit. Then she looked at me and said, “You might think this is the alcohol talking, but I really want to kiss you.” 

I was honestly taken aback because I didn’t expect anything like this at all. Well after a few seconds a kissed her hand and looked at her, basically saying that I’m ok with it. We then start making out and things start to escalate. Before anything happens though, she said, “we both have needs and this will help me get over my ex. Don’t catch feelings either. Just act like nothing happened.” I was ok with this, because it wasn’t my first rodeo. I’ve had a couple one night stands before so this wasn’t anything new to me. The only difference was that she was my friend and I cared for her as a friend prior to all this. So we ended up having sex and once we both were satisfied, we both sat there not talking for a while. 

Finally after what felt like centuries, I broke the silence and said, “Well that happened” and then we started talking. She wanted to make sure that I didn’t have any feelings which I assured her I was fine. After 30 or so minutes, she told me she had to get back to her dorm. So we cleaned up and I walked her to her dorm. Before she went in her dorm she turned to me and said, “You’re not gonna be weird, right?” And I told her again, that I was fine. 

The next day comes and I went to the class we had together. I acted like I normally do and greeted her. She seemed a little off though and it had me a little worried. She seemed a little distant and I was a little hurt by that. Then the day of the final comes. Me and my other classmates are studying in a room and I saw her sitting outside studying by herself. I go out and ask her if she wants to join us to which she declined and said she was ok. I took this opportunity to ask her if everything was ok, obviously referring to what happened between us, to which she responded with, “Oh no, I just prefer to studying alone.” From my perspective, she didn’t want to talk about what happened so I left it at that and told her that she’s free to join us if she wants, and she eventually did. 

We ended up taking the final and I finished early so I left before she did. Now a little bit about me, I have separation anxiety due to events in the past. So I was having some anxiety that I was gonna lose her as a friend. I went to a friend from another class to get her advice and she just said, just give her some space. So I did. We were on winter break so it was fairly easy to give some space. 

Once break was over and we were done with our first week, I texted her on Snapchat (I didn’t have any classes with her at the time) and asked her how her break was and how her first week was. She didn’t respond, but I know she saw my text. This ended up giving me more anxiety. Well for the whole quarter, I didn’t see her and slowly I was recovering from my anxiety. 

Now we are in present day. I actually have a class with her now. And now all the anxiety is coming back. Idk what to do. How should I act? Should I bring up what happened? Should I even interact with her? I haven’t gone to the class because I didn’t sign up for it until yesterday, not knowing she was in it. My class is on Monday and as the day gets closer, the more my anxiety rises up. Please help me reddit. I have no idea what to do. 

TL;DR
I slept with my friend and after her telling me not to be weird, she starts acting weird. I haven’t talked to her for a quarter and now I have a class with her coming up on Monday. What do I do?

This week I have been in the new job and honestly, I can’t stand the environment... it’s not bad job, the position is pretty good (marketing assistant), but it’s really old school company and I don’t feel good there, there are two employees who are about the same age as me (22) and the others( around 40 employees) are about 40-60 yo and everything is like 10 years behind... hell we are using Microsoft offices from 2013 and stuff like that. I just have a feeling like they are stucked at a time and I don’t know if I can’t stand it... well the second job is exactly opposite... it’s an IT company and they have like chilled atmosphere there, they don’t even care about dress code, but from position view it would be downgrade for me. I rly don’t have a clue what I’m gonna do and as this is life changing decision, I would like to know more opinions on my situations...

512,"so a while ago i was with a guy who had weed in his car. i have never done drugs a single time in my life and he whips out weed while i’m there. he starts to grind it and i’m like idk about this. immediately a cop knocks on the window, puts the guy in cuffs. the cop lets me and my other friend go because we weren’t doing anything wrong. eventually, the cop lets the guy go too and does do anything at all about it, not even a citation. just wanted to reach him a lesson i guess. 

my question is, if school finds out, could i get in trouble?",03Apr2019,1
513,"Over the past couple of months, through my own neglect and cowardice, I ruined a friendship.

Because of some emotional stuff this semester, I've been pretty withdrawn and tired- not wanting to hang out or talk to people or go and do things (I know this is bad, and I'm working on addressing it). Basically, without getting too much into it, I didn't know my friend was feeling isolated and targeted in our friend group (I knew there was tension but not the full extent) and wasn't talking or hanging out with her much the past couple of months. 

Then, because of my obliviousness and lack of communication, I did something that hurt her and betrayed my own values, though I didn't realize it until after I'd done it. I wasn't as conscientious as I should have been. And after I realized I had hurt her, I didn't reach out to her for several days. It was cowardly, but I thought she wouldn't want to talk to me immediately after. I realize now if I had reached out and apologized sooner, things might have been better and I could have fixed things. I did end up apologizing but she is still hurt. 

She is not speaking to me anymore, and I respect her right to do so. I know an apology doesn't make everything better and she doesn't have to forgive me or be friends with me again. I'm not the victim here- I messed things up, and I'm trying to think about my behavior and how I can be better in the future so I don't hurt people again. But I also have this panic in the pit of my stomach because I've hurt someone. 

Basically, I want to ask for advice on how to move on emotionally, learn from my mistakes, and become more conscientious. Personal advice and book/article recommendations are all welcome. Sorry this is so long, and thank you!

516,"Problem: My mentally handicapped brother (24M) lives with me across the country from his GF(24/25?F) who is also mentally handicapped. I believe she is mentally unstable and is hampering my little brother's development. I don't know whether I should intervene and try to gently end it or let it ride.

BACKSTORY: I take care of my mentally handicapped little brother. He is deficient in being able to understand cause and effect, social cues, stand up for himself, etc. I took him out of our home of living with our parents and now he lives with my wife and I across the country. I am currently building his self confidence and I have been slowly ramping up his responsibilities to that one day he can live on his own with minimum supervision. For example, I sit him down every month and I break out an excel sheet showing the cost of rent/utilities/etc. and what my wife and I put towards it (to start I put 2/3 of it and my wife and him split the remaining 1/3, but now we all equally play 1/3)

He moved out here in December of 2017. Shortly before he moved here, he met a girl at his work who took to him affectionately very quickly. He moved out here and they started a long-distance relationship with him only visiting about 1-2 times a year. My brother hasn't had a real girlfriend before so he thinks this is the end-all-be-all. 

I don't think his heart is necessarily in it though because he's told me that if he gets another girlfriend, he would probably go out with the new girl. But that said, it's not as if he doesn't love his current girlfriend, he definitely cares for her. I think he's just with her though just for the ""convenience"" and the ""idea"" of having a girlfriend.

Now, with all of that said, I've let this relationship ride with full support from me and my wife, but lately we've been getting a little worn out. The ultimate plan was to get my brother the ability to live on his own with his girlfriend.

Between when my brother left home in Dec 2017 til now, his gf has either quit or been fired from 5-6 jobs. The first three, she claimed that the staff or customers were mean to her. Granted, I consoled her and taught her how to stand up for herself etc. The next job, she was fired because ""supposedly, she didn't have the qualifcations to work at the register"". Then the next job she claimed people were being mean to her so she quit. In my mind, statistically, I don't think that it's really as bad she says it is, and I don't know if what she says to us is entirely factual.

Other factors that have driven me to question their relationship are that she has, on multiple occasions, threatened to harm herself out of depression. The first time I was alerted to it, I friended her mother on facebook and told her of the situation. Her mother was taken by surprise and said that her daughter is always happy at home. A few months passed and I heard rumblings that she posted something on social media about beating her head in with a hammer but later removed the post.. I told my brother next time he sees her post something on social media about it, that he is to screenshot it and send it to me immediately. The following day, he sent me two pictures of posts she made detailing how she will harm herself and the world will be better off without her. I immediately took to facebook to message her mother about and update, and to my surprise I could not message her mom anymore. I could not find any other family members of hers on facebook so i was led to believe I was blocked from messaging her mom. So I took it upon myself and called the local PD to do a welfare check on her. They showed up to her house and took her to the hospital, she was released later that day. Since then, she has not made any suicidal idealogies but she has been obsessive about my little brother ""saving her life"". I believe she believes it was him who intervened, which is fine with me. He is constantly worried about her mental health and has told me that it makes him sad and sometimes thinks he shouldnt be talking to her when she is in these negative states of mind.

She also is quite obsessive. She shares to social media daily about the one time she came out here to visit him. She texts him constantly with a battery of kiss and heart emojis, thanking him relentlessly for being in her life, etc. It is getting to the point where it is scaring my wife and I because of how obsessive it is. His girlfriend does not hold conversations very well either, if you ask her a direct question (about her health, or how people treat her at work), she darts around the question and says ""How great my(ForAllOccasions) family is."" She never actually has any substance in discussion and talks around in circles constantly. It is exhausting to message her because I can only say the same thing so many times. This feeling is not only echoed by myself and my wife, but also my little brother and the rest of my family. To an extent, my little brother has started replicating the social qualities that she has in their text messages. To an extent, things are cute but I don't want him getting the impression that this is the normal way to act.. all.. the.. time, especially if he gets another girlfriend.

Periodically, she has been sending gifts to the house for him, maybe 2-3 gifts a week, some of these gifts surprise me at the amount it probably costs her. In the beginning, I thought it was just her way of showing affection, but now I brings to my point before that it's an obsession. She'll constantly send candy/chocolates/shirts/stuff from etsy. My brother doesn't even eat the candy/chocolates she sends because it comes at a rate faster than he can eat it. We have tried to talk to her about it but she darts around the point.

Most importantly, her gifts recently have had her name on them, but with our last name, as if they are married. And in their texts between eachother, she signs the same, her first name and our last name.

So, do I intervene? How do I intervene? I am afraid if I end it that she will spiral out of control and do something irrational to herself, which obviously is more harm than good. I am looking out for the best interest of my brother because I want him to live as best of a life as he can.

tldr; My mentally handicapped brother lives across the country from his girlfriend since he moved. I believe she is a detrament to his personal growth but at the same time, she has had suicidal ideologies so I need to step with care and great tact when dealing with the situation.",03Apr2019,1
518,"I recently got into a relationship with a girl, and as I was starting to tell my dad about her, he just started freaking out about how wrong it would be to date someone like that (she is in school and I am 1st year).

So I told him I broke it off with her, but in reality I have been seeing her for a month now. I've met her parents and they love me, but I don't want to introduce her to my dad.

519,"HOL' UP REDDIT BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG ONE

&amp;#x200B;

First post on reddit, ever, and i feel it belongs here because i really need help =(

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so a bit of backstory here: in Nov. 2017, i started in my first job, thanks to a person that was an inspiration to me during college, that offered me the thing and i accepted it, (let's call him Carl), after all, i needed the money and i was DESPERATE for new things in my life.

So i did, and at that job, with Carl being one of my 3 bosses, alongside two of his friends, (let's call em Mike and Chad), changed my life.

There, at my first day, i met her, (let's call her ***Amy***)**,** Chad's wife.

From day 1, we began knowing each other, and developed quite an amicable relationship, but becoming very close, very fast. Then, on the second week at the job, a situation happened where i had a bit of a fall out with 2 of my colleagues, and they were a bit hard on me. Carl and Amy, being the two ""bosses"" i was most close to at the point, took that ""attack"" on me very personally, and actually called out my colleagues. At that point, (according to Amy), that was the moment that she started feeling something else for me.

Our relationship at the workplace was a bit weird. We were always side by side, sometimes hugged, sometimes holding hands with each other, but at every point, having some form of physical contact. At first, i didn't realized it was weird, because i wasn't thinking that such contact was having any undertone whatsoever, but then i realized others were weirded out about it.

It took me a while to realize that Amy might have feelings for me, i spent at least 3 to 4 months convincing myself that it wasn't the case, even when telling my friends about it, (friends from school), and they were saying 'DUDE SHE HAS THE HOTS FOR YOU', i still wasn't sure.

Fast forwarding a bit, to July 2018. At that point, i was still not sure if she really had feelings for me or not, but somethings started to happen that i couldn't ignore anymore. There is a balcony there, that if a person is on the end of it, for someone to pass, you have to squeeze yourself between the balcony and the person at the end of it. Naturally, for the men in there, we would joke around and grab each other's ass or tap it, AS a joke, but with women, we of course were totally respectful, so there were no problems, whatsoever. Well, Amy, when she decided to pass between me and the said balcony, instead of squeezing herself, she would LITERALLY rub her ass in my crotch area, and i, numbed by it, went along with it for a while. From there on, there was a lot of touch on the thighs, some ass grabing or slaping, and some more sexually insinuating scenarios (of course, very carefully so nobody could see or even suspect anything).

At that point, i couldn't pretend it wasn't real anymore, and understood what was going on. Then, came August, and with it, it began our relationship. One day, she invited all of us to her place, for a night of drinking and play, however, i lied to everybody saying i was going to the gym first, and we all agreed to arrive together, around 8:30 pm, but in reality, i left with Amy, and went to her place with her, around 5:30 pm.

That day, we were together for a couple of hours but nothing really happened, however, minutes before my co-workers arrive, she kissed me, and i was stunned. I knew it could happen, but i went into shock state because i couldn't believe it was actually really happening. That kinda screwed up my night, and i stayed a bit far from the ""party"" everyone wanted to happen. I left her place, and through the next days, i was a bit shaky around her. It all came back to normality one week from that day, when she called me up to go to her place afterwards, because my boss Chad was going for a business travel, and she would stay alone for the night. I was scared, but was aware that it could happen that we would have sex, but was still cautious about it. However, from the moment i entered her car, we started talking about how we thought of each other, the fact that we dreamed about each other, masturbated thinking about each other, and things like that.

When we arrived at her place, something happened. A friend of her husband, my boss, spotted us, and stopped to talk right when we were entering her building. She lied to him, and said that the folks from work were 'coming over', but in fact, i was the only one going. I was pretty nervous, and thought that she had to create an alibi, that we discussed later.

We got up to her apartment, lied at the couch, watched some tv, and then boom, we started kissing, fondling, then when i realize, we're both doing it, and believe me, it was amazing. Although the age difference, she has an amazing body for a 45 year old woman, she never had kids, and had started losing weight up that point (although she didn't really needed it, but it was mostly for her self-steem). We did it, and right afterwards, we ordered some food, but me, still worried at my friend's boss, told her to actually call some of my colleagues, even if it was just the girls, because i was scared that we might get caught. And so she did, and before they arrived, i left, taking a detour so i didn't encountered them in any way.

My head was full, i couldn't think straight, and i went to talk to one of my best friends, who lives right next block from me.

I told him, and he, not surprised, answered ""well, you done fucked up, huh?"". we talked for an hour or two, then i went back home, thinking of what yould be on the next day.

Well, things then started to take off from there. I had one break day on the week, and at that day, every single week, we would meet up to have sex at my place. She was developing more and more her feelings for me, everytime telling me that she was only well and fine when she's with me, that she wanted to spend more time with me, etc.

&gt;ONE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTICE HERE: Her marriage to Chad, that lasts so far about 14 years, isn't on it's golden days. They have several fights, even at the workplace, have petty arguments over stupid shit, and all of that same old relationship that has been worned out. She was going through a rough phase emotionally, being a former smoker, was oftenly smoking again, trying to deal with her anxiety, etc. She was emotionally distressed, and i became her safe spot.

She, from the very start of our romantic relationship, had a bit of a bigger power between us. She would always buy me things, whether i needed or not, as a way to please me, and i, unfortunately, let it happen. It kinda became a ""sugar mommy"" situation, where i became her emotional support, and she became my provider, and that kinda started to bug me a bit. Time went on, and around the last week of October and the first week of November, 2018, we broke up.

The break happened like this: We were at my place, having sex, and all of a sudden, she said something in the likes of ""Do you think any other girl would be doing this for you?"". At that point, i stopped what we were doing, and started questioning why would she say something like that, all of a sudden. We started a big argument, and i said a couple of things that i didn't wanted to at the time, but was thinking about it, in the likes of ""We should break up, because this is not NORMAL for a 21 year old to be going through"". At that point, she started crying, i felt bad, and we started hugging for an entire hour. We ended up having sex AGAIN, but i was still confused, and didn't really wanted it to happen, although letting it go forward. Still, we broke up, and we became a bit apart for the next weeks to come.

One day, around the end of November, she went to the beach and invited me, and i, instead of refusing, accepted it. We went back to her place, and upon leaving, we started kissing, and ended up back together.

At that point, i was a bit disappointed with myself. Personally, i wasn't very happy with that relationship, and then, i wanted out from it, because i felt like we were using each other. I felt like using her because she could provide for me whereas i didn't have to worry about money and other superficial things, and she in her way was putting on my sole back the weight of helping her mental and emotional state.

Time went on, and in Dec 20, she travelled to San Diego, for New Year's Eve, and woud only come back on Jan 10 of 2019. When she came back, i felt like we were a bit disconnected from each other, and some things started to pop off, and we had a fall out. On Jan. 20, one of my biggest girl-friends was going to throw her birthday party, and i had completely forgotten (what a friend, i know). On the evening of jan. 19, another friend of mine reminded me of that, and i went to Amy to let her know that i wouldn't be able to stay with her on the 20th. She literally looked at me and said ""You know who you want to spend your time with, do what you want"". I froze. My single reaction to that was to leave, without even telling her goodbye, even though i told her to hit me up next day so i would try to meet her later. She didn't call, didn't text, not on sunday (jan 20th), and not even in the days following. On monday, i was a bit stressed out about it, and a friend of mine told me to go check the psychiatrist he was going to.

I was able to check with my psych on tuesday, let's call her Nat, and man, i bursted out. She said the first session was more to understand what was afflicting me, but goddamn, not even i think she was prepared to hear some of the things i said about my relationship with Amy. Week after week, i was feeling more and more better with myself, for being able to work and reflect on my relationship with Amy, and things were going well.

On February, i started hooking up with a friend of mine, (let's call her Sue), not as a way to forget or to replace Amy, the feelings that we had for each other were there, i was just not sure if she actually liked me, and because i was with Amy, i was ""safe"", so i didn't even cared about other women.

My relationship with Amy started to become more and more cold, we would stare each other as if we wanted to speak something to one another, but would remain silent, anytime we were alone in the room, i always left it or would do something else, just because i didn't wanted to demonstrate any mixed feelings.

I wasn't sure how i was feeling. I liked Amy, and felt bad that our relationship had ended on such a silly reason, but in a way, i felt like i had freed myself from something that was harming me, however...

A friend of mine started working there, (let's call him John), (around the end of January), doing some freelance gigs, and he knew about me and Amy. I started having mix feelings about him being there, because i knew the kind of person he was. He used to cheat on his girlfriend, and even went to actually having sex with another of my friend's girlfriend for a while, just because he could. He's not a bad person, however, he did that shit, and i felt threatened for him, because i was afraid of losing Amy to him, even though we weren't together anymore. He even went to tell me that if it was with him, he wouldn't let her go at all.

I started getting jealous all of a sudden, and then i realized, i still liked her. My psychiatrist started questioning me, with reason, if i actually felt something still for Amy, or if what i was feeling was just the sensation of loss and replacement. My friend John started going more and more, and all of a sudden, he started already hanging out with the guys, while i would leave, and with Amy as well. What really bugged me is that 3 weeks ago, i was right next to Amy, she opened her messages on her iphone and BOOM, i saw his icon and his name there, with a hearted eye emoji, sent to her. That day, i got paranoid. I started thinking about all the worst case scenarios possible, and then, i actually got her phone, and went to see the texts (Yes, i knew her password, she told me when we were together bc she didn't wanted to hide anything from me, even though i never thought it was necessary).

I unlocked her phone, and was kinda underwhelmed. She texted 'hi' to him, and he replied 'hi' followed by the emoji. On a sense, i was relieved, but in a way, still very jealous. (side note: those texts happened on February 15 if i recall, and until today, that's the only texts they ever exchanged).

While all of that was going on, i was still going out with Sue. I felt something for her for a while, but never managed to do anything because i wasn't sure if she liked me too, although she sometimes showed, i was in denial. (I don't know why, but i manage to not believe people like me, romantically, until something big happens). We started seeing each other practically every day by the end of February, and our feelings were growing, mutually. I genuinely started caring for her, not even being able to think about Amy for instance, at least when i was with her.

Amy was not aware that i started seeing someone, but i was dumb enough to tell a couple of my co-workers. I didn't told 'em knowing they might tell her, but a simple joke turned into a nightmare. Someone started yelling asking me ""DUDE ARE YOU ACTUALLY DATING?"" and in that moment, she entered the room.

Her face was normal, when i looked at her, but man oh man, when she heard that, she changed. She ignored me the entire day, pretended i wasn't there, and i was scared. I wasn't scared that she might tell someone from the workplace about us, or even tell her husband, but was kinda scared because i didn't know what she could do.

Well, time started passing by, and i realized that everytime someone brought up the subject of me dating, she changed her ways with me, specifically. I don't blame her, at all. I wouldn't like knowing that she was seeing someone, specially if it was my friend John, so i accepted her hostility towards me at that point. However, in the past 2 weeks, we actually started treating each other nicely again. We started mantaining a normal conversation for longer, she went back to ask me how i was, how i felt, if i was ok, showing signs of affection that we didn't had for 2 months now.

I started talking to Nat about those feelings, and mostly about the fact that i was afraid of a relapse. I always thought a relapse could happen, but never wanted it to happen, specially because i was happy about being with Sue and wanted to continue with her, but still being conflicted about the feelings i had for Amy.

Welp. Things started to took a turn this last friday, March 29.

I went out with some of my friends, that didn't knew about my affair with Amy, and told them about it. We spent 4 hours talking about it, and i kinda realized a couple of things about that relationship that i didn't wanted to. Sure thing, i did realized with Nat that my relationship with Amy was unsustainable, and unhealthy. The fact that she used me for emotional support, but wasn't really interested about how i felt, the emotional blackmail that she would do to me, saying that all she needed was me to tell her that she would ACTUALLY DIVORCE to stay with me, etc. However, talking to my friends about it, they shed some new light upon those things, and i kinda took a punch in the face with the fact that i was sustaining something that was making me feel so bad.

Then came Saturday, March 30. I told Amy that i had talked to these two friends about us, (she knows them, one of them actually works there as a freelance as well), and she wanted details, like why i had told them, what they said, etc.

We started talking, i told her about the fact that i was confused, still had feelings for her, felt jealous of her, (and stupid enough mentioned my friend John), but still, i was happy with Sue, and wouldn't trade her for nothing right now. She went to tell me that she still also had feelings for me, she didn't wanted things to have ended the way they did, and that she was ""happy"" that i was jealous of her, because that meant i liked her. We talked for a bit and reached the consensus to try to be friends again, so things could come back to normalcy. Later, she and folks from work were going to hang out, and she invited me too. I already had something planned with my friends from friday, and told her that i would try to meet with them later, if possible. I was more inclined to go not because of her, but because John was going, and i don't know why, but at the moment i felt vulnerable by the fact she know KNEW i was jealous of her with him.

I went out with my friends, and afterwards in my car, we started talking that we shouldn't meet them up. I was reluctant. I wanted to go to ""mark my presence"" there, but at the same time, i didn't wanted to. We stayed an entire hour deciding where to go next, and i forcefully said ""Let's meet them up, fuck it"".

While driving to the place, i texted John, asking if they were still there. He answered that he didn't actually went, instead he went home and got tired to go out, and asked me if i wanted to meet up. I brushed off his reply and actually got happy with it, at least i didn't had to worry about him hitting on her there. We arrived and well, i kinda got bumped about actually meeting them up. I didn't wanted to show her that i went because she asked me to go, but it's not like i could tell her i went because of my jealousy. We stayed there for an hour or two, and we decided to head home.

Amy came to me and asked me if i could drive her home. I was afraid this would happen. I could have said no, but for some reason, i wasn't being able to pronounce the words. I tried to brush off, but i said 'Ok'. I tried to drop her off first, because i had one of my friends in the car, (the ones from friday), but i ended up screwing the way back and my friend asked me to drop her off first, which i did.

After she got out, Amy asked me if i really wanted to drive her home, to which i replied ""Sure, why not?"", and she responded ""Then why were you trying to avoid dropping off C (my friend) first?"".

I didn't wanted to respond, and we went both silent all the way to her place.

We arrived, and then shit hit the fan. She started asking me a lot of things, to which i honestly couldn't reply. I was confused, i didn't understood well what i was feeling, and i felt vulnerable, because now she knows all of that, and i didn't wanted to continue the conversation at that point. Then, she started to kiss me, but in the 'putting her tongue deep down my throat' kind of kissing.

I felt like shit. I was just standing there, sitting on my seat while she was trying to make me to do something. She started going from hugging to kissing, and started questioning me whether i wasn't going to respond. Again, i told her i was confused, and i needed some time to think. Then she started confronting me about Sue. Started asking if it was easier for me to be with her, given the fact we're the same age, she's single, totally different from her. I got a bit mad at that point, and asked her to get out of the car and go home, because that wasn't the time nor the place to have that discussion.

Upon leaving, she told me that if i wanted, i could hit her up the next day, or monday, but if i didn't, she would understand that i didn't wanted anything with her anymore. I got home, parked the car, started texting my friends saying that 'i done fucked up', and that i was feeling awful.

I woke up on sunday completely drained. I was very shook by what happened, and started going down towards the ground with my depression.

&gt;side note: Well, i fight depression on and off for a while. I don't take medication, because it has never caused me or affected me as bad as it is now, but yeah.

Sunday passed by and i didn't called Amy, however, i went to see Sue at night. We met, and she looked at my face and saw i was a bit off. She asked what happenend but i didn't felt like telling her, after all, i was afraid of how she might react knowing that i was having an affair. We stayed for a while on my car, i laid on her lap, and we started talking. I ended up telling her, and for my surprise, she reacted in a way i couldn't have forseen. She understood my situation, said she couldn't imagine how awful it was being for me, and all she asked from me is that i 'got things right'. We stayed together for a bit more, and i went back home. At that point, i knew i had to call Amy on Monday, April's Fools, to talk, and was ok with that happening. (side note: i did not tell Sue about what happened saturday night, because i wasn't sure how she would take that information, alongside the shock of knowing the entirety of it)

Monday came, and i texted her. I told her i wanted to meet up to talk, however, she immediately responded asking i she could pass by here in my house. Again, i couldn't respond 'NO', so i just went with 'i guess'. She arrived, we went to my room, she sat in one end of my bed, i on the other, and started talking.

Again, i was telling her that i liked Sue, nothing would make me change my mind, but i wanted to resolve my feelings for her, still not knowing how to do it. She again started asking me if the problem was the fact that she was married, that could no longer be a problem;

&gt;For a while, i started to notice that she would use the argument that if her marriage was getting in our way, she could divorce to be with me, and i NEVER wanted that. I even went to tell her that, if for some reason, she would divorce, because of me, i wouldn't take that, and we should not be together, because i sincerely didn't wanted to be the cause of a break up. Recently she started going to the shrink as well, and told me that she has started working on her problems, and has realized her marriage isn't ok. Now she says that if they split, OF COURSE it wouldn't be because of me, but because she wasn't able to continue with that relationship anymore.

We started discussing things, and then she asked if we could just lay in the bed, one next to the other. Stupid enough, i said ok, and from then on, i fucked up. We started kissing, fondling, all of that shit, all over again, and we of course, had sex. We did it, and when it ended, i was kinda disgusted with myself. She even asked me if i regretted of what happened.

I wasn't sure.

I was dissapointed with myself for allowing that to happen, and that fear of the relapse was real, and now i understood it. Relapses are not a joke, let me tell you. I was already not feeling well with myself, and that was the icing on the cake.

We stayed in my bed for a little while, but i, feeling disgusted with myself, created a situation for her to leave. Before leaving, we started talking a bit more, and she just started talking things that started messing with my mind. She was often saying how we should be together, i shouldn't be with Sue, but then escalated it to the point where she started saying that if we didn't got back together, ok, she would suffer, and might take her some time, but eventually she would ""forget me"". She even said that it would be hard, but of course it wouldn't be with Chad that she would forget me.

At that point, i started to really point out that i had an appointment and i had to leave, so we did.

She went to meet with C, my friend that was aware of our affair, because C is also going through some stuff, and they went to talk.

I spent the entire monday thinking whether or not i should tell my friends about what happened, but i didn't.

Then came yesterday.

Amy texted me good morning, just the way she did when we were together. At that moment, i started panicking a bit. It was almost a deja vu. I was afraid of having to live that thing over and over again, but was glad that later i had my appointment with Nat, and afterwards was going to see Sue. I tried to maintain appearances at work, even though Amy wasn't there, but everyone kinda realized i was a bit down, and were asking what was going on, but i, didn't answered.

I finally went to see Nat and told her everything that had happened since our last session. She was a bit in aue. But mostly, she was a bit bugged by the fact that i had to go through that to realize the abusive relation i was having. We talked, and i felt a bit relieved, however, still a bit afraid of how to definitively end things with Amy,

Then i went to call Sue.

I asked her at what time i could drop by her place to pick her up, and she was brushing me off. I was afraid to ask, but i did, and of course, she was confused about my situation as well. She suggested for us to take a break, until i get my shit together (me saying this), because she doesn't want to be in a situation where she feels used, and i get that. IN ANY MOMENT i would want that, and i also started thinking about that, and that was hurting me as well. I didn't wanted to be with her just for her to become a replacement for Amy, after all, i was developing real feelings for her, however, i started thinking if that wouldn't be the case, accidentaly. So we talked for a bit more, decided to stay apart for now, and that kinda struck me.

Angry as i was, i tweeted about it, even though Amy sees everything i post. I tweeted about the fact that i was losing a good thing in my life because of my stupidity, and boy oh boy, she got mad. She texted me, saying that she was really enjoying the show i was putting up. My sole responde was ""I sincerely don't have the strength to do this right now"".

I was feeling like shit, and still am. I called up my friends, C and P (the ones from friday), we met up, and started talking.

C told me that when she went out with Amy on monday, they talked, a lot, and she even tried to convince Amy to break up with me, but failed to do so. She was also a bit surprised that i waited a day to tell them about monday, even though she knew already, because she could only imagine the things were going through my mind. We stayed talking for a couple of hours, and i then, AGAIN, got hit in the face by the truth, and realized that i have to put an end to my relationship with Amy.

I know what many of you might say, cause i've probably heard it from my friends, but still, i would like your advice, fellow redditors. I'm still confused. I want to end things with her, i want to go back no normalcy, but i feel trapped. I feel like i have no real strength to do so, and i'm afraid that if i try, she will seduce me again, and continue to mess with my emotions and feelings. HELP ME

TL;DR: I was having an affair with my bosses's wife, it lasted a couple of months, i started feeling weird about it, we distanced from each other, i started going to the shrink to get my shit together, was starting to develop something with someone and was liking it, but my jealousy and ways kinda screwed it up.",03Apr2019,19
520,"I applied for a teaching job at a local community college a few weeks ago and got a call yesterday to see if I was still interested. I said I think it would be a really cool job and I could definitely make it work with the hours they wanted. He couldn’t talk long because he had a tour to give but we briefly discussed what I’m doing now (volunteering at a wildlife sanctuary bc this area I’m in has few jobs available). He also told me the previous instructor is on maternity leave but the replacement couldn’t teach after all so he is “in a bind.” He told me he’d call me back yesterday but didn’t, and I sent an email a few hours ago with no response.

521,"So recently my sister's cat had kittens (she lives on a farm so keep in mind these are farm cats) and I'm thinking about adopting one of them. I am moving away from home to a new city here in a month or so and like the idea of having a pet as a companion however-
1.) I have never owned a cat before. My parents have 2 small dogs that I'm used to help care for but have never had a cat of my own 
2.) I'm going to be working and going to school so it's very possible I'll be away from home 9+ hours a day, I dont know how feasible it is to care for a cat if I'm home that little 
3.) I will be living with roomates so I'm not sure if the common spaces will be open for my cat to be in while I'm not there. I feel weird about the idea of just keeping a cat in a room for 9 hours a day 

With all of this, is it a good idea to take on this kind of responsibility and would it still be possible to make a good home for a cat in this situation? Thanks

I (f22) was driving to go pay my rent when an 18 wheeler was trying to get into my lane. I slowed down so I could let him over but the person behind me kept honking for me to go. They kept honking and hit my back bumper, on purpose I presume, so I speed up, because I though maybe I still had time to pass the 18 wheeler but I didn’t and I basically swerved into the bridge and hit my breaks and if I hadn’t hit my breaks in time, I would have fallen off the bridge and onto on coming traffic. The guy that was behind me passed me speeding, I wasn’t even able to get their plates, even though it was mostly my fault for trying to pass the trunk in the first place. I backed my car up to safety, put on my hazards and cried. I cried hard then I’d ever cried, my face was was red, my throat was in agonizing pain, my head was foggy. Everything that I was going through came out via my tears.

Basically I have been bottling my emotions since my mother abandoned me with my disabled father and two brothers a year ago. I’ve been trying to juggle them, school and my social life and it took a near death experience to realize that I’m a complete mess. I’m failing my anatomy class, I’ve gained 15 lbs back after losing 60 last year, so I’ve been self medicating with food. The guy I was interested in shows no interest back ( but fuck him, that’s not even an issue it’s just the feather that broke the camels back). And I literally just hate myself all around, I went to the school councilor a couple of days ago (because I have two part time jobs, I can’t afford insurance) , and they tell me, I don’t actually have problems I’m just over reacting. 

I don’t know what to do at this point? I see everyone else and they seem to have it figured out and I’m struggling to keep my head up. Seriously any advice helps, I’ll do anything, I just want to feel happiness again. ",03Apr2019,1

538,"First time poster here - I'm usually an observer of reddit rather than a participant but I really don't know what else to do at this juncture than to ask the internet for advice. This is probably a completely boring read for most so I apologise in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me give a brief background. I'm a final year law student at a Russell Group Uni (although not Oxbridge by any means). I've been on the path to becoming a barrister for as long as I can remember and not without struggle. I'm the first in my family to go to Uni and, while incredibly proud, they have been unable to financially support me in any way. It's a truly dire financial circumstance. Somehow I've managed to support myself to this point but I have had to sink a substantial amount of money into Bar-related things. The BCAT, for example, costs a sweet £150 - an Inn membership around £100 and so on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was always told that I would never be able to pursue this career without money - I'm starting to really understand that sentiment - but I had enough faith in my ability to take that advice on the chin. Now I'm facing a huge problem. I've accepted an offer to study the BPTC which costs around £16,000+ out of pocket. I'm taking it as a combined LLM course which means I can get a £10,000 (approx) government loan but this leaves me with the remainder of the course fees plus living costs to find and I've just been rejected from the final scholarship avenue that was available to me (having applied through both the Inn and Uni). I have a loan offer from a third-party company sitting at around £14,000 and have transferred to a part-time weekend-dominant course in order to get a job simultaneously but I can't wholeheartedly say that this is the right option for me. I can't get a full-time job any time soon because of my remaining uni commitments, I can't ask my parents for help and I can't seem to be able to find any other sources of income. Right now, best case scenario, I'm looking at taking the course over 2 years, paying back loans whilst studying and working full-time with no guarantee of a pupillage at the end of it all. I could always defer - go for another round of scholarship applications and sink more money into it while working and maybe even saving a little - but I'm terrified that I won't be able to secure another loan as substantial as the one offered to me this year.

&amp;#x200B;

I know some will question my abilities given these rejections and rightly so. I have never been the most intelligent in the core subjects and I can't abide most of the classes I had to take but my grades have gone through the roof in the specialist classes which I was permitted to select this year. My skillset has always been more practically and resourcefully focused and I excel in every scenario-based interview. Unfortunately, these are few, most being based on knowledge of the core subjects which for the most part I can barely recall. I suppose have always done better at knowing things when I *need* to know them. A lot of professional practitioners who I know have great faith in me but they aren't the ones holding the key to the safe. I'm sure a majority of candidates do not, in fact receive scholarships, but that pill is harder to swallow knowing that a fair few will have hefty parental bank balances to fall back on.

**TLDR at the bottom**

For context, my mom is best described as controlling, manipulative, and generally cunty. I wouldn't necessarily call her abusive as we are hispanic and everyone in our family/people we know physically disciplines their kids, so to me ""abuse"" is only for extreme cases such as when a parent comes home after a bad day of work and decides to greet their kids by bruising them. I am going to be 20 in a few months and she still doesn't like it when I go out with my bf of 5 1/2 years alone. At this point I am absolutely done with her toxic behavior and want to move out by next year. It'd be sooner if I had more money in my savings, but I don't.

However, since I recieved my permit a few years ago, I still do not have a driver's license. I was/am still somewhat horrified of driving, believing that it will be my cause of death when I die. Guess who didn't help with that? Anyway, I saved up a few hundred dollars and bought myself a few hours of driving class. Day 1 I literally cried at my instructor twice, Day 3 we were driving around 3-4 lane traffic, so I've definitely improved. I don't have my license yet, but I plan on getting it by the 1st week of May.

I really want a car by then, though. I am only dependent because I don't drive on my own, once I can do that I'll be free to fuck off and move in with my bf. I seriously have no clue as to what kind of car to get, though. I hear people say both ""oh get a new/2014+ car or else you'll have issues immediately"" and others that say ""I bought a 2001 car with 200k miles on it and it still works like new"". So, what do would be the best thing to do??

**TLDR; I want to move out but I can't without first buying a car. I have been given extremely confusing advice ranging from, ""you NEED a brand new car"" to ""ah get something worth $2k, doesn't matter if it's almost 300k miles on it as long as the owner(s) did regular oil changes""**",03Apr2019,1

541,"Hi everyone. So I'm a Moroccan student who pretty much messed up his high school final exam. I graduated but I had 45% which is really bad. I barely managed to get into one of the worst college right here (FSTT for those who are familiar with the Moroccan stuff). But I really don't feel at ease in this system because we basically have to choose a pathway that has a lot of courses. In the one I chose, we learn a bit of algorithms, algebra, calculus, electrostatics, mechanics etc... Now this is a great system if you don't know what you want to do in your life, but that's not my case; I want to study computer sciences. Therefore must of the subject we learn are pretty much useless for me. Why would I need to study thermodynamics or quantum mechanics if I know that I want to study computer sciences ? Why would I have to wait until the year I graduate to finally get to study what I really love, and at a very basic level ?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm basically fed up with this system and I soon realized that the American / British system (with very specific subject in each course) would work way better for me. So I started looking for tuition-free American universities and colleges (yeah because the tuition fees per year are often what my family makes in 10 years, so even with partial scholarships and on-campus jobs it would still not be possible) and I noticed that a lot of them have an acceptance rate below 10%, which means that I would never be accepted with my GPA being below 2.5.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I have two options:

&amp;#x200B;

1- Do I continue in my actual college until I have my degree in my shitty college, which would take me two years, and then apply for a Masters degree in an American college, with a higher chance of having nothing above a C+ because the college is /that/ shitty ?

2- Do I pass some SATs and retake my high school exam as an external candidate in order to have a &gt;4.0 GPA (which is pretty much guaranteed) and then apply for a bachelor degree ?

Since I'll be an external candidate then, I'll probably have to wait until I have my new GPA before I apply right ? And then I can only start one year after applying, so that brings the total to 2 years ?

&amp;#x200B;

What do you advise me to do ? Should I pick the first option ? The second ? Do you know if other countries with the Anglo-Saxon system offer easier opportunities to take ? Or are there tuition-free / fully-funding good colleges or universities to which I can transfer ?

545,"TLDR at the bottom! 

Hiyah! This post might be a mess, my head’s all over the place. 

I (21F) moved out of my apt a few days ago. At first it was me, my then bf(24M), and another couple my age (moved out in January). When they all left, I couldn’t find another roommate in time before my lease was up to help me financially. Let alone find an affordable apt that I can just rent by myself. So I had to move out.

I ended up moving into my best friend’s mom’s (who we’ll call “Carly”) apartment. It’s just her and Carly’s 16 year old daughter in a very small 3 bedroom 1 bathroom apt. She was sooo generous, though. To offer me a place in her home and charge me so little! Just $150/month INCLUDING utilities. What a steal!! I should be grateful.
But the problem? 

My new room literally has no storage space. So I have to live out of garbage bags that I’ve placed all my belongings into (I didn’t have cardboard boxes. Don’t judge me lol). The room has a small couch with a pullout bed that I can’t really pull out because there’s no space due to all my stuff being on the floor in front of it. 
They have a cat and a dog on the larger side. The cat stuff including the litter box is stored in my room.. where the cat only poops in front of it now for some reason even though the litter box will be completely clean? My room has a funky scent to it, but whatever I guess. Anyways;

My room (which was a spare/storage room) was still full of things when I moved in. So right off the bat, this was stressful since clutter really messes with my headspace. 
It doesn’t look like the home of a hoarder like I’m probably making it sound, but it’s just.. quite a bit of stuff with not enough room!

On top of this, I’ve recently dealt with ;
-Moving the whole apt on my own when I have no car (what I’m religiously trying to save up for). I had to rely on my very busy parents and best friend to help me move, so I felt pretty poopy. 
-My ex ghosting me, leaving me to pay for all the bills for the last month at my previous apt. Even though his name was on the 30 day notice too. Did I mention he already owes me $1,000+ not including March’s expenditures?(I talked to my rental agency and there’s nothing I nor they can really do about it. I probably can’t even get my security deposit back because my ex has to sign it to be able to cash the check, and he’s refusing to do anything.. fml)
-Getting laid off from my main job last week because it went out of business. I have another job that I only worked one day a week at, but I won’t start getting scheduled more until May. 
-Discovering my insurance is inactive. Now I can’t really seek out professional mental help and other things I needed to tend to.
-Found out my estranged dad’s very ill, his organs are slowly failing. But I found out 3 months ago and it’s still troubling me. 

Not to mention, I’m very introverted with pretty bad social anxiety. I have INCREDIBLY low privacy here due to reasons, so I’m of course flipping out:/
I’ve had a cruddy go of it lately. 

I’ve seen the new room before and it looked okay, I suppose! The last time I saw it, was a couple months ago. It was tight knit, but it looked doable. I think I was overzealous lol. 
Carly told me it would cleared out to the best of her abilities before I moved in so I wasn’t super worried about it. (She can’t remove many things, her storage garage is already full and I didn’t know this until the day I moved here. If I’d known this before, I’d honestly reconsider)
But I had no idea how small the room really was UNTIL I put all of my things in. Does that make sense? Especially with their stuff still in it. 

To preface this; I have 8 trash bags that contain my clothes, toiletries and a couple other necessities. 
I’ve stored my furniture and other items I didn’t need with me in my parent’s garage as well. I really don’t have much. Just the essentials. 
And I don’t even have room for any of that.. Anywhere in the apt. Just on my bedroom floor. I really wish I was exaggerating. 
There’s a teeny closet in my room to barely hold just my clothes along with a dresser, but Carly’s clothes are in both of those and she doesn’t have anywhere else to put them because her bedroom is the smallest.. I know it’s not her fault but Jesus. 

Mid January I asked Carly if March 31st was an appropriate date for me to move in and she said yes!
I thought that’d be enough time for them to purge their place for me to come.. And it wasn’t done.
When my ex and I were going through a rough patch, she’d keep offering me to stay here if we split. So the idea isn’t new, when she first offered a year and a half ago.. Anyway. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love Carly. She’s almost like my second mom. I understand she has little to no time to do these things. She’s stressed all the time because of her job- 12 hours every day, 5 days/week and has to take care of her ill grandma that lives 2 1/2 hours away about every weekend.

But I can’t help but to feel really disappointed. How did she think I was able to live in the room like this? She could’ve at least told me that the room wasn’t going to be ready for a while. If she wanted to, she could’ve asked her daughter to help clean out the home while she’s away and I would’ve offered to help since I’m gonna be living there!
When I spoke to her closer to the move in day, she she said all she had to do was just clear out the bedroom closet then I’d be good to go. But here we are. I think she just underestimated how much stuff I brought, and overestimated the space the room had?? 

I would’ve been fine waiting for however long it takes her to do what she needs to do. I told her this part. 
I had the option to move into my parents‘ garage, but I couldn’t afford to live there. Which is mostly why I’m at Carly’s. 
Also, at first, living in a garage that’s detached from the house didn’t sound ideal for me since I was offered an actual room for cheap.. That I thought was plausible at least. 
And tbh, I’m not sure if I even told Carly that I had another option. But if I did, I must have vaguely alluded to it. She must’ve been under the impression that I had no where else to live, so she probably felt rushed to move me in. That poor communication was on my part. 

I know I sound irrational and over emotional. Spoiled even. I should be counting my blessings and happy I’m not homeless. But I can’t do this shit. I’m so sorry Carly honey. But I can’t. I feel like me not having a place to put my clothes and shit shouldn’t have me spazzing out. 

I’ve been having little mental breakdowns all week, I feel like I’m at my lowest. I don’t cry often; I’d say like twice a year. But I’ve bawled every night since I’ve moved in. 
I’m a homebody. I want my home to be at least somewhat comfortable but I can’t seem to relax when just being in my room stresses me out. Even in my best headspace I know wouldn’t like living here. I can only handle a month and a half here, tops. 

I have $3k in savings. I’d honestly rather live with my parents and pay whatever I have to at this point. Where I’d be provided with more space than I know what to do with and privacy. Being around the people I’m most comfortable with. 
And you know what?! My parents are so sweet. They’re willing to pay to redo the garage a bit with the little money they have. I’m talking installing carpet in that huge space and anything else they can do to make my stay there comfortable. I offered help to pay for it and they declined?? AND after I opened up about my issues here, they want to lower my rent over there a little to support me. Why are they so nice. What the heck. 
Now I want to take them up on that offer. That garage is really starting to sound like heaven now. 

I just don’t know how to break it to Carly that I wanna move out in May, when it’s only been 4 days. I could lie and make up an excuse, but seeing the look on her face after I tell her would kill me. 
She doesn’t need help with bills at all, she was just so excited to have me move in :(
I know I should tough it out, cool down, really decide if I want to leave. But I don’t see my stay here getting any better when she can’t really move much of her things and make much of a difference. Rearranging the whole apartment wouldn’t do much IMO. Each day here hasn’t been getting worse, it just hasn’t been getting better at all.

I’m not confrontational in the SLIGHTEST so this is really eating me up. I don’t want Carly to feel guilty for practically being poor. What do I even say to her? Of course I could just say 
“I’m sorry but this isn’t working out.” But I’m not good at articulating my thoughts and feelings without sounding like a jerk, in my head at least. I wish I could tell her how I feel without choking up and bawling. It’s an escapist thing to do, but texting her instead of talking to her in person about moving out is an option. :/

Could this also be poor planning on my part?

TLDR; 
My new roommate said she’d have my future, cluttered room cleared out before I moved in and when I did, noting was done after I gave her enough time to do so. So I have literally NO place to put my things, among other reasons why I’m unhappy here. I’ve only been here for 4 days and I hate it so much. 
I was offered to stay in my parents garage but I declined because it’s expensive to live there, but now I want to move in with my family instead. Although I’m not sure if I expressed to my roomie that I had that option. So she could’ve felt rushed to move me in, it was probably poor communication on my end.
I don’t know how to break it to my roommate because it’s not quite her fault her home is a mess, but I’m still disappointed. ",03Apr2019,1

547,"Okay, I know this sounds weird, but hear me out. I am from Greece and my sister married an American (they now both live in the US). In Greece, we have this tradition that you name the kid after a grandparent and my mom in particular thinks it is a very important thing to do to honor your parents.

She actually named me after her mother, even though her brother had already done so with his older daughter. So, naturally, when she found out that my sister's baby was going to be a girl, she was very hyped about her getting her name.

On the other hand, my sister and her husband preferred another name, so as a compromise they decided to choose my mom's name as the baby's first name and the name that they preferred as a middle name, but always address her with her middle name.

My mom refuses to accept that and she insists on calling the baby with her first name and as a result, so do most of our Greek relatives. Both my sister and her husband are pretty annoyed about that and there have been many fights between them, but also put lots of pressure on me and my dad (who follows the same approach as I do) to call her how they respectively want to.

In an effort to be impartial, I still call her sweaty or baby, in order to avoid conflicts but I don't think this is a sustainable solution. Right now the baby is one year old, but how long can I keep this up? Both sides are annoyed and pressuring me to call her this or that to the point I actually feel like they are blackmailing me (my mom has cried about it and my sister has fought about it with me rather intensely).

After a big fight with both sides today, I realized I can't keep this up forever and at this point I will just feel like a bad guy, no matter what I do. Advice would be appreciated.",03Apr2019,1

Just a disclaimer; Both of us had consented to this.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I lost my virginity to my SO, and I'm worried that I kind of forced it on her a little bit.

We've been talking about having sex for a while, and although this is my first time, it wasn't hers, but she was still very nervous about screwing things up.

I asked her multiple times if what we did was ok, and i was honest in telling her I was worried that I had forced her into something. Everytime she told me it was ok, and she was perfectly fine with everything that happened.

&amp;#x200B;

My fear is, that because of her traumatic past of being abused/raped multiple times before, that she was maybe afraid to say no? These events were way in the past, but I can tell that they still have an impact on her today. 

&amp;#x200B;

When she opened up to me she got very emotional, and very vulnerable, I didn't want to take advantage of that vulnerability then, it wouldn't feel right. Afterwards she was kind of telling me that she actually wanted to do stuff with me; I mentioned that she was very vulnerable, but she replied ""I'm always vulnerable""

&amp;#x200B;

When she seemed reluctant during, I asked her if this was ok, and she asked me if I was sure I wanted to do this.

572,"My (M, 20) ex-boyfriend (M, 20) and I separated about a year ago. Our relationship was never healthy and it has taken me a year to realise how toxic it was. He constantly ignored me, cheated on me, forced me to spend thousands of dollars, asked me to dress more femininely because he had always preferred girls over guys. Our relationship has left me with destroyed friendships and serious debt. I feel my life has been ruined since we started dating. I was never a very good partner either, but I never put my hands on him or emotionally abused him in any way. 

Since we broke up, we have remained in contact and have shifted to a completely sexual relationship. I know this doesn’t help me move on. To be clear, he is not DATING the woman (18) he is talking to. They have not confirmed their relationship as anything. He believes I have absolutely no knowledge of this, but I have known for quite some time. He and I speak daily, but purely sexual unless he asks for money. He does not have a car and recently asked me to take him ‘somewhere’ (the woman’s house, I only know because I am friends with her sister) and said he will repay me with sex. This will be on Saturday (currently it is Wednesday), but I am unsure if I can. 

The girl he is talking to just recently got her heart broken, her and I are very friendly. I want to tell her that he is still having sex with someone (will not say it is me) and that he has plans to continue his relationship with said sexual partner even if he and her begin to date. I DO NOT want to do this with the intentions of dating him again. I DO NOT want to do this to hope he and I can develop into something more. I want to protect a young girl from getting her life ruined like I had when we started dating. 

My plan is to show her text messages to prove he is speaking to other people, but with the condition that she tells NO ONE, including him that she knows he is ‘cheating’. I recently asked her and her sister a ‘hypothetical’ question that was “if I told you your boyfriend was cheating and showed you proof, but said you CANNOT tell him that you know he is cheating, would you break up with him by making up another reason or would you tell him you know?” She said she would make up a reason to break up with him and keep my word secret. Since her and I are friendly but not close, I want to trust her, but I’m unsure.

575,"I’m a 22 year old engineer who’s not dependent on them at all. After several years of thought and a year of proven self sufficiency, I’m finally getting a puppy. I take it home in June, and though I’m nervous, I’m very excited. How do I break this news to my parents? 

My parents are not on board. They agree that I am more than responsible enough to raise a puppy, but have actively expressed worry that it’ll keep me from experiencing life as a young person. They are right to some extent of course, it’ll mean I can’t just head to a friend’s straight after work, but I probably only do that once a week. I know it’ll cut back on my ability to spontaneously travel (which I rarely do ever), but I’ve done the budgeting and I can easily afford my maximum vacation time at a kennel while still maintaining and growing my savings at my current savings rate. 

Basically I just want them to know that I really have thought through their viewpoint, and though I respect it I’m going to get a dog anyway. I had a tenuous relationship with my parents in college and it’s finally recovered to a point where we’re actively getting along. I don’t want to ruin that by coming across as callous and impulsive, but I also need them to know that I am an adult who doesn’t always need their approval. How do I do this tactfully?

576,"I'm an anxious person. I worry a lot. Despite all the worrying I do, I still seem to ignore a lot of my problems. When I turned 18 last month, I realized I cannot push these problems in my closet like I do with the dirty clothes in my room. If I don't tackle these issues now, they will hurt me or the ones I care about.

Thanks to the help of my wonderful boyfriend, I realized I don't need to go to college right away like I thought I did. He also helped me realize I don't think I'm emotionally or financially ready to go to college. I have doubts about my major; I don't work well under stress, and there's pretty much no way I could pay for college (even a local, cheap community college) without taking out loans. With all this in mind, I think I will work and save money until I can better pay for college and have a better idea of what career I want to pursue. This is fine, but I still am worried about a lot.

What will I do if I never discover a career I want to pursue? How can I ensure I won't become out of practice academically and can't function when I go back to college? What if by the time I get all my stuff together, I'm old and don't have a lot of time to practice my profession? Scariest of all, what if I fail, disappoint everyone (including myself) and just become a loser?

Realistically, I know at least the last fear I is silly. I have loving, understanding family and friends and a loving, understanding boyfriend. I don't think any of them would call me or think of me as a loser, but I want to make them proud. I want to give back to them after all they've done for me.

I'm not a confident person and I don't like uncertainty, but uncertainty seems to make up a lot of what I have. So, my question is; how I can I practice my academic skills, help discover what career I want to pursue, and become more confident while out of school and working?

tldr; I think I'm not going to college right away due to financial issues, emotional instability, and uncertainty with what I want to do. What can I do while working to help practice my academic skills, discover what career I want to pursue, and become more confident in myself?",03Apr2019,3

Well my boyfriend vapes and we were gonna hang out after school so I shoved it in my backpack as headed off to school. On the back from school ( our hangout got cancelled) my friend is rummaging through my backpack looking for a tampon bc she ran out at home and needed to borrow one. I wasn’t paying attention and was talking to someone else. She pulls out the pen and takes a hit, blows it out and then I realized what she found. I sit down and tell her to put it back, she says fine just one more hit, I say fine, no ones looking and it doesn’t really smell so no big deal. She took a hit then I did then we put it away. Well apparently some girl up front of the bus smelled it and goes and told the school officer after school outside, I was walking past and heard her list off my name, my friends name and a bunch of other kids as the ones who were smoking.

579,"Last year I was convicted of a Reckless Driving that was a reduced conviction from my original DUI charge. I was in my senior year of college.

I ended up finishing with a BS in Psych &amp; Bio. The reason being was I wanted to apply to PA school and the psych portion allowed me to work in mental health while in school. Well the DUI arrest had shown up and I had to jump through many hoops just to keep my clearance that California Department of Social Services had set out. Luckily my boss was a friend so she was patient with the process. I eventually had left that job as I began working more hours at a hospital as a NA as it was more direct patient care experience which was mandatory for PA school apps. 

But then it hit me, this actually set me back. I reached out to schools and got mixed reviews. Some said they'd flat out deny me for it, some said it won't play a huge impact. All of them said I'd need to be off probation. I'm on probation for 3 years. I have a useless degree, I might lose my hospital job cause I'm renewing my NA license now and they are extensively reviewing the circumstances now which if I don't have proof of renewal by a certain time to HR then I kiss my job goodbye.

I'm in an immense amount of debt, lawyer fees and ticket and all that total about $11k. And I have $35k in undergrad that I'm going to have to start paying back soon. I just feel everything I worked for just pissed down the drain.. and I , guess I'm opened to absolutely anything now..just anything. If I pissed this dream away then so be it, but it seems everywhere I turn I'm reminded of it.

581,"Background and stuff: TL:DR at the bottom, in our school we have a bunch of councils for every classroom kind of thing, plus, we are divided in lines, each line has a representative member of the discipline council, this representative, has the duty of observing the behavior of the members of the line and report any misbehave to the head-teacher. English is not my first language btw, so, sorry for any spelling or term errors    

So, we have this guy here that has been in the same school as me since i was in 4th grade, the dude has been kind of the troublesome kind, but it seems to have gotten better over the years, at least it seemed to. PS: I'll refer to him as Pete

So, Pete has been kind of an ass lately, he somehow got into the discipline council of the class (idk how tho) and is in charge of my line, i was pretty much OK with this until some changes into the school in general rolled in, a bunch of strict rules and stuff, plus, our classroom was pretty much a disaster, so more shit coming to us, the thing is that Pete has been an asshole to me for kind of a long time, even tho he acts like a real friend sometimes, he also just becomes absolutely insufferable, basically just being a straight ass, being annoying, gross, and even saying i'm a faggot and stuff like that.

He started breaking some school rules, and also being bad at his job pretty much, it seems like he just took on me, every single damn time i break even the most stupid and minimal rule, he tells me stuff like he's going to put me into a kind of paper when bad behavior is written down and stuff, i just sighed and went back to what i was doing, until i realized the guy was also breaking most of the school rules, not only the minimal stupid ones, i mean, kind of medium ones.

As you might have guessed, even if most people know about what he does, it doesn't seems like no one is doing anything about it, not even teachers. But today was the drop that filled the glass. Last hour, everything going on as normal, i unwillingly change my seat with some friend, i just keep at it normally, until i decide to go to the thrash can (which is at the side of my line) and then Pete calls me down and tells me the usual shit, that he is going to put me into that damn paper and bla, bla bla, i was pissed off at him, so i just said something withing the lines of: Alright, do it.

He kind of just gave me a bad look and kept talking with one of our mutual friends.

So, to the thing i need advice for, I've had enough of his shit, i cant stand this type of thing anymore, and it has been clear for me, that he doesn't deserves that spot on the discipline council, so, i was thinking about making an anonymous letter to the head-teacher about my concerns and stuff, and if everything i said is proved to be true, it could really hurt his grades and just straight up get too far, so, should i do it? Or should i just move on.

PS: I'm accepting recommendations and advice

PS\^2: We have a lot of mutual friends, so, i feel like it could really hurt our ""friendship""

PS\^3: Am i being a drama king? Kind of a concern

TL:DR: A guy is an ass, is in the discipline council, he has pissed me off enough, we have a bunch of mutual friends, i won't stand this anymore, what should i do?",03Apr2019,1
582,"My siblings and I have noticed my nephew acting increasingly edgy over the past few months. My mother suggested (since I am the youngest uncle he has, and there’s only a 12-year gap between us) that I should speak to him tonight to kind of see where his head is at and why he’s been acting the way he does.

I have a solid relationship with him - we go see all the marvel movies together, and I see his family at least once a week. But for the life of me, I’ve got no idea how I can help steer him out of this funk he’s in. I see a lot of my old behavior in him, but I know our personality types and inner wirings are completely different. What worked for me most likely will not work for him, and I don’t want to come off as condescending or authoritative in this approach. He’s just been extremely negative for a long time, which has resulted in him acting like a very spoiled brat.

I love him very much and I don’t want him to wake up someday in his twenties like I did and realize you weren’t making the most out of formative years.

585,"I am fairly young however have been through more than my share of relationships. 

My struggle started 2 years ago when I first realized that I had the capability to date a guy. Before that, I felt ugly and did not conform to societal norms to the point that I wore a polo shirt and bootcut jeans every single day and messed my hair up on purpose, just to look smart. 

When I realized that I might have the capacity to “pull” the guy I was interested in, I put all my effort into it until he started dating my friend. I immediately backed away and maintained a healthy distance out of respect from my friend, even though I still had feelings for the guy. About a month later, the guy and my friend broke up and he asked me out. I was floored with surprise/ happiness. He quickly backed out though, saying that he was kidding. THis broke my heart for the first time, and I remember feeling so empty.  

I then moved on to the next guy who was fairly sweet and I started exploring \*things\* with him. My culture is fairly restrictive and places a norm of being extremely studious and conservative, so every time we fooled around, I felt empowered that I was breaking out of cultural norms. We mutually broke up at the end of summer. 

At the beginning of the school year, I realized that girls got attention for their bodies, and I wanted to be a part of that. I wore slutty clothes and flirted with guys, which got me attention along with backlash that I had shifted personalities. I was confused but I started having a “thing” with this guy that was far above me in the social hierarchy. The “thing” ended as quickly as it started and it left me with the reputation of a whore. I was fine with the reputation at the time, because I told myself that people were just acknowledging that I was pretty. 

I then got into what could have been the best relationship that I have had. He was caring, funny, intelligent, and basically my better half. We were happy for a few weeks, but I ended the relationship because I was insecure about my place in the social hierarchy, and that I was dating “down”. Still kicking myself for that BTW

After that, I realized that I had feelings for my best friend, who wanted my body but not a relationship. We were too young to assume a true friends with benefits relationship, but we did other things. 

At that point, I still thought that my dating life was okay and that I was just making up for lost time that I had spent “being a nerd”. I started realizing that I was being an idiot for trying to show off that much, but I still thought I liked the attention. At that point, I didn’t have many friends because people either pegged me as a bad influence or as fake. 

I moved to a different school in the area as I started the next year… Within the first 10 days of school, I started developing a tiny crush on a guy who is now a friend and a guy asked me out only to say that he couldn’t date me. I was shocked by how quickly life was moving, ya know?

I soon started dating a guy who was the image of a sweet person, he always shook people’s hands when they met and went out of his way to be polite. I thought that that might have been the first healthy relationship of my life. I soon found out that he was cheating on me with a girl that I had bitch slapped in my earlier school. I was shocked, disappointed, and sad. 

I thought I had sworn off guys, but those types of promises don’t last for long. I soon started liking another guy, who was the image of a homeschool kid raised by tiger parents, water polo, swim, and his life committed to robotics. I don’t know how I fell for him, but I found his nerdiness attractive and I asked him to homecoming. The day before the dance, though, he friendzoned me which left me shocked. 

Everyone had a good laugh about that just because of how normal the situation was. I started developing feelings for a guy that is 4 years older than me (freshman/ senior). I flirted with him quite often (messing with his hair/ being extra nice to him/ having fun in general). I never thought that he would even notice that I liked him, because his other friends said he was oblivious to that type of thing. One day, we were hanging out and he was messing around with me (holding my prized bluetooth earbuds away from me). I told him that I would tell him a secret if he gave me the earbuds back, and I whispered that I thought he was cute in his ear. 

We started talking more seriously and messing around physically. It got to the point where he said that I was attractive (yes this stroked my ego lol) and somehow he asked me out. I was extremely surprised because before that day, I didn’t even realize he saw me as a girl. I said yes, and we dated for 3 hours before I got a nervous text from him saying that he couldn’t commit because he was 18. I was shocked but at the same time, I expected it. 

We agreed to be friends but started arguing to the point where it got so bad that other people noticed our screaming matches. I would yell and swear, both activities that I do not take part in (scared of arguments thanks mom and dad). The issue here is that whenever he isn’t arguing, he is extremely sweet and gets me to do things for him (get his lunch). I can’t stop being nice to him and I don’t know how to change the dynamic of our “friendship”

I have recently taken up with another guy who is really sweet most of the time. He has a lot of friends that are equally great people, and is never openly rude. He is 2 year older, which does get a little strange because I feel like a child. About 2 months ago, I noticed that he was attractive and hence started flirting with him. He is extremely flirtatious in nature, so when he reciprocated, I thought nothing of it. One day, we were hanging out outside and he asked me if I liked him. I told him that I found him attractive. He said that he thought the same thing of me but was not able to commit to a relationship at the time. He then said that he thought that we were going to come outside and make out. I laughed and said that we could, and we did. 

He used to sneak out of his lunch to come meet me when we first started “talking” and we progressed further in the “thing” that we had. The “thing” was claimed as exclusive. We were also talking to each other a lot over text, and I thought that things were going well. He was extremely sincere and I found that amazing. I thought things were going well, but the response rate of his texts was declining and he also started coming out to hang out less, which I found strange. 

Around that time, I also brought up the fact that I was looking for a relationship and felt shitty when he put his arm around his ex (stuff like that ya know). After I said that, I feel like he has been avoiding me, but has never said it. 

I asked him if we wanted to hang out outside of school a couple days ago, and he seemed excited about it until he canceled without much of an explanation. I have been trying to distance myself a little bit because I feel like my value has plummeted to nothing and that I am “just an easy hoe”. 

My friends tell me that I just want attention or that I’m a slut. Neither of these are true, I feel like I just catch feelings too quickly and get in over my head. As of late, I have started feeling more anxious as to what I am doing because I know that I am not “getting anywhere” by hoeing. 

So sorry this was so long but I appreciate any advice. ",03Apr2019,1
586,"Hi everyone,

So basically  I will try not to bore you too much with the details and only include that are necessary but my best friend and I have hit a rough patch after a series of misunderstandings/ events and I need some advice!

Update: okay after typing it all out it is longer than i thought sorry but I need advice so if you're willing please read!!!

Would be super grateful :)

So me and my best friend have just broken up for easter break before our finals in May.

We were meant to go see this film on Tuesday just gone, and we had made plans to do so.

All was fine, I went home to visit my parents on mother's day,Sunday 31/03 and alas when I get home my mum said what she really wanted was to go see the film that my friend and I were planning on seeing(!!) This was the start of the end...

To be honest,  maybe I should have thought about it more at the time but my mum kept saying how she couldn't get to go see it because she worked when it was shown during the week and it isn't being shown after a certain date. 

It's a bit far from where we live, and I hadn't seen a film with her in years, so I agreed to go, because it would make her happy and assumed my friend would understand which she kinda did?¿ it's all a bit confusing still...but I was like oh I'll just watch it twice I don't see the harm.

When we were at the cinema my mum seemed really happy and it made my heart happy, so I'm not sure I entirely regret the decision. I don't get to see her much and it was nice to treat her, I think she just wanted us all to something as a family, it was sweet.

Anyway I sent  a text telling my best friend what was happening on the way, which maybe wasn't the best idea, having had some wines with lunch - the text might have been a bit long or soppy idk, to which she replied 'It's your choice haha'.

Anyway so I come home from the film (btw I live at uni which is about 30 mins from where I'm actually from which is why the places and people clash in this story)

My best friend, who I live with, isn't really around when I get back and doesn't come into my room to ask me about my day which happens sometimes, she might have been tired I thought? 

So the next day rolls around and so I thought I would head to the library early - best friend was in shower when I left

So then I get a text saying 'have you already  left lol I wanted to go to library too.'

To which I honestly replied that I didn't know she wanted to come (cos sometimes she doesn't like the library!) and usually when we are at uni and going to lectures we know eachothers schedules so we don't like text eachother where we are going etc...

Anyway she replied: 'you could've asked me lol' and replying to what I already had said (that I would save her a seat) she was like 'no it's fine don't want to interrupt your day lol' and I said we could grab lunch or a coffee together to which she kept saying 'no don't want to disturb you' which was a bit strange to me...

The reason I kept offering to meet in person is because I have sufferrd with anxiety and I have a tendency to hide behind my phone and it always ends up badly which ironically slapped me in the face this time.

Replying to the cinema thing, she replied that she was going to go with our other flatmate and that she didn't want me to come with her just because 'i felt bad.'

To which I replied I didn't feel bad, I wanted to go with her and we had been looking forward to it and it was a commitment we had made, and that I hadn't had a chance to tell her about Mother's Day and why I ended up going, and then she was like no you don't need to explain 'i'm a big girl.'

Then I was like I will explain it in person, but i said 'you don't have to listen if you don't want to', jokingly

Then she replied 'you need to stop saying things like this, I'm not a monster who's going to erupt.'

This monster thing has come up before in another little argument where I stupidly text everything I wanted to say to her, but I made sure this time not to do that and I have been trying to work on communication, and I didn't avoid her on purpose I genuinely think that was misunderstood.

Anyway since then she has been super distant, whenever I message her she just replied with 'nice!' Or 'yup!'

In the living room it's super awkward and whenever I try to make conversation she replied with one word answers and it's so weird not being close and just talking/laughing about everything and anything.

We went to the film yesterday night and the walk there with my flatmate she only made small talk and was very distant in general.

Around the house she only says superficial hellos and makes small talk but I hear her being less distant with my other flatmate upstairs. 

I have made two attempts to spend time together, yesterday offering to study together and today I asked if she wanted to come to the library with me and she replied something along the lines of 'No, I don't want to slow you down'(?)

I honestly feel like it's been a lot of misunderstanding but I feel like I'm losing my best friend and I don't really understand how his happened,

We are super close we do everything together and she is really important to me. I know I fucked up but I'm just trying to make sense of where (can anyone help?!!)

I was thinking of tomorrow asking her to have a conversation about it all but I'm worried she'll tell me I'm treating her like a 'monster' again if I go to her room and get all shaky  asking her (I have previously suffered from and continue to suffer from social anxiety)

But if I text her I'm worried she'll say the same thing about hiding away.

We are in final year, and we have been friends for 4 yrs including a year in different countries and with exams looming, I feel like neither of us need this stress and it's a bit ridiculous as we are both 21 y/o.

But more than that I love her and miss her and I'm truly sorry for any upset I may have caused!!

I haven't approached her about talking about it yet because I wanted to give some space and see if things would return to normal but they really have stagnated, or gone stale even and there has been no thawing of her distant demeanour...

Part of the issue is I don't understand this whole monster thing?? (Help)

I also want to talk to her before she goes home for easter next week.

(Also I'm aware she could see this but is because it's nothing I wouldn't say to her face haha)

Anyway thanks for reading all this I guess, it was long and any advice I would be super grateful for!! 

Do I go to her room and ask her to organise a time to talk it through? Or do I message her and organise a time?
Or something else?

What should I say?? (I have a rough idea but would be helpful to hear people's suggestions) 

I know this probably sounds so dumb but I have several friends irl but she is my only close friend I can talk to about stuff like this so I feel really alone without her and I miss her a lot :(

590,"Hopefully, this isn't considered hate speech to another subreddit- but this is going to be a gigantic rant to r/SAT, r/ACT, r/chanceme .. I guess is- how do you all do it?

I'm currently an early college student + Winter Swimmer + 3.7 High School GPA Senior - 1170 SAT - Just started working at a Tim hortons.. so I am gaining customer experience in the weekend instead of just playing video games

Every time I see people around me- I just see everyone as so much better than me. There seems to be nothing that I'm actually good at or doing well. People around me say that I'm an intelligent person, but in reality I got a 3 on the AP language and dropped out of AP Calculus just because of the pace. I'm going to go to calculus at my community college hopefully my last semester before I get my associate's, but I have no clue how I will be able to keep up with that pace if I couldn't do it at the high school.

I only got one job shadow (internship) provided with the assistance of the high school and I just don't know where to go from here or what I should do. My goal is to go into computer science, but I can't get myself into a ""coding mindset"", nor do I ever feel like I have the time to do it when I feel like it. I feel that I'm just scathing by with the bare minimum wherever I go or whatever I do. Maybe I just don't feel like I'm putting in enough effort into what I do.

Playing video games (computer, console seems to slow) isn't as fun as I hoped it to be each time I play and I just don't know why I never can feel relaxed anymore.

I am seeing a counselor, but I feel they aren't helping ass much as I want them to- or rather it's just me lacking motivation to do the things that they ask me to do. I kind-of have a hint of depression + anxiety + ADD but I just have no clue what that all would entail for me- or what I am supposed to make of what happens in the upcoming years.

My goal is to go to UMich, but my brother (he had a 1280, 1300 unweighted, 3.8 highschool GPa, early college) recently just got denied after being waitlisted- so I have no clue what to make of it.

I am thinking of just settling in on Kettering University and MSU, but I have no clue what to do at this point or how I should go on. Everything just seems like a pain to do and I have no clue what I need to do to even fix it. I'm probably a huge procrastinator, and I don't want to be a quitter. At the same time though, I just want to quit it all and go on a different path- but I love technology for what it is and I want to do coding in the future- I just don't really know how to or where to start with it.

592," 

For context, I smoke weed and my roommate doesn't. I don't smoke in the apartment to be considerate to her. One day a couple months ago I messed up. I got kinda wine drunk and lit a joint in the front room. She confronts me about in a civil and respectful way and asks that I don't smoke again inside b/c of the furniture, etc. I apologize and say I understand, it won't happen again.

Fast forward to last weekend, I have a couple childhood friends visiting. My roommate leaves for the morning. We pick up weed, come back to the apartment to roll the joint, then head outside to smoke it. We did not smoke inside the house; we simply rolled the joint on the kitchen table and left the apartment building.

We come back later in the day and chill and watch tv. My roommate comes back and doesn't say anything. The next day, I ask her if she knew where my foam roller was, a regular question, and I could tell something was off. I asked her ""are you ok?"" and she says ""well, I wasn't gonna bring it up because I already told you once to not smoke in the apartment and you did again"" and I respond ""no, I didn't. And why wouldn't you tell me, you should tell things so I can address it."". She then continues to imply that I did smoke in the house because she ""knows what it smells like because she's a dentist"" I repeat, ""I didn't smoke in the house. Maybe you smelled it because we had it with us"". In a super condescending tone she says ""I know what it smells like and I left and came back and it smelled like weed."" I said ""well, i don't doubt that you smelled something. But now you're accusing me of lying and that's hurtful"" and then she started rambling about how if the dental school finds out, it'll be bad for her and she has loans blah blah. I'm not sure what me smoking weed has to do with that, but she somehow turned it to make it like I could potentially damage her career. Then she said ""I don't even want it in the house but whatever"".

For background, I have tolerated a lot of her bs including her mom staying with us for a month, randomly bringing her dog when pets aren't allowed, and asking me to leave work because she was stuck outside without her keys, plus a handful of other times where I had to get her out of situations because she lost her keys.

Am I in the wrong here? I feel like she is terribly out of line and that she disrespected me by insinuating I was lying to her. My plan was to assert myself to her and tell her straight up you disrespected me and I can't tolerate that. I want to see what other people might think.",03Apr2019,2
593,"She is beautiful, we get along really well and I know she is into me. I would ask her out in a heartbeat. However, I am worried about what my friends might think.

594,"I [19 F] have attended my first semester of college, after two years of being on and off unemployed and just trying to figure everything out. Still no clue what to major in I am failing all the classes. I am fucking up everything, I was super excited for school and I still want to attend, but I feel a weight of trying to work and do school and that is a lot for me to do. 

When I was in high school, I didn’t work so I could fully focus on school. That worked for me, unless if I became depressed and of course fell back on my studies. 

With my job I work at a local grocery store and I condition the store (fix products/make products look decent) from 5pm to 11:30pm. The more time they give me a week to work the more likely I have a mental breakdown. They know about 3 days is at most for me to handle. I understand every and now and then to give me more days cause of the other conditioners (there’s 2 others). They are new and they are not good at all. I feel very uncomfortable and unwanted by my other managers. 

I don’t mind the physical labor anymore, but I know college is my only option. I don’t want to work there or a factory for the rest of my life. 

I don’t like being enclosed and I like being outdoors and having a garden and have some cows as pets is a dream of mine. It’s my happy place 

But I know I won’t get there without decent money and decent money also means a decent education 

But I’m not good at anything 

Literally nothing

I hate the thought of medical field

I hate the thought doing most things that doesn’t involve me being apart of a flexible environment. With flexible scheduling or understanding employers. I don’t care about having a boss 

And I can’t drop out of these classes cause I was told that I may have to pay the money I received and I cannot do that at all.

I feel trapped. 

I’m trying so incredibly hard to succeed, but the most my best can do is a D (60s) 

When I tell people this they don’t fully hear what I’m saying or more like they don’t wanna see how I am feeling 

I know I have to go to class but I just don’t see the point in anything anymore and I don’t know how to open doors for myself when they all seem to be locked shut 

I just wanna be happy but everything is fighting me keep me away from that. 

I just don’t know, I’m lost

595,"Well, where do I start?! Late last year I found out (inadvertently) my mum has been hooking up with other men without my Dad having a clue. I think it had been going on for about 6 months until I found out.

They've had a difficult relationship ever since I can remember and should have divorced years ago. My Dad has been pretty bad to my Mum all these years so wouldn't blame her seeking love and attention elsewhere, however the vindictive nature of this (I've unfortunately seen the messages) feels plain wrong and not the mum who brought me up.

So, before Christmas I confronted her about what I knew. I wanted her to be honest and own up but she denied it all so had to share the details I knew (not a great experience for a son telling his mum details of her sexual conversations!). I said, though it's not my business what she likes to do personal life, the way she's done this and the lies were wrong and I felt it is time to move on  meaning she leaves my Dad. Our grandmother has recently been diagnosed with dementia so suggested this was an opportunity to spend more time with her and move away from Dad.  I also said I wouldn't tell Dad, mainly because he is an arsehole, he's cheated on my mum and doesn't care about anyone but himself. However it didn't make what Mum did right and not something we just 'sweep under the carpet'.

We agreed after the festivities of Christmas with all the family, she would separate from Dad

Christmas passed and nothing. I spoke to her in January and she said there had been alot on at her work so would at the start of February instead.

And now we're in April and still nothing. No mention from Mum, just carrying on with life as if nothing has happened.

So, to my question. What shall I do? Ignore it and just leave them both to it? Tell Dad? Give Mum an ultimatum? - tell Dad or leave (is this blackmail?!?)

Sorry for rant guys. Having not spoken to anyone about this it's good to get off my chest....

596,"I’m pretty upset and I’m going to *try* and make this brief. I’m 17 and still in high school and my “friend” group includes a guy we’ll call John who I’ve known my entire life and I can honestly say he’s turned into a douche and I can confidently say if I met him now I would hate his guts. Then there’s another guy we’ll call Brad and I helped him get out of an extreme bullying situation back in 6th grade and helped him switch schools and introduced him to good people. 

Anyways Brad is a pain in the ass who I honestly now see why he was getting bullied and he fully deserved it. He’s arrogant, talks constant shit and never shuts up. He uses peoples hopes and dreams to make fun of them, and makes fun of me for anything he possibly can even if I don’t say a word to him. If I tell them anything it will be used against me. John constantly puts everyone down, he only wants pussy and he’s an angry little shit all the time because girls ghost him for being a creep. He also is just rude and insulting, goes around yelling the n word as a 5’6 110lb white guy. He asks how long I worked last night and I’ll tell him, he’ll call me a loser and a pussy and say he worked more, and that I need to “get on his level” that type stuff. 

Anyways I have a girlfriend and she has been nothing but kind to all of them even though she really dislikes them. John gives me constant shit for never hanging out with him but I don’t really want to tell him it’s because he acts like an ass all the time and can’t stand him. Also our moms are close friends (he’s only cool when we’re alone) and I can’t stand any of them. Today I decided that I didn’t want to deal with Brad so I decided not to talk to him so he started making fun of me for a half hour straight so I told my girlfriend that if he says anything else I’ll just break his nose as walk away. He didn’t say anything else so I let it go. They are all rude to my gf as well, today they looked over her shoulder at her phone and insulted her because of who she was texting and called her a fake bitch. She told them she didn’t like how they did that and they said it “shouldn’t fucking bother her”

I can’t just leave because Brad will follow me anywhere I go just to harass me and John will start crying and telling me he misses me if I don’t hang out with them at lunch and talk to his mom about it which causes problems at home. I think I’m just going to punch Brads lights out if he keeps it up. My mom says I have to hang out with them because I can’t just leave friends and be left with nobody but my gf.

It started 2 months ago when my little brother wanted to have a party at my parents house while they were gone. I told him that there would be no party with alcohol. He completely ignored me and expected me to cover for him. I was being very clear that there would be no party, but the party happened anyway. I called my parents when a bunch of drunk teenagers started showing up anyways.

   * My brother got an engineering degree and after a couple years decided he hated engineering and left for the army
* My mom thinks that I just need to drop out of school because I struggle to manage my pain and she does't believe in me
   * My relationship with my mom isn't that great. My dad wasn't around growing up but my mom was. I recently discovered a lot of our relationship has been her gas lighting me to get her was (but idk if she knows anything she's doing is wrong)

Okay so here we go...

So I was an honors student in high school. Got a 1220 on the SAT and graduated with a \~3.85 GPA. School was super easy for me. College classes are NOT easy at all. I now have a GPA less than 2.00. Classes at the community college are easier, but I still am failing one and I can't be here forever. I also no longer have any idea what I want to do as a career anymore or what I want to major in. I really no longer think college is for me, but I want to stick it to my mom and not give up.  

I really just don't know what to do. 

I will literally take any advice anyone has.",03Apr2019,2
600,"Hello.  My girlfriend and I currently have a 2013 Ford Edge.  We owe approximately $11,000 on it, but we are in a position where we can pay it off and eliminate the debt completely.  However, since we don't really care for the car, we're considering upgrading.  We've found a 2015 Honda Accord for $13,000, which is after $2,000 in ""Trade-in assistance,"" and another $2,000 for using the dealership's financing.  The dealership said they would give us $11,000 for the Edge on trade-in, as long as we bought the Accord for $13,000.

Here's where the spidey-senses start kicking in.  The car had been sitting on the lot since January, and my girlfriend called the dealership, and expressed interest in it earlier in the week.  The dealership is nearly an hour away from us, but she went down there today while I slept (I work overnights), and lo and behold, the car just happened to be sold last night, but here is another Accord for $19,000.  Naturally she balked at that, and then shortly after, she gets word that the ""previous buyer couldn't get financed, so they're bringing back the vehicle.""  My GF asks some questions, and somehow finds out they sold the car to the previous people for $12K, because they ""had a clear title.""  I think that it's awfully suspicious that they ""sold"" it yesterday, but now it's potentially coming back.  It's just incredibly coincidental .  

Something about the whole thing feels sketchy.  They're ranked a 4.1 on Google with 285 reviews, and a 4.8 with 211 reviews on Dealer Rater, but out of 21 reviews of that particular salesperson, all but 4 are on the same day, and the other 4 are the days immediately following - no reviews since September.  

So, I guess my advice question is two-fold -- is it a good idea to upgrade?  And is the deal too sketchy to be true?  Any other advice/input would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!!",03Apr2019,1

607,"Hi all, second post on reddit and second time I am in need of help. Writing here because first time it really helped. But I hope the third post I will be helping  or sharing ;)

In general I almost made a peace with myself and found out I bore myself to death. Turned out I can't stop thinking I wasted my 20s and it makes me angry (manly booze and frustration that come with anxiety towards women). So I want to push into 30s as a better man. 

Basically there are some things that I want to change and I need some advice to begin doing stuff. Maybe answers are obvious but I feel I need to see them. 

Bullet points, (I love them) what bothers me:

\- I landed a job I love, but I am scared that I will turn workaholic, and I really hate work - home routine, got big expectations and hopes but also i don't want to be burn, so I don't feel 100% into it yet

\- Fashion advice, I was goofing around. Always had balls to wear something out of ordinary but I think I crossed a line so I need get in touch with real world, need to grown up a little?

\- Sex / relationship life. All my expectation and imagination unfortunately is forged by porn and it is boring one. I'd like to find something more erotic, sensual sources. Unfortunately my background is dysfunctional family so I don't know how to establish connection with women, no role model in my life - i feel like i need to start from scratch in this topic. Not really want to jump into relationship, but just to better connect as a man, as a person.

\- Right know I don't have real interests, I think I know what I used to like in my teenage/early 20s but... still deep down i feel like I am scifi guy Star Wars, The X-files, Lem books, but also I want to get more down to earth

&amp;#x200B;

So generally speaking I feel like a blank card. I somewhat know what I want to achieve, but I am overwhelmed with amount of possible sources of information. And what's terrifying I know that this is a project, long term kind of plan but I want it all at once and I often end up doing nothing. Scared that I can lose some friendships that I have a few.. but I definitely willing to risk, right know I feel that they are not as deep as I thought some time ago. I want to end with clueless, somekind social awkward and hesitant person I turned into. I'd like to get advice how to kick off - how to manage all this in so such short twenty four hour day, 7 day week, maybe few links to boards, fine books to start with.

609,"So I am currently employed at a great company with a solid, albeit not great salary. You know just enough to cover the rent, pay the bills, provide for the family (2 kids, 7 and 1), etc. But not exactly enough to go on vacation twice a year or think about purchasing any sudden necessities over $500 without some serious talks with the wife and some cutting back on some things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have applied to several jobs in search for that extra bump in pay I'm looking for. I have been very firm in my pursuit for this salary while also being reasonable. Finally I get a call, go to the interview and passed with flying colors which leads me to this predicament...

&amp;#x200B;

The position pays 30% more than my current role, requires traveling twice a year to Paris for stat presentations and just all around more work overall. I was told about potential odd-hour meetings due in part to colleagues being located in various time zones. But see the problem is that my current job while paying me 30% less... is WAYYY smoother. I can work from home if necessary, I don't get reprimanded for coming in 30min late or even if I leave 30min early, vacation days pretty much on-demand within reason and laid back dress code. The main task at my job is to report my monthly stat reports and back again the following month. A very ""if the work gets done, I don't care what you do"" scenario.

618," 

Hey guys! I have been a lurker on this subreddit for awhile now, and would like to share my journey/struggles, and am searching for some advice. O and also, please let me know if I should not have posted this here, I will take it down right away.

Here it goes.

Ever since I was in about 8th grade, I have always known I wanted to start my own business, but as I have grown, I have come to the understanding I have absolutely NO idea on what type of business, and that is what I am coming to you guys for advice. I am at a complete loss on what direction I want to go in.

Right now I am currently at a full time job which I do not enjoy at ALL. The office here is so disorganized it drives me a little crazy. They hired me as a Sales Representative, but now they expect me to Social Media Manage, manage their eCommerce store, manage their google analytics, answer phones sometimes, and organize a marketing strategy...for $15 an hour. At the start I was paid $13 an hour, with a promise of a significant raise and eventually an ownership of the company down the road. In my first 2 months of being here, I grew online sales by 10% (for a million dollar business which was going downhill). I was then given a raise of 2 dollars ($15/hr 35 hrs a week). This felt like a slap in the face as they made it seem to be I would be getting a huge raise because of what I have done. The owner of the company is extremely old, and has become senile and delusional. Shutting down new marketing strategies, re-branding to be more new, wasting a ton of money by changing decisions last minute, and so on. Because of all of this, I have given up and just been going through the motions.

While having this full time job I also am Social Media Managing for another company remotely. This job I love. I have been involved in influencer marketing, paid advertising, and organic growth. I enjoy engaging with customers and answering any questions they have. The only problem is this job does not pay well as it is only a contracted job (not full time), and I definitely cannot live on this alone. I do love this job, but the owner of the company has been getting extremely busy and does not have time to get back to me in a timely manner, which kind of ties my hands on doing things.

I am also creating a Snapchat paid advertising educational course for a company. This pays well but is also a short contracted job with an affiliate opportunity once launched.

While having jobs, I have also created an eCommerce store to figure that side of the internet out, ran a couple ad campaigns as short term contracted jobs, and created a website for a power washing business.

So now a little bit about me as a person.

I absolutely love customer engagement and have 3+ years in customer service. I love talking to people, figuring out what makes them tick, answering questions for them, etc... I am an extremely personable guy and I just love to help people out. I think that is why I like marketing and Social Media Managing so much. Creating a marketing plan to sell to people seems really easy to me as I have a decent EQ and can tell why people do certain things. Social Media Managing is just fun to me. I enjoy replying to people's comments and posts in a fun way. Also figuring out how to post a little outside the box to garner engagement. O, and I also love Public Speaking.

I am fairly tech savy. I have a good amount of knowledge in Social Media advertising within FB/IG/SC/Adwords, and I know my way around google analytics. I also know how to build eCommerce websites and manage them.

My hobbies include: Gaming, snowboarding, sports, and cars.

I also am getting married May 11th, so all this has kinda been piling up and I am now looking for some outside advice on a road to go down (my soon to be wife is completely supportive of anything I do). I would love to run my own business, but I am not sure where to start and what business to build. I am moving to the Midwest next January, so it would have to either be an online business, or something easily movable.

I am not looking for any ""get rich quick"" programs or any of that bullshit. I am just looking for some genuine advice as I feel a little lost.

**So my main question is this. What advice would you give me on a business I should start, or remote work I should look in to, and how should I go about accomplishing this? I am just completely out of ideas.**

Thanks in advance guys, I really appreciate it!",03Apr2019,1
619,"I’m a boy. Few days ago, I was just studying in my room and fell asleep without locking a door. I was wearing a skirt. My dad called for me I think and when I didn’t answer he just came in. I’m really light sleeper and I woke up almost immediately. He was standing there, frozen and just went out without saying a word. I haven’t talked to him for few days, He just drives me to school in the morning without saying a word. What should I do?",03Apr2019,1
620,"So this is kinda weird but I went to a strip club with a group of friends and we were all either drunk or tipsy. On the way in, I asked everybody not to video tape me inside and they said they wouldn't. Since it was my B-Day, they surprised me with a lap dance from one of the guys (we were all women in a male strip club). 3 of the girls taped it with their phones. It's understandable, like i said, we had been drinking.

The thought of anyone seeing that video is mortifying for me because I'm shy and it's definitely not the type of thing i would do. I asked all my friends to delete the videos. Two of them did right away. But one of them wouldn't. She tried to convince me it was no big deal and she said she needed the video because it was also her first time in a strip club. I had to bring this issue up to her on 3 separate occasions before she finally deleted the video (or at least said she did).

But it kind of bothers me that she kept dismissing my feelings and never apologized.  I've always been closer with her than the other two girls and they deleted their videos immediately, but she's one of my best friends and she didn't seem to care how embarrassing it was for me. Her excuse is that she was drunk but she wasn't drunk the 3 times i asked her to delete the video. She once told me I have a flaw as a friend because I forget that I made plans sometimes. And that's fair because I know that can be annoying. But I've never pointed out her flaws. I just feel like I don't have full resolution without an apology. But now that was so long ago and I don't know how to bring it back up. 

Do you think I'm making a big deal out of nothing? Or do you think I should bring it up to her and let her know how it made me feel in hopes I'll get an apology?",03Apr2019,1

625,"My best friend had me cat-sit and housesit for 5 days while she and her husband visited her her terminally ill dad in December. I was asked to obv feed the cats and interact with them and also run her broken furnace for about an hour each time so her pipes didn’t freeze. She said that it was overheating and it shut itself off after about an hour anyway and that would be enough. I said of course, YES, to this without a second thought knowing this trip would be very difficult for her in so many ways. She was already grieving her Dad knowing that he would pass soon. I was happy to be able to do something to help her in a situation one usually feels utterly helpless in. 

When I thought about the furnace component of the situation I internally questioned whether that would be safe to repeatedly run an almost 20-year-old furnace that was overheating. What if the safety mechanism stopped working? There are many combustibles in her garage. What if it caught on fire? I reasoned that it was more a fire hazard to run it than running small space heater, provided that there was nothing else in the room. So, I, put my newer, frequently used, ceramic space heater (with auto-shutoff) in a hallway with all the doors shut. I checked for smoke detector. There was one hardwired and functioning attached to the ceiling of this hallway. I let it run for about 6 hours to see if it could sustain the temperature of the home to keep pipes from freezing and it did. Their home is one level and not very big. It was getting below freezing at night that week but only to about 20 degrees which isnt actually terribly cold as far as freezing pipes (im told) 

I definitely knew I needed to text my friend soon about my concerns and let her know I decided to switch up the plan when i noticed something... a copy of the furnance maintenance request summary on their living room end table. I read it. I knew they called a repair company out to try to fix it and they were told that it was “totaled” so to speak, and just needed to be completely replaced. The form said that the unit was ‘EMMITTING 17 PPM OF CARBON MONOXIDE GAS. The owners were instructed not to run it and that it was shut off by the HVAC rep.’ 

I went cold. (Or was that the 55 degree house?) 

There was no Carbon Monoxide Detector anywhere . And just one smoke detector. Real cool, guys. I wondered “maybe this is such a tiny amount they werent worried about me?” Unbelievably, i happened to be dating an HVAC at the time. I texted and let him know the situation, what i had been asked to do, and asked “is that amout of Carbon Monoxide even dangerous? 

His response included several F-bombs. He said is was absolutely hazardous to human health and that the unit could only get worse (emit MORE Carbon monoxide) the more it was run and the more broken down it became. My friend is a social worker who visits homes to make sure that adults and children alike are safe, healthy and ensures that the adults are maintaining a safe home environment for their children and themselves. Could she really have thought this was a safe situation? She just completed her Masters in Social Work a couple years ago with flying colors and knows anything and everything Ive ever asked her about questions pertaining to social work. Its her full-time job and passion. She’s paid to know better than this. 

OK..... so I told myself she must not have known (perhaps her husband dealt with the maintenance rep?) So, I texted her to ask. SHE SAID YES SHE DID KNOW ABOUT THE CARBON MONOXIDE LEAK BUT SHE JUST DID NOT WANT HER PIPES TO FREEZE. I said, “actually your pipes freezing is not that big a deal when you, your bestie and cats are all dead from Carbon Monoxide poisoning” with laughing emojis (to soften the blow of course) Trying to keep it light. I love her...I wasn’t trying to lose my mind at her (esp in her state of being stressed out and grief-stricken) but Holy Hell. How could she do this to me? How could she not at least tell me? Let me be part of the decision whether that was something i was comfortable doing or not? 

I asked her, “you know about space heaters right? Lol. It’s a relatively safe option in a pinch if you take proper precautions, are running them when you are home, and limit the time that they are running unsupervised” She said YEAH WE HAVE SPACE HEATERS AND WE HAVE BEEN USING THEM. 

I wanted to ask if they were not even running the furnace themselves as I now suspected based on that.... but i didnt. i stopped wanting to find out upsetting stuff. So i stopped. Wow. First time for that.

I have not told her how upset about this i am but i have been wanting to. I scheduled a lunch with her super amazing Mom so I could ask for her help perhaps in talking to her. I lost my nerve and cancelled. Maybe that was “wrong?” But I am certainly worried about HER. I believe type of decision making is a slippery slope and someone could get hurt as a consequence. Is this all because of going through grief? Has she been hurt from Carbon Monoxide exposure herself and this is resulting in cognitive dysfuncion” Or was she just trying to get done what she needed done and didn’t realize that she was legitimately more concerned with the condition of her home than the health, safety and very life of her own best friend? I have run this by several other close friends and far and away the the top reaction to the question “if this happened or you what would you say to her?” is “Wow I wouldn’t even know where to begin”

Please help. Every time she texts me i have no desire to respond. Sometimes I do but I never want to. I have hung out with her since all this and have had a good time but am wrestling with the “who the F are you?” Question in the back of my mind. What would you say to her if you were me?

&amp;#x200B;

But lately my heart has been reminiscing on my first love from childhood. Back then he was my biggest crush since 6th to 11th grade. We used to be best friends early on and liked each other at one point but neither of us pursued anything in fear of ruining our friendship. Well we got older and drifted apart and he dated other girls and stopped showing romantic interest in me. However, I always loved him and back then I told myself I would always love him in the future. I thought I was being silly by saying that, but here I am at 24 years old and thinking about him still.

 I love him dearly and I thought to myself if he came to my door today and asked me to run away with him, I don't know that I could tell him no. I feel bad because since I have a fiance the answer should be an easy no. But I daydream and look at where he's at now and only think ""that could've been us"". I just have this great guilt I can't shake even though I know we'll never be together. Him already married with a kid, and me getting married soon enough.

628,"So there’s this girl that I will call Elizabeth, me and Elizabeth have been friends for years, best friends in fact, but a subtle amount of flirting has always remained, a huge majority of it comical, but before last year I periodically had crushes and feelings for her which I never pursued because she’s too close to me, our relationship is almost reminiscent of that of siblings at times, I couldn’t bring myself to approach her out of personal disgust and fear of rejection (she’s gorgeous, funny and much greater than she likes to believe she is).

However Elizabeth is far from a perfect person, she’s not well rounded and has suffered traumas like everybody else (parents marriage failed due to inconsolable differences and sour relationship), she suffers with complex emotions and struggles with her mental health in general, leading her to also experience failure in relationships, she keeps people at a distance, guards herself tightly, she’s quite self destructive as she continues to do things that make her feel horrible and shameful and in general effects her negatively but however she’s stubborn so even when she realises she needs to change she doesn’t take the initiative and stays on the same destructive path, this information is intended to give you a basis to form your opinions on.

MY MAIN ISSUE is that, she frequently participates in casual sex with multiple men (not in the same instance but she does see each of them) , I admittedly thinks it’s disgusting behaviour regardless of why she does it and it puts me off her in general, but my problem isn’t just that she does it, it’s the fact that it annoys me, I feel irritated, perplexed, and lost whenever I hear of it, I don’t feel like I like her or anything like that, but my friends that aren’t associated with her believe I harbour something for her, they try to convince me I like her because they “see it”.

I suppose what I’m asking for is your opinions on this, what you think I ought to do, whether or not you’ve experience something like this, I hope it was clear enough for you understand and I’m thankful for any response you give me.

Anyways, later on, I got called into the guidance office and the guidance counselor asked me if I got in, I said yes, I should have said no, and then they called MIT and they then called me down to tell me that I have been caught lying for and because I lied to a teacher, I will be kicked out of the NHS, I don't really care about being kicked out, I care more about my reputation. I have done a lot within my school, including a lot of school service, student council work, and I have represented my school at several international competitions.

I don't know where to begin, it feels like such a mess. Going to rant  a bit longer. 
Tomorrow I'm going to talk to a new landlord because I want to move, problem is my finances aren't in order. Well they are but I fucked up my records and I have no official backup, though I could easily pay the caution 5 times. 

How did I do that? It gets worse. Because I received a letter (don't want to get into detail here, it was not good at all should suffice) some time ago, I get full panic attacks since then when it comes to letters overall. I just panic whatever it is, simple advertisement, a bill, doesn't matter, I almost die because of panic. Now I went to therapy because of that but it took some time and in between.. Yeah. 

I paid my bills but got some overdue notices. So my record is a bit f... But I've got no debts, healthy sum on my account, still I tremble whenever I have to open a letter. 
I wanted to change it all and move, get a new mailbox and start again but, here it comes, my former landlord noticed the police (I owed him around 100$ because I forgot (=didn't read the letter) to adjust my automatical monthly payments. 

Of course this all escalated in two days and tomorrow I'm going to see my hopefully new landlord and if he's going to ask me about my former landlord or problems of mine I'm going to die.. Internally and externally. 
Also because a family member would guarantee for me and they don't know anything about this, made some fun about this letter problem of mine when I asked for help way back, only said ""should be no problem with your credit history, if not you can ask your former landlord for a letter of recommendation""

I just want to die. I fucked up so badly I wish a car is going to hit me tomorrow... I see no chance of getting the new place, also I fear my family will freak out.

643,"So I take an online math class at my local community college. I’m currently halfway through my Calculus semester course. A couple of weeks ago I found some work that was not listed on our syllabus and I tried to access it. Every time I tried to access it, it said that the quick-link did not work. I’ve updated my computer and downloaded everything necessary for the online class and it still does not work. I’ve also tried accessing the material on school computers and friends computers. The quick-link will not work for me.

So upon discovering this problem I emailed my teacher multiple times. She did not respond until about the third email and she said that it may be a plug in problem with my computer and to call the technology help center. I did this and the help center people opened the course page from their services and told me that the link does not even exist. I reported back to my professor telling her what the help center said. She only responded saying directly put the link into mymathlab (our homework/quiz website). But the mymathlab help center also told me the link does not exist and neither does the work the teacher has assigned. 

I am lost in what to do. The teacher is not helping much and is giving me full responses in what to do about the class work. The work has 12 problems, each being 100 points. If I am unable to complete this work by the end of the semester then I will fail the course. What should I do next? Email my professor again? Or contact someone higher up?

TLDR: I am unable to access my calculus course material and my teacher is not helping me. I’ve contacted two help centers and they each said it’s the teachers fault. What should I do?",03Apr2019,1
644,"So just for reference, I’m from a working class family. I’m a sophomore in college and I’m trying to finish school.

My dad told me at the beginning of the year not to worry about paying for it because he would set up a payment plan and take care of it. I have been helping him a little but I only have a minimum wage part time job so I couldn’t make much of a dent.

I just got word today that I cannot sign up for classes or housing next year because I am $3000 behind schedule on my payment plan. I don’t know what to do. I need money fast. I am willing to do anything as long as it’s not sex work, I just don’t know what’s out there.

646,"I’m stressing myself out trying to keep up with payments and having to pay for repairs. My car has been breaking down for over a year now and I have been making payments for a little over two years. I had a car for about a year when it started breaking down. It was small issues at first but they seemed to graduate. At this point, I’ve gotten a new starter, alternator, battery, full tune up, water pump, tires, and a few suspension parts. 

Today, my car shut off completely. Not while driving but it wouldn’t start leaving the store. I got a jump, it cut my car “on” but didn’t start it. I’ve used all of my paid “free” AAA roadside assistance and had to pay $90 to get it towed home. Not sure what the actual problem is yet nor what it will cost. My car payment is due next week. In this last year, I’ve called the company about 3 times to push my payment date back because I needed time to come up with extra funds. I was told last time, that was their last time accommodating. At one point, I had a savings, this car ate it up and I can’t seem to save for the life of me now. My credit isn’t what it used to be due to some bills getting behind. My car is making it almost impossible for me to keep up with my regular life. I don’t have help. Been on my own since 17, you’d think I’d learn something by now. The beginning of my car breaking down is when I lost a well paying job. I needed my car to transport the clients of the company. Haven’t had a solid good paying job since. Been doing restaurants, dog sitting, and plenty of other side gigs to try to make way without my car. 

I don’t want my car to get repod but I’m struggling with this car. Is there anything I can do about this or am I stuck with this car? I only have 9more payments left but I’m not even sure if I’ll have the next payment in time now. I don’t get paid before it’s due and had no intent on spending $90 to get it towed, I’m 23, the example of young and dumb. ",03Apr2019,1
647,"I'll try and keep this short. Just for the record, he's actually my flatmate, since we share an apartment together.

&amp;#x200B;

So he is an advocate, and I'm an actor. He works from home and prepares for court from home (he doesn't have an office, so he's around a lot). I am an actor, and as you know, the business is tough and income needs to be found at other sources. I've taken a job working for a company overseas where the hours are reversed, so I can do the job at night and still focus on doing my acting work during the day, as well as starring on the TV show I have a contract with. It fits in perfectly with my schedule. 

Here's the problem. The company I'm working for requires me to call people using VoIP, and since it's a night job, it is annoying my flatmate. Now I'm a very considerate person, and I understand calling people past a certain point at night is disturbing. I would be willing to go as far as saying that I have to leave the flat to continue making calls @ 11PM, maybe even 10PM if that's really an issue. 

I told him when I took the job that he needs to tell me if I'm disturbing him with my calls, and he said he will. The other night sent me a text message asking me to keep it down (even though he was in his room and could have easily just walked over to tell me in person) because he can hear every word I'm saying and he's scared that the neighbours are going to complain. 

This felt passive aggressive, but nevertheless I said sorry and I moved to my car where I can work in peace without disturbing him. The car work was only to finish off, and lasted about an hour or so. Now all of a sudden, he complained about me calling in the flat sooner as well, saying he can hear me and he's tired of hearing the monotonous voice, it's disturbing him. He said all of this in a text message again when I was in my car, since I left the flat out of decency early to allow him to prepare for a case he was working on. In his text, he said that me coming back into the apartment at 1PM at night is disturbing him, and he feels like an asshole for letting me work in my car. I went inside to talk to him in person about it. He also has an issue with me working in the apartment when he's not working, but just watching TV, saying his hearing is sharp and he can hear everything (I work in my room with the door closed). 

Now I'm forced to work in my car every night, but it's taking its toll. I can't do this for 6 hours 5 days a week. I at first said it's fine because it provided a solution to me so that I don't have to disturb him. The reason I can't go to a McDonald's or something is because I need access to fast WiFi, and we only have that at the apartment, so I sit in the car because it's still in range. 

My flatmate smokes cigarettes inside the flat when he's working, and it really bothers me. I feel it is extremely inconsiderate, but I've never said anything because he pays more rent than I do. He is doing me a favour, since that was the agreement when moving in. He knows I'm not earning a lot yet since acting is tough, so he offered to pay more, which I really appreciate. I am very grateful for this, but now that I have a job that can help out with paying the rent and so on, I need to have sufficient space to do it, and I can't keep doing it in my car since I feel like the quality of my work suffers. The company is also going to promote me to a better position soon where I will absolutely have to be working at a desk, so the car situation can't go on indefinitely, even if it was working (which it isn't). 

I don't know what to do here? Do I talk about it and tell him I am going to work in the apartment until a certain time? Do I move out and find a place to live by myself? Do I mention him smoking being inconsiderate? Please help. Am I the one in the wrong here?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - took a new job calling VoIP calling for company at night in another country as a way to make money. Flatmate says it bothers him, even at early hours such as 6PM. Now I have to work in my car to not disturb him. He also smokes cigarettes in the apartment, but I haven't said anything since he pays more rent than I do because we agreed to that when we moved in together. I can't keep working in my car. I can't go to a coffee shop since I need fast WiFi, and the car is still in range of our internet connection. What should I do?",03Apr2019,1
648,"I’m 19 and in my first year of community college. Most of my friends left and went to bigger colleges, and the friend group I used to have not only split up, but really doesn’t fit who I am anymore. I need new and better friends, how can I do this?

Let me explain a bit more about my situation. 
I have a “significant other”, and I’m content with almost everything about that relationship, but right now we can’t seem to get along. They also have a big family and friends and community and I don’t think they understand what I’m struggling with, and it seems like they don’t want me closer to them or their community, which is understandable but it still makes me sad :(
I asked them for advice on how to fix my situation and they just told me to change my outlook, and be more secure with myself. I like myself, things are going alright, but I have no one at all to share anything with, and no one shares anything with me. 

I don’t have siblings or close family members that I could get closer to, and I have no sense of community in where I live or what I do. My parents are old and already moved on from the part of their lives where they are really into being a family, so we never do anything together or find anything in common with each other. 

I start to feel like life is pointless, I never have anyone to help or talk to, no one ever calls me to tell me about something cool that happened to them, I never have anyone to call and tell cool stuff to. When I come home its always so empty and sad. 

Being in theatre is the only thing close to giving me that, but I don’t know how to break into any friend groups or make friends. I get along with and enjoy everyone, but after shows end I haven’t stayed friends with anyone. No one ever comes to my shows too, and after a while that starts to make me kinda sad. I work very hard to be in them, everyone else has family and friends that come to see the show, and bring them flowers and visit with them afterwards, I just sit there awkwardly. 

One person I am sorta friends with also doesn’t have any real friends, or friend group, except me, kinda. She relies mostly on her boyfriend for everything and I constantly feel used by her. They have petty fights every day and it’s always the same cycle, when we hang out I just feel like I’m there to feed her and sit with her while she yells at her boyfriend on the phone. She doesn’t have any real interests or hobbies, so this is all we do. On my birthday she bugged me for a ride from the airport, then tried to get me to come with her to meet a guy from work at the beach so it wasn’t weird. She gets frustrated with me when I am in a show or going to rehearsals but being busy like that is good for my mental state. She doesn’t ever come to my shows and complains when I’m in them because I’m not available. I don’t even want to see her anymore and I feel so guilty for that but I feel so used. 

I don’t want to be like her, I feel like she’s always trying to manipulate me and use me just because she is lonely. I want genuine friendships with people who bring stories and similar interests into my life, and I want to do the same for them.

Is there a way to make online friends based on similar interests and such? 
Is there a way to make friends in my life without bringing that desperation for it with me? It’s not fair to make friends just because I don’t have any, I don’t wanna use anyone, I’m a big believer that things should happen naturally, I just need something to do to help it along a bit. 
How do I fix my one friendship and have boundaries and still enjoy her company? 
Also, if this seems the way it does to me a lot, like there is nothing I can do for now, what are little coping habits I can try so that I am not sad? 

Thank you, any help is appreciated :)",03Apr2019,1
651,"during spring break a friend wanted to basically make a gossip girl type thing on Instagram she couldn’t make an account so I afforded to do it for her, big mistake. I told her I wanted nothing to do with it there it was use it how you would like to, she post a few things most of them pretty stupid like ""heard pErson V has fake Gucci"" then she targeted the most popular girl at school the girl saw and she snitched, she found out it was the friend and yuh. so during lunch today our 7th grade principal said this 
""it’s come to my attention that people are creating ""drama"" &amp; ""tea pages"" anyone who is found with one of these is getting expleded from the arts program and put in regionals"" 
I freaked the fuck out and had my mom pick me up early. The account has been deleted for a looong time now. She’s the only one snitching. Two other girls also made a tea account and posted about her she isn’t going after them. The principal said ""since its deleted were gonna track down the IP address"" I’m fucking panicking, was I wrong in this situation? I only made the account and wanted nothing to do with it. But  we also have people on my side who are trying to get her expleded for trying to start a fight between two boys and bullying a few people. Am I screwed?

This was just kids being curious. She is 15 now and is embarresed about it. Her parents did find out about it then.

654,"Don't you just love high school drama? 

Basically this kid used to date her months back until they broke up. We we're really close friends and he made her cut off all of her guy friends (including me) and would get pissed at her for the slightest thing involving a guy, generally controlling her and shit. Eventually it got to be to much for her and she realized her value as a human being and left him. He never got over her. 

This all happened months ago, and since then, he has been trying to talk to her and constantly harasses her. She has gone to the school about it but is always told ""If he does one more thing let us know and he will be punished"" but he never gets punished. Essentially the school is on his side. Every so often maybe 2-3 times a week he'll follow her to her class when I'm not around and bother her. She ignores him.

This past Friday, I got a DM from him sending me pictures of her (nudes but blocked out)  saying how she cheated on me the day after we got together and how she went over his house and they had sex, how she didn't want to leave him because she thought she was pregnant and just general bullshit like how they still talk even though I know she cut off all communication with him. I also know the ""going over his house"" thing isn't true either because her mom installed a tracker in her phone so she'd always know where she is and her mom absolutely hates him so she would be pissed off completely if she actually did that. I responded telling him that he needs to give up with the bull shit and lies and that I know that he's lying and to find himself and a girl that will love him and give him the world, because the girl I'm with isn't that girl anymore. This was my girlfriends breaking point and so she went to the school again on Monday about it. 

I was called into the office two different times and she was called down a lot too. Basically she told her psychologist about the screenshots that I had of our conversation and then this was bought to the Assistant Principals and it just spread around the office until they called me down to confirm. They argued against us saying how they can't do anything because he blocked the pictures out. They even lied to my girlfriend saying that me and him were arguing when I never saw him in the office at all. Essentially defending him TO THE MAX. They told her that he obviously loves her if he blocked out the pictures to protect her and basically said ""He's heartbroken"" and didn't do anything about it. Keep in mind this kid is not stupid and he didn't block out the pictures because he loves her, he blocked out the pictures because he knew what would happen if he didn't. They went through her phone to make sure she wasn't texting him and I wasn't being lied too and found nothing. He was let off completely free regardless of the countless warnings and constant harassing. 

The next day he posted on his snap chat (a friend of mine showed me) saying ""Nice try :)))))) so glad today feels like a Friday"" and another one of clown shoes saying that she should put these on and ""The office pulled an April fools on her"". The day after rumors are now spreading that broke up with her, he fucked her, she left me, she cheated on me, I cheated on her, she got suspended, none of which are true. And we know where they started, all by him. Today he posted on his snap about how she cheated on me and a few days back he posted about how he ""fucked another kids girl"" when he never did. We share the same 7th period and i heard him talking shit about me and starting more rumors. I heard my name and ""I don't know I heard it from _____"" I couldn't hear that part. 

In this situation I feel trapped because no matter what I do, he'll go to the office and get me or my girlfriend in trouble so I cant confront him, fight him, but I also cant completely ignore the situation without all of my friends turning on me because of the rumors. The school is even against us and on his side almost fully. Im treating this situation like a game of chess right now and I haven't done anything about it since besides talk to my girlfriend and a few trusted friends about it and completely ignore it other than that. Im not to sure what to do on how to end it since the schools on his side and I cant do anything without jeopardizing myself or my girlfriend.

TL:DR Ex boyfriend of girl I'm with constantly harasses and bothers her, we went to the school about it but they are completely on his side and will not punish him, started spreading rumors and cant do anything because of the schools side in this and i don't want my friends or my girlfriends friends to turn on me or her because of these rumors. What should I do?

655,"     There is a lot to unpack here and I’m not sure how to word it, so please bear with me.  My mom is in her mid-40s. I’m 19. My mom has always seemed a little off, but I’ve always just assumed it was drug use (she has a history).  I moved out when I was 17, we’ve had a very strained relationship ever since she found out I was gay. She held a knife in my face and said the devil was in me, but that’s another story. 
     Anyway, I went to visit her a few weeks ago. She started telling me all kinds of crazy things. That there was a monster that lived in the woods and toppled trees, and that it watched her sleep and that it comes into her house. That it leaves foot prints in the road. She showed me the footprints, they were just potholes.  She told me that voices have been telling her to do awful things like burn down her house. She showed me hundreds of pictures of herself on her phone that she swore wasn’t here, that it was her “mommy”.  There were pictures of small fires that she started on the coffee table. Burning dust and hair because it was “following her”. It really scared me, and broke my heart if I’m being honest. 
     Fast forward to about a week later. She drew a giant evil clown face on the wall. Then she said that the clown was coming to life and that it’s face was coming through the walls. She painted over it. Now she says that the “monster” is a tornado, and that she was struck by lightning. 
    Last week she told my aunt that a stain in her car seat was part of her soul. She started rubbing it to try to “get part of herself back”. 

These are only some of the things that have been going on, and I don’t know what to do to help her.  I asked her to go to a doctor, she refused. My uncles begged her to go to the hospital, she refused. What do I do?  If I don’t do anything and she hurts herself I’ll feel so guilty for not doing anything to help her.  What if it’s something genetic?  I don’t want to end up like this...any advice would be appreciated. Thank you. ",03Apr2019,2

658,"This is my first post here on Reddit. And it's mostly just me ranting I guess. 
So my bf and I are in a long distance relationship and we've been together for about a year. He never actually asked me out, just started calling me his gf and I went along because I liked him. 
I should mention here that I like him A LOT, and don't want to lose him. I mostly apologize when we fight even though he says really hurtful things. And he knows that he does. This is just to make y'all understand that I really do care for him and have compromised quite a bit to make this relationship work. We both have.
Problem is, I'm not physically attracted to him. I love everything else about him. He's pretty short, which is ok - but he's really overweight. Which makes him look really disproportionate. I keep nagging him about losing weight but after a while I started feeling bad and stopped. After that I suggested we both get healthy. And since then he's only been gaining weight. Its getting really hard for me to be attracted to him and more. 
And the fact that when we meet, which isn't very often - and he doesn't make ANY effort to look presentable doesn't help either. It annoys me that we don't meet so often, and when we do, he doesn't even bother brushing his hair. 
I've tried nagging him, I've tried convincing him to be healthy, I've tried for us to lose weight together. I don't want to tell him I'm not attracted to him and want him to lose some weight.

I decided to ask for some help/advices on Reddit since I keep making bad decisions in my life.
I will try not to be too long :
It has been a few months since I lost motivation in studying ( 4th year in college ) and completing any task pretty much.
And it all started by not being able to wake up early anymore, or more like, not having the motivation to leave my house anymore, unless being forced. So I started skipping, and staying home all day long, doing nothing, not able to study, avoiding any social interactions,...
It might sound like I am in depression, but I don't have any reasons to be depressed. I have a loving family and surroundings who support me, I passed my first period exams really well and made myself and my parents proud. I was really motivated a few month ago.
Now exams are coming in a month and I haven't opened my text books, haven't attended my lessons, haven't had social interactions, and haven't found the motivation to leave my bed yet, even though the stress is slowly devouring me.
I don't know what is happening to me, my parents are worried, and my body just doesn't want to do anything anymore.
So Here I am on reddit, trying to find some advices maybe? How to wake up early, get a bit more motivated,...Not sure myself

665,"So my mother has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD, depression, and anxiety. All my life she has had these problems, and when I was younger I don't think I realized it then. As I got older, and spent more time at friends houses and saw the dynamic between a lot of my friends and their moms, I noticed a big difference in how my mother was with me. My mom would sleep all day on and off, and she did not really clean or cook. My mom would really let the house go as far as cleaning. I would try to encourage her to clean and stuff, but it would turn into a big argument over how if I wanted it clean, then I should clean it. She rarely left the house. And one thing that made me feel really bad was the fact that she did not care to go to any of my events or ask about how I was doing in school. She did not come to take pictures of me at prom (as silly as it sounds), and in general I just felt like she did not care to invest in the many things I had going on. She would get mad at me when I went shopping with my other friend's moms, but yet never wanted to go when I invited her. Communication with my mom was nonexistent, and arguing with her was like arguing with a 13 year old. I wished for a relationship with my mother like my other friends had.

&amp;#x200B;

I slowly began to resent my mother because I did not understand why I had to have a mom like this. I began to feel like I was the parent and she was the child. I realize I should not be complaining, because at least I have my mother. Also I know now as I have grown older that she does have mental health issues and I am trying to be understanding, and I do lover her. (Please do not take this as I am ungrateful and not understanding of her conditions). Now I am in college and I still live at home. I try to be more understanding and helpful, but I still sometimes find myself longing for a mom that takes care of me and I could easily communicate with. I get frustrated with her sometimes and I feel bad for it afterwards. Maybe it would be better if  I moved out and we could have some distance. Sometimes I just wish things were different. Honestly I am just posting this to get it out of my system. If you have advice or have been through something similar please share. ",03Apr2019,1

669,"I'm a 20 year old girl. I finished high school, but haven't been to university. I liked school until the 5th grade, and learned everything, got perfect grades and talked to everyone. After that I started becoming more and more disorganized and forgot nearly everything I learnt.
I moved a lot. I lost interest in people because people start to talk about different stuff after they stop being kids. Most of the people talked about gossip, dating and alcohol/drugs/movies/books. I have barely finished any books, they put too much details and characters, I can't imagine/remember things. I just liked psychological anime and youtube, not a great way to make female friends where I live. 
In high school I even didn't attend for many days because I didn't like sitting for so long and not having anyone to talk to or anything to do besides studying. I didn't take studying seriously until the 11th grade and even then I didn't take it seriously enough. Even things I found interesting I wasn't motivated enough to study them. Party because of disorganisation(my notebooks were all a mess and I didn't know how to fix it).
I forget things a lot. My short term memory is terrible. People think I forget things because I don't care and I feel bad. I forget a lot of things important to myself too. 
This stuff took toll on my final exams in high school and my grades were average. The only thing I found some interest in was programming. I couldn't study it with those grades. I tried going to a course but there were too many people and guys (my high school was mostly girls), I didn't feel comfortable. Most people talked to someone and they helped each other with exercises and a lot of people were saying how things are ""too easy"". I think it's useful to hear different perspectives, tried talking to some girls there but it didn't work out, I felt I was supposed to ask them something but I didn't know what I could ask since they told me the basics. I went to the exam and did really bad.  I quit. I couldn't handle this anymore. Did the same exercises on my own a few months later after I found motivation and did them right a lot quicker then the exam would have finished. I had misunderstood the tasks so badly before. It was clear after I managed to concentrate properly.
But I don't know if I should really study this. Every job that's without a degree seems to require great social skills, business skills or unique ideas. Sometimes all of them. The problems I have that can be solved with programming I don't realize about until someone points them out. 
I live alone and work full-time. But I need a better paying job if I want to be independent, something where I can sit and work even at old age. ",03Apr2019,1
670,"My boyfriends birthday is coming up in a few months and I want to make a charcoal portrait of him and our new baby. 

However lately I’ve been considering if it’s a good or bad idea to instead  sketch his mother and our newborn daughter together. 

His mom passed away about 5 years ago when he was in his late teens. We are now in our early twenties and she died before him and I ever met. 

Anyways he doesn’t have any psychical photos of her and neither do his siblings, however he did show me her old Facebook and there are some very nice photos of her I can replicate. 

He is her youngest child and he mentioned to me once that he is sad because he is slowly forgetting what she looked like. She died prematurely before her time due to an terminal illness. 

Anyways before her unfortunate passing she took time to write only one letter only for him despite having many other surviving kids and family members. He did let me read the letter. 

So, I’m not sure. I obviously want it to be a surprise if I do sketch it out so I don’t want to ask him first but because I never actually met her I don’t want to make a mistake on her likeness. 

There are some very clear photos of her on her Facebook so I would just directly sketch one as it is shown. I don’t want to change anything about it. 

If it is a good idea, I would like to sketch our newborn sleeping and have his mom appear to be watching over her somehow. 

If it’s a bad idea I’ll just sketch something else for him. ",03Apr2019,1

672,"I have a great friend I value. Let's call him ""D"". He's a model of sorts and a very lively and outgoing character. Quite brutal in his opinions but that's why I love the guy, I guess. We both follow each other on twitter. He's quite the tweeter. He often tweets to his best mate ""J"" too, so they have alot of public back and forth on the platform. 

Anyway, I called D last week for a catchup. Things were going very well until it got to this point.

Me: Any plans for the weekend?
D: Well I'm going out in town at the weekend. Just myself I guess.
Me: Ah! Why don't you ask J to come with you? Keep you company?
D:... Ehhhhh
Me:... Huh?
D:.... Ehhhhh
Me:... Should I change the subject?
D:... Yeaaahhhh

I thought that him and J may have fell out. I was worried about the guy as they are quite tight. A little later I subtly asked him if he and J are OK? He just replied ""Yes"". And that was it.

At the weekend, I'm on twitter and a new post from D pops up. It read along the lines of ""Had a fab day out with J and everyone! Such a good day!"" I was relieved as it seemed like my fears were at rest.

Later, I messaged him to see how he was. I said I was thankful he had company at the weekend and things between him and J were still good. This is where it got messy.

Immediately, he jumped down my throat and started getting on at me for prying. 

Quote: ""Am I getting an ass kicking about keeping things to myself when I wish to? I dont know what mixed messages Im sending, I dont know what im supposed to be being vauge or not vauge about. Im not sure why my freinds should be an issue. Way to bum me out about a really good day with two friends. Im not gonna be made to feel like a peice of shit for making evasive noises when nervous about something""

Right now I feel pretty confused and shaken. D and me are not ""close"" as in BFF but he's a good acquaintance who I value. I really am worried if I said something or went too far in just showing concern for a good friend...

682,"I struggle to make friends, a lot.

I started using Meetup, I didn't really connect with anyone but there was a group that went to all the places I enjoy going so it was great just to have a decent social life again with opportunity to meet new people while out with them too.

A while after I joined a guy joined and he became a popular core member of the group very quickly.

I started dating this guy, it was intense and I got swept up in it, but he started becoming emotionally abusive - not severe, but that's because I wasn't just taking it, the result was arguments and eventually I called him out. He dumped me as soon as I pointed out his behaviour was abusive (his ex wife had apparently accused him of the same, he decided I was being flippant and he said he had a rule not to date anyone who accused him of emotional abuse again). 

So good riddens to him, but it meant losing that Meetup group too because he was so much part of that group - even if I could avoid nights where he was out it would have still felt like going out with his friends, I'd still not know what he'd told them, also two weeks after we broke up he started dating someone else in the group too. 

As well as losing this Meetup group, which was perfect for me in that they went all the places I like going...it also means problems going to to any of those places now. For one going anywhere alone makes me look like a pathetic loser (I've tried, it's horrible) but there's risk of running into my ex and running into that group while I'm on my own so I'd look like even more of a loser. I've been going to this same bar for twenty years, the club's are the only clubs I'd want to go to in town, I can't go to see any decent bands locally in case I run into this group. Meetup is also out of the question too because all the group's intermingle. 

It feels like he's 'won' which feels so desperately unfair when he was abusive to me, it's been eight months but I just can't make new friends let alone find a big group to go to these places to again. So it's loss of a social group but also loss of a social life, and in my thirties with my difficulty in making new friends it's not being dramatic to say it feels like the loss of my social life all together. 

I try to find new ways of meeting people to try to make new friends but I get nowhere with it.

He’s the best person that’s ever come into my life and he’s helped me with so many things that I’d never imagined anyone to help me with. We have the greatest connection ever. He’s been there in the absolute worst and best times 

He’s also been with two of my friends. We talk about everything together and lately he’s been saying how people like him but he can’t find the one he wants to spend the rest of his life with.

Last night him and I went out to a college party. We were both very drunk and I noticed he started to get sad so I told him let’s go to the outside area of the club. He was crying and he said, “I’m in love with you.” And I said “what? You’re not” and he said “of course I’m in love with you.” I said “but you’ve been with heaps of my friends I don’t understand..” and he said “because I could never be with you. It kills me that I’m not good enough for you. It kills me to see all these guys treat you like sh&amp;t. It kills me to see you get with all these guys.” And I said “you are good enough” to which he said “I’m not. I’m sorry I just couldn’t deal with this another second without telling you.” And he said “my entire family knows about you, my mum and mt dad hear about you all the time” . He proceeded to cry and so did I and then he got his mum to take him back home (to his family house and not on campus where he lives). 

The thing is, he is someone I could easily be with. I’ve held myself back from allowing myself to get those feelings for him (mostly, during the long holiday break when I was back at my hometown I realised how much I missed his presence etc and we were talking on social media everyday like usual).

My high school is *too* easy; I don't feel challenged and I don't learn anything. I only have three classes, but that still a good 5 hours of my day. It's a small school, there's some outstanding teachers, but a lot of the teachers have no fucking clue what they're doing. I just want to go to school, get an education, and go home, but every minute in school ticks by like an fucking hour. For much of the day, I simply have my headphones in trying to read whatever while the teacher's ""teaching"". It feels like every minute I'm there my finite time is being wasted. I try to make every minute productive, but with split-attention I can't really focus on anything. I get 2 - 3 pages done in a hour at school, while I could easily knock out 10 -15 at home with full concentration. There's only like 30 more days of high school left and I'm trying to make the most of it, but it still feels like forever.

This all however is part of a bigger problem. Since this year has began, I have so many regrets over the past three years of high school. I felt that I had so much potential and if I had gone to a different school, I might have fully been able to utilize my potential. Even though I had taken all the hardest classes, I feel like I was stuck in classes that were too slow. In hindsight, I feel stupid for not talking to my guidance counselor and making some arrangements for harder/college classes. But, for the last three years, I never had this feeling of existential dread of *wasting time* until now*.* I simply went with the flow and didn't really care. Maybe time-awareness and responsibility is part of maturing?

I know regret does nothing; I've read all about it but I can't seem to get rid of it. Part of it I think stems from jealously of others who went to another high school and had the opportunities and the competition that I didn't. I feel like I wasted my time in high school with the wrong people and classes. I feel as if I could have made a real impact on the world if I had the opportunities and the awareness to capture those opportunities. If you made it this far, thanks you already made me feel so much better by reading it.

And in the past few months , my brain has started to realize for itself that I'm truly never able to get myself to a better position. I've always hated myself and have struggled with my self worth.

693,"Hi! This is actually my first reddit post so I’m sorry if it’s a bit weirdly formatted or awkward but anyways. 
I started dating my current boyfriend two months ago, we’ve been best friends for several years and always acted like a couple but I had too much going on with school and family issues to want a committed relationship. Which he was always super supportive and understanding of! We’re officially “official” now which is great I’ve known since we were kids he was the guy I wanted to marry and we’ve talked about it a lot. But I just found out a few days ago he’s planning to propose on a trip we’re taking in July, which is really super fast and we’re both really young. Plus, I’ll be studying full time in college starting in fall (I’m working on my PhD) , he works full time plus he wants to start taking part time college classes and he’d like to move in with me (I currently have a roommate but we’re going out separate ways when our lease is up in September) I guess my question really is if there’s anyone who’s kind of been here before and their experience or advice with getting engaged/married young? 

 I’m really worried because he’s very family oriented and his parents are very involved with his life, but his father has made some really hurtful/rude comments about me which makes me really uncomfortable especially about getting engaged. And also as someone who has no biological family (I have close friends I refer to as family but I grew up in foster care and have no relationship with my parents or blood siblings) I’m uncomfortable with the idea of getting really involved with his family that have boundary issues (they just invite themselves over/in and feel like they have to give their opinions on everything we do) but maybe I’m just being dramatic? 

TL;dr My boyfriend and best friend of several years wants to get married but I’m nervous, with us both being young. He’s also very family oriented where as I grew up in foster care and I’m not a fan of his father, who makes rude and insulting comments as well as they have huge boundary issues. Kind of want advice from older couples who got married young and if they had regrets or wished they hadn’t, thanks! ",03Apr2019,1

So I come back and talk to the manger. He says no can do, only the boss could and he just left. I convinced him to call his boss and ask, I said I lived too far to come back a third day in a row. The conversation was in Hindi or something like that, sorry for my ignorance but main point is I couldn’t understand it, the manager hung up looked surprised and asked for my card. I asked him if I was getting a refund and he said yes. He put my card back in and had me sign another receipt and gave me one that said 50$ Refund. I asked where’d the 3ish dollars go and he said that was tax and he can’t give that back. No idea how refunds work I was just thrilled to be getting something back. Now this all happened an hour or two ago and I keep checking my account and I’ve yet to see it pop up. Now this could all be me being really really dumb and sorry if I am but I’m concerned that the money hasn’t come back yet. Is there anything I should be worried about?

I am a crippling procrastinator. No matter what I do, I end up watching Twitch streams or watching videos.

But nearly every day without fail I hit stop or snooze and drag myself back to bed almost unconsciously, telling myself I’ll hustle to the next alarm, which is obviously false it never works... But I do it every day! I don’t think of myself as a lazy person but the first 30 minutes of waking up is just so hard for me somehow.

699,Ok first off my a 17 year old male the girl is also 17. I’ve known this girl for about a year or so and we have the same group of friends so we hang out sometimes. A couple months ago prom started to be talked about. I never really cared about prom and didn’t think it was this mandatory thing that you had to go to but if somebody wanted to go with me that I liked I would go. I’ve always thought this girl was very attractive and was interested in her but she’s never really shown it back to me and if she has if seems like just something friendly. So any way she had a thing with a guy up until a couple weeks ago. At this time some people have had dates figured out. She this is why I’m thinking she could just need a date. A couple days after she and the guy ended she started to ask me why I wasn’t going to prom. I explained to her but last Saturday at a party she came up to me and said that she wants to go to prom with me if I ever decide I want to go. I told her I would go with her and she seemed pretty excited about. Later that night she Snapchated me and started conversations which continued for many days which then made me think she is interested in me. Then one day she mentioned me having a party after cause she knows my parents are pretty chill about that stuff. I saw this as a red flag and called her out on it and she swore she would never use me like that and she didn’t even think about that when she asked me. At some points I feel like she is just using me cause she needs a date or just wants an after party from me but that other points I feel that she is interested in me.

722,"Hello and welcome to the mess that will my post; I'm on my phone and will inevitably screw up the formatting and make some grammar/spelling errors. My apologies in advance.

Before I start, here's a little bit of information about me:
I'm an 18 year old male who lives in Germany. 
I consider myself a shit human being and thus won't blame anyone for thinking the same. 
I often claim to be mediocre at everything and good at nothing. This is not true, for I am usually worse than mediocre. 
I have no personality and adjust it to whoever I'm around. 
I'm lazy and probably very obnoxious to the people around me. They may not tell me this, but if I were someone else, I'd absolutely despise my current self. 
I procrastinate a lot, usually due to either my laziness or the problem I will get into after this introduction.
I'm self-absorbed, and will thus only really consider how things will impact me with only little regard for others.
And last but not least: I'm a prick who's about to drown in his disgusting self-pity, as you could probably tell by me making this post.

Let me just start by telling you that I have tried to become a better person many times, but I just can't keep it up, not much unlike how sending a dog to university won't suddenly make him smarter.
The issue at hand is that while I absolutely hate myself, I still enjoy life. I have friends and even a few close friends. 
But every now and then the inevitable happens: I, like probably most people, start feeling down. This happens for varying amounts of time; sometimes it lasts a day, other times it lasts up to two full weeks. I get demotivated and don't want to do anything; not because I'm being lazy again, but because it feels like there is no point to it. 
Go to school, get a job, marry a woman, get kids, raise said kids, die. That's life. Might as well die now, really. There is no meaning to that kind of dull existence.
I know that since I'll inevitably die I might as well enjoy it, and I'm trying to. But in this periods of feeling down it doesn't feel rewarding to be productive, and so I just lay in my bed hoping that I can just fall asleep and maybe never wake up and have to deal with anything ever again.

I know probably everyone has these periods where they just feel down and would rather not exist, but this is causing me to not study for tests and making me lose friends and I have no idea how to deal with it. 
I can't repair it when I'm not down anymore either; it's a never ending cycle that just keeps getting worse because the periods of being down just create worse circumstances, which in turn result in me feeling even worse in the next period of feeling down.


I am completely lost on what to do anymore. ",03Apr2019,1
724,"hey guys I’m 18 and I just got back all my college decisions. I applied as an art major and for the past year I’ve been working on my portfolio. I thought my work was good but after being rejected to so many art schools I’m not so sure anymore. My mom also paid a lot of money for me to take additional classes to improve my portfolio, so she is really disappointed that I did not get into the major art schools and programs I applied to. Being rejected made me feel like absolute shit and I feel that if I’m not good enough to get into competitive art colleges, being an artist in the real world would be even harder. This also made me super self conscious of my art and I keep on comparing myself to other people. 

Also, I’m not entirely sure if I even like art anymore. I’ve been really uninspired and unmotivated lately and don’t enjoy creating projects like I once did. I can’t tell if this is a sign that art is not for me or if I’m just in a really bad mental state. I’ve been feeling pretty depressed lately and it’s been hard for me to get up in the morning and just do something productive. In addition to this, I’ve been finding it really hard to take care of myself physically. I can’t help myself from sleeping late at night and don’t have any motivation to exercise.

725,"Hi friends,

This post could go on for a while, but I’ll try not to ramble on for too long about this. So on the very first day of high school, I met the person who would become my best friend for those four years (let’s call her Stella). For reference, I am 20(F) now, she is the same age as me, and we met seven years ago. Our friendship was always so strong, and it was truly as though the stars aligned for us to be in each other’s lives. We spent so much time together, and each other’s company never got stale. 

Things started to change when she went away to university, though. She became a lot more distant, physically of course, but also emotionally. She was never the greatest at communicating via text, but when she moved she became even worse at it. By the end of 2017, my mutual friend (let’s call her Amy) and I got fed up of Stella constantly blowing us off and essentially shoving us to the side for someone better, namely her new friends and roommates that occupied her time that we apparently were not worthy of. At the time, Amy and I stupidly thought it would be best if we flat-out started to ignore Stella, sort of in a give-her-her-own-medicine type of way. Foolish and childish, I know. The whole thing blew up when Stella finally confronted both of us and asked if anything was wrong, and I just snapped. Basically telling her about all this pent up emotion I had kept to myself, and in that moment it just all came out. In retrospect, I know I should’ve been honest with Stella from the beginning about how I felt hostility towards her for essentially forgetting about Amy and I back home, and I admitted this to her. 

Fast forward to last summer, Stella and I sat down and worked through our emotions the best way we could. We agreed to move forward with our friendship and just be open and honest about everything, and she promised to be better at communicating with me. This lasted a couple months, only for things to fall right back in the place they were in earlier. The kicker for me is that Amy has been able to rekindle her friendship with Stella, and she talks to me sometimes about things her and Stella have done, what Stella’s been up to, etc. This kills me inside. It makes me angry, because Amy was just as guilty as I was for when we ignored Stella on purpose. Yet Stella accepted Amy back into her life. As much as it pains me to admit, it does make me jealous. 

This whole situation fucks with me mentally almost every day. I’ve lost sleep over this, and have had nightmares; I haven’t had a nightmare since I was a child, so for me, this is a big deal. Over the years, I have become so invested in Stella and her family, and now it feels like they all hate me. It feels like I have tried everything I can to recover our friendship, but I’m the only one who’s still fighting for it, and that’s not fair to me. When my mom died last year, Stella wasn’t there for me at all. She still does not check in on me, or ask me how I’m doing. The last thing I said to her was a text in January asking if I could call her to catch up because I missed her, and she still hasn’t responded. Amy tells me about how her and Stella text all the time, so I know I’m just being ignored. I’d love to know if she wants to continue our friendship, but I’m not about to keep texting her after she didn’t respond to me asking for a simple phone call. For mental health’s sake, I have muted Stella’s social media accounts, as well as her family members that I have, so I don’t have to see them on my feed and get upset/angry. 

At this point, I’d like to move on and forget her, and everything having to do with her. I’ve already learned to live without her, and that has gotten easier over time. But I feel as though to truly be able to move on, I need to completely forget. I know this might sound unrealistic, like how can your brain just forget someone ever existed? But for anyone who knows what I’m talking about, or has been in a similar situation, what helped you to move on from close friendships that have expired? 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated! If you have made it to the end of my post, thank you. I hope you have a wonderful day ☺️",03Apr2019,1

728,"So there is quite a bit of backstory to what is going on, not my main account for obvious reasons. I don't really know where to start so I'll start from the beginning?

I am a (27M) in California, I split an apartment with a really close friend I worked 2 jobs and was going to school part time. 1st job is a Massage Therapist at a Spa Resort, 2nd job was like 2 days a week no big deal. I was pulling in almost $40,000 a year before school but I wanted to change fields to something more permanent like a Physical Therapist. My then girlfriend now fiance worked my schedule really well so I was able to handle everything fairly well nothing was really pressing me things were going good. Until two major things happened, 1. I decided to ask my GF to marry me (she said yes!) 2. Around the same time at my massage job I had a client accuse me of fingering her which I did not do because it would jeopardize my entire future, I would go to jail, nothing good could come from that. So a fuck ton of shit went down the police came to work that night and talked to me and her and my boss plus HR and what not (I was not arrested). My boss said a lot of good things about me and totally had my back, but now I'm unable to work there for the time being. I hired a lawyer but they still haven't even processed the paperwork for it and it has almost been 6 months so I had to move out of my apartment, I moved in with my fiance who lives with her mother in a super full house. I can't pick up any work as a Massage Therapist so now I'm making so little money its making me sick even though my fiance has a good job and we don't have to pay for rent I keep having to ask her for money. I started working an entry level job that pays $12 an hour and at first I was working a lot but its like apples and oranges compared to my other job and now I'm only working one day a week now so I'm looking for another job. Also I'm still going to school through all of this and manage to pass my first semester of college! BUT this is where things amp up, to get into this great/cheap Physical Therapist Assistant program that I would really love to get into. BUT I need to take four classes before May of this year, I'm in three right now, plus I need observational hours at a Physical Therapist clinic and my drive to school is about two hours both ways depending on traffic. My grades have now been slipping for like a month, just did a bit of math HW before I wrote this so that's a win for today. I don't know how to handle any of this, I'm trying to be this rock for my fiance while we plan our wedding and I don't want to worry her with  the fact that I can't seem to keep up on my studding. I can't seem to focus on anything for long periods of time, all I want to do is escape from school even though I do like going to school. I'm always so tired and exhausted, a lot of time during my drive to school I think about how much easier things would be if I just wasn't around anymore. I feel like shit and I don't feel like anything is going right. I wont take my life or try to disappear, I love my fiance and family too much to do that to them, plus I'm so excited to get married and have kids, make a whole new little family. I just need some help, I don't know if I should keep going forward in school and hope this stupid case is closed before they run a background check on me and find this accusation. Should I finish this semester and just work/save as much as possible for the wedding and such? All this is just pressing down on me and I don't know what to do.  ",03Apr2019,1

It just seems like everyone around me is moving around and going off far from home and starting to become adults.

My little sister is graduating high school and thinking about going further out in the state. She also has a similar job I had at Big Lots and is saving up a lot. My friends are already starting to get long standing jobs and I'm just now getting ready to graduate and go to another college to get my bachelor's. I also had to spend an extra year there than normal to get all my credits.

It just seems like everyone around knows what they're doing and is doing it while I'm still trying to figure out what's the next step for me. I have an idea of what I want to do but nothing concrete yet. Am I falling behind in life? ",03Apr2019,1

734,"Hey all. I'm a longtime musician, singer and songwriter. I'm 24 years old and I'm a waiter at a restaurant. It is my lifelong dream to be a musician/artist for a living and I've worked my whole life to make this dream a reality-- I've written songs since I was young and experienced some minor successes; I've released songs on the internet that have accrued thousands and thousands of plays on Spotify with no promotion, I've won battle of the bands at my University, and I've opened up for popular artists that I look up to. All this is to say that I know I have a degree of talent and I take this seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

At any rate-- about a week ago I got a new co-worker at the restaurant. We were in the back washing dishes, making small talk, when I mentioned I was a musician. She told me that she is too and that she's signed to the father of a popular local rapper, and that she gets paid to write songs for other artists. Naturally, I was interested, especially because the famous rapper makes music in a similar vein to mine. I talked to her a bit more about music before she was called away to work up front.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very interested in asking her for more info, for an audience with her employer, or at least getting my music in the ears of the people she works for-- how can I broach this subject with her tactfully without coming across as a user or a schmoozer?

My job has recently opened up a branch within a middle-sized city in Germany. I have applied for and been accepted at an open position there for what would be a minimum 1 year commitment and ideally--for them--two years; however, as the time comes nearer and nearer to making a final decision, I have become painfully indecisive as to whether or not I should actually go.  


What I want for myself is independence. Living in Germany for 1 - 2 years to me seems a form of temporary independence because when I return home I will be roughly in the same position, without an advanced degree, but with ""life experience"".   


Alternatively, if I stay, I can complete my degree sooner so that I can potentially achieve financial, and thus ""true"" independence. Moreover, if I were to stay, I would also seriously consider applying to other jobs so that I could potentially earn a higher wage and move out regardless.

I’m not sure if it’s just me or something environmental but I’m getting frustrated with several women in my office and the Midwest in general. I don’t have the same frustrations when I go home, out of state and even when I travel on vacation to NY or CA.

770,"Hi there! :)

As we all know, Avengers: Endgame is coming out later this month. For me, it releases on Thursday, April 25th. This past summer, I watched all of the MCU films with my sister, and we planned to watch Endgame in theaters upon release. **However:** Due to an extracurricular (we are both in HS), she will be leaving on Thursday for approx. a week, and coming back the next weekend, so we will no longer be able to watch in together upon its release. As I see it, this leaves me with two options:

1. Wait until she comes back to watch it for the first time. (**Disadvantage**: risk of getting it spoiled on social media or by overhearing conversations at school; I imagine Endgame will be discussed heavily throughout the following week)
2. Watch it alone upon its release, and watch it again when she returns. (**Disadvantage:** don't get to share experience of watching for first time/discussing.)

This isn't a super big deal or anything; she doesn't have a problem with me watching it alone. I would just appreciate Reddit's insight. Let me know what you think I should do or if there are other options I'm missing. Thanks :D",03Apr2019,0
771,"So, I'd assume I'm ""depressed."" I'm aware not all depression is noticeable like ""Wow I am sad."" or something of that nature. Literally all I want to do is work (I work 40-50 hours a week in a job I enjoy with good people) but after work, I just want to be a lazy fuck. I get two days off (which is rare in my field of work.) I have two dogs (one is a puppy that loves to run) and I recently purchased a firearm (a gun range is literally a mile from my house) but instead, my lazy ass just sits there. I've tried forcing myself and I just can't do it. I am not mentally strong. At all. I just don't know how to change it. I'm also a lard ass, so I'd love to go on walks with my wife &amp; dogs, but the mental drive just isn't there. I don't want to wait until I have a heartattack at a young age to be FORCED to change. I want to change now, but I'm weak. Any tips to jump start myself? Thanks in advance. ",03Apr2019,2
772,"I have everything I want. I'm getting physically healthy, I am done with my college degree, I am now living alone in a nice apartment. Things are GOOD!   


But I have Schizophrenia. And Depression. And everything is good in the mornings when I have things to do and things to distract me, but as the day goes on I get depressed, and I think of cutting myself, and by the end of the day EVERY day I'm contemplating slashing my wrists open and ending it all if I'm alone. 

  
It's like I can't stand to be by myself, if I am I get suicidal. I can't stand my own company. I get miserable. It's a nightmare every single day. And I only recently started living alone(like 2 weeks), so maybe it's that? Maybe I just need to adjust more to being by myself?

  
I cannot stress how awful this is. I'm so sad and so hurt and the symptoms of Schizophrenia aren't the worst part, those are managed ok with meds right now. The worst is the depression. I can't stand to be by myself in the afternoon/nights because I easily get suicidal.

Why am I SO unhappy and LONELY? Please help me before I off myself.",03Apr2019,1
773,"Long story short, I tried cleaning my ears with Q-tips, which created a massive blockage of ear wax, making me deaf. On top, I tried to remedy the problem by pouring warm water down my ear canal. The made things so much worse. So now, I'm deaf in both ears, on vacation in Thailand, with no way to fix this minor medical issue.
