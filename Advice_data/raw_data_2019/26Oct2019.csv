1,"I turned 25 this May and truly feel like I’m having a “quarter life crisis”. My job makes me feel completely soulless. I’m an accountant for a large national firm and I go to work everyday knowing that it has no purpose and feeling entirely unfulfilled. I have worked there for 3 years and was completely happy until somewhat recently. I just want to quit because the thought of working everyday makes me sick. 

I’ve been in a relationship for 4 years and recently have felt unfulfilled in that as well. I love my boyfriend more than anything but I am not happy with our relationship. We don’t talk we are barely intimate and he feels more like my best friend than life partner. I just returned from a work trip where I honestly became somewhat infatuated with a coworker. I think for no other reason than missing the conversation and excitement of being with a new person. I did not act on it but it made me feel like I would be better off breaking it off my LTR because I am not treating him fairly. 

I really just hate about every aspect of my life at the moment and I don’t understand why. I just started going to therapy but I felt like I needed to vent tonight. I’m not really sure what I’m looking for but I wish I could just run away and start over.",26Oct2019,5
2,"I feel like anyone who I consider a friend just puts up with me and in reality hates me despite saying they don’t, every time I try talking to the people I consider my best or better friends I always feel like they just want the conversation to end and for me to leave them alone and I can’t stop worrying about whether I should just stop bothering to talk to them especially since I always seem to be the one initiating a conversation and even if they do continue talking to me I always have trouble just talking to anyone, it’s gotten to the point where I haven’t been able to get more that 2-3 hours of sleep due to thinking about whether they really even care or not and it’s just starting to make everything worse. I genuinely don’t know what to do or if I’m just being an idiot and getting paranoid over nothing and just thinking my situation is bad even though other people have it a lot worse , any comment welcome I  don’t expect any though",26Oct2019,1
3,"I was chatting with this girl one night last year and I though we were hitting it off. She told me she had a boyfriend. It turned out he was in my friend group but not one of my friends if that makes sense. Anyway, that was fine, I didn't want to cause any drama. I still kinda thought she was cool though.

So long story short, her bf turned into a bit of a dick. He's really judgemental about everything everyone does and I can tell he secretly thinks he's better than everyone too. She went to study abroad recently and they broke up. She's gonna come back in the new year. I'm wondering if I should go for it because she's really cool and cute. Because of my friend group though, if anything happened I'd inevitably have to be in the same room as that guy at some point. 

Part of me wants to try because, as I said before, she is pretty hot and she's easy to talk to. Part of me also wants to get with her to spite the guy for being a dick. Should I try? Or would it be too messy?",26Oct2019,1
4,"I’ve recently found myself in a situation that I really don’t know how to get out of. I moved into our university dorms with a friend for my sophomore year. Me and my roommate/friend have one other friend (that lives in another dorm) that we would invite over to hangout occasionally. This was acceptable because we were all aware of who was coming and when. As time went on, my roommate began showing up with my friend at random times that I wasn’t aware of. At first, it was manageable but now it drives me crazy! I know that these are my friends but I really miss having the weekends to myself. Alone time is a must for me and I don’t know how to tell my friends to leave me alone! Advice?",26Oct2019,1
5,"I just got out of my first committed relationship and I cannot explain how badly I feel. More info, I'm M(15) and she is F(17) she says she needs time and that she had lost love but she still cares about me. I don't know what to do I feel absolutely awful I'm seeing a therapist this Wednesday which I don't know if I'll actually go to, I have a history of depression and suicidal thoughts, how do I get through this I need help elders of Reddit!",26Oct2019,1
6,"I use discord a lot but everyone in the servers I’m in ignores or bullies me.
I had some friends but I haven’t been good to them I think. They’ve ignored me recently and I’m starting to become depressed from extreme lack of socialisation. I have no friends IRL either so I want advice on making friends.",26Oct2019,2
7,"Just to preface this, I am a fairly liberal person in a strongly conservative family. My uncle is fairly vocal about his conservative stances and often makes jokes about liberals/Democrats (it's usually revolving around Fox News talking points). I'm typically quiet about my views partly because I've gotten very strong negative reactions from family for it. For example, about two years ago, I had vocalized my support for DACA and other programs and my parents threatened to put me out on my own (I was in college at the time) because they thought it would change my views to align more closely with theirs. Since then, I've been really cautious to really talk politics with any family. 

About a week ago, I was asked to take care of my uncle's cats and plants while they were out of town. I had told them that they didn't have to pay me, but they insisted that they do so. I had no issues with the job and everything turned out fine. When I got home today, I had received a letter from my uncle with the money. Inside the envelope was a receipt for the job with a bunch of deductions for taxes and fees attributed to each major Democrat in office or running for president. The comments were made in jest (he actually paid me fairly well), but my parents are pushing me to send him a reply with a witty political response of my own as well. While I am certainly going to thank him for paying me, I'm very hesitant to couple that with a political joke, especially when it's in context of the payee making a joke about the payer. I mentioned this hesitation with my parents, who scoffed about the matter and said that I am what's wrong with the world since nobody can joke about anything now. Am I wrong to feel this hesitation? Should I just say thanks and move on or should I try to extend this banter with my own remarks?",26Oct2019,1
8,"I was sitting in Spanish class minding my damn business while my crush was walking around and talking to people. The teacher told her to sit down and as she was going to her seat she whispered ""Hey sexy"" the girl she was talking to while walking around had  overheard this and commented on it, I, having just had my crush say I was ""sexy"" wasnt listening to anything else. Anyways, just needed to let this off my chest... Thanks if you give any advice",26Oct2019,1
9,"I can’t seem to be good enough for anything, not for sports, not smart enough, not skinny enough. I’m just the “pretty” one, the one guys use and take advantage of. I’m tired of living and my friends are hanging out today and like always I wasn’t invited",26Oct2019,1
10,"So I (F, 38) love my partner, we have been together for 10 years and I can't imagine a future without him. But I don't want to have sex with him, and I think about sex with women all the time. 

I have been with women previously and consider myself bisexual, but they've only been sexual relationships and even though they've fulfilled me more sexually than being with a man ever has, I felt that I didn't know how to be in a relationship with a woman, which I know sounds stupid. But I know how to be around men, like there is a part we play. Conforming to a social role i guess, and I feel really intimidated and out of my depth with women. And I get really nervous and weird and don't know what to do.

 But I think about being with women all the time, not just sexually, like being in a proper relationship with a woman. Like it feels like that is how it should be, but it also seems impossible. 

I was with my ex for 10 years too, and whilst with him I didn't want to sleep with him and thought about women all the time. I find my partner attractive, as in I think he's good looking but there is no desire, and I don't think there's been any desire with any men I've been with, after the first couple of times at least. Then the excitement goes and I'm going through the motions because I'm supposed to. 

Am I just unhappy and don't fancy my partner and fetishising women like a dick, or am I actually gay? And why do I find interaction with women in a romantic way so difficult and alien? I don't have this problem with men at all. 

I just feel like right now I'm missing something and like I'm not being me but I know that could be for any reason really. I dunno, I guess I was hoping someone who was gay might say it was like this for them. I don't have anyone to talk to, especially because I'm in a relationship. Sorry if this is A rambling mess. Even if I am gay, I guess its irrelevant because I couldn't do anything about it, but I still need to know.",26Oct2019,1

What possibilities does our future hold as mankind? I’m not so much worried for myself as I am for the rest of mankind. And I don’t know how do deal with this feeling. Nor do I know where it came from. I have a wife, and a good friend circle. And I’ve never talked about this with any of them out of fear that I’ll elicit the same worries in them.

Recently, a job came open back in my home state where I would be using my degree to its fullest potential and have opportunities for promotion. I applied and was asked to go interview.

16,"So, it’s college app season for me, and new freshmen have entered.

But, I’ve noticed **so many kids are such assholes,** including my close friends, and some of them are the top of the school or representatives. A lot of these kids are going to ivies or come from wealthy fams.

Ik people are generally bad, but what they’ve been doing is going beyond my view of society. I’ve been taught to be polite, and the adults in my life have done so as well.

**Problem**: When I greet acquaintances or friends, they feign eye contact and keep walking or ignore me.  They don’t greet others. When I greet, it’s saying “Good morning, X” and “Wazzup.”  It’s not something out of the ordinary, and with chummy friends, I’ll high-five or fist bump, but now, they don’t. **They think it’s gross or out of date?!**

Generally, these people are introverts, but also super arrogant (even if they have nothing to be proud of).

Sometimes when I’m talking or asking a question, they’ll just **LEAVE**. 

Like a hardworking friend (all A+) I hanged out for 6 years when he newly moved to my town, he will just leave the convo or take my phone to check how long SAT scores take to send to colleges without my permission.

Am I missing something? Does my district sucks? Or people are generally this rude? Ik high schoolers have it hard in their lives—stressed and lost, but I have never seen this degeneracy!

Tldr; high schoolers—friends or not—don’t respond when spoken, even for greetings, while leaving conversations whenever they feel like it and believing high-fives are too old-school. Is this how the world works?",26Oct2019,2
17,"To be simple and forward, I've never been in a relationship, nor have I really had a major crush before. I went and hung out with a friend of mine yesterday, and when I say hung out, I mean we spent over 8 hours hanging out. We went places like the mall, window shopping, card shops, getting breakfast and lunch together and just talking. I had been having thoughts but I'm really starting to crush on him and I'm not sure what to do, I'm so afraid of telling him and ruining our friendship as cliche as that sounds, I know he's bisexual like I am but I'm pretty sure he leans more twords women when it comes to dating.",26Oct2019,1
18,"She's been dropping hints that she wants to get back together and would break up with her boyfriend for me, but I've always told her not to do it, but she went ahead and did it anyways.

Though I'm very fond of her, I simply can't see myself getting into a relationship with her, if only out of respect for her ex (he gave us the go-ahead because he wants her to be happy, but I know he sure as hell isnt).",26Oct2019,1
19,"I am a 23 yo f and an only child. Growing up I always had an excellent relationship with my parents. We would do everything together and I always felt loved and supported by them. Throughout my life I have always had perfectionist tendencies and wanted to please my parents. Despite going through school with a 3.9 gpa, winning awards for my competitive dancing, and being very involved in community activities, I still always felt like I was going to disappoint my parents. Fast forward 20 some years- I came out to my parents as being queer and everything changed.

When I came out to my parents I was a sophomore in college and their reaction wasn't great but it was ok. For them they believed my sexuality was more of a phase and would eventually fade away. I had so much anxiety surronding my own sexuality, and my parents have always been nonconfrontational, so we didn't talk about my queerness for years. It was the biggest elephant in the room at every family occasion. My anxiety rose through the roof and I felt that I was keeping things from them and living a very fragmented life. For the first time in my life, I really felt like a huge disappointment to my parents.

Fast forward a little more, about 5 months ago I met my current girlfriend. She's great and I decided I wanted to share more of my life with her with my family, my mom in particular. So, I began to tell my mom bits and pieces about our relationship- mostly that I am happy and some information about my gf. My mom was always short in her replies (if she did reply) and was never engaged in the conversation whatsoever. Oftentimes when I would reach out to my mom about my gf (which was super hard and vulnerable for me to do), she wouldn't even reply to me at all. That particularly hurt me and damaged our relationship very much. Every time I would tell my mom I'm traveling to go visit my gf (we are long-distance) she would blatantly not reply to me or even acknowledge that I reached out to her. I know I'm an adult and not obligated to tell her these things, but I was really hoping to be more honest with her and visible with my relationship. But, her non-responsiveness is really hurting me. I'm sad and anxious all the time. I feel like her love is completely conditional. She will talk to me when it's about anything else aside from my relationship.

So basically I don't know what to do. Do I keep reaching out to my mom trying to be more honest- even if I just end up being hurt by her not responding? OR do I no longer communicate with her about my partner and feel the guilt of withholding the truth from her? I feel like its a lose-lose situation. I'm really struggling and need some other brains to help me out. Thanks in advance",26Oct2019,4
20,"Heres what happened. For my exam we are allow to bring in 1 page note and our lab journals that we submitted for marking before, no alterations. Before my final exam, I had an assessment in which we could bring notes so I printed out a bunch of lab manuals ,which later became summarised into my journal. 

For my final exam, I brought in the lab manuals I used for my assessment, so they are not the same as the one I submitted. I forgot they werent my journal, but an unsummarised mess.

During the exam, my examiner was suspicious of me for some reason and only asked me to submit my journal with my exam so he could check if it really was my original journal. The thing is it says we only have to submit our exam paper with the 1 page note we made. So since I got singled out and started feeling paranoid, I decided to not submit my journal like he asked me too because the other students didnt need to submit their journals, and just submitted my 1 page note and left.

Will I get in trouble? What things can I say to justify my actions or reduce any potential punishment?

P.S. i firmly believe the lab manuals I brought to the exam were way worse than my actual lab journal notes. Will I still be punished for bringing an inferior copy of my real notes? Can I use that fact to reduce punishment?",26Oct2019,1
21,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

22,"I'm 24 and have no kids, still in school (and also working a full time job), happy and stable relationship, but not financially positioned to care for another person. 

Lately I have just really, really wanted a baby. I didn't really notice how bad it was until my boyfriend pointed out that most of my dreams lately have been about having babies. 

I come from a ""non-traditional"" family where I spent a lot of time around babies. I spent my teen years sharing a bedroom with a baby. I have caught flying baby poop in my bare hands more times than I can count. I know what raising kids is like, I have no illusions, and I still want in!

I also had a traumatic experience with foster parenting in the last 5 years. My parents are foster parents who took in a child and were ready to adopt her, but then a distant blood relative decided they wanted her instead, starting sending us death threats and hired investigators to follow and harass us, eventually succeeded in getting the agency to move her into their home, where she drowned 6 months later after being left alone in a pool because people who pull that shit aren't fucking qualified to supervise 4 year old children. Foster care is amazing and important and everyone who is able to should consider it, but I am too traumatized to personally interact with that system again. 

I had a health experience in my younger years that have me feeling concerned that I might have trouble conceiving. I'm glad that infertility is becoming less taboo, but every time one of my friends opens up about how much trouble she had with getting/staying pregnant, I crack a little inside with fear.

My mom is a nurse midwife and in medium (not bad but not impressive) health. I really want her to be around for me when I do have kids.

And my boyfriend! He's such a delight. I've dated losers, I've dated great people, but this guy is ***it***. And he'll be such a great dad. But he's not ready, which is 1) fair and 2) totally correct. He's right. It's not time. I don't want to pressure him. It would be wrong to pressure him into something he's not comfortable with. It's also not an issue with him -- this is an issue with me. I'm the problem here. Neither of us is really ready, and I'm just not coping with it well.

One of the things that has me feeling the worst is the thought that I just might never be ""ready."" I'm trying to crunch the numbers and figure out how we can buy a house. I'm trying to make plans to get myself to a sustainable life as fast as possible. I don't know what choices to make. Do I go to grad school, take on student debt, delay a career for 2-3 more years, but hopefully end up in a place where I can find a very well-paying and satisfying part time job? Or do I skip grad school, start saving aggressively now, and risk having to work full time with kids? I keep feeling all of it stacked on top of itself -- I have to wait until I'm out of school, and then until I make X amount of money, and then until I have X amount of money saved, and then until I have a house, and then until I have X amount of money in my retirement account.... 

That seems like a good idea, but is it possible? Will I regret spending the next decade of my life just preparing for the thing that I want most? I'm so terrified that if I wait until I'm ""ready,"" I'll never be ready. There will never be a good or a perfect time. Life is always going to be happening, right? 

I know, logically, that this is not the time to have babies. But it hurts so much and I'm so anxious. And I just really, really want to have a baby at home right now. My heart aches and sometimes when I'm alone, I get teary about it. So what do I do now?",26Oct2019,6
23,"Me and my girlfriend has been dating for almost 3 years. Don’t get me wrong I love her but I’m just losing sexual attention to her. We have sex regularly but it isn’t that great. She never wants to try anything new and I’m always the one that has to initiate it. She does give me oral but most of the time she  always come up with a reason that she doesn’t want to and I end up doing it instead. It’s like I don’t want to force her to do something while we’re fixing to have sex because it’s a turn off. She doesn’t have a bad body but I find myself looking at other females because they’re thicker or have a little more weight, if you know what I mean.

I know that suicide is selfish and not the answer but I have serious trouble telling myself that especially when I start into one of my episodes.
Sometimes it gets really bad to the point it scares me. 
I’ve talked to therapists but it seems as though the therapists I talk to never have answers that work for me or they just want to institutionalize me for my suicidal ideation. 
Ive been hospitalized and it is a waste of time as I’m not looking to be medicated which is what most psyc wards offer. (In my opinion. I’m sure they work for some people but they make me feel crazy.)
I’m incredibly intelligent and I am able to look at my life from a distance until I get into a specific mindset then It feels impossible to get out.
Please anybody who cares I just want advice on what I can do to keep me out of that mindset. Coping techniques, meditation or even if you have been in this type of situation and just want to tell your story I’d love to hear it.

-harassment at work that resulted in leaving their job and becoming unemployed

-stolen car

This friend is diagnosed as bipolar on mood stabilizer medication. When they lost their rental abruptly, we decided to offer up a room in our house to come to live with us until the end of the year.

The friend was so grateful and excited at the time. But right before they moved in, we could tell they were hiding things from us (taking a last minute trip to LA during move in weekend but claiming it had been booked forever, etc.

This friend moved in and would only come home to sleep. Then they lost the key to our house and their behavior changed into only coming home for 2 hrs a day to shower and grab some things. Two days ago, this friend showed up at 11:30 pm, we talked, and they cried about feeling like they have no idea what they’re doing and being a mess.

28,"I ask this question because in my therapy session yesterday we discussed one of my biggest obstacles being me not being able to accept who I really am.  I went into therapy for feelings of loneliness, hopelessness, dwelling on missed opportunities and mistakes in my past.

I am 31 years old, never had a relationship, still a virgin, only 1 friend.  Lived in the same 3 mile radius my entire life, not really enjoying where I live (Chicago suburbs).

At the same time I like being alone.  I enjoy sitting at home watching youtube and netflix, reading about music/guitars, reading about paranormal stuff.  I've loved doing it ever since I was a kid.

In past sessions we talked about if I liked that I sat at home on the computer all night, throughout high school an college.....yes, I enjoyed it.   Did I ever have the urge to go to parties or clubs or hang out with classmates.....no not really, didn't really enjoy it the few times I did it.  I always enjoyed hanging out with friends at either their house or my house playing video games, etc.  Never enjoyed the large parties, etc.

So we determined that I did in fact do what I wanted to do in my life because if I wanted to do something different I probably would have done it.  I didn't not enjoy doing my isolating hobbies, etc.

The unfortunate consequence of that is that yes, there is a lack of relationships, lack of sexual experience, etc but those are consequences of the decisions I made.

We discussed me needing to first accept that I am the way I am.  I am a homebody that doesn't really go out much, enjoys isolating hobbies.  I'm not someone who thrives in the city life, with lots of stuff going on all the time, I prefer the quiet suburbs with the big space.  I don't like being in a cramped apartment, etc.

I am someone who has and continues to have trouble with dating, difficulty getting dates, even though I do work out and am fit, and dress well.  I will have a tough time finding someone, if I'm even ready for it.  I personally don't even know if I want a relationship because I've been alone for so long that I feel it would just piss me off to have to compromise for someone else.

I have a really tough time accepting this though.  I do want to have maybe some type of companionship.  I am afraid of settling down and buying a home here in Chicago/Illinois because I feel like I haven't explored anywhere else and I don't want to tie myself to extremely high property taxes, etc.

My therapist tells me these are things I might have to accept and that nothing is ever perfect.  Very real possibility that I will live here for most of my life because being near family is something important to me,  but I'm not sure whether that's because I am just too reliant on my parents, etc.

I'm questioning whether I prefer the suburbs only because I never experienced living in the city, even though I know for certain that living in an even smaller apartment than I am now, paying double or triple the rent is not going to make me happier.

I don't know.  Very tough times, and maybe I do need to learn to accept it, but it doesn't make it hurt any less.

I feel like it is giving up.

I was born in 1995 in Russia. I stayed there for 22 months, when I was adopted by my parents, because my sister (5 at the time) wanted a little brother. And no, I don't speak Russian. I was too young to remember anything. I lived in Connecticut for 10 years of my life, then my dad got a job in Virginia and we've lived here for the past 12 years.

As a kid I was stubborn, and my stubbornness sticks with me today, even though I am truly trying to rid myself of it and accept responsibilities that I may not enjoy. I played a lot outside, drew a lot, and had a best friend who lived down the street (quite literally as our street was a hill, even though my house at the time went downhill from the road). When moving I was stubborn about it. I didn't want to move, and said I wasn't going to. But I did anyway, because I realized I had no actual say in the matter and not because I was thinking of all the good it could do. I didn't like my parents because of this, but I have let go of these stupid emotions since.

I was taken to psychologists for about 2 years prior to my move, then after the move I was taken for a couple of months. These were where my resentment rooted itself. I hated going to sessions, and I avoided answering questions as much as possible. I thought to myself ""things will get better when I grow up and move out, I don't need to talk about how I feel now"". But I did, and now it's too late. During the sessions while I lived in Virginia my parents would trick me into going, because they knew I didn't want to. They would tell me that they were going for breakfast, and we did, but then we'd stop at the office. At one point I had caught on and while I did go out that morning, when we got to the office I simply refused to get out of the car. The psychiatrist came out of the building and tried talking to me that way, but still I remained stubborn as a stone wall. Built on a foundation of fear and hatred.

&amp;#x200B;

As a teenage my stubbornness only grew. It came to a point where I was refusing to do homework for school, not showering regularly, not eating at the dinner table with my family, refusing to do house chores (but I still had to do those even if I didn't want to). In high school, towards the end of the 4 years, talks of college came up frequently. I wanted to go to art school, or somewhere nice, but my parents kept persuading me to go somewhere local and not as expensive. I gave in, and went to a community college.

My dad did his best to raise me, by putting me through cub scouts, then boy scouts. I didn't like going sometimes, but most times I did. My father isn't a bad father, but after a certain while he stopped being in my life despite still living in the same house. I can't say I hate him, but I feel like he abandoned his responsibility to love me because, at the same time, I refused to accept love at all from anyone.

So, the problems that kept watering my tree of hate were ones that formed through the words and actions of my mother. I knew she was trying to do the best for me, but I was not performing the best for her. I know my potential, but at the time I also knew something was wrong with me. Mentally, I could not do my assignments. I couldn't focus enough to study. I couldn't perform well on tests and exams. I figured that there was a problem deeper than my stubbornness, but I felt weak and couldn't confront my parents about it or else it might get harder for me (which, doesn't make sense, but that's what I felt at the time). With her expectations being so high (aka if I had one C in a class she would reprimand me), I would cry a lot in my bedroom feeling like a failure. Feeling as if I had no future and I didn't want to live anymore. I used to contemplate suicide, but after I started to grow as an artist I realized it was pointless to consider such things. If I had something to offer to people, why kill myself? But at the time it didn't come fast enough. I was constantly in my bedroom, I hardly spoke to my parents, and when I tried to make light conversation they would always turn it into something they wanted me to fix. ""What about your grades? Have you thought about your career? Are you taking care of the car we're letting you borrow? When are you getting a girlfriend?"". Stuff like that, and that's the main reason I didn't enjoy talking to them.

&amp;#x200B;

2017 was the year things went south. I was having dinner with my mom, dad in the other room. School was a constant subject with her, and she asked me about my grades one last time. I finally shouted ""I'm moving out. With my boyfriend, Josh."" All she said, and I will never forget this, was ""good"". As if it didn't phase her. Like she didn't care what happened to me. But it's partially my fault too, for being a ghost under her roof and making her feel like I was never there anyway. Those months after that dinner were hell. I had no job, and my parents refused to feed me. They would go out to dinner and bring nothing back, and when they mad dinner at home they'd eat then finish without me. I would go without eating much each day, and I told my boyfriend at the time. Looking back on that time, I was stupid. Like, actually stupid for not making food myself because there clearly was enough in the house. During this time, since I had no job and no money, I had to have my ex pay for my credit card payments (which were $25 a month). It hurt me to have him do this, but I was still greatful he did it anyway. We moved in an apartment 40 miles from my parents' house.

In these 2 years I rarely talked to my family. Only for occassions that were basically obligations (but nothing as important as marriage or w/e). I avoided them because I was tired of them constantly bringing up things I hadn't done, or done improperly, or anything that made me feel awful about myself. I thought I was ready for a new beginning, to start healing and get somewhere in life. That was not the case. And in the past 2 years everything just went downhill. Got fired from 1 job, quit from the next, almost got involved with the police (thank god I didn't), and let my complacancy consume me. At one point, a month or two ago, I stopped eating for 2 months because there was no food in the place and the person who was letting me stay with him stopped bringing food. He was away 90% of the weeks. I gave up, and contacted my sister (the more rational of my family) and we talked and walked on a trail about the last 2 years and how to move forward. Then I confronted my mom and we talked about it too.

Now I'm back at square one. No job. No school. No money. Home again. This time, things are better though. I've resolved my conflicts with them, and they're helping me with job searches and figuring out the best educational track. I am actively working with them, not against them. But every time I say ""I love you"", it never feels sincere.

The main point I'm trying to make is, while I resent my mom for her high standards, and my dad for dropping the ball, it's not like I haven't had my fair share of problems.

&amp;#x200B;

But.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm saying now is that even though I can go through everything in my head detail by detail, knowing why everyone felt the way we did, nothing in my head tells me they deserve my love. And being aware of the problem doesn't suddenly make the problem go away. I just... I don't understand what I need to do, or what we as a family need to do to fix how I feel. Can it be fixed? Can I ever actually love them despite how they treated me?

When we talked, we didn't talk about all the stuff I mentioned up above. I never told her I didn't love her, or how I felt about how she treated me. I don't know if I can, because at this point I might get kicked out if I do. She is, and always has been, someone who makes mountains out of molehills. That's the main reason I can't tell her. I don't want to hurt her.

&amp;#x200B;

I need to ask; am I a cold person? Is my heart filled with hate? Am I a bad person? What the hell is wrong with me? Have I been damaged too much? Do I need to truly love her??? What is my responsibility as her child??? I can't figure anything out, and I don't know how to talk about this stuff with her, especially if it ends up not mattering and she cuts me out of the family.

38,"A girl in my class got out of her chair the other day and came at my AirPod with her hand. (Note: I am a guy) I was doing work on my computer and therefore did not have my full focus on her. But when she came close to my ear I threw my hand up (like shooing a fly away) because I had a ring on it left a small mark just at the pointy end of her right eyebrow. I defined didn’t intend to hurt her or come at her in a violent way and once it did happen she immediately excused herself and went to the bathroom. When she came back to the classroom I saw no blood and she appeared fine so I didn’t think too much of it and just kind of compartmentalised it for myself. 

However, she was extremely rude about and spun it as if I abused her (which I didn’t think was the case) and for 2 days she kept going on about it in that manner and got a lot of people mad at me who weren’t there to see that it was just a self defence instinct (in my opinion). Because she was very angry and wouldn’t listen to what I was saying I didn’t make a proper apology, however I did say I was sorry, which went over her head. 

Eventually this ended up in front of the head of student services (who is the person who deals with disciplinary action). I was taken out of class and I told the story from my perspective. He at first said it made sense however he would have to “verify it” (note she wasn’t at school on this day). Other people in the class said the same general story and I thought it would probably end up being ok. 

The next day she was at school and was interviewed by him, and then I was taken to be talked to in front of her. I made an apology because, in her words, “I just want to move on”. They then criticised my apology because I said that it was self defence and that “when a woman is involved it’s violence against women”. I let it go in the moment because if I got mad it would go nowhere, however, once she left I got a long talk about how I was disrespectful and I should have said it was ALL my fault from the very beginning.

He told me he would call my parents and tell them “the whole story” but what they told me was that he said I needed to be taught to not abuse women. I felt genuinely bad that she was hurt but I certainly was not going to let my own parents be told that. This is because my school has a lot of other guys who have a much more negative attitude than me when it comes to women, I am not a precedent for “abuse”, there are much worse things happening to girls at my school. I’m not a misogynistic person at all! I’ve always stood up against sexism at my school and felt really shitty that someone would say this about me. But maybe I am an abuser.

40,"I hit a deer about a month ago which of course damaged the front of my 2007 Mercury Mariner Hybrid.
Originally insurance requested that I take it to a shop to be tore down, then they would evaluate whether they were repairing or not. I fought that and got an agent to come evaluate my vehicle. They estimated it would be about $4500 in damages, not totalled at that point. I booked it in for repairs, the shop tore it down and found additional damage. Insurance has now decided it's a total loss. I knew this was a possibility being there can be hidden damage but insurance ensured me that the chances were slim. 
I now have a vehicle that isn't driveable because its tore down and a decision to make on what the freak to do. 
My dad has offered to fix it in his free time (hes a mechanic) but I'm not sure what the additional damages are to know if this is still possible. If it is, I can take the payout, buy back the vehicle and have my dad fix it for around $1700. 
I can also buy it from insurance and then sell it for parts or to someone privately. I put tires on it the day before the wreck, right now those are worth more than the buy back ironically. 
The other option is to let insurance have it, take the payout, get a loan and buy something around $12-15k. 
I have no debt other than $3k in student loans. I teach preschool and only bring home around $1900 a month though. Bill's average around $850 a month.

44,"Ok so I am 18 years old and go to college about an hour and 45 minutes away from my house. I live on residence there and am doing well in school so far. 

Over the summer I broke up with my girlfriend of a year and a half and within a few weeks got together with a different girl who i meld with much better then I even did with my girlfriend beforehand. We were not officially dating at the time just had little thing between us with no labels. 

On multiple occasions she has come to spend the weekend with me at my residence and at the apartment that her mom has in the same city. My parents have never known about these because I knew how they would react as they are incredibly strict about rules and girlfriends and such. 

I have told them multiple times that I am doing well in school, have maintained focus, and kept my relationship separate. Just over a week ago this girl and I made our relationship official and now it seems like my parents don’t trust me again. As soon as I flipped it to being something for real they figure all of my work is going to go out the window. 

Even something as small as hanging out with her for the day at the end of my reading week they are getting into a fuss about saying that I better be focused on school. 

I don’t know what to do because I’m getting sick of having them on my ass all the time when I am a legal adult and can do my own stuff without having their constant watch. I still want them to be in good spirits with me and my girlfriend however it’s becoming difficult.

46,"I (19F) have had this one guy (19M) in my life for the past 3 years. When we first met, I was a senior in high school and he was a junior in high school. We developed feelings for each other and thought about starting a relationship. However, he quickly minimized my feelings for him and said that I was too boring for him and decided to start a relationship with this other girl. I was devastated and this was a huge blow to my self esteem. Afterwards I immediately blocked him on everything, but about a year after, I wanted to see how he was doing, we sporadically talked over the next few years as we went through life and he went through relationships. He broke up with the girl he ditched me for and started dating another girl and they broke up.
After this, he comes to me and asks if he can get a second chance because he wonders what it would have been like if he never left me. He offers for me to come down to his school about an hour away from me. At first I decline. I say that I cannot trust him and don’t want to put myself through that again. He was obviously upset about it. The next week, I have a change of heart and drive down to see him. I spend most of the day with him and things seem to be great. At the end of the day, he says he can’t trust me because I didn’t go down the first time, and we are on two different life paths, and he just wants to be friends. I’m again hurt but I take it in stride and head back home. So I try to be friends with this guy but every time I text him (I always have to text first) he just seems so annoyed.

47,"I’ve been taking Spanish for three years and I’ve always been the top of the class. Last year, since everyone assumed I was smart and knew everything, they constantly asked me for help. I didn’t mind at first, but then more and more people started asking me/texting me. By the time finals week rolled around, I was getting 20+ requests a day for study help.

This year, since I didn’t want to go through all those annoying pleas for help, I decided to say no to everything so then people would get the idea that I’m not going to spend my own time helping them. Of course, if it’s something simple, that’s not a problem, but if it was something like “can you review my 10 page project for me”, I’d just politely say “You can ask Sr.  M for help, he knows more than I do.”

So around two weeks ago this girl (a senior, I’m a freshman), we’ll call her Ashley, asked, “Hey, what does acostarse mean?” Her textbook and notebook were sitting in front of her, both open. Our textbook has a list of all the vocab in it, and our teacher also makes us copy the vocab words down in her notebook. So Ashley was sitting there with two sources of information on her desk.

Personally, I was kind of annoyed by this, because I’d rather help if there was no textbook and notebook. I told her, “You can find the definition in your textbook or notebook, or just ask the teacher.”

Fast forward to the end of class. I’m out in the hallway when Ashley, on purpose, runs into me and kind of pushes me into the wall, then turns around and runs into me again back towards her friends. Her friends are all laughing.

I ignored it and kept on walking. But today (~two weeks later) she did it again, and I haven’t even talked to her since then. This time I turned around and said “dude, what the heck” and she and her friends started laughing, saying “who even says ‘dude’ anymore? That’s so old!”

So the title kinda sums it up, but I’m gonna go more into detail. (S= my crush F=my friend)

So I’m pretty sure I’m gay at this point, cuz I’m a girl and I’ve never found any guys sexually appealing. Sometimes I would find them a bit pretty but not pretty like I’d date them, you get the point.

And there’s this girl in my class who is not only out of my league and is straight, but also is hated by F. (They used to be friends and then F felt like she was in a toxic relationship so she broke up with her)

I used to find S annoying for a while, even though I always found her kinda pretty. (I knew her since 1st grade and even back then I still thought she was really pretty) I never thought that I’d ever like her.

But recently she’s been becoming kinder and funnier, and she sits next to me in English. f and one of her other friends were also at our table. They would talk crap about her in front of her face and pretend like they weren’t talking about her (it was very obvious) and I felt really bad for her so I would sorta try to side with her, cuz her friends weren’t at our table and there was no one to defend her. And sometimes I would try to talk with her, and we would actually kinda but not that much, get along. I don’t know how but we were talking and we came along the topic of who would be on who’s funeral. And S said that she’d be at my funeral (even tho we’re not that close) and that she’d miss me a lot. She said that while putting her hands on my shoulders, I started laughing and I said I’d do the same.

I couldn’t stop thinking about that one moment.

I want to talk to someone about this, I can’t tell my therapist nor my family or friends. (I have very few friends who are ok with this but most of them hate S so I feel like they’d judge me if I told them and I just don’t think I’m ready to tell them)

 now, this friend has been asking for money through venmo for the past few days. he just requested some today and i texted him asking why he keeps asking. he  basically just says, “it was more than we expected, but thanks for helping out.” i tell him that i don’t mind helping out but im not just a money lender and then explain that the insurance money was supposed to be for me and my future and i don’t want to screw that up and to keep the money asking to a minimum. he understood and then said “that’s all for this month”. 

how do i tell this guy to stop asking for money without sounding like a prick? like i said i don’t mind helping out but it just seems excessive at this point and i don’t want to be taken advantage of.",26Oct2019,189

I'm 17 and I have been pretty much cursed with deep set eyes since a young age. The appearance of my deep set eyes always made me feel horrible and I was often teased for it. I never showed much interest at makeup as I felt like it did nothing for me at all,everything looked pretty much the same. I recall me going to theatre camp several years back and having pictures taken some of the adult ladies there did our makeup. I Remember me going to the bathroom stunned feeling like a fairy godmother just waved her magic wand and fixed what I hated the most about my face.

I wanted to try...but I had no idea where to start my mother sorta helped but at the same time wasn't helpful. I ended up feeling discusted with makeup I felt like it made my skin tone look darker than it was which made me look even  more ugly, I could still see the darkness of my deep set eyes still. I hated it so much and I kept trying until I never wanted to try it ever again.

Until now. I really wanna learn but I have no idea what all I would need and how much it would cost. I have no idea where to start and what works the only thing I have that is any good from my first attempt is a brush set some pencil face concealer thingies that my mom got me this year  ( 3 pencils.)  I tried them and it makes my face look really chalky  and it works but not that great...unless I'm doing it wrong.

Please help me.",26Oct2019,1
65,"Last Friday (10/18/19) I heard sirens sometime around the middle of the day, I didn’t think much of it at the time although I live in a rural neighborhood and those type of occurrences are quite rare. I went on about my day and later in the afternoon went outside and there where a TON of police vehicles at my neighbors house. Local law enforcement along with unmarked SUV’s and Vans with the windows blacked out.

We tried to enquirer with one of the officers what was going on and where told that it was an open investigation and that they could not share any information. Sense then we have been searching arrest records with the sheriffs department, crimemaps, etc. And there seems to be no public record of what occurred there.

My feeling is that the sirens I heard earlier in the day where an ambulance, and the police vehicles came in silently afterwards. Sense last Friday there have been more unmarked SUV’s and vans coming and going and lights on in the house at night. As if they are still investigating the scene.

I never meet the people occupying the house, the house is a rental and the previous residents moved out a few month back. A handful of young men moved in afterwards, they where quite obnoxious to the other residents of the neighborhood, through loud parties all the time and riding dirt bikes through the neighborhood. We would hear fights break out quite regularly, etc.

Can anyone shed some light on what might have happened or how I can find police records? This is a quiet neighborhood with a lot of children, including my own. I would like to know what happened here and file a complaint with the rental company so they will vet their renters better.",26Oct2019,1

my aunt recently moved back into town and was talking with me and my older sisters recently, disclosing my older brother be cause he can’t give birth. She was talking to us about how she wanted us to have one child of our own in her/our life time.
Here’s the kicker, I’m a trans male and haven’t opened up to my family yet about it, only one of my siblings knows and she’s, another kicker, is a full fledged lesbian and proud of it, (also doesn’t want kids) though also hasn’t told the family.
So do I tell them I’m trans and as well don’t plan on having kids, I’m not the maternal type anyways, or do I vanish out of their lives when I’m of age to legally do so? 
I do care about my family, but I know they won’t accept me. And I’ve pondered about leaving for a long while to just get freedom and reprieve from my family members.

Anyways we decided to go out today to get some lunch at this diner. He’s acting so nice and like all signs show that he wants to pursue us. So I’m so confused as to why he doesn’t answer my texts.

And I’m not saying like he doesn’t text back right away... NO he doesn’t text back the entire d a y. Maybe at 11 when I’m already asleep. 

I’m not going to ask him because I just don’t wanna be that person. But has anyone been through something like this? Do you know why some people do this? Does he actually like me or??",26Oct2019,1

77,"I’m a sophomore in high school (male) 


Me and my cousin go to the same high school, and we’re good friends. When I started at this school last year, me and my cousin didn’t have other friends, and since my cousin is anti social, she didn’t try and make other friends. I met a pretty cool group of kids and we came to be good friends. But I became really really good friends with one of them, probably my best friend at my school. Me and him started to talk to each other and hang out. My cousin still didn’t have many friends, so she usually tagged along with my and my friend. She still wasn’t really part of the dynamic, and she didn’t really talk to my friend all that much. This year, they did start to talk more. And it became us 3, always hanging out together. I had a sleepover with a couple friends, and my cousin and friend were there. I’m pretty sure that my friend caught feelings for my cousin at the sleepover, and she felt the same way. They started to date, and didn’t even tell me about it. I found out about a month later from another friend. I was still pretty chill about it and it didn’t feel like a big deal. However, as the weeks have gone on, I’ve noticed some stuff. When we eat hangout or do really anything, they whisper to each other and when I ask what they’re talking about, they just shrug it off and move on. I still understood, there’s obviously some stuff they don’t wanna tell me. They’ve only been dating for about 2 months, and all the stuff we used to do together, they’ve started to do without me. We almost always hang out at someone’s house on Friday, and when I asked who’s house we were hanging out at on Friday, my friend said he couldn’t this week. Today’s Friday and I asked him why he couldn’t hang out today, he said he had family stuff. I just found out they’re hanging out at my cousins house. Even that is still understandable, they wanna have some alone time, but they went roller skating with other friends who my cousin doesn’t even know, and didn’t invite me. When I approach them after school, they just say bye and run off. This really sucks. I didn’t think that relationships really destroyed friendships, guess I was wrong. What should I do, how do I get things back to normal without them breaking up? because I truly love them and want them to be happy. :(",26Oct2019,1

80,"Hey,

So long story short, I was enrolled at a university for a month and a half before I decided to withdraw due to financial reasons as well as not feeling at home at the school. 

The one aspect I actually liked about the school was the radio club. I met the members and got along really well. Though I only hung out with them twice before leaving.

I eventually left the state and went back to my home state 1,500 miles away, thinking I’d probably never get invited to hang out with them again, or invited to work on field projects outside of the school.

However, a few weeks ago, I got an invite to a Halloween party they’re hosting. I asked if it was ok to come considering I’m no longer in the school and they enthusiastically said yes. Here’s the trying though, they don’t know I’m 1,500 miles away as I had told them I’m gonna stay in the area (which I thought I would at the time).

Right now, I have three or so months until my next semester of college starts at another school, and since I had a falling out with my friends where I live now, I kind of wanted to fly in for the party. However, I feel so mixed about this. It just feels really sad and pathetic on a certain level, like, flying out 1,500 miles just to go to a Halloween party with people who are mainly acquaintances. I’ve kind of rationalized this by telling myself I’m going to continue to reside out there in the hopes that this party might blossom friendships/social life and/or let me get radio experience with them on their projects. Rent won’t be cheap, and I’ll have to get a job (either way really). It just feels weird going to a party and coming home from out of state. I really don’t want to admit to them that I went through these lengths to go to the party. Plus it’s a costume party, and just the thought of shopping for a costume in this context makes me cringe.

So, in all honesty, does going out there for this seem cringe/sad? Or am I crazy? I’m not sure if I should bail or not.

Again honesty is appreciated.

Thanks!",26Oct2019,5

My BF (m25) and I (f23) let my dad move in with us a year and a half ago. He is a very heavy drinker and it’s taking a huge toll on myself and my relationship. 

I feel like I don’t belong in my own home. I keep to myself in my room because he sits in the living room all day drinking and I don’t want to see it. He trashes the place while intoxicated and recently has started slipping on paying rent. 

My dad does not make enough money to support himself so I can’t ask him to move out.  I also worry about his safety while living alone. I have tried talking to him about it but nothing ever sticks. He promises to cut down but by the next day or so he is back at it. There was never a set deadline, but it was always the plan for him to stay a few months to get on his feet, then find a room mate or his own place and move out. 

I am at the end of my rope. I’m tired of seeing him like this. I’m tired of watching him kill himself. I’m tired of not feeling safe in my own home. I don’t know what to do. I don’t see any option but to let him stay?

 I am not physically disfigured or scared in any way, the operation was successful, however did leave me with a cross bite/crooked smile. Since then I sub conciousesly hide my actual smile in most pictures or most face to face interactions and substitute it with a grin or quick laughter. Rarely does it resemble a smile that doesn't look ""awkwardly forced"" or ""fake"". This is something my close friends have told me so it's not my opinion alone.

86,"I just am disinterested in everything and it kills my ability to have a stable life. I don't have any hobbies that I can maintain or do for more than a little while.

88,"So at count I have four friends. Two I get along with well and I feel comfortable in confiding in them. The third I have fun with but wouldn't see him as more than a play mate, since he's just too immature. And the fourth, I feel I could trust. But honestly, he is just too emotionally dull to know what to do. He means well though. So anyways, the first two friends, I hold close to my heart. That doesn't mean the other two aren't important to me, but yea. 

So the problem is that the two friends I feel I can trust, are *never* around. You might be thinking that they're just busy. And yea, I'm sure they are. But this has been going on for about two months. It's gotten to the point where everyone else talked about it. ""Where are X and Y? They're never around anymore.""

So a couple of times I talked to one of them about it. In short, he's depressed and isolating himself. I have a lot of experience in that specific thing, so I told him that he should do his best to stick around with his friends, because having fun with his friends is the best way to get out of that depression.

He's still not around. And when I went through my own bout of isolation, he and everyone else kinda forgot about me. So honestly I don't have much patience for him, as horrible as that sounds. I just don't have it in me to keep him from locking himself up in his room.

As for person number two, he has sorta become obsessed with person number one. When person one began isolating himself, person two came to me wondering where the hell he went. I told him that we have to let him come back on his own. Honestly he was the only person keeping person two here, so now he's gone as well.

That's half of my friends gone. It really hurts to lose them. Obviously their choices are their own, and I have to accept it. But I am almost positive I cannot make new friends. I'm just socially awkward and introverted to the point where I am actually in the middle of isolating myself for over a year.

So I guess to sum it all up, we're all a bunch of damaged little things that don't know what to do. They're both just going their own ways and I really don't want to lose them. But maybe I'm being possessive. Or maybe these are valid problems to have, I don't know. I know this has come off as one big rambling clusterfuck, but there's so much context that I can't even begin to make it all make sense on a single reddit post.

Does anybody have any advice?",26Oct2019,1

95,"So my roommate’s birthday party is tomorrow. It’s at our apartment. One person who is invited was someone I tried to cut out of my life entirely. To give a very short version of what happened:

In college my ex cheated and then dumped me for her. She didn’t know my side and he told her a lie so I wasn’t super mad at her. She did some other inconsiderate things, though, like leaving me alone in a shady area at night to hang out with him (before they were even dating while he and I were still together), and canceling on projects at the last minute. They broke up after a month, and we were in a group project together, and I ended up talking about what happened. We grew close and I supported her. Then she went out of her way to start dating him again. She knew why he meant so much to me and still betrayed our friendship, and expected me to be okay with it. She would continue to do inconsiderate things like talk about him kissing her while I was just trying to enjoy my birthday, make out with him while we were in class and trying to be professional, pulling out my bra strap in public (long story short I have CPTSD and she knows, but still did it and it started to trigger me). He dumped her for someone else and college ended. I stopped talking to both of them. He eventually apologized and I said it was appreciated although I didn’t trust him. 

She, on the other hand, only bothered to say anything when she found out I was moving in with her (at the time) best friends. She sent me a message saying she was willing to talk and complimented me, but never actually apologized. In public we’d see each other and mutually not say anything, but the SECOND my roommates saw us near each other she would go “OH MY GOSH HEY! I HAVENT SEEN YOU IN FOREVER!” She has stayed the night several times, and every time was a nightmare for me.

The first time she faked being drunk (I only saw her for a minute so I assumed it was real and didn’t complain thinking she was going to pass out and didn’t want her getting hurt) then spread rumors about me by saying I forced her to go into my roommates room, when in reality my roommate calmly asked her to go into her room without me even requesting it.

The other time I was inside for about five seconds and she already was making comments. So I packed my bag, finally posted about some things that happened online (without naming names) and left. 

The third time my roommate just got mad at me because I wasn’t happy, but she apologized for snapping at me.  

Now with this party coming up, they’re no longer best friends, but she still invited her to be nice. She’s coming, and I don’t know the best way to cope with it. I don’t want to start drama because it’s my roommates birthday and she deserves to be happy on her b day. If we were able to just stay away from each other it would probably be NBD despite the fact even being around her gives me some level of nervousness.  But knowing her, she’s going to try to talk to me and probably start something or turn the story around if I finally snap and say I’m not interested in talking to her. I have posted about it online,so at least the people who have seen it if she says something to them I can say “she was the main person I was talking about.” But I don’t want it to have to come to that. Not on my roommate’s birthday. So, what advice do you have for how I can cope with having someone who I actually HATE in my apartment?

99,"i found a car from the 70s on craigslist and i even went to go look at it in person. it’s very nice but has some paint flaws and the seats are like 4/10. it costs $2k, plus an extra $200 that i already gave this dude to hold it for a couple of days and change the title over to us. he said he’d change the title the next day, but ive contacted him 2 days after we met up and he said he hasn’t gone to the dmv yet.

it wasn’t sus at all at first, but this dude does not seem like the type to drive this car. he had the latest iphone and yeezys and a big ass truck, and was selling a little beat up car 40+ years old. the ad said it was given to him, but like.... really? he took it for a test drive with my dad, and my dad said he didn’t even know how to drive it, so he obviously isn’t too invested in it and just wants to sell it fast.

ok so the guy hasn’t gone to the dmv, and my dad brings up how it might have fees due since (i literally do not know anything about cars sorry) the little sticker thingy on the license plate hasn’t been up to date in 22 years. my dad said he’s probably just trying to make a quick buck and sell anyone a car with higher dmv fees than the value. we did bring it up when we met, and the guy said “oh no the original owner took care of it and it doesn’t have fees, the dmv knows the car isn’t being used” does this mean it’s titled salvaged or something and can’t be used? i know it’s harder to drive a car titled salvaged here since im in california.

man i got kinda sad when my dad started bringing up how suspicious this whole thing is, because i really liked it but even i was a little anxious about it. i searched up the guys phone number and he’s on other car websites and has apparently sold other old cars. i don’t know if this is suspicious or not.

anyway, what do you think? part of me wants to believe it’s not a scam and the guy just doesn’t know much about older cars, but i know it’s probably true and im gonna get fucked over tomorrow. we want to tell the dude to change the title since we already paid him and let him deal with fees if there are any, but im worried he’s gonna get slightly offended and just say he doesn’t wanna sell it to us anymore. plus he showed us like 13 other text messages of people trying to buy it. so, do i buy it? is it sus? do i tell him to wait and change the title himself? how should i even tell him?",26Oct2019,1
100,"This is a bit difficult to say, mostly because i'm only 16 years old and this has happened in a relatively short period of time.

I'll say that this year has been a pretty difficult one. I discovered that i like women and men equally (i'm bi, apparently) and i fell in love with this closeted insecure guy.
So this guy and i are closeted, i believe he is also bi but idk. The problem is that we both know we like each other but neither of us will say anything.

However, this is not the main topic i'm going to talk about.
Let's start saying that i've been dealing with anxiety and porn addiction since i was 12, so it's been 4 years hooked up with both.

Now when i falled in love with this guy my anxiety and PMO addiction skyrocketed, and my self steem decreased. Also, my family has had an horrible financial situation since May and we lost our house due a corrupt deal my uncle made in 2007.

So porn has been my ""escape"". Eventually those ""pornographic thoughts"" polluted my mind, so i found a WhatsApp group for hook-ups. 
I initially thought finding a girl my age, but since my last relationship with a girl (which is the only one i've had) ended horribly, i decided to go try an older male, just for curiosity.

 So i've hooked up three times with three different males. But, idk, i didn't enjoyed it. 
I don't feel raped or abused, actually i've been lucky because the three persons i contacted were understanding and considerate. Even when i asked the last guy to stop, he did and let me go.

I know i exposed myself a lot, but that's because my self esteem plumbeted in just 10 months. I came to the conclusion that i did what i did because i don't love myself. I feel poor and lonely.

The girl i loved left me and the guy i love is almost impossible for someone like myself. My mother is working incredibely hard to get us out of our crisis, and my family is really divided right now.

I'm kinda the popular guy who is like joyful, positive, smart, handsome and happy at the eyes of my classmates, teachers and relatives, but inside i'm dying since May.

Honestly i've grown as a person, began to take care of myself, battle my addiction, make excersise and increase my califications. I've also became more conscious, mature and confident in some ways. I do believe that i'm enough to overcome this, but i don't know where should i start.

The main issue here isn't the fact i slept with men older than i, my family loosing our house or my crush on this guy and the scars of my past relatonship, the problem here is that i don't value myself. I do not respect me nor take care of who i am.

I know i'm strong. I know guys my age with suicidal thoughts and stuff. Idk if they are facing worst things or something, but i haven't thought about it as a solution.
I do wanna live and i have never doubt about it. I just wanna change this, and i know i can, i really can. Not for nothing, but i'm one of the stongest persons i know, and i want to overcome this.

I just don't know where should i begin. I have tons of proyects and dreams, but i need to get rid of this in order to achieve self improvement.",26Oct2019,1
101,"So i have this friend, we’ll call her Lucy. We hit it off great in every other aspect except for some political stuff and religious beliefs. Not a problem, I don’t care. She’s caring and has always treated me well, which is why this is so difficult for me.
Here’s the thing - she likes to debate. I do too, but i stopped pretty quickly because the way in which she says and does things is, for lack of a better word, bitchy. She brings up the fact that she’s a Political Science major to back up any opinion she has. she has a very know-it-all attitude and cannot be wrong about anything political because she’s majoring in it. It’s even to the point where if we have discussions where I am obviously the expert and am right (i.e, I’m an EMT and i say that i wouldn’t touch a random person’s blood without gloves), she finds a way to make me feel like an idiot. i realize that a thicker skin may be in order, but the attitude she has is very demeaning. outside of these discussions we have a lot of fun and she doesn’t display that sort of attitude that much but when we discuss something vaguely political it always comes out. Now, before you say it, i’ve tried the easy route and just...deflected or not started any debates or discussions. Then it turned into me checking out a history book to learn more about it and her condescendingly going “wow how did you not know about xyz already?”. Then tonight, I was talking about a fun activity my family used to do when i was younger and she very passive-aggressively mentioned how since i was “rich” (my family is comfortably middle-class but we’re definitely not rich), we could afford to do that (it was a free activity), whereas her poorer upbringing put her in a position where she couldn’t. All I was trying to do was talk about something fun, and I ended up feeling like I had to get on the defensive.
I’m starting to get more and more fed up with this and i feel like i need to confront her about it. I just don’t know the best and most respectful way to word things, and would appreciate any advice.",26Oct2019,2

109,"Alright, so let me preface with I am on mobile so I’m sorry if formatting sucks and with the simple fact that today was a hard day. It wasn’t labor intensive but it was a mental and emotional obstacle course so I’m very sorry in advance if this doesn’t make sense or is all over the place. 

I work at a franchised beauty school as the front desk manager. I have many tasks outside of the front desk aside from general reception duties and am told regularly by my coworkers and director of the school that I am a very valuable asset who has ran the desk the smoothest it has in years. I take a lot of pride in that (being the work horse I am) and being a valuable asset to the school itself. 

Today I had a regular client come in who we will call Marge. Marge has been coming to the school for many, many years; long before I even lived in the state that I currently reside. She has always had a note on her profile that she can bring in her own color per the owners. I never thought much of it but come to find out, almost a year later, she is a close friend of theirs. 

This last week she received a perm from one of our students. When I scheduled her appointment she asked for a more advanced student (sure, I supposed that’s understandable) to which I informed her that we would make a note and get her taken care of. 

We are able to make a scheduling note with much ease that the client has asked for a more advanced student, but not a particular student. 
We can also note if they have asked for a particular student, if they’re a new client, or if they’re a non-request client. So when push comes to shove and we have to move appointments around due to attendance/classes/etc we know what appointments we can and can’t move and who is expecting a student who is further along in the educational program. If a more experienced student is requested but has called in absent, we move the appointment to the next student who is available with the most experience. Make sense? 

Moving forward.. today Marge comes in, guns blazing, and is upset that her perm didn’t turn out and is requesting to speak to a manager. My coworker who greeted her and heard out her request for manager went to go grab our clinic floor manager. While she was gone Marge started complaining to me saying she “can’t believe how awful this perm turned out.” She continued with saying that she requested a more advanced student and was thoroughly disappointed that the gal who had performed the service was brand new to the floor. 

I assured her with a “I’m sorry that your service did not turn out as intended. I understand the frustration you may be feeling, but you do have to remember that this is a beauty school and that the students are still learning and practicing.”  
She interrupted me before I could finish my sentence and offer a redo at no charge with a “I know it’s a school, I know it’s a school, I know it’s a school.” 
I responded to her comment about an advanced student telling her “unfortunately since it is a trade school, much like a standard university, we cannot force students to show up for school. When we make an appointment for more advanced students we have to move them down the line of students who are more experienced if one or more in unavailable which unfortunately can result in someone who is not the -most- experienced, but will definitely do their best at the service.” 
She met me with a “I don’t think you should be letting students who haven’t performed a perm before do perms. I know the owners (names omitted) very well and would hate to have to make a complaint to them.”

At this point I was going to say something I’d regret if I continued talking. So I just looked at her and said, “Okay Marge, if you’ll take a seat a manager will be over for you shortly.” and then continued on with my task I was working on prior to this encounter. 

I am feeling overwhelming upset by this interaction and my shift has been over for 5 hours now. 

I am seeking advice on whether or not I should email the director of my school and tell her my experience and how I feel it is unfair that I am expected to be polite, respectful, and overly accommodating to the owners friends/family friends when they threaten me with a good time because their service didn’t turn out to the quality and standard of professionals? 
I work really hard at this job to make every one else’s jobs easier, to make sure that we are creating a safe space for our students to learn and grow, and making sure that we are accommodating the best we can to our clients. 
I don’t get paid enough to receive threats to complain about how I do my job/how poorly the students preform services and I sure as hell don’t get paid enough to grin and bare it, especially when it is coming from someone the owners personally know. 

TLDR; a family friend of the owners at my job threatened to complain to them because her perm didn’t turn out and I want to know if I should email my boss about it because it really upset me and I don’t think I should be treated that way, especially from a friend of the owners.",26Oct2019,4

114,"My little brother is 12 years old and just came back from his first school dance in tears because some kid strode up to him, called him a fat fuck, insulted his percussion playing (?), and then punched him in the gut.  He had a small bruise on his stomach.

I had him punch my shoulder with what he felt was the same intensity and it was a pretty hard hit. I was the one who picked him up and when he told me this, I did a U-turn and went back to tell the Vice Principal about the incident (who also happened to be my French teacher when I was a 6th grader). She said the kid would be dealt with.

I've had a farily tight and consistent group of friends since high school and we've hung out a lot over the summers but now that school is in swing I hear from them much less. Obviously I get they're busy and have their own lives but sometimes I feel left out. For example, one of my friends attends the same school as I do and talks about having gone to shows/parties that he knows I might be interested in yet doesn't tell me or invites other people. I'm always afraid if I ask about it or ask to hang out too often I'm gonna be seen as clingy or emotionally needy (which maybe I am) and they're going to eventually reject me because of it. 

Additionally, though this is more of a minor point, a lot of my friends have significant others while I've never had a partner in my life. I hope this doesn't come across as ""incel-ish"", but I am a little envious of the intimacy and it does make me feel a bit like a loser.

I guess I'm just afraid of being alone and afraid of losing the few close friendships I have. I feel like if I don't try to interact often they're just gonna forget about me and move on. There's a lot of other stuff going on in my life that also may be contributing to this feeling such as my mother being terminally ill, my father nearing the end of his natural life and having little time between school and work.

120,"I know this title may seem inconsiderate but I hear me out.  I have been through severe depression, and I feel like I am still depressed but not nearly as bad.  I understand that it's a mental illness and that it feels like heavy shackles on you.  People who say ""pull yourself up by your boot straps"" or ""just smile"" and other stuff like that don't get it.  Depression changes the way you think.  It physically drains you.  You think negative thoughts all the time and it seems impossible to think positively of yourself.  Telling a depressed person to ""just be happy"" is like telling someone with a fever to go run a 5k.

Depressed people need medication.  They need a good support system of family and/or friends to help provide for their physical, mental, and spiritual needs.  They need therapy.  BUT, and I don't think it's at all wrong to say this, you 100% need to take some matters into your own hands to get better.  What others can do for you can only go so far, YOU need to do your share to get better.

122," 

Hey everyone,

I'm the father of a 21 year old son - he is currently a college senior with nearly 4.0 cumulative GPA. He is one of the smartest students in the classroom I've ever seen - he puts in absolutely zero effort into school and outperforms everyone else. My problem is that he's been suffering from horrendous depression and blames it all on me.

All his life, he's always been an introvert. He got straight A's in high school without so much as a sweat, and always wanted to be a ""regular kid."" He had taken enough credits in prior school years to go home early and take it easy his senior year, but that was unacceptable to me. I forced him to take electives, join after-school clubs (like the indoor marching band for example), and I also forced him to take all honors courses, even though he wanted to take the ""normal"" classes. He already got accepted into college and had a 4.0 GPA, and just wanted to be a regular kid, but I thought I was doing him a favor by forcing him to do things he didn't want to do.

It turned out, me forcing him to do stuff in high school made him not want to go to college just out of resent. He eventually gave in and went to college, but that's where it got worse. When he enrolled in college, I forced him to join his school's English Literature Honors Society, because I figured it would help him meet people and expand his critical thinking skills. He told me up front he had no interest in the program, English was his least favorite subject in high school, and he absolutely begged me not to do it. He just wanted to be a ""normal kid,"" but that's honestly garbage - when opportunities like this present themselves, you accept them. So now, instead of making friends with the people at college he wanted to - the ""party people"" - he made friends with the ""artsy, nerdy - his words"" kids who don't go out to parties and he has a pretty nonexistant social life. And this ungrateful kid blames me for his mistakes, and now is depressed and doesn't want to talk to me.

Did I do something wrong? What should I have done differently? I think I did a great job as a father but I want my son to stop feeling depressed. Any and all advice helps. Thanks. -Steve",26Oct2019,1
123,"Hello everyone, here is the context - I have a really good group of friends who I truly love, trust me they're really not having the worse of intentions and I've swapped out alot of friend groups, I'm very happy with them but recently there has been a constant trend which started to annoy me.

Basically, in this group there are 3 people who constantly talk over me, I will be talking and they will just burst into what I'm saying with something unrelated or something like that, it's super disrespectful and it's starting to bug me. Moreover, today we had a small party and while the original plan was to stay there the entire night, me and another friend decided to leave, I said my goodbyes of course but no one responded to me, I'm not thinking about it too much beacuse I know them quite well and I know they don't have the best intentions so it doesn't hurt me but how I do feel very disrespected.

Sometimes 2 specific people out of that friend group will continously talk over me to the point where I just can't talk (as in, they talk over me in a row in a way that does not allow me to say what I was meaning to say), this happened today and another friend mentioned it, he said ""there is just one alpha is this group and he's the only one no one interrupts"" that is definetely true to some extent (people do interrupt him, just a very small amount) but I am almost sure to me they do it way more excessively than any other person in the group. When I mentioned this, they said that I'm getting mad over small things which I don't agree with myself but I'm open to other opinions.

He would get mad at me or make me mad, make me think I lost my bestie (online that is) forever then pop up a few days later as if nothing happened and saying it was a troll. He knew all the dark stuff happening in my life, he was there during a really depressing stage, and then he just pushes all blame of our ending friendship on me abd poof gone. The last thing I managed to say to him was that if he doesn't wanna be my friend anymore to man up and say it and to not make a dumb excuse.

My anxiety has only gotten worse I am hyperventilating at random times its only gotten to the point I couldn't stop it on my own twice. I've had about 5 panic attacks in total. 

TL;DR: my friend lied his way out of our friendship and left me with extreme anxiety read the last small section for more detail.",26Oct2019,1
130,"My girlfriend and I have lived together for about 10 or 11 months or so and her brother got out of prison 4 months ago after being in prison for 7 years, hes only been here two weeks but I still want him gone. Although he was in prison that's not the problem per say, but it is. He has some sort of disconnect and he doesn't act like a regular person. He acts like a grown child. Very loud, and way too honest, and he only laughs at other peoples misfortunes, plays his guitar and videogames loud as fuck. And the biggest thing is whenever I ask something of him that pertains to his stuff like clean it up or move it he goes ""it's not that bad I've seen worse"" and leaves it there. And I'm about to lose my shit on this guy.

So that's what I'm dealing with now at home, let me tell you how I got in this situation. As I said he is a felon, and lived in prison for 7 years so he's very antisocial. But he got some girl pregnant almost exactly right after he got out. A real ugly bitch. Cleft lip and shit, and a huge drug addict. Smokes weed while pregnant. Anyway, he moved in with her at first and they actually were doing okay, aside the smoking weed while pregnant. So he was talking shit about the people they were living with and they kicked just him out and she stayed and broke up with him. I honestly dont even think it's his kid, but he swears up and down it is. My sweet girlfriend decided to shelter this fucking caveman of a person and just now as I speak he told me he fucked his said pregnant girlfriend in my parking lot in front of my apartment, which is infuriating because for one, it's in front of my apartment and for two hes not even on his own feet right now so why is he fucking people while living under my roof, its disrespectful and I dont have the money or patience to support his smoking habit, food habits, or anything anymore. What can I do to get him out of here? My girlfriend keeps saying she'll talk to him but never does.

TL'DR- 
Girlfriend has annoying brother who lives with us temporarily because his girlfriend kicked him out, and he keeps being annoying as fuck at my house and disrespecting my rules. My girlfriend let's him do what he wants and tells me she'll handle it. How can I solve this?",26Oct2019,2
131,"Before I ask for the advice it’s a little bit of a story, sorry.

Too embarrassed to post this on my main account, but I literally feel like I’m wasting my life. I’m 16 which is supposedly the prime of my life but all I’m doing is sitting in bad all day depressed. I’m practically a mute at school, my mom is and was abusive to me my whole life so I never really learned how to talk or communicate with people. I can’t really explain it without telling a life story but I pretty much drove myself into depression staying in my room for pretty much all day. When ever I do come out my room it’s always a fight with my mom and sister, they pretty much bully me to be honest. I have bags under my eyes from sleeping too much, becoming suicidal but too much of a pussy to put myself in any pain but can’t afford any painless methods. A while ago I came to the conclusion I’m going to get treated like shit either way so I gave up on keeping my grades up and started skipping school(also I got into a pretty bad drug habit, daily weed smoking that brought me to a psychosis, and pretty much anything that can get me high, especially psychedelics). I’m supposed to be in 11th grade but stayed back twice but got my credits back last year so I’m in 10th grade. 

What should I do? I don’t think I can deal with my mom or sister anymore(it’s really bad, honestly it might sound like a teenager overreacting but they really do bully me, for example today I missed the bus and the whole way to school my mom told me she hated me and wished she listened to my dad about getting an abortion when she had me(I don’t understand why she was so mad because she literally drives my sister to school everyday) when I brought that up she tried to hit me. This happens weekly. I would go to the councilor but I’m too antisocial and think it’s too much work, and if they call any child services I’ve heard nothing but bad things about living with them, and I only have 2 more years until I’m 18 and I can leave, I might get treated like shit but I’ll still have warm meals everyday. 

I also don’t know where to go, I want to go to Canada for college but I don’t think I’ll get very far with terrible grades. If I were to get straight As for this and next year and make my credits back would any colleges accept me? 

I’ve quit smoking weed because it makes me feel terrible. Actually I’ve quit most drugs except for lsd or shrooms once a month(I’m pretty sure this has no effect on me and honestly it’s kinda sad but if I didn’t try psychedelics I probably would’ve killed myself a while ago)

I also need to fix this antisocial thing I’m doing right now. I probably could have friends and I used to before I started hiding in my room. I’ve also lost and could’ve started relationships but I’m just terrible at talking to me(I’m a pretty good looking guy and have had a few girls come up to me trying to start something but I’m just too awkward. It’s not that I don’t know what to say my voice is just used to being quiet so I talk quietly). I’ve met a couple people at my school but I only talk to them in school, people know that I have a quiet personality and a fun personality, but the teachers don’t and I’m pretty sure all my teachers think I’m going to be a school shooter or something. I can honestly see why I’d give off some shooter vibes but I don’t really care that much.

My plan at this point is to get a visa, move to Canada and hope I can get into college if I fix my grades. I think I can write a really good letter about my struggles in life and how I made a 180° turn and got my shit together, I hope they’ll understand and accept me, I’m not doing any activities for school and I’d be lying if I said I would join a club or something. If that doesn’t work, I don’t have any other goals and know other plans so I’ll probably just kill myself or something, it might sound awful but I doubt I could do anything with my life after that except be homeless or a drug addict.",26Oct2019,2
132,"I genuinely really like ""teaching"" Maths. I've offered free help for a countless number of people (friends and strangers alike), but I think that it's because I like the feeling of someone understanding what I've explained. 

I feel extremely lifeless and depressed being some ""optimizer"" in a company, a sort of ""make it work"" machine. I can't handle it anymore. 

It feels incredibly rewarding when someone says ""Ohhh, I see now!"". That and my love for mathematics lead to me think maybe I should give up everything and become a math teacher.

My fear about that is that I have no idea if it suits me. Do I have to start with lower highschool levels before going to 1st year college/university level, then maybe even further? What's the academic lifestyle like? What are the perks and disadvantages? What if I'm just terrible with holding and teaching to a class altogether and am simply good at teaching one on one?

135,"A while ago, lets say 2 to 3 years, I had a crush who I was too shy to talk to in person. Around this time, I joined social media for the first time, and found her on tumblr and instagram. She was an art student, interested in photography, poetry, and social justice. Somewhat pathetically (I had grown since then) I worked up the courage to talk to her on Tumblr. For a moment it looked like we were at least becoming friendly, but she later ended up blocking me (She kinda figured out I had feelings for her, and I was a bit awkward and cringey).

Fast forward a year and a half and I'm in a better place than I was then. I realized I made a lot of mistakes. I decided to check her tumblr through public, and I found her posting artwork. They aren't getting a lot of notoriety, so I thought I'd send an anonymous question through the ask function and compliment her work.

The reason I'm posting this is because I have Asperger's syndrome (Autism), and I have trouble understanding people, social conventions, and what is and isn't appropriate, and I'm not entirely sure if it's okay for me do this and I'd like some input from others.",26Oct2019,1

When I was about nine, I made a deviantart account. I was obviously too young but art was so important to me at the time- I wanted to post it and look at others and find friends that liked the same thing as me. And I did. 

I made one of the best friends I’ve ever had, but I totally catfished her. She’s five years older than me. I had no idea it was wrong because I was so young, and I had no ill intentions. I was afraid of my parents finding out I had an account, and especially that I was using my real name. I was also afraid of people finding out I was so young, and I also thought I wasn’t interesting enough to make friends, so I basically made up this person that I wanted to be, and even made her a cousin that was, in a sense, more like me. Anyway, this friend and I would talk pretty much every day about whatever was going on in our lives (which was very much real) and problems and crushes and I mean, anything you would talk about with your best friend. We RP’d, we made art for each other, I even sent her things for her birthday.

We fell out of contact a couple of years later and we haven’t spoken since. I checked my account today and saw that she commented that she misses me and wishes she could get back in contact with me. I would love to, but I am so scared she will hate me for lying to her about who I was. 

Do you think there’s any way she could understand? Is it even worth reaching out?",26Oct2019,1
138,"So I have a problem with my landlord. I have rented a room there for almost 3 years and the people that live there know that I have 2 German shepherds that are kind but also protective. Whenever they want to enter in my side of the house (I own a big room that also includes the yard) they always ask me if it is okay to go on my side of the house. Ok so this is where the problem starts. The landlord has the tendency to enter the house whenever she pleases without asking anyone in the house, (she doesn’t live in the house). So I let me dogs out in the backyard when I was taking a shower and as soon as I got in the shower. The landlord entered the backyard without telling me and was carrying a stick with her and my dog apparently bit her. I would’ve thought that she would’ve called the police immediately but she called them 2 days after. The police came to see what happened and they just checked if the dogs had all of their shots and were well taken cared of, all was checked and they said that it was okay. They called the vet to see if all of my dogs had their shots and they did.  They gave me a ticket and said that my dog is in house arrest for a week, meaning they can’t leave the house at all. Now this morning, I was walking out of the house and my landlord handed me a note, an eviction notice that is for 60 days. I have paid all of my rent on time and all the roommates are sided with me because she apparently invaded their privacy as well. I guess I also heard stories that she once walked in a room and was checking their room out. I really don’t know if that is true at all. The roommates are chill with my dogs. I really just need advice about this eviction thing, I’m extremely worried about where to live with my dogs.

So quick background info: 
Thursday afternoon I applied to a few jobs in my local area. One in particular was very fancy, suit and tie and white table cloth fancy. I was applying to it basically just because why not?

I handed in my resume with the job application and instantly felt like I wasnt going to get the job and I shouldnt have done that. 

But today. One day later. I get a call. It's them...and I have an interview monday afternoon. She said she liked my resume. But the thing is I feel like I'm not qualified enough for a place like this. I worked in fine dining but it was no where near as fine as this. Presidents come to this place to eat and I'm nervous that I'm not good enough and will totally destroy my chances by bombing this interview.

I dont want her to see that I'm afraid and I want to nail this interview very badly. It will look good on my resume in the future and I've heard people who work there stay for a long time so I can only assume they treat their employees well.

145,"Hola, kinda new and have never posted and also on mobile so sorry for formatting.

So, I (19F) have never been in a relationship, as you can see from the title, and I need advice or support or whatever is allowed on this sub. This will be EXTREMELY long because I am Captain Over Explain but Ill include a tldr.

I got my first boyfriend in 8th grade at 13 yrs old, even though I barely knew him, I was just excited to have my first boyfriend lol. We were on and off for a few weeks at a time until 10th grade. Since then, all of the boys Ive ""dated"" ended up the same way, it never lasted. Ive talked to about 10 to 15 guys, only 4 of which officially asked me to be their girlfriend, and none of the ""relationships"" have lasted more than 5 months. During those times we would barely see eachother, they would either neglect me, cheat on me, or abuse me (only once mentally for 3 months before my amazing parents stepped in).

The other boys Ive talked to never made it past the talking stage. These boys have always either ghosted me, got bored and talked to me less and less over time, liked someone else and didnt tell me they didnt like me anymore, or didnt know how to communicate their feelings caused by really shitty childhoods and never went to therapy to work out the deep rooted issues. 

Now Im not really a horribly unattractive person physically, I have a bit of a crooked nose and crooked teeth, I dont have a misshapen body or missing limbs, Im an average weight/height, you know, normal stuff but everyone has their flaws. 

My personality is a teeny bit eccentric, I get told Im funny, that I laugh a lot, that Im an interesting person to talk to etc, my music taste is pretty decent and all over the place.. Im not rude or toxic or mean in any way to anybody, so just generally a pretty rad down to earth person if I say so myself. Of course I have flaws here too and Ive been working extremely hard my whole life to better myself spiritually, I self reflect and apologize and actively fix my behavior when Im in the wrong; Im learning everyday what it takes to be a good human. I am extremely consistent and supportive and dead loyal to all friends and boys Im interested in. No matter what a guy has been going through Im always there for him being supportive and considerate and I never lose my cool on them, unless they hurt me and I have evidence so I spit fire (my fault).

For some reason I always seem to attract broken emotionally unavailable boys who come from a broken past, and it feels like all Ive ever been is a healing path. A stepping stone if you will. Im FAR from perfect, and deep down I know my worth and that I am valuable, and I know Im a good kid that definitely dont deserve to be treated like shit. But I cant help but think theres something wrong with me that Im not seeing. My friends tell me Im amazing and the boys I choose just dont see my worth, and that Im young and still have my whole life to find him. I just dont know how to be patient and let life do her thing. I know I can have a healthy real relationship with someone who puts in as much effort as I do but I feel alone and confused and need support.

159,"I desperately need help. It feels like everything has suddenly gone into a downward spiral. I'll put a TLDR at the end because I expect this to be rather lengthy. 

Full context:

I am a 19 year old male in my second year as a mechanical engineering major at a state school (about $9-10k per year without housing and food). As of now, my parents pay my expenses, which is a blessing. Prior to this I attended an academically rigorous private high school, again I know I was very fortunate. During that time, I was extremely well behaved. I never did any drugs, never partied, and didn't drink until my senior year, and it was occasional, and I was very reasonable and safe with it. My good behavior was especially easy as I didn't really have a close group of friends until my senior year. During that friendless time, I often felt depressed and alone, but that changed senior year when I was hanging out with friends more often and became significantly happier. I had good grades throughout and applied to a number of very good engineering schools in the area, all but one of which I got into but couldn't attend for financial reasons. So I settled on on my safety school, the aforementioned state school. This school too has a good reputation and strong engineering program, but not at the same level. I was disappointed at first, but I can't say I regret that decision in the least anymore. Last school year was easily the happiest year of my life to this point. I made a number of great new friends, and my grades were similarly good (A's and B's only). This year started off similarly well, in fact possibly better. I felt confident in my classes and had maintained my friends. During college, I started to drink socially on weekends and eventually started to smoke weed. 

Now we'll jump into the problem:

Just this week my parents discovered that I smoked. They knew and accepted that I was drinking as they did with my older siblings, but they are staunchly against weed. They are both in law enforcement and staunchly conservative. They told me to bus home Friday to deal with the repercussions, and so I did. I got it cleared with the necessary professors and got on the first bus in the morning. I knew I was about to face something serious, but had no hint as to what it might be. After a 6+ hour bus ride home and an uber from the bus stop, I finally arrived. After they had returned from work and other errands they sent my little brother away and sat me down to talk. During this talk, they searched through my phone and laptop (and found nothing they were looking for) and laid out my punishment. They said I was to bus home from school every Friday from now on and that I would return on a bus Sunday or Monday morning. During these weekends, I would be ""attached at the hip"" to my dad. Going wherever he goes and just keeping me busy basically. 

Not only would this destroy my social life but likely impact my grades too being that I'd have very little free time now. I just don't see how I can take these conditions for the foreseeable future without drastically fucking up my life. I've already been talking to my sister, who's moved out and thus has less threat of consequences, about trying to reason with them to lessen the punishment a bit, and I'm planning on reaching out to other family members in the hopes that they too could talk a little reason into them. The alternative I'm looking at if they don't listen is to just straight up move out and take out loans. I don't know if I'm really ready for that at this time, but I can't throw my college years away just because my parents hate weed. 

TLDR: 

Very strict parents found out I started to smoke at college and now want me to take a 6 hour bus to and from home every weekend so I can waste it following them around and staying out of trouble.

161,"for one, I do love my parents. They're great overall, but with that being said I've always felt kind of neglected. 

So for context I'm nearing my mid 20s. I have 3 brothers and I'm their only daughter. My brothers either got full ride to colleges from sports or are doing well off after college, which is awesome. But the issue with that is I definitely lived in their shadow basically growing up my entire life. I don't mind, nor necessarily cared. I was dragged to games and always had to be at every event yadadada, none of it interested me but I was used to going. However my father really hated the fact that I'm not a competitive person, and definitely was a lot more harsh with me and made me basically feel like well, a loser. I knew he loved me but he wouldn't show it through being a father, he'd show it through trying to buy me or trying to 'give me a reality check' but honestly be so mean to me I'd just cry every time. My mom definitely was softer with me but even she has said similar things that really hurt me. You know those parents where you tell them how you feel and they throw it back in your face and undermine it? Kinda my life when it comes to my family, which is why I haven't really told them anything about my life anymore. Long story short it happened again today when going to a game ( of course I wanted to go, I'm an adult now and wanted to support my younger brother ) but damn are they great at making me feel 13 again and feeling like shit about myself.
I know this is all very vague with not much context I guess, but I just need some encouraging words or something. I hate that this still makes me cry, and can ruin my entire day. Like damn I just want them to be proud of me sometimes, genuinely.",26Oct2019,1

163,"So I have this one coworker/friend that I feel very close to, he has helped me through some issues and is in general a good guy and a shoulder to cry on. Me and this guy have always had the relationship in which we make fun of each other, poke and slap eachother around, make dirty jokes, and of course flirt with each other (as you do with most opposite gender friends in my opinion). Now he has done some flirting that has gone a little overboard which I won't go into but I never really thought anything of it, but today my opinion on him has completely changed. So the conversation went like this 
Me: Would you come with me to get a tattoo when I turn 18?
Him: Well duh of course, I'd do anything with you when you turn 18.
Me: AAAAnYthInG?? Whoa there what
Him: Well not like thaaaat.. you know what I mean
Him: but if girls are over the age of 18 and I think they're attractive then I'll have sex with them, I don't really care if we're just friends. I see no issue.
Me: I dunno, I don't think I could do that with (insert my guy friends) it would feel wrong unless I met them and immediately wanted to do that.

164,"Hey guys! 
I am in a bit of a pickle here. Forgive the format I’m on mobile. Anyways, I’m a fisherman in Alaska and have run into a situation that’s stressing me out. I have a love hate relationship with this job. Our summer season didn’t go so well due to a major engine breakdown,  and my paycheck was pretty terrible.....but because my captain and crew was solid I decided to come back for fall fishing.  Now that I’m here, we’re still having a rough season and can’t seem to get a break. My captain has gone above and beyond to show he appreciates my loyalty and even gave me a size-able bonus and higher percentage, which takes money directly out of his pocket and into mine. I can tell he cares about us and feels bad that we’ve been so unlucky. On top of that he’s one of the most influential people to come into my life.  I feel like we are due for a break and one big bag of fish. That being said, there’s only 3 more weeks to this season and if it continues to be this bad, I won’t be able to afford rent in California  when I get home and that puts me and my girlfriend in a tough spot. If I leave now, I will have $0 and sacrifice part of the bonus from summer season. BUT. I do have a gaurnteed job lined up and a safe steady income, my girlfriend and dog to come home too + I can bust ass for 3 weeks to afford rent. However if I stay, there’s the chance that I make nothing or a chance I come home with a few extra grand in my pocket and some financial security for once. It’s a high risk high reward, but is it worth it?  My girl is stressed and wants me to come home but for some reason my gut is telling me to take the gamble despite the serious consequences.

Last year I (F16) was close friends with a boy(M15). He liked me and I later on started to grow feelings for him but I didn’t tell anyone. I was too embarrassed to express my feelings because I’m shy and I was too scared to tell him. I kept denying my feelings for a while but that didn’t work. I eventually was going to tell him how I felt but then I went back to pretending I didn’t want him. I was confusing myself all the time and I was becoming frustrated and took it out on him. I then stopped talking to him because I didn’t know how to cope with these new emotions. Over a few months I regretted everything I did and I was filled with guilt. I missed him so much but I didn’t want to crawl back to him because I knew I would of upset him a lot. Everyday I couldn’t stop thinking about him  and my past actions. I tried to start a conversation but I got shit down a bit harshly and I don’t blame him. Later on I worked up the courage to apologise to him about what I did. He was really mad at me  just before the apology but the next day he accepted my apology and said he didn’t want to talk like we used to though. I was crushed by this but I tried to move on. It was only 3 weeks ago he all of sudden started talking to me and I was really confused. He said he was only talking to me because he had no one else to talk to. This kind of upset a bit but I just brushed it off because I missed him so much. He talked about how he’s been lonely and depressed (not in a guilt tripping way) and asked me about how I’ve been and how my job search was going. He later on apologised for being rude to me previously. He said it was good talking to me but I’m not sure if still has a thing for me or he was just being polite. He’s quite shy too and it’s hard to tell. After this I haven’t talked to him because I don’t want to bother him. I just want to be with him and I have to admit I’m in love with him.

172,"So a few days ago or so I made a post asking if a guy liked me based on things he did like walk with me to where I needed to go even though it was away from his next class, wait for me after every class so we could hang out, or wait with me for like 30 minutes for my ride to come even though he had a car and could leave anytime he wanted. But since then more things have happened:

Last class we had together he said mentioned that we should study together for our next test because we both didn't do well on the one we had just taken, and he asked for my number. When I said I hoped we didn't have another test for a while (because obviously I hate tests) he said he hoped there was one, I assume implying he wanted one just so he could study with me? He basically said something about it being an excuse to hang out with me, so we just made plans for Sunday. He also told me I looked lovely on top of all of that.

But also, he keeps calling me his friend or his new friend (because we just started interacting a little over a month ago) and that just makes me think I'm getting friendzoned or just misinterpreting his intentions? I know it all seems to point to the fact that he likes me, but sometimes he just says something and I'm like literally what does this mean but that's also just me with a lot of things guys say or do. So I don't know if he likes me and this is kinda sorta a date or if he's just really really nice and we're just hanging out and I'm mistaking it for flirting. People in the last post said he obviously likes me so I don't know if I'm just blind to it because of my own self esteem issues or if he's just a really confusing person.

But Leah keeps making *jokes* about suicide, and I hate it. I love everything else about her (no homo lol), but those jokes just get at me. I have been on the verge of suicide so many times that hearing someone trying make it funny just makes me sick to my stomach.

187,"Bit of a backstory, I’ve been single since early July. I thought it would be best if my girlfriend at the time and I had gone our separate ways as she was going into college and I just didn’t want to hold her back(let me clarify that I am still in high school and yeah). On top of that it was just really hard to hold onto a long distance relationship. I don’t regret that relationship, just glad I learned through the process.

 So, I met this girl late last year, she’s just the right amount like me but enough not like me to where I don’t hate her and I think she’s perfect. She tells me things that she’s never told anybody and will never tell anybody and we just have a great relationship. I’m terrified to mess it up. I have feelings for her and she has absolutely no clue and I really don’t think I should tell her but keeping it in and just sitting back as I watch everything happen just hurts. 

So many things just tell me I’d have no chance, like the biggest thing, she has a boyfriend. She tells me how she doesn’t want to be dating him and that we he asked her out it was just a heat of the moment decision to say yes and that she would feel horrible to dump him so she’d rather he dumps her. However within a few days of them getting together, he tried to make her block me because he was jealous and wanted me out of the picture to which she told him that she’d rather lose him than me. 

Another thing is that within the past year or so it’s just been so common that people confess their feelings to her, like two guys who we actually pretty close with her confessed their feelings and she came to me saying that she thought they were using her friendship and just trying to get close to see if they’d have a chance. I’m terrified of that happening because that means I’d probably lose her. 

Recently it’s just been getting to me more and more that I’m just not happy like I used to be. I’m lonely and it sucks. I don’t even think I’ve slept regularly since July and it’s slowly taking its toll on me and I have a few friends notice and tell me.

Anyways onto why I'm posting. A couple of months ago, this dude and I used to talk almost everyday. We would talk until past midnight (Still a student so this was crazy), about music, classes, whatever. It was great, the friendship was fun. My friends teased me about it, but it was all just jokes, they knew we were friends. 
Over the summer, there was less to talk about and I was a lot more busy. Eventually, the conversations met their natural ends for once and one of us would usually send a meme or something to start it again. At one point it was just me over and over so I thought he didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't reply the last time and assumed he would send something if he wanted to. He didn't, and that was fine.
Now that school's begun again, he's being sort of an asshole? We don't have classes or anything, but when I see him in the hallways he looks pissed. Recently, he started following the path I take around the school, making that same stupid face.
I cannot for the life of me figure out if I did something.

195,"I [M24] met a girl [F22] earlier this year who was absolutely stunning. Smart, beautiful, funny, interesting, and everything else you could ever dream for in a girl. We dated for 2 months.

However, she was only in my country temporarily and had to move back overseas. We left things on an extremely unclear note; we never explicitly stated we were dating, we never explicitly said we were breaking up. We just said we would stay in touch. Both of us are introverts who are not good at communicating our feelings.

I have never been in a long term relationship, but she is the first girl I have ever loved. I had a really hard time when she left and I never told her how important she was to me. She's STILL important to me, to be honest. I want to tell her that.

However, when it comes to relationships, she is in a different boat. She has been in one that lasted 8 years (Yes, 8. That's not a typo). I automatically assumed that a 2 month fling with some American boy must be totally forgettable by her standards, but I can't stop thinking about it. I have to know for sure.

How do I approach telling her how I feel? My current idea is to be direct and plainly ask her if she thought what we had was special or if it was just a fling to her; is there anything wrong with that?.

I need to leave at 2 tmmrw but the schedule says another lady is leaving at 2 just like me and we both work in the kitchen so only one of us is going to actually leave at 2 (most likely her they fucking hate me) should i even bother asking to let me leave at 2 since the schedule does say 2?",26Oct2019,3
202,"When we moved to a neighborhood from an apartment we were so excited our daughter could make friends who were more likely to stick around. Well the friends have stuck around but they are a disappointment. All my daughter wanted was to have good friends who love to play. Every kid is obsessed with technology. None of them have a unique personality either. Its some internet persona from tik tok or youtubers they idol. They have absolutely no imagination. Mean and negative constantly calling everything and everyone ugly and and stupid. Always screaming. They hit bit and push on occasion. Trashing her room and my house no matter how much i try they just dont pick up unless i say something, then they do it. Im sick of having to tell them. The few sleepovers weve done they say theyre bored, miss their phones, and leave. Theyve even said yes lets have a sleepover tonight!! She gets so excited! And then they change their minds ""just cause"". So im done with sleepovers so she can stop getting her heart broken. She has a very sensitive heart and needs a meaningful connection that somehow these kids dont seem to need? To make matters worse, we switched schools and the vibe here is completely different, not in a good way.

These arent assumptions of them either. I have these kids over 24/7 and have gotten to know them each personally. I was basically a free babysitter this summer feeding them and attempting to teach them to be better people. But it isnt getting better and my daughter is starting to think everyone hates her. Shes frustrated and lonely. She feels used. Its almost like they only play because they are bored. Not because they like her. But she is the type to do anything just to have a friend. I am also home all the time so we spend so much time together. Not as much anymore obviously, shes very bored without a friend her age with us nowdays. I just want to see her happy but im not sure if i should let her cut it off herself with a bit more convincing on my part. Or if i should be the barrier between her and them, no choice, and basically tell them why. 
The kids are ages 6 7 7 9 10. 
Im fed up with internet raising kids. It makes me sick. Im lucky to have a daughter who somehow doesn't like it that much. But its been a struggle finding someone like her.",26Oct2019,791

204,"For the sake of my adhd I'm going use (fake) names and tell the story than ask my question. 

Jane(friend 1 and 'ringleader')
Kaliya(friend 2)
Rebecca(friend 3)
Maddison(friend 4)
Wan(friend 5 and the 'reasonable')

Its started a couple days ago, we would always hang out however they were avoiding me. It wasn't really that uncommon that maybe they were talking about something private but that wasn't the case. I hung out with 'Kaliya' for about 2hrs after the avoidance, but it was nice and she wasn't being aggressive to me which is common for her. But I saw her and 'Jane'  about 1/2 hr later I hear her tell Kaliya not to hang around me and to avoid me, so I walk away. I go back home, and text Jane, ""I may be alot of things but I'm not an idiot"" I believe it was. We text for about 20m and she reveals that shes been telling her 'goons' lies about me and jokes out of context; telling them to avoid me. I told her that what she was doing hurt me severely, and that my friends are everthing I ha(ve/d), and that I still love her and everyone else in my 'friend group'; she doesn't respond I stop texting her. Wan is here for me and doesn't avoid me, she was in a group chat on Instagram with them, and told me what they said (about me) making fun of my race saying the n-slur as I'm biracial and half black. But above all they spoke about me as if I trapped them. My logic and reasoning is telling me to get over it and move on, but my emotions are attracted to them and I love the and want to be with them, I'm doubting myself currently advice to get them back? (If it becomes toxic again I wont hesitate to leave but these type of things having often as we're a dramatic bunch so should I stick it out or just leave) sorry for gramatic errors I'm a bit embarrassed and overwhelmed by this situation.",26Oct2019,1

207,"I’m in a rough situation. I’m 18, and I moved out with my boyfriend(20) and his brother(21) in June. We were all in situations where we had to move out (me, I wanted to get out of my abusive household. My boyfriend and his brother, dad was moving far away so they moved out to stay in this area with work and school). We were very iffy about his brother coming with us due to him dropping out of college (just stopped going to his classes) and never having been able to keep a steady job. After a long conversation with him, he decided he was ready to be an adult and we let him come with us. Our mistake. He just stopped going to his job, got laid off for “mental health issues” (which is an excuse for not wanting to take responsibility, and before you come for me, I’ve known him for years and I suffer from many mental issues myself, he pulls this card when he doesn’t want responsibility). His mum came to the rescue and has swept him away for a month to her place two hours away. He can’t search for a new job during this time, and only has enough money for next months rent. My boyfriend and I don’t make enough to be able to cover it ourselves. My boyfriend makes the money to pay our bills and unfortunately I’m a tattoo apprentice and make almost no money. Any money I do make all goes to our groceries or helping with bills if I can. I am extremely grateful to them for letting me live with them, given my circumstances,  but I am freaking out right now. I have physical and mental health issues that prevent me from being able to work at most places, I almost got fired from my apprenticeship because I had to be out so much for doctors appts. My insurance stopped covering therapy and meds too, so no more of those. On one hand I want to get a job that pays more so I can contribute more, but on the other hand this is what I want to do for a career and I have no idea where to go outside of this. Our only option if we get evicted is my boyfriend moves 2 hours away to live w his mum and I go back to living with my parents. There is no where that just him and I can afford to rent or will get approved for, given that at any place here you have to make at least 3x rent and we make just barely enough to cover all basic living expenses for the lowest priced places around here. I feel so bad posting this because I know so many people have it way worse, and I am extremely grateful for everything I do have.

210,"So about a month ago, a friend told me she thought my guy best friend was cute, so I hooked them up. They've been dating for about a month now and both seem somewhat happy with each other. However, whenever I see them together my blood boils with anger and jealousy, making me distance myself from my best friend, and I have grown to resent my once friend. He has told me countless times that if I felt that uncomfortable with her that he would break up with her, but I don't want to be that selfish. I somewhat want to detach myself from him so I stop caring, but at the same time he IS my best friend, and I don't want to lose him. 

Today I talked somewhat trash about her and he blew up on me saying I knew that he preferred me over her and that he didn't know why I was acting the way I was. I felt terrible about this and asked forgiveness, but I feel as though he still hasn't gotten over it. 

I hate getting attached to people, and I might feel this resentment so strongly because I used to somewhat like him, but I'm over it now. He is one of the dearest persons to me and I love him with all my heart and I hate seeing us like this. He is one of the closest people to me and knows me inside and out.

 In the end, I know I'm the asshole but I don't know what to do anymore. I really want them to break up, but on their own terms. Should I distance myself from him?",26Oct2019,1
211," 

When I'm at school and I talk to girls around my age I think I can get to sound obsessive on subjects, and I love to argue, and talking to a girl in a 15 minute plus conversation I automatically develop feelings towards them. I am also pretty loud and I talk quickly combined with me getting excited in arguments and discussions causes me to rub women the wrong way. I always tend to think that I'm somehow very ugly, or something along those lines and then immediately flip on that and basically say ""suck it up"" to myself that I'm fine that I am being a total pussy because of that, I feel that I may have developed a inferiority complex but at the same time won't let me say that to myself, because I won't let myself become a victim. I'm worried that with my inhibiting sense of anxiety, preventing me from asking anyone out, ""because it won't end well"" and general frustration may push me down that rabbit hole, and last thing I want is to be one of them.

213,"This Girl, lets call her Girl A, from what I’ve gathered isn’t that great of a person. After talking to close friend of mine (let’s call her Girl B), Girl A has repeatedly bullied others out of her “friend group” with other people. Girl A also disliked Girl B greatly and eventually helped drive Girl B out of the group. Girl A, from what I know, helped harass others out of her group. She in one instance, called one “friend” a whore after the friend posted a picture of her kissing a boy at a party on some social media site. Then Girl A and her helpers repeatedly put down and eventually drove the friend out of the group.

They did this to Girl B too. From what I’ve gathered, it is because they saw Girl B as “flaky”. I should mention Girl B had certain mental health issues and needed time for herself, and with issues from her transcript, she had to transfer in and out of school a couple times.

I am unsure if Girl A’s sister aware of any of this. Girl A’s sister (let’s call her Girl C), is a remarkably kind and sweet person. Girl C is a tremendously hard worker and she stresses herself too much because her family expects her to succeed well. I know that Girl A has been “given up on” by her parents in terms of grades. So Girl C believes she has so much pressure to succeed. Girl C barely sleeps or eats sometimes. 
I know Girl A has gotten into certain issues with other people before, but I do not know what occurred in those issues. Girl A is someone with more power and social connections than me. I am afraid and unsure of what I believe. I come here for some perspective or any advice on how to handle this.

214,"Let me start off by thanking you for taking the time to read this. I’m rather embarrassed about this and I honestly cannot talk to anyone in my inner circle about it for obvious reasons. 

Some background: I’m a thirty something female, I’ve been happily married for a rather long time and we have a wonderful child. 
Our child is in elementary school and has an amazing teacher; She’s also a female and she’s younger than me. 
 I am becoming unreasonably interested in her. I’ve known her now for over a year and we’re not that close though I have been involved with the school quite a bit and I see her daily. 
I think of her non-stop and I always try to find a way to ‘bump’ into her or see her somehow. I plan out clothing/makeup/hair, etc in the hopes of looking effortlessly beautiful and/or impressive. 
I know she’s not gay (she’s in a straight marriage) and I know I’m not either, so what is up? It’s driving me CRAZY. I have weird fantasies about making out with her (no sex though, that doesn’t interest me) and being in a more deeply emotional relationship with her. I know as I say this that I sound crazy and I know it’s completely inappropriate, borderline obsessive and totally unreasonable. My question is: what do I do? I can’t avoid her. I would never actually try and act on this but I can’t stop thinking about her. She’s also younger than me and I feel like this old, creepy, bored mom trying to have some excitement in her life. 
I obviously can’t talk about it with her either, nor would I. 
I haven’t told my husband, I’m sure he would think it was ‘hot’ and then question my sanity. 
I don’t know what to do and I’m not sure if this is even normal?",26Oct2019,1
215,"Hi dear Redditors,

I'm writing this in hopes that I can help my fiance (soon to be wife) to turn her career around. A bit of a background story: we are a Hungarian couple (30f, 30m) who moved over to Dublin in hopes for a better life. Herself started initially in a café place where she worked for almost 2 years (started as a junior barista and managed to become an assistant manager) then she changed jobs (her current job) and started working in a wine bar/restaurant a year ago and she is still working next to a coffee machine and grinder (damaging her hearing day to day) making the best coffee in the area. 

Now before we moved here she just finished her Masters by writing and defending her thesis on cellular aging and prevention of it. Now she is at the stage where she lost her confidence and belief in her being capable to achieve anything. Making her one step closer to be clinically depressed. Not a week passes by without her having a burst out cry session.

The only thing making it harder is that every time me or her parents are trying to prove her that she is and can be great in anything she puts her mind to.

The fact that she is not getting any response for her applications for jobs in the industry (pharma or biotech) doesn't help either.

I'm desperate to figure out how can I make her career start.",26Oct2019,1

217,"So I've been into anime for about 10 years now and I have a love-hate relationship with it. **this post is slightly age inappropriate**. I keep quiet about my interest in anime; I virtually never talk about it and I make sure nobody finds out. I truly fear being called a ""weeb"" and how it'll tarnish the kind and scholarly reputation that I try to create. To tell you how deep I'm into my obsession (aside from the sheer amount of episodes I've watched), I've completed several manga, my current favorite music genre is J-rock, when I play piano I play anime music, I play anime video games, and I currently use a less than legal streaming service to access the less widely broadcasted shows. 
     Anime has been detrimental to my life in that all the time that I spend on it is time taken away from more productive things such as academics, which I need all the time I can get for. In addition, every few days, I give into the urge and look up anime hentai. I sometimes also make amateur ecchi drawings (both forms of porn). This is a habit I definitely want to break. Being into anime means walking close to the border between the pure and the impure. I want to stop myself from crossing. Is the solution to give up on anime for good?
     However, I cant deny that I enjoy the deeper conversations that these shows have and the artistry in every frame or the creativity that goes into every painting. Lately, I've been wondering what life would be like if I joined the anime club? What new friends would I gain? Which current friends would I lose?
     Ideally, I would totally forget about anime, and and instead be that perfect student that truly enjoys studying and investing into their future. However, that might be a tough transformation to make. Don't get me wrong though, one of my beliefs is that you can turn yourself into anybody if you try hard enough.
    Anime was my main interest during my most impressionable years, so it's going to be a hard habit to get rid of. My question is, what should my path be going forward? Should I completely cut ties with it and find more academic pastimes like chess or can I break my habits without completely giving up my interests or is there another path? And additionally, How do I achieve this path which you suggest. Thankyou, I've been struggling with this for years.",26Oct2019,0
219,"sorry long post: im a 17 y/o girl, my best friend is the same age and so is her ex. my best friend is my world and were pretty inseparable. they dated for about 2 months back in january and didnt talk until about 3 months ago when we all started hanging out with other friends as a big group and since weve all spent most weekends together. shes been over him for the most part, but it was also what she considers her first love and i know that its a weird thing for her to deal with since were partying over his house all the time. i would have never thought twice about him until we had a super deep talk one night and really connected. from that night and on he has told me hes in love with me; granted i took it with a grain of salt since most guys our age only want one thing. but he has shown that he does have genuine feelings for me, he always asks about my day, tries to see me whenever he can and he calls me every night just to talk for hours. my best friend means so much to me and knows none of this. last week i agreed to hang out with him alone, we wound up hooking up, which i felt ridiculously guilty about. i would be fine with nothing more than that, but he wants more and tells me every day how much hed do anything to be with me. honestly i do have genuine feelings for him and want to be with him too, but cant because i care so much for my friend. ive told him before that i dont want to hurt him and that we should both move on for the sake of my friendship, but he hasnt been able to and neither have i. im at a crossroads right now because i dont want to lose either of them, and i know its rare to find a connection like this that the person would fight for and nothing stops the feelings we both have. what do i do!!!!",26Oct2019,1
220,"[28, M] I’ve always been into fashion and consider myself a collector of luxury apparel. I’m not rich at all, I simply work hard for these things, and I really like wearing them. 

My issue lies with the assumption that people might have, and that assumption is that I look down on others who wear affordable apparel. I also think I come off as a narcissistic asshole before I even have a chance to open my mouth. I’m honestly very outgoing and get along with everyone I meet, that’s why it’s kinda frustrating to think that others are looking at my in a different light before I even have a chance.

222,"5 years ago I knew this girl in class. We had a big crush on each other, but to be honest I fell in love with her at first sight. I was really shy and she was really shy as well. I never asked her out because I was too shy. 

Despite this I helped her with certain things such as her interview prep for university. 

5 years passed and a lot happend. I got really sick, but I fully recovered which was very lucky for someone who had my condition. I also developed an anxiety disorder because someone did something horrible to me. I don't want to talk about it because I'll get a panic attack as I always do when I bring it up. I always had an overthinking issue, but this had gone way out of control. 

My anxiety got so bad that I was thinking about that incident for every second of every day. I could only sleep about 2-3 hours a day. I couldn't even watch TV because I kept seeing they event on the screen.

 My doctors were absolutely shocked when I told them. I was ruminating about it and I had catastrophic thinking. I thought everybody would find out about it on the internet and it would ruin my life. I thought I could never get hired because someone will know about it if they Google my name. This led me to constantly search the internet for myself and that event. 

I way given medication, but it really didn't help. I even started to get serious suicidal thoughts to the point where I was looking for buildings to jump off of. I found one and I was close to doing it. Sometimes I regret that I didn't. 

I was supposed to get psychotherapy, but I was on a waiting list that lasted months. 

I was also in my house almost 24/7. I couldn't go outside because I kept on thinking everybody saw me on the internet and they were laughing at me and talking behind my back. I was absolutely losing it. I really mean that. I was in the brink of insanity. I felt so isolated and I didn't have anybody to talk to about anything. 

I also cut contact with all my friends and some of my family thinking that they've seen me on the internet and they're laughing at me behind my back. Nobody could contact me at all. 

After my suicidal thoughts I started thinking about that girl again. I knew she wouldn't like me anymore and we hadn't seen each other in years. My anxiety was killing me and I started ruminating about her. I thought she would be remember me and we could catch up. I was also desperate to talk to someone. 

I couldn't find her on Facebook and I assumed she shut her account down as she would be working now. I found her on Linkedin. I decided to make an account and message her. The thing is my profile was empty. I had nothing on there because I've been recovering from my illness for years so I haven't been to university. She had all sorts of stuff. 

I asked her if she could email me and I congratulated her on her degree and her job and I wished her well. I knew where she went to university anyway  because I helped her with her interview prep, but I didn't know where she worked. 

I wanted her to email me instead of using LinkedIn because I didn't want anybody finding out that I've connected with her. My profile was basically empty and looked out of place and  if people found out she connected with someone like that then I was worried it would affect her. 

She looked at my profile for 2 days, but didn't say anything so I deleted my account. I figured she probably thought it was a trick or something. I didn't even realise how stupid I was because I was so exhausted due to the anxiety and insomnia. 

A few months past and I got really anxious and lonely. I decided to make a Facebook account to reconnect with my old friends. I thought about her again and I decided to try something different in the search index. I found her.

I sent her a friend request and a few messages. I told her I was really sorry for contacting her on LinkedIn and that I couldn't find her on Facebook so that's why I did it. I couldn't apologise enough. 

This part is going to sound like a lie, but I've decided to do a very similar course to what she did and preferably at the same university. I told her that I needed some advice because if she tells me something about the course I don't like then I may not do it. She's the only one I've ever known to do they course, let alone at the same university I want to apply to. I also explained why I was interested in the course. In fact, I decided not to do it because I found out something about it. I dodged a bullet. 

I also explained about how I had a serious medical condition and that's why I haven't been to university yet and that I made a Facebook account to reconnect with old friends. 

She rejected my friend request and never responded to my messages. Obviously, she doesn't want to speak to me. That's fine and I haven't contacted her since and I have no intention of doing so. 

**Here's my issue**: One of the things I said to her was: **To be honest, I regret not speaking to you all those years ago**. 

I know that sounds like I want to ask her or that I like her, but honestly I didn't mean it that way. I can't tell you how many times I typed and deleted that part because I knew she could take it the wrong way. She's a very intelligent and well rounded person and that's why I said that. I wish I got to know her more because of that. **I know it sounds like I'm lying, but I swear that's the truth**. 

I was so anxious and sleep deprived that I couldn't think about what I was typing. This was all a terrible idea, but I couldn't see that at the time. I was just desperate to get rid of the anxiety. 

I'm really not interested in her anymore and I contacted her purely to relief the anxiety because I was going insane and I was exhausted. **I could have contacted her anytime in the past, but I'm never did because I had no feelings for her**. I swear it was because of my anxiety. 

**Im absolutely terrified that she's going to screenshot what I said and share it around the internet. I'm even worried that she has shared it on her timeline already**. 

I keep thinking someone, such as employer, is going to Google me and see those messages. That will leave me to not get hired. I'm worried about being blacklisted by employees and just being shunned by society. 

I'm honestly terrified and I even had a mental health crisis about a week ago where I was getting suicidal thoughts. I'm starting to feel suicidal again. I keep thinking about that building. I've been up there before. It's easy to jump. Nobody could stop me. 

I'm on medication right now, but it's gonna take a couple of months to work and I'm on a waiting list for psychotherapy and that should be about 4 months. 

**I can't get over the fact that I said** ""To be honest, I regret not speaking to you all those years ago"". 

It's making me go insane. Nobody will believe that I didn't mean it in that way when they see it. They're gonna think I'm a creep. I couldn't do anything all day. I just sat I'm bedroom thinking about that sentence all day. I couldn't even study or anything. 

I know I need help, but I didn't know what to do. **Please believe me**. I didn't mean to say that to her. I really didn't, but nobody is gonna believe me and I know she's going to screenshot that message. My life is going to be ruined and I don't know what to do. 

Please help me. I'm getting suicidal thoughts again.

223,"Just some background info... I’m 16 and I live with my parents. 

Any advice on anything would be so helpful... halfway through I couldn’t even think of ways to word how I wanted advice, I’m sorry. Just an opinion at all would be helpful. 

**My parents’ relationship**

This is going to be a rant, and not about advice, I promise the rest will be asking for advice. I’m sorry.

My parents have always had a bad relationship. They fight pretty much nightly, getting so loud that the neighbors have called the police on them, multiple times. They’ve even done it when I had friends over night. 

They usually try to rope me into it, too. Something like “You crazy b****, you’re fighting in front of the kids!” or something like that. 

I actually keep a journal of their fights... and I’m embarrassed to admit it’s easily over thirty large paragraphs worth of text. If it’s needed for anything, I’d be willing to describe a fight or two, but you can certainly understand why I’d be reluctant. 

**Self Esteem** 

I’ve always had a really really bad self esteem. It’s a bit strong to say, but at this point I flat out hate myself. The phrase “hating yourself” is thrown around pretty easily... but I honestly and genuinely do. 

I’m really ashamed to admit, but I have a habit of messaging older men online... you know what for... because I really like the attention and everything that they give me. Even if it’s just a temporary, superficial boost to my self esteem is worth it, to me. 

You can obviously imagine why I’d wanna stop, advice on how to even come to terms with it, and move on would really be appreciated.

**Therapy** 

I can imagine someone’s first response would be to get therapy, mine is too. My parents, are really against therapy as a whole, though. 

They scoff whenever therapy is mentioned on tv, and say it’s for wusses. Because I’m a minor, I’m not allowed to go to a therapist without their permission, and I know they’d be mad at me for even insinuating. They used to even get mad at me when I cried, so you can understand why I’d be nervous about asking. 

**Eating Disorder** 

I’ve been overweight ever since I was 7-8. Freshman year of High School, I weighed 278 pounds. Currently I’ve dropped around 40 pounds, but I can’t help but feel like I’m cheating, and I haven’t earned a single one. 

I’m really ashamed to say it, but I think I have an eating disorder. I don’t eat breakfast, or lunch, and if I can, I avoid dinner. If I can’t, I’ll try to find an opportunity to throw up, but I can’t usually. 

I know it’s really dangerous, but I can’t help but justify it with “I’d rather die than continue living with myself like this,” and that thought scares me so much. 

I don’t even know how to phrase this one... I just want some advice, at all, about this. 

**My Mood as a Whole**

Recently, really across the last year, it’s felt like I’m not in control of my mood. It feels like I switch from one emotion to the other before I even realize it, which I’d hardly noticed until my brother yelled at me for it. 

Usually I just feel down, like my stomach is just slowly sinking. 

**Comparing my problems to others** 

I can’t help but compare my problems to others. I feel really entitled when I complain about something in my life, when someone else has, and is going through something so much worse than anything I could dream of. 

The other day my friend told me she was sexually assaulted a while ago, and ever since then I’ve just felt extra stupid.

226,"I started working this part-time job officially at the end of September early October of this year. I only took this job because I was pressured by my family to take it and they basically berated me for it everyday since it is close to my home, despite me not wanting to work that position. Well, I finally got a full-time job eslewhere and they offered me the role yesterday. I said I could start soon and now they want me to start Monday but I never told my boss anything. I do not feel comfortable reaching out to my boss because I barely get to see him/speak with him and I feel lost at this position because I feel responsible for doing work that I have no experience with. I hate myself for letting my family pressure me into it but I can't take this job anymore. I went in today and left my key, ID, and walkie-talkie in my ''office''( empty classroom) and left through a back exit so I wouldn't be seen. Where I fucked up was not leaving my logsheet wih my work hours there and now I am afraid of going back to work because I know they will ask me why I left stuff there. I was thinking of screenshotting and leaving my hours there or reaching out to a co-worker/neighbor to turn it in for me. I am afraid my boss will not understand at all why I am leaving especially since the program I was supposed to help implement starts on the 4th of November. I have mental health issues to sort out and I cannot take working at that job any longer because I feel like I am going to have a meltdown there in front of everyone.

almost three years ago i started losing weight via calorie counting. i went from a bmi of 28 to a bmi of 21. i was ravenous at my lowest weight and began binging, all the way back to a bmi around 25. i’ve since been losing and gaining the same ten pounds. i try to eat healthy and moderately but i always end up binging, hard. i started prolonged fasting to deal with it. i started making myself vomit to deal with it. but i can’t fucking stop. i can’t just eat at a deficit like i used to and i have no idea why. my body image is horrendous, probably way worse than it was when i was nearing obesity. i am such a mess in so many ways, i am dealing with pretty bad anxiety and depression and now this too?

Context-------- 

I had liked this guy for awhile now, and had found out he was fluid, first time anyone I have liked who I knew was into (could get into) guys. We started talking immediately, he knew right off the bat I was gay, then proceeded to start talking about this guy he was texting. This became a daily/weekly thing... and each time, new person/ex. 

I got the idea that: a) he didn't stick around too long, and b) he didn't like me enough to date me. Keep in mind, we are good friends by this point, he's a physical person (gives hugs) and we'd occas. cuddle in class. (Friendly cuddling[?]) Eventually I decided to get over it.

Then after I thought I was finally over it, he decides to just out of the blue, asks me to date him, over. text... I still said yes. Long story short, it lasted 1 day. I blame myself for not seeing what would happen. But things are really awkward between us, I tried recuperating our friendship but...

My brother is a young, talented ballet dancer. A year and a half ago he went to a ballet school in the US(we're from EU) in a state where weed is legalized. My mother had mixed feelings about this, she was/is worried sick and proud of her son.

This summer he returned on vacation and he brought a vape pen alpng with a marijuana capsule, of some sort(I don't know a lot about this stuff). My mother got really angry and dissapointed with him but my father went through the exact same thing when he was young. So my parents are split on how to deal with him smoking when he is away. This has led to a whole lot of tension in my family.

He went back to school late august this year. A couple of weeks ago, my mom called me and let me know that he had a panic attack and was coming home.

243,I just really need someone to listen to me right now,26Oct2019,1
244,"My cousin and his wife (and most of my extended family) live in another country so I don't know too many things about him, but here's the few I do know that are true: He's very cheap, his mother (my father’s sister) was abused by her husband, his family all wanted him to break up another women's marriage year before he got married because they thought she was rich; his wife is sick with multiple sclerosis. 

So basically, my uncle received a phone call from my cousin’s wife that on the day my other cousin was supposed to be married and she said she went out to buy him a present, when she got back he beat her up and she couldn't deal with his constant abuse anymore and that he’s been doing it for years. My uncle then heard a few stories from everyone and here's what they both said:

Cousin #1: He said he has a drinking problem and goes to frequently prostitutes. He said he’s called him multiple times drunk saying he wishes his wife was dead from MS so he doesn't have to pay for his medication anymore; and complains for all the money he has to spend on his wife and kids.  

Cousin #2: He said that he heard the prostitute thing from the other cousin and believed him since he has a penchant for doing perverted things all the time ever since they all were kids. One time he was at his house asked what these weird binoculars on this table were for and he said it was to watch a girl in the house across the street. He was saying it like a joke, but my cousin said that it seems like there was truth to that. (Okay this comment isn’t too pertinent but I’m just adding everything that was said).

What my uncle heard: When she called him she was saying that he hits her repeatedly ever since they’ve been married and his mom (who lives with them and was abused herself) watches him hit her like she’s watching TV and then just says “that’s just what husbands do”.

The (alleged abuser) cousin’s sister (my other cousin): She came to visit the US (where we are), after asking my father to sponsor her family for a visiting visa and once they got here they basically never left. They are now pressuring my father (who owns a medical practice) to sponsor her husband for a work visa for a made-up job. My father said multiple times that he cannot do this, and that is against the law; so they hired their own lawyer and made a fake wanted ad (which I guess is step one needed to sponsor someone) in my dad’s name saying he needs a worker and basically trapped my dad into doing this. Not only that but somehow they were able to go on Medicare in California (I have no idea how), have a government provided house worker who comes to their house five days a week (again, I have no idea how), and enrolled their kids in public school, all on a travel visa. She also said multiple times how her bothers wife has such an easy life because she was lucky enough to marry someone like her brother even though ""she was nothing"". They both inherited money and neither of them have actual jobs. When we all found out she was diagnosed with MS her first response was to tell her brother that he needs to take care of himself physically and he needs to go to the gym and dress nicely and “keep his appearance up”, which is pretty nonsensical advice to give someone whose wife was diagnosed with MS. 

My uncle called my dad and my dad then called my cousins wife: She said that the prostitution and alcohol thing is untrue and he’s a very good father to his kids. She said he does hit her many times and there was a time when he pulled her out of the car to hit her, but she then blamed herself saying that it’s because of the way she talks. My father told her that nothing justifies it and asked if there’s anything he can do. She told him that she doesn’t want to leave him, she wants them to be a family since she knows she’s dying anyways, she just wants him to stop hitting her. My dad said he’ll do anything for her. But when he got off the phone he still did not believe her and said my uncle (his brother) just makes things up even though he just heard it from her. 

Then all of a sudden, my cousin’s wife blocked my mom’s phone number, and my uncle said she called him saying he found out that she talked to my dad and forced her to delete all of her phone numbers and block everyone. She had my uncles number memorized and called him to let him know what happened. My uncle called my dad who later than night finally called my cousin this is what he said. I was at college when the phone call happened but my sister was home that weekend and said he was on the verge of tears and said this:

He said he has hit her twice (which is two too many in my opinion, but in my culture apparently is completely normal) and they were both because he was afraid for her and his kids. Apparently he has a cousin who is actively trying to kill him for land that was split up between all of them (Yes, I know how ridiculous this sounds) and he was upset the day of the wedding because she left without a guard accompanying her and her son, and he said he “only” pushed her around a little. He got the most upset that everyone said he didn’t want to pay for his wife’s MS medication and that he was driving her all around the country to doctor appointments and paying for all of it out of pocket. She was on speaker phone with him and confirmed everything. He said he made her delete her contacts out of anger but felt immediately bad right after, and she said she just called my uncle out of revenge and exaggerated everything. 

Everyone in my family believes him except me and felt really bad for everything he went through. They said that all of my cousins made up things because they were all really competitive growing up and they have resentment towards each other. They all 100% believe them and were making fun of my uncle saying he had a penchant for exaggerating and he put all these stories together and things like that. My dad grew up with them and basically helped raise him before he moved so I know he didn’t want to believe any of this, but I’m not sure what to believe and if there’s anything I can do. Everyone in my immediate family now believes him except me, but they’re saying I don’t believe him because of everyone his sister is forcing my father to do: but that just speaks to the character of their family: their father was an abuser, they don’t think the rules of law apply to them, they scammed the US government out of resources, they were okay with him trying to break up another women’s marriage because they thought she was rich, they think they’re better than everyone because they inherited money?

247,"Friend ghosted 15 of us

I have a friend (26f) we’ll call Diana. We’ve been close friends for three years. We met at Uni and bonded instantly. We’re both from the same country and we’re the oldest students (I’m in my 30s) in our small class of 18.

Our instructors were extremely abusive. I won’t go into details but at least four of us made formal complaints against them. I’m also in therapy to help me move beyond the abuse. It was horrible. Naturally, my class mostly bonded together very closely. We still are extremely close despite graduating months ago. 

Diana and I were great friends and we talked about how we felt like sisters. She was the one to call me her sister first. She was ecstatic when I got engaged. 

Her plans after graduation were to move back to our home country. I’m staying as I am getting married. In this day and age staying in touch isn’t hard. 

Diana was thrilled when I asked her to be a bridesmaid for the wedding in our home country. At graduation we all stood in a circle crying because we had made it through when most of us thought we wouldn’t. We graduated because we supported each other through a horrible time. Diana was leaving to go home two days after graduation so it was the last time I saw her before she left. 

I hugged her and she promised to keep in touch.  She kept talking about how she was so excited to see me at my wedding and was planning on visiting all of us in October. 

After graduation things settled down. I heard a little bit from her here and there. She was moving to a new area in our country and was settling into her new job. When I didn’t hear back from her I brushed it off as she’s adjusting to being back home and has a lot going on. 

Our other friends started to ask if I had heard from her. I thought it was odd none of us had heard from her but it was still fairly soon after she had moved home. All messages went unseen. 

Two of our friends were really trying to get ahold of her as they had been living together and needed to get in touch to finish housing stuff ie deposit return. Diana would never respond to them. They asked if I had heard from her. I hadn’t heard from her in over two months. 

I was getting worried. I messaged her about the wedding just to see what happened. We had just booked the venue in my home country and had an official date. She immediately responded positively and said how excited she was. I relaxed a bit because at least she was ok. 

A month goes by and no one has heard anything from her and her response about the wedding is the last she’s contacted me. The two friends she lived with ask me to help them get in touch with her as they can’t get their deposit back until she responds. At this point I’m very worried no one is hearing from her. 

I messaged her and wrote a message asking if she was ok. I told her I was worried as multiple people kept asking me if I had heard from her. I told her I understood if she needed to walk away from our friendships because of how horrible our Uni was but just to say that and I would understand. I mentioned the two who were trying to get in touch for the deposit. I finished the message saying I was worried and I hoped she wasn’t being silent because she was in a bad place mentally and told her I was there if she needed me and loved her. 

She responded back immediately saying she was fine. She just was swamped with moving, her new job, and seeing people she hadn’t seen because she’d been out of the country. I told her I was glad she was ok and missed her. I wished her well on her move. 

She never contacted to two about the deposit. She was avoiding them so badly that they had to message her parents to try and get in touch. They said that they would inform her eighth away. Diana finally responded with a short message confirming what she needed to get the deposit. 

To my knowledge no one from Uni has heard from her since. I messaged her about the wedding date in the country I’m currently living in over a month ago and she hasn’t read it. 

I’m heartbroken and I miss my friend. We are now at the end of October and it is obvious she is not visiting. I can understand that as tickets are expensive. What I’m having trouble dealing with is the silence. We leaned on each other so much in the last three years and now it’s like there is a massive hole where she was. 

I figured our communication would wane as being by thousands of miles apart can slow friendships down. I never thought she would ghost me though. 

I’m not sure what to do at this point. I’m sad my friend has left my life so abruptly and wish I knew why. Do I still try and reach out to her? I need to know if she’s still coming to the wedding. I can message her asking her new towns name so I know what resources I have for her bridesmaid dress. I’m not sure I want her in my wedding though if she’s just going to ghost me the rest of the time. I miss my friend. Do I try to reach out knowing I might not get a response or have her pull out of the wedding? Both would hurt. I’m just so confused as to why she’s ghosted so many of us.

252,"So let's give some context. I live in an apartment complex with 3 other roommates, 2 in each room. My downstairs neighbors have come to complain about us making too much noise 4 times now in the past 5 months. The first time everyone was asleep because it was dead I  the night but they came banging on the door insisting it was us who were ""running around, stomping, and dropping things"". We answered the door and dealt with them and moved on. The second time they came and yelled at us around 9pm because we had some guests over and we being ""too loud and stomping once again"". It was a friday night and quiet hours dont starts until 10 pm but we didn't want to deal with them so we asked everyone to leave. But then the third time everyone was asleep and it was around 1:30 am. Nobody was making any noise. Yet they came up once again and banged on our to argue and yell about us about ""running around and dropping things again"". We genuinely have no idea what they were talking about, but they are very insistent and wanted to start arguing with us. But when we tried to explain it wasnt us they started yelling and started threatening us because we ""disrespected them"". At this point we drew the line and talked the office about how they were starting to get aggressive and how they are making us feel unsafe in our own home. We have tried ways of mitigating our walking by getting slippers, putting rugs down, and even changing how we walk in the apartment. But apparently none of these worked. So the front office/housing manager basically wrote a small report and told us to call the security officers if they come again.
Fast forward to the past week, I had some guests over and it was a Friday night. At around 9:10 pm they came banging on the door to start another fight so I just called the security and they came to deal with it. They came over and went to talk to them to diffuse the situation. They then came to me and talked me through what was happening. They went to their apartment and stood in their and from their own experience noticed that we were little to no noise and that it was obvious we were trying to keep it to a minimum. They basically told us to try and keep it down even more and ask the housing manager again for help in the morning. I want to know what rights or actions I can take because the neighbors never want to have civil conversations and are always very very aggressive to the point where I do not feel safe being in the same area. Us being college students make is very hard to go and move to a new apartment and we are signed onto a contract so breaking that would cost us money we dont have. What do I do?",26Oct2019,3

255,"I feel like I've been screwed by my parent's choices. This is a long story so bear with me. 

My family is US military so we've been moved around a lot. My parents don't get along much at all. They met in a club, father was already in, and they got married. Then they had me; I am the oldest. In 3rd grade or so, I made honor-roll. Just good at basic math early, but this probably influenced later decisions. Few grades later, my mother decided to home-school me and my other siblings. We were Christian so it was mainly a desire to keep away from secular schools. It wasn't a big desire since we alternated between home-school and normal school a few times during my life. One thing to note was my father could be quite an asshole, a few times falling into abuse, but just over all scary to young me. Once, I got mad at him for something stupid and he threatened to kill me. He is not as bad now, but he still scares me, even though we can get along quite nice sometimes. 

Anyway, nothing else of note happened until a moved to a particular city. I loved it here. I made a great group of friends, met my first girlfriend, it was the happiest time of my life... for a single year. We had to move overseas. I was really mad and my parents didn't help much at all. The usual, I'll make new friends and all that. Only, I developed a case of really bad anxiety over there that still affects me several years later. My mother also home-schooled me on off for high school. We moved back to the states and I turned 18. I had no idea what to do with my life, so my parents get fed up with me and pushed me into college. I decided that I might as well take up computer networking since I took a class in high school. 

I took out some student loans for four classes; just enough to learn to get a CCNA (networking certificate). However, my parents were not happy with that; they wanted to use my dad's GI bill (basically military scholarship) to take more classes and they could get the  housing allotment that came with it. I did get some of that money, but they got most of it. I was only doing this, because I had no real choice in the matter. I never wanted to use my dad's GI bill. 

Now, I have enough certificate to get hired at a government contractor for an important military installation. I had to get an interim security clearance. I started work this week. Everything seemed fine until today. My team lead was teaching something that I did not understand. He was taking jabs at me as well. Not overly hostile, but mean jabs. I started getting flustered and frustrated. I was holding back tears while I was thinking about everything that lead to this point. 

I've been screwed by my parents. They expected too much of me. A ""B"" in a class wasn't good enough. They got mad at me for not having a job when we moved to one of the worst towns for one. One where I was lucky enough to get a job for three months at a store going out of business. They got mad at me for not wanting to take my dad's GI  bill. They got mad at me for not taking more student loans so I could keep my dependent benefits, because I was turning 21. They also screwed my out of proper social skills. They home-schooled when I should have been socializing with more kids than just my one friend and other home-schooled kids. I was never allowed to talk back or I would be threatened with something. Even now, **at 21**, if an argument gets heated with my mother, she will threaten to take everything out of my room. 

Now I'm stuck with a fear of other people, authority, and assholes. I can't do this job. My salary is 45,000, but what is that worth if I am going to be constantly in fear of a mental break. I could get fired, then I would be right fucked at work, and especially at home. I have no idea what to do. Running away and starting a new life is a tempting option in the back of my mind, but that would come with a great cost to what little I still treasure. Do any of you have any idea what I should do?",26Oct2019,1
256,"I don’t have a solid friend I see every single day. Mostly because I prefer solitude at times. Technically I have a friend’s house keys that I can go to any time and have a couple friends there to be around, but I have stayed away for a while because I don’t like staying in a dim house watching Netflix all day.

Last week I went out with some other friends. This week the friends went out without me and I felt a sense of sadness.

When I feel this sadness, I think of all the people in less fortunate situations who not only don’t have the opportunity to hang out with friends but also have no place to live and I get even more sad.

I try to relax into the sadness by thinking about Jesus Christ and feel like the being alone and feeling sad is not a big deal and I should be stronger emotionally/spiritually.

Or I will focus into my eternal conscious being that still remains after the sadness is gone and just sit with the sadness and not attach to it too much.

Or I will tell myself that God is the reason I am in this situation because in the past when I was left out I ended up meeting a stranger and had a meaningful conversation or went home and watched an insightful video so even though I don’t enjoy the place God is taking me, a lot of times it seems to teach me something to help mw necessarily grow or contribute to someone.

Is there any other way to view a situation of feeling left out or unfortunate?",26Oct2019,1
257,"Hey! So, I was in a year long relationship with a guy. He left me unexpectedly and it really broke me, because we had such a good relationship. He just wasn't ready to get serious. Currently I've been in a serious relationship for a year, but recently I've started having these dreams about my ex almost every night. All of these dreams have been us either getting back together or me trying to talk to him, being very emotional about it. I'm starting to think that I maybe have some unresolved issues that I'm not aware of. I'm not looking to get back together with him, because I'm very happy in my current relationship, but should I text my ex and talk to him?",26Oct2019,1
258,"I’m not a person who opens up a lot to many people. I have a small circle of friends because of this, as I have a hard time connecting with people without properly getting to know them.

About a year and a half ago, I made friends with this person at work. He was really cool, we shared a lot of similarties but there were huge differences too. 

Due to this combination we quickly grew into really good friends. I used to see him at work and we’d go to the gym together (he had convinced me to join after hearing me say I didn’t like the way I looked) 


After a while, it ended up being too much, seeing someone all day every day for maybe 5-6 times a week, as well as messaging in between and playing video games together.

Rightfully so, the friendship began pulling back. 

But by then what I had failed to realise was that I’d developed feelings for him. I had only come out of the closet a few months prior and don’t have any experience with relationships. So I began to find it difficult to pull back, but I never understood why. When I came out to him, prior to having feelings, he was by far the most supportive and wonderful friend. He never treated me any different.

We were there for each other a lot during our friendship. We had similar family situations and got each other through it by talking to each other. So much so, I began to feel like his sister was the sibling I never had.

I never made a move and never in a million years would I have done so. I knew he wasn’t interested. But I learned quickly that what your head wants and what your heart wants are two totally different things.

I told him that I had these feelings one day, but I did so because we both value honesty a lot and I struggle with not being a transparent person. I vowed to him that I knew where he stood and that I would work my hardest to get over them.

But I made mistakes and never took a step back to gain perspective. Had I have done so, I would have known to have given myself some time away to get over it.

Eventually, it became too much and he wanted to take a break.

To cut a longer story short, we never really recovered as friends.

After the break my feelings for him went away, as we both suspected it would in time. But he told me he felt a lot more anxious around me now, that he was afraid because of the past.

I understood, and after a really long talk we agreed that we needed to take a massive step back and just see/talk to each other a lot less.

It took a while to get used to, but we got there. It’s now been about a year since this talk. 

What happens, is we text once a fortnight. I always want to talk more, but I respected his boundary by only responding.

I had planned to go to the US for holiday. I asked him if he wanted to catch up in person before I left. I knew this would be risky, but I had hoped that with all the time that has passed he would see that so much had changed. Or maybe I had prayed he would give me a chance to prove that I had learned from this all.

He didn’t respond.

Two days before I left, we saw each other at a birthday party. There, we sat, and while I was a little tipsier than I would have preferred, we talked again. He said he still felt the same way. I, incredibly crestfallen, had asked if he believed the situation was the same.

He said he knew that I had changed for the better, that it was not the same at all.  That he knew I would never make the same mistakes again, But he didn’t want to “be friends that saw each other outside of events”

I asked whether there was ever a moment where he liked spending time with me, and he said, during the very beginning. I finally asked, albeit a lot more tearfully than I would have liked, why he never believed it would go back to the way it was. He didn’t really answer.

He admitted that he too had not been the best friend he could have. I knew that during the break he had talked about it all with mutual friends, which surprised me. In it, he painted me in a very bad way. Both of our personalities had always been the same on this, that we both didn’t talk bad about someone to others.

What I took from that, was that the situation would never improve. Maybe that wasn’t the message he was trying to send. But after months of agonising over every response, ensuring that I didn’t step on toes during every interaction, it felt like there was no reciprocation. That we would always be friends that corresponded and nothing more.

I know this probably sounds dumb, but I wanted more. I wanted a friend that I could play video games with, that wanted to come hang out with me. That wanted to go to the beach like we used to. Maybe I reminisce too much, but I just wanted a friend. What he wanted sounds like the relationship I have with a uni professor.

So I said I understood and I left. We actually left it on good terms, considering. The next morning I felt awful about it and deleted him from my social media. Not because I hate him - I don’t. I will always hold a soft spot for the friendship, it helped me through a lot of dark times and taught me a lot.

But I needed to try to heal, and work out my life away from him. I hate to admit it, but my heart hurts from it all. There was a stage in my life where he was my best friend. 

I worked very hard to be a better person and to learn from my mistakes. I’m glad to have gone through this and learn from it, I had just hoped to not have lost him in the process.

I have found gaining distance from him to be hard though. We work together, we have a lot of mutual friends (I introduced him to my friendship circle - to which he is still friends with to this day). I have NEVER been the one to talk bad about anyone and I have always been the type to forgive, rather than hate.

It kills me to see him at work, that he looks so unphased by it all. I have yet to show any sort of emotion about it since, but it gives me the impression that I placed a lot more importance on the friendship than he did.

His sister now works at the same place we both do, I’m also really unsure how to approach that situation. I want to be respectful of the situation, but I have no problems with her and actually like her a good amount.

Reddit, I know the problem is almost exclusively in my head, but I can’t wrap my head around this all. I’ve never experience a bad breakup relationship or friendship wise. 

Ultimately, as ridiculous as this sounds, and I know it does, I would like to reconcile as friends. I have always known him to be the kindest, best person I’ve ever met. I know he has his flaws, but everyone does. But I’m not holding my breath. I’m also not going to be the one who initates it, I can’t put myself through that obstacle course again.

Which leads me to the question, what do I do about this all? How do I get over this sadness? I find myself getting reminded of him all of the time. Small things trigger memories that make me feel sad. I’m not the best at my own emotions so I have been stuck on this sad loop for weeks.

I’m not debilitated by it all, but it’s taken a toll on my happiness.",26Oct2019,1
259,"Man I don’t even know if I’m looking for advice or need someone to talk to or just to rant...but sorry for the long post. 

However I ask you If you’ve overcome being a pushover in life PLEASE read through and help me get some courage and guidance.
I’ll try to keep this as not boring as I possibly can.....

A friend and I were on a long weekend road trip in his mid 90s Lexus when He bought up that I mentioned that I was looking at selling my ‘02 Civic for $1500.

Him: “Yo I know you like cars and you can’t live without them (no idea where he got that from but not true)
How about I take your civic and you give me another $1500 and I’ll sell you this Lexus?” (So about $3000 in all) 

I didn’t think he was serious....and I didn’t want to rudely say ‘NO!’ So I played along:

- Me: haha your Lexus is so comfy and good for road trips. (Note that I never said the word yes)

Throughout the road trip he kept telling me the cool features of the car. Then a couple hours later:

- Him: “man I’m actually glad I’m selling you this car so I can see it whenever I want and its not with some stranger”

What???? I’m buying his car? how did it get to this...I tried clearing stuff out mildly.

- Me: Yeah I actually can’t afford an additional $1500 right now.

Him: “oh? Student loans?”

Me: “yeah haha student loans.” (I don’t have student loans) “I’m trying to pay them off in the next 2-3 months...

Him: Well I know you like this car” (I was just being polite)...”so I’ll give you the car now and you can pay me the $1500 after you pay off your loans in 3 months.”

I didn’t want to say that I’m actually trying to save up $10000 in case I ever wanted to move cities like I always planned. 
I would say I’m building an emergency fund but then I’d have to hear a lecture about how 22 year olds like me shouldn’t think about money too much and should enjoy their youth and passions (he thinks my passion is cars...and that’s just because Im polite enough to pretend not to be bored when he’s droning on and on and on about cars)

So what’d I do? I said “I’ll have to think about it. It’s not insignificant money.” Then I changed the topic. 

4 DAYS on that road trip we went through THE EXACT SAME CYCLE multiple times daily....he praises the car.....I express doubt (but never strongly decline or accept)....then I get some lecture about why buying it is the smart investment....then I change the topic....

Cut to today....2 weeks after the road trip.

Him: Hey I have a guy who wants to see your car. Let’s sell it for $1800. Bring it over I can polish it.

I was glad. Finally I was getting rid of my civic and adding $1500 to my savings account. I said that to him as he polished it.

Me: man this works out great. I get $1500...you get $300...your guy gets a car...

Him: Yeah but ummm...you’re not getting $1500 :/.....

Me: what?

Him: You’re buying my car remember? 

Me: But I said I can’t afford it...

Him: Don’t worry. I’ll keep your $1500 from this sale. You can just pay me $1500 whenever you have it. Even months after you pay your student loans off.

Me: um actually I could use that money right now tbh.

Him: for what? Paying student loan early?

Me: Yeah....(Again, I don’t actually have student loans) 

Him: I would suggest you don’t put money from one investment into paying off debt. Because once you want a car again you’ll have to save from scratch to buy one...and that will take a long time. And you can’t live without a car (again....where did he get this from?)

That was the end of me. I literally couldn’t think of any more excuses or could talk my way out of this other than bluntly saying fuck off and ruining the friendship forever. And that’s just not me. 

He must’ve noticed me the rest of the night I was quiet, visibly disturbed, not making eye contact. I did try once more to get out of it though...

Me: Yeah well I’ll sleep on it actually I’ll tell you tomorrow at the party. 

Him: “No you ARE buying this car. (That is hands down the most assertive a persons EVER been with me.) 
Because It’s a good investment for you”........blah blah blah continued talking about why it’s a good decision.”

I literally don’t even know what to say anymore when nothing’s worked out till now. I’m just so sick of people always thinking I need their expertise and that I can’t make my own decisions (I guess I can’t?)

Before this party tomorrow night I need to set this straight with him. I know I just have to say “Buying that car is not in my best interest” but then I’d have no counter response to when he lectures me about why I need it and I’ll cave in. I don’t really want to tell him about my savings goals coz then there’ll be more questions.

So yeah tomorrow’s just gonna be probably the hardest day of my life. I’m going to have to stop being a pushover (something I’ve been my whole life) to someone assertive and firm in saying no. That’s literally the first time in my 22 years that I’ll have to do something like that. It’s a 180 degrees personality change and I’m scared. But if I don’t do it I’ll be stuck with a car I don’t want and $1500 gone from my savings account.

264,"Forgive me this will probably be a long post.

SO basically this post is to help me determine whether I'm in a Toxic Friend Group, as I honestly don't know anymore and it's usually nice to get a second opinion.

So background info first: I am a 19 year old second year college student who moved 8 hours away to a liberal arts college in downtown Chicago. I am originally from a small town in the Southern US. I don't really have that many friends here, I am fairly close with two of my roommates from last year, but our schedules make it so we can't meet up that often. I also suffer from mildly severe ADHD (that will come back later). I also should preface this, that all of these examples are things that have happened in the past two years.

Back home I have a friend group that mainly derives from a group of about 8 guys (myself included) that all met because of our church Youth Group. I graduated first out of all of them, (although I'm the third oldest of the group.) so starting there I always felt kinda left out. 

So basically I have a list of things that I will reference and hopefully someone can help me figure this out.

1. I am the one to always instigate everything. No matter what it is, I always feel like I was the one who makes plans and tries to get up to hang out, outside of the usual going to lunch after church thing we did every week. For example we all play DnD and we can never get a consistent game going as there are a lot of us and it's hard, I get that, but I'm the one who always tries to get it going and for some reason, everyone wants to play, but no one wants to put in the effort to do so. 

Also sometimes groups of them will hang out and I'll find out about and they will be like oh yeah we kinda forgot to invite you. So to me either that means they just didn't want to invite me and I found out so they felt like that had to or they actually forgot which seems worse to me.

2. I feel like I'm the group punching bag, or overall in any group I feel like that. So what I mean by this, is not what I say or do I always get made fun of for it. It could literally be anything. Basically I feel like Jerry from Parks and Recreations most of the time.

For example, I used to drink soda constantly, but have cut myself back as I've gotten older, but there's still the stigma of me being the fat kid who drank a bunch of sodas. I get any drink with no ice just because I prefer it that way for some reason I always get mocked for it.

Another example is anytime we are all having a conversation, I'm always on the fringe of it, no one ever asks me what I think of it, or for my input, which I get sometimes, but sometimes it makes me feel like I don't exist. 

Another example is I will say something when we are all hanging out and some guy will make a funny voice, because I guess my voice is easy to mock, everyone laughs. Then a few minutes later someone else will say the same thing and everyone will be like you're a genius how did you think of that. It feels like no matter what I say, it's automatically discredited because I said it.

3. I feel like a Mascot/Caricature

I mentioned this earlier that we all know each other mainly because of our Youth Group. So I also grew with not a lot of friends. I was the one bullied in school and whether or not why it happened doesn't matter anymore. I also lost my mother when I was 11 so that sucked and I tried to make new friends and for a while it seemed like it was going well, people were actually talking to me, but I soon realized it was just because they felt bad for me and a few weeks later it was back to the same old thing.

I then started going to Youth Group stuff and I loved it, I actually felt like I had people to talk to and it was cool because I was 13 and their were Seniors in High School who were actually my friends. 

So the reason I'm bringing this up is because as I didn't have really any friends growing up, so in my 13 year old brain I had to be loud, stupid, and funny to get attention for myself. I now know this was the wrong way to go about this. But in doing so I gained the title of that funny side character on a sitcom and people who joke about how I was the mascot of the Youth Group. 

So that's all I fine I guess as a 13 year old, but as I started to get older and mature, I started to hate that title and I wanted people to stop treating me like I was a kid again (in the context of all of us being around from the 11 to 18 range.) I didn't get the respect or the relationships when I was Senior with the younger members that I did with the Seniors when I was 13. Now I'm not saying I needed or expected that same relationship, but even to the people who were five years younger than me, I was still treated like a mascot. I was given that designation back in Middle School when it was kinda cute and funny, but just sad by the time I graduated. 

It was like when I was younger it was a fine thing, the best way to describe it was the cute kid on a sitcom that everyone loved and by the time I was in High School it turned into I've become just a thing to make jokes about and laugh at not what they say.

Seriously, this last summer was after my Freshman year of school and I went on a mission trip with the Youth Group because I was asked by the Youth Minister to go and no matter what I said or did everyone just laughed or someone else who find a joke about me to say.

4. In small groups this doesn't happen. I mentioned earlier that this main group of guys is around 8 people and when it's just two or three of us hanging out things are fine and we can have fun and I actually enjoy being around them, but whenever it's all of us, it's always like I've described already. I mean no matter who it is, when it's just a few of us, this doesn't happen. So I don't know why that is. 

I had fun memories of being close with this group of guys and I still enjoy seeing them and hanging out with them, but as the years have gone on, it seems like it has gotten worse. And these are the only friends I really have as I've tried so desperately to make a lasting connection, but it seems like with the people at my school.

In Summary:

Now I can acknowledge that I can be a little too much sometimes, I don't get some social cues and I can still be quite energetic, and I know that can weigh on some people that's why I brought up the ADHD. I'm sure I can get on people's nerves sometimes and I've been trying to work on it. But never once by any of these people have they told me that, it's just lets make fun of him. 

I feel like I'm constantly being pushed down by these friends and I don't know if that's just how we all act around each as it it's tough love and we mess with each other, or it's actually I'm just kept around to be the punching bag and lightning rod for everything. To me it feels like whenever I'm there every bit of tension or anything just boils down to making fun of me.

So basically all I'm asking is does it seem like this a toxic group for me or am I just in a group of people who act like this, but actually enjoy my company.

Thanks for listening to my ramblings. 

TL;DR: My closet friend group is a group of around 8 guys back home 8 hours away from my current college. As I grown up the dynamic has turned into I'm a mascot, funny side character to a punching bag who no matter what they do gets made fun of. I honestly can't tell anymore if I'm taking it the wrong way or I'm hanging out with the wrong people.",26Oct2019,1

272,"In short- tl;dr - my girlfriend screemed at my mum but I want her back still ?

For the past year I’ve dated this same woman and we have had about 14 breakups. They usually happen because something happens to upset her and she ends up saying she is leaving forever and she has left fur days or weeks and once over a month but she always comes back after I’ve apologized enough or she has forgot about what happened.
After the 14th breakup things were going well and she moved in with me and my mum. From there she has started screaming at me more and more when she doesn’t get something her way, and becomes impossible to talk to. I always take accountability for my actions that start the arguement and apologize but she never takes any responsibility for how she starts screaming and saying horrible stuff.

I am pretty used to her argueing and screaming at me like that but recently we had an arguement where this happened and she overheard my mum on the phone saying to a friend that she screams to much, her response to that was to start shouting and screaming at my mum, deflecting everything and saying my mum is the one who is always screaming. In the end my mum and I threatened to call the police because she wasn’t stopping screaming and she looks very aggressive when she is angry and screaming. She stormed out Of the house and has gone back to live with her parents, she left all her belongs here and didn’t take anything with her and just ran away.
Me and my mum have both said she isn’t being evicted and I’ve said to her that we had to threaten to call the police because of her behavior, but she has twisted it and sent me messages explaining how I’ve been abusing her over the year? Which is crazy. I’ve tried to make her see that she has to take some responsibility as well but she can’t seem to see any fault in her actions.
I don’t why but after 14 break up and make ups I am once again chasing and apologizing to her and asking her to grow up and come home so we can talk about our issues and not just scream. It blows my mind that she has thrown away her job and everything we had just because of a silly arguement. I mean one day I’m teasing her with a spider, a clear joke, and the next day aparently it means I’ve been abusing her and everything has just blown out of proportion and she has run away.
I don’t know why I still want her back.
Normally we would patch this up and she would be screaming about something else next week but now because she has screamed at my mum, I think she knows there’s no coming back from that because unlike me, my mum won’t accept that kind of behavior and would expect a apology for her screaming, but in her mind, if we have caused her to scream it’s our fault because we have done something so hurtful that we deserved that?

277,"For some backstory, my sister and I are the only ""purebreed"" siblings, meaning we have the same mother and the same father. We both have 2 younger siblings each from different fathers. We grew up primarily with our biological father that was negligent and didn't know how to handle kids; at some point we had over 20 cats, 3x the amount of feces in the house, and 0x the cleaning. My biological father would constantly put my sister down, calling her ""fat"" and ""bitchy"" while simultaneously telling me that he would have killed himself if it weren't for me. In 2016, it seemed that we both finally had enough of our environment and the constant mental manipulation of our feelings as his daughters. I moved in with my mom, while sister moved in with her boyfriend and took all of the cats with her (at this point there are only 10-14). I spent the next year hiding in fear that I'd run into him in public and my guilt would confront me head on. Meanwhile my sister emailed him back and forth (although she admitted to being snarky about it). In 2017, he passed away from sepsis and we were both there to hold his hand as he left, giving apologies and final goodbyes, because despite everything we still loved him and harbored so, so much guilt because we felt that we didn't put any effort to help him at all. I learned later that my sister had to make the decision to pull the plug and stop life support. 
In the next few years after this, she started to spiral. The money she gained from the inheritance (50k) was entirely spent in a year on extravagances nobody would ever need, including a purebred Alaskan marmont. She got a job, but quit a couple months ago for reasons I dont know. Shes declining to speak to anybody, even her closest friends, and not even her boyfriend of 5 years because hes either working or sleeping most of the time. Today was my 17th birthday and she confided in me that shes had several trips to the E.R ranging from chest pains from smoking to thoughts about ending her life (I think attempts, too). 

I have no idea what to do. She doesnt want to accept any of my help because shes older, and I understand that she makes her own decisions, but I am so scared of losing her because shes the only person that knows what i went through and vice versa. I love her so much but I have no clue. I feel like I should tell our mom, because shes been worried about my sister for some time now too, but I dont know if it would be a good option. I've thought about moving in with her and helping her through everything step by step, but I think that' would intrude on her privacy even more. There is just so many things going on in both of our lives that maybe I'd be overstepping boundaries. Shes one of my closest friends on top of being my sister.",26Oct2019,1
278,"So my gf was on her Facebook and I noticed she had searched her ex and some other guy. I asked what the ex was about, and she was reluctant to talk about it. They’ve been broken up for a while and we’ve been together for 6 months.

She said that since we’ve been having issues (she has BPD and it’s led to a number of fights), she’s been searching him pretty much weekly. She said that the way we fight reminds her of that relationship. She also said she’s not sure why she keeps thinking about him to the point of searching him. She then said I’m the only guy she thinks about romantically. She also said that she searches him to see if he’s succeeding because she hopes he isn’t (but I don’t see what our issues have to do with that).

I asked about the other guy. She closed her eyes and said it was the guy she was seeing between her ex and I. She said that he was a part of her life and she was just curious how he’s doing. She never seemed like she liked the guy all that much and she said that she definitely isn’t interested in him.

I don’t know what to think. I’m pretty darn hurt. She was getting mad saying she was hurt, so I just sat in silence. She calmed down and started crying, then got out of the car to go into her house and said “I love you” before she closed the door.

280,"This will sound crazy. I feel crazy for thinking it but I really, really would like advice on how to calm down after a taxi ride. Let me add that this taxi guy is probably a super nice, normal guy but my brain is not telling me that.  


So there was a party at the house I am staying at. I drank a decent mount (not blackout or slurred but still a decent amount) and decided I really wanted to go to the corner store for a slushy/slurpee/whatever it's called where you live.  I wanted one so badly I decided to take a taxi to the corner store and back for one.  


 I'm normally a quiet person but I decided to chat with the friendly seeming taxi driver on the way there and back.  I told him about the place I was staying at. Not in great detail, but enough detail that it might be enough to aid him if he tried to break in  (I didn't think of that when I talked to him at first).   


Later during the ride he randomly asked.......where my boyfriend was. I never mentioned a boyfriend though.... but I calmly replied that I broke up with him last month. He asked how long I was with my boyfriend and why I broke up with him, etc. Basically he asked a lot of other questions that seemed to flow with the conversation, but that one question about my boyfriend made me super uncomfortable. It made me irrationally scared that he might try to break into the house at night or something because there's no guy here ( well... there is one in the suite below me, but that never came up).   


I need advice on how to calm down. Like, advice on how to stop this anxiety attack over the stupid taxi driver because I keep thinking about it and it feels like my heart is going to burst out of my chest.

Moved here from a different country and can’t talk to any of my friends back home about this  because they seem to be having an amazing time . I try to make friends and talk to people and be friendly ,Im a very sociable person in general, outgoing, and never had any problem making friends (I off handedly mentioned this to one of my friends and they were surprised that I was the one having this problem). Every time I talk to someone we seem to hit it off and get along really well. At first I was reluctant to ask people to hang out because I was really nervous to be rejected, the person I’m with (who’s really far away) said that it’s cus of my ego and I should get over that and put myself out there. Fine. That made sense. Thing is, I did put myself out there, again and again, I ask people to hang out and they always make some sort of excuse, and I just don’t get it, maybe it’s because everyone has already formed their own little groups and it’s too late for me to try to get into any of them?. The very few times I have gotten anyone to hang out is cus I’m face to face and they ask if I want to tag along. It’s just so fucking defeating and honestly, embarrassing. The college I wanted to go to didn’t work out and I went through a rough time dealing with that and I thought at the very least if I came here I’d have a fun time, and that doesn’t seem to be happening either.

288,"I will try to keep it nice and short in June of this year my mother kicked me out of the house because I didn't like her bf, I never disrespected her and I never said a thing to her bf. 

She was very abusive,when she got angry she would take away food, she would gaslight me, she will punch me for no apparent reason, she will get angry at me for treating her bf like a stranger (i barely knew him), and she would left me outside the house, for hours... As a punishment for god know what. 

She then sued my dad for domestic abuse, and in court said that I was abusive towards her and that I manipulated my brother. 

Currently I blocked her, and my major issue right now is that almost every family member wants me to forgive her not because of her, but because of me, and that this is the only way I can get peace. 

At first I said ""yeah I forgive her"" but no, I don't want to forgive her, she cannot be forgiven for me she crossed the line a long time ago  I gave her a lot of opportunities, in the past I forgave her for shit I shouldn't, and she didn't even for a bit of remorse for that, not a single drop, for me it would be a slap on the face forgiving her. 

But my brother keeps saying that I'm a resentful brat because of that, my dad says that I said something very sad, and that she would always be my mother even when I die, my grandpa's wife keeps saying that I should be calling her, because she misses me, and maybe she feels remorse. 

I need advice, on how to say to them, that this is my choice that I am not a resentful brat for this, and that not only this is best for me and will help me grow but also to stop bringing this up, and that I'm done forgiving people who do not apologize, that I will heal my own way.

There is girl form my school that I find cute. I want to approach her, but I don't know how to do it and is that even good idea. Why is that bad idea? Because I'm not sure what she thinks of me... I'll get to that soon, but first I want to describe her. She is my age, she is almost always alone and usually has annoyed look on her face. On rare occasions she talks to some of my female friends, she looks really postive and happy. We don't know each other, because we don't share any classes. Why I don't just try talking to her then? Because we made too much eye contact. For months we would make eye contact every single time we walked past eachother. I don't know if she is also interested in me or she thinks I'm creep... Anyway, I felt uncomfortable so I stopped making eye contact. I'm pretty sure she kept watching me, but maybe I'm just imaginating things... She started walking past me a lot more. We have to go to different classroom for every class and wait in halls for professor to unlock classroom, so we spent whole breaks in halls. There is chance that she is just going to her class and we randomlly met, but almost every time she walks past me (which is almost every break), she comes back few minuter later and goes to other floor. She is following me and liking my posts on soical media, but I don't think that matters. Is is all in my head, or is she intetested in me?
So, now I'm not sure what to do? Should I do something and hope that she doesn't think I'm some creep, or should I just ignore her? If you think I should do something, what should I do? I don't know what to say without feeling that I'll embarrass myself.

308,"Hey all! as the title reads, im having trouble with a friend of mine that ive known since grade 7, who can never seem to take “no” for an answer, unless of course i have an excuse.  We’ll call him B. 

B and i have been friends since grade 7 and are both now 21. Hes someone i hang out with quite frequently and  have been since we finished high school. The issue is, whenever he wants to go out, i feel as though i have to make excuses in order to be able to stay home when i dont feel like going, just because he’ll proceed to guilt trip me and make me feel like a terrible friend. If i dont answer his calls, when i return the call he’ll say things like “oh yeah, about
time, i could have been dying” or “hoorraaayy he finally answered his phone” in a sarcastic tone, which then makes me feel uncomfortable and bad again. Ive been putting up with this behaviour for too long now and yesterdays occurrence really was the last straw. I have a hard time saying no to B, because of
the way he reacts or acts toward me so i always feel obliged to put his needs and wants first before mine.  

He called me and invited me over to his house, to which i said ill come a bit
later, he wouldnt take that for an answer and replied with “we’re in the area, we’ll pick you up” so i ended up agreeing to go, even though i did not feel like going. Not long after the call i texted him and told him not to worry about
getting me, i just feel like staying home in the AC as it was a really hot day yesterday. He asked me if i was sure and still proceeded to call me back and guilt trip me further into going “you havent been out with me all week” (because he didnt end up wanting to go out) “you didnt even see me on my birthday yesterday” (he was busy all day with his gf, and then at night with his other mate), so he continued to make me feel like i was a bad friend. I kept telling him not to stress about coming to get me, that id go later on as a way of compromising with him, but he still would not take anything i said for an answer. After a while, i texted him again saying id go later, but he responded with “im on the way”. So after all that, i was basically forced to go because he ended up rocking up at my place with his gf to pick me up, despite saying no. I dont know how to deal with this, its taking a toll on my life and im sick of putting in effort for someone who has little to no respect for our friendship. He calls me to talk about himself, gets distracted and doesnt listen to me when i talk, he invites me over to do one thing and then he’ll change plans on me to do another, hes rude to my siblings and can even be pretty rude to me too.

So reddit, how do i deal with such a friend? I dont know how to cut him off because hes one of the only people i really hang out with, despite having other friends and im not really sure how to approach him about all this either.

310,"Ok here goes. My Wife (37) and a I (36) have two kids (4 and 2). My wife is an only child and is also the only child in her whole extended family (none of her uncles and aunties had kids, bizarre I know) . Anyway, we live in Melbourne, Australia where house prices have gone insane but fortunately we have invested and saved and have nearly 50% deposit for a house. 

We currently live ten mins from my in laws who are hugely helpful with the kids and are very generous and lovely people, but as soon as it came time for us to start looking to buy and they found out we will be looking in an area that is 15 mins further away they were horrified. Yes that's correct, they went into a panic, fear based thinking and just plain illogical. My in laws are not Australian (they are Sri Lankan) and it's part of their culture that as they get older, their kids look after them, which I have fully intention of honouring. But I feel we can still do that living 20 mins or so away from them and they are only in their late 60's so it's not like they're about to kick the bucket.

So anyway, depsite their ""concerns"" we started looking in the area we felt was the best for young families, good value where we can find a decent house with a backyard, my father in law calls me and says he wants to have a straight talk, now I'm a pretty laid back dude but I also don't like being talked down on. My FIL told me he was very disappointed in me for guiding my family away from them, for not looking after his daughter as moving to this particular suburb was ""dangerous"" (which isnt true,it's one of the safest in Melbourne). I told him he has stepped over the line and I don't appreciate it. We had a long talk and I debated whether to tell my wife but I did and she lost it at him. Things calmed down for a week, but now he had gone out looking at houses without telling us, in areas we aren't interested in and telling agents to call me and try to convince us to buy the property. I've had enough and don't know how to deal with this without causing a massive rift in the family. 

How do I get him to back off whilst still being respectful?",26Oct2019,1

312,"Warning:Long post! No tldr don't know how to summarize this. 

My best friend(f23) and I(f23) have been inseparable since grade 5. Even when we didn't see each other everyday anymore or talk every day, when we saw each other it was like nothing changed. We had our own language basically.

We tried things together and experimented with new things like drinking, smoking, drugs, all that stuff. We did meth together for a long time, both got pretty messed up on it for a long time. I finally had to quit for my own sanity and moved to another state with my husband. She didn't slow down like I did even though I encouraged her to.

Then her mom passed away, a year or so ago.I dropped everything and came home for her, her mom was there my whole childhood too, so of course she meant a lot to me. Anyway, after her mom passed away she sort of went off the deep end. She went hard on drugs and alcohol, hanging around the wrong people. Our communication sort of dropped off...I couldn't be around her when I visited our home state because she would promise not to pressure me into doing anything or partying, then go ahead and message her dealer knowing I would give in anyway. It just wasn't good for my sobriety.

I know she's hurting and hate seeing her hurt. She was doing good and had a job, getting clean but suddenly disappeared with her boyfriend (who is a shithead) and getting back on heroin. I've been scared for her and getting a phone call that she's dead somewhere. 

Before she disappeared,(the last time I talked to her), I was in our home state to be with my dad...who was on life support and eventually passed away. This happened early this year. On top of all of this I was pregnant, so it was a horrible time.
I decided to text her because I just wanted my best friend...and she grew up with my dad and I thought she'd want to know what's going on.  Seriously all she said to me was ""I'm so sorry just be there for him."" And then proceeded to talk about how she missed her boyfriend and needed to get some dick. It was like a slap to the fucking face, like I cried for days over that alone. Not only to me but to my dad, whom has been in her fucking life for years, and was a father figure to her when her dad was too busy hitting the bottle. (He's sober now thankfully).

It's like she's a completely different person...she didn't even call...or try to come see me, even though I was in the same area as her so it's not like she had to travel far. It hurt fucking bad. I understand addiction, I was stuck on meth with her for years and I'm still trying to kick the alcohol. I'm still so god damned angry at her and it makes me cry just thinking about it. 

After all that I completely quit talking to her or trying to contact her at all. Everyone encouraged me to get her out of my life. 

But about a month ago I finally got back in fb after deleting it for two or so years, So I could post pictures of my daughter for my extended family I don't contact much. I decided to try to get ahold of her, because I love her..she's my best friend ya know? And I just wanted to know if she was okay if anything. Now, everyone told me they hadn't seen her in ages and told me she ran off with her boyfriend(the shithead). I asked her sisters and family to contact me if they hear or see her. 

Last night around 6 pm I got a call from her dad and I didn't answer because I thought he might be butt dialing me. But he texted me telling me my friend was home and was trying to call me. Of course I said YES call me back! But I guess she fell asleep and he said he'd have her call me later. Well, I fell asleep and missed her call again (I suck I know) , but I texted her dad again and apologized for falling asleep. He said it's okay and he'd have her call me in the morning. 

Now it's almost morning, I can't sleep because honestly I'm nervous about talking to her. Like I said I'm so god damned angry and hurt by her...and I don't know what to say to her. I feel like I  should definitely not bring it up, atleast not right now, especially if she's trying to get her life together again. But then it feels like I'll never get to say anything about it because honestly it feels like it's all about how she is, and how she's doing. And I don't know how our relationship is going to be. I love her to death but honestly I'm just tired...and I dunno I'm just so hurt by someone who was supposed to be my closest friend...

How should I go about handling all of this?

Also, sorry about the long post..if anything is unclear let me know. Thanks.",26Oct2019,1
313,"Hey! So im 18.5 and i have the option of volunteering at the local fire department. I've wanted to join as a volunteer for a few good years now. I had an interview a few days ago together with about 30 teenagers (15-18) and the had like a 40 minute lecture about what it is to be a fire fighter and all the rules, in the first five minutes the instructor mentioned sexual harassment claims and said there was no place for sexual harassment in the station, i was happy to hear he addressed the subject but the more he talked the clearer it was that the fire departments way of dealing with sexual harassment was basically just forcing women to only work mornings and afternoons and only in one fire station and basically anyone who made a claim about sexual harassment was just sent home (not really fired as this is volunteer work). Im a trans guy, and this bothers the hell out of me, i know if i was still presenting as a girl i would get so mad about only being able to do three hour shifts (we cant start before school ends). Thing is, i know that doing this is, at the end of the day, helping and saving lives using my physical strength to better my surroundings, but this horrible sexism towards female volunteers is making me re - consider my application. I've been training for years but it seems so pointless joining if by helping fight natural disasters im standing by sexism and Infurcing the notion that the victim is to blame. If i had plans on working as a fire fighter later in life i would join in the hopes of getting to a position high enough to change the system but im planning on doing 1-2 years of volunteer work and then move to a whole different country. I won't be able to change the rules or the situation because i will be ranked very low so if i join it means i have to stand aside while the incharge officers act in a sexist way. Is helping fight fires worth the victim blaming and dehumanising of women and sexual assaults victims? Im really stumped here. What should i do? 
Ps: these rules apply to female volunteers, not workers as much as i know. Also please excuse any spelling mistakes as English is my second language. And lastly, i do know that men cant be harassed but the instructor didn't mention it.",26Oct2019,3
314,"TL;DR
I'm considering getting a second degree (that I might like) that is totally unrelated to my first. I'm wondering if it will even be worth it now.


Hi! I currently have a degree in Clinical Laboratory Science. I initially wanted Chemical Engineering but was forced to take CLS. I asked several times to shift but was not allowed to and was told to just finish this one and just take another one once I'm done. Everything I wanted to do since I was a kid was not allowed and I got used to it. I know it's my fault for not having the guts to insist on what I really wanted. So now I'm left on my own and have a career path I don't feel happy doing. I'm considering taking another degree while working but I'm wondering if it would even be worth it. I'm leaning on Materials Science Engineering but I wonder if I'll even be happy then. I'm already 27 and I'm concerned of my job opportunities having a messed up resume and background. I'm female and I plan to be hands on raising my kids if I ever have any. So I was wondering if continuing to pursue my current career would be best for me. I know all jobs are difficult and bring its own source of stress. But I don't know if I'll just end up getting older and regretting not studying again.",26Oct2019,1

Eventhough that is not really long, we all are quitte close with each other, seeing each other at least every thursday and saturday. Now one of my friends has a stunningly beautiful girlfriend, lets call her Denise. My housemate, who doesnt know that friend, knows his girlfriend. This housemate is very manipulative and in my eyes a bit of a psychopath. 
So he came up to me asking if I knew Denise. So I replied ""yes, she is the gf of a friend of mine."" and my housemate replied with: ""well, then I will make her cheat on him.""
I'm 100% sure he sees her as a ""one-night-stand"" and that is it.
I do want to tell my friend about my housemate his plan however, if it comes out, I will probably need to find a new house.
I know that if I dont tell my friend and Denise does cheat on him, my housemate will for sure say that I knew of his plan, to make sure his anger is towards me and not him.

318,"I want to save this relationship but I don't know if I can

me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 2 years now. I love being around him, we sing in the car we pick on each other, we have the same taste in the shows we watch and we love cuddling. I know I love this man, but everything else about him just...idk

this might jump around a lot, im sorry for that.

we got new phones together, about a week later, he ""comes up"" with this great idea to keep up with each other to make sure we are ""safe""...he installed a GPS tracker on both of our phones...its not something I wanted, but I went along with it...he also goes through my phone constantly. it feels like hes looking for something that just isn't there. Im debating with turning off the tracker and telling him that he cant go through my stuff anymore. He told me the reason he wants to be able to do those things is because his ""brain"" messes with him and its just reassurance, however, it doesn't seem to be reassuring anything. He has issues with the fact that I have male friends, that I talk to regularly. When we first started talking I told him that I have guy friends that I keep in touch with and he said he didn't have an issue with that....well now he does all of a sudden. So he goes through my phone, sees that me and a friend had a 3 hour long talk about how we have been, how our kids are doing, buying houses, our SOs and whatnot and turn it into something else.  


He cannot support me financially at all. After paying child support, rent, utilities and basic expenses, he has maybe $150 to last 2 weeks. that's gas, groceries, household stuff, and smokes. I pay for his car insurance, hulu, vudu, and wrestling bullshit. as well as give him extra money to be able to take his kids out. Recently we both got pay raises. His was significantly higher than mine. I struggle with money too but I tend to make it work. Im rather upset that, with this new pay raise, he hasn't offered to help with anything. not even something small like taking back his WWE network mess. Aside from bills, Im the one that pays for all of our dates. movies, dinner, just a drive out to no where, bowling, pool, double dates whatever, it comes out of my pocket. Even a friend of ours that double dates with us says that they don't like the fact that everytime we have gone out they notice im the one paying for everything. At first I didn't mind, but now my money is tighter and he still expects me to pay for everything

&amp;#x200B;

We both struggle with PTSD, his from the service, mine from trauma. Ill sit up with him when he wakes up at night and try to comfort him. My episodes are far and few between, but the last one I had I just needed someone to talk to. He literally told me that he has heard it all before, and rolled over. I was in such a dark place I would up leaving my own home, sitting in my car alone for hours before I called the suicide hotline just looking for someone to talk to. he never brought it up again.

&amp;#x200B;

Physically, I do everything I can to be intimate. Rubbing his back, massaging him, playing with his hair whatever. im just an affectionate person, but I love being loved on too and he just doesn't do any of it. I have talked to him about this several times and each time he wants to wait until im angry to do something about it, which in turn makes me madder.

&amp;#x200B;

finally, we both have kids from previous relationships. My kids love him. they tell him they love him, but all he gives them is a ""that's nice"" and he moves on. I have asked him to spend some time with my kids and to do somethings with them but he flatly refuses. he tells me that it feels like ""hes replacing his kids with my kids"" which I don't really understand. He doesn't see his kids very often but mine shouldn't have to suffer for it. We got into a huge argument last week over my kids. They were playing in the living room one AFTERNOON, I was taking a bath and getting ready for work (night shift) he was asleep in my bedroom. He came storming out into the living room and began screaming at my kids to ""Shut up! People are trying to sleep! Go outside and play or go in your room!""

319,"Recently my parents came to visit and among other things I started noticing how much time they spend on social media. It has come to a point where the things they read have become the main topic of conversation and a source of stress for them because they believe everything they see... A few days ago for example they found an article about how Brexit will bring famine to the UK and started pestering me to buy supplies... I briefly looked at the article and told them this is a baseless assumption aimed at gaining publicity and ‘clicks’ because I cannot see any reliable sources or research attached to it and they should be checking for that. But they are adamant that since it is published in the newspaper it must be true. 

They are both pretty stubborn so I can’t seem to think of a way to better explain to them that they need to think critically about that they decide to believe. Any ideas? Thank you!",26Oct2019,1

I am an 18 years old, Italian, on my last year of high school; 

currently working full-time, homeschooled (last 4 years I have been in a normal school), living with my parents.

Here things are really stressful for me and I'm not looking at really bright future, at all, I'm having some troubles obtaining my diploma 

My parents would really like to make me do and exchange year in the US, to help me out, but it's temporary, it can cost a LOT, and it's not even 100% sure that they'd let you get a diploma

i'd figured since I'm 18, already working I could just move there, I'd think it would be less expensive, I could earn some money and obtain a GED (really need that), then I'd love to go to a university or a college (not a fan of the huge debts tho, that's why I listed Canada as well, and I'm really open-minded)

I just really need to change things up, here everything is driving me to suicide, I am a 'do it myself' kind of guy, paying for my food, my school, so I really do struggle with loneliness and depression, my friends are not helping me out at all, in fact they are dragging me down af

324,"This is a throwaway account for personal reasons as I don't want things tied to my main account for privacy.

I know the basics about being around a celebrity - be respectful, don't take photos without their permission, be respectful of privacy, and if dating them, find common interests, treat them like a person not a celebrity, obviously.

However, my problem is - where do you meet up-and-coming / very new celebrities? I'm not talking about A and B-listers but people who've only just started to become famous in some way. Basically, very low on the bottom of the totem pole of celebrities.

The only celebs I've really met, if you can call it that, were the people who presented my local radio station's breakfast show, but that was 15 years ago in a shopping mall! (They were high-profile for the time in the 2000s locally!)

I do have some skills that may be of use to them - I've been teaching myself about website design for the past 17 years or so, learning about WordPress and add-ons/plugins, learning the basics of PHP and Apache in addition to website design, I've been learning about how to ghostwrite (simply as an additional skill to have). 

I have limited experience of ghostwriting ; doing a relative's website (which is now gone, never got archived by the Wayback Machine from what I know) which was a long-term project in itself. At least it was a start.

I would like to date an up-and-coming/very new celebrity. I wouldn't be dating them only because they're famous or as a springboard to being famous but because we have some shared interests (the celeb, whoever they are, being into social media/influencer culture probably has some shared interests relating to website design/WordPress/ghostwriting.). This is **not** the same as gold-digging.

I'm 33/M and British if age is an issue. In terms of looks, I'm average-looking but fairly strong although average build.

I realize that it will take connections and meeting a lot of people, but along the way I could be making some new friends and it's a different sort of networking.

I am considered an interesting, likeable person to talk to and I suppose some of my interests listed above may/may not be of use as conversation topics.

I don't live in an area where celebrities are common (like Los Angeles) or up-and-coming celebrities, just a small town in Greater Manchester, England and I'm in a job I enjoy which is good (bit sensitive to discuss on here).

Would it be weird that I don't have social media like Facebook/Instagram for reasons relating to /r/privacy ? Or considered a good thing in this day and age of things like Cambridge Analytica?

This is getting out of my comfort zone and trying something new, but finding the opportunities is the hard part as I don't know anyone who can introduce me.

Anyway my cousin has some behavioral issues that aren’t his fault; he never looks people in the eye, is often nervous and has a really short temper.

The context here is I am at university with my boyfriend (don’t live together but in separate flats with our own flatmates). My boyfriend was out of town the last couple of days, but I get on with his flat so they still asked me to come join them drinking and going out with their flat.
So we are all having a good time (or at least I think so) and I’m trying to be my best self seeing as these are my boyfriends close friends and it’s my first time hanging out with them without my boyfriend there. 
We all play this drinking game, it’s on a app where it generates your name with a question. Lots of them are super out there though and a bit weird so you just skip them (e.g take a piss on the table or down your drink) 
One came to me asking me to take one of the guys phones and message someone a saucy message on their contacts. This guy is really funny, I feel I get on with him and I like him a lot. He hand his phone laughing and I take it and everyone like “ahhhh shit” 
I scroll on his contacts and just pick a random one near the top, it says ‘driving instructor’
I didn’t think it was that bad a person to message, like it’s not his sister or anything. At least I know if someone messaged my driving instructor he would be fine with it.
So I message somethint stupid like “hey sexy wanna revv my engine”(really stupid I know, but I wanted to make it jokey and stupid)
I pass the phone to a different guy, who’s like best friends with the guy who’s phone it was. He reads it and laughs so hard. He found it so funny and convinced me it was cool and sent the message.
We pass the phone back to the guy and he freaks. He gets so mad, saying “ahhh fuck this you’ve gone to far for fuck sake” and storms off to his room. 
We go to try knock on the door and he won’t let us in and is just telling us to fuck off. We don’t end up going out and I end up walking home.
So I’ve basically fucked any fun relationship with these people and they’re my boyfriends close friends. I’m so mad at myself. I don’t know them very well so it’s just super awkward and I’m gonna have to go back there sometime.

I moved recently for work. I became a regular at a starbucks near my house ever since moving. There is a young girl only a year younger than me who works there. I didn't notice her at first, but then one day about 2 weeks ago this girl who I didn't notice before approaches me and says I heard you come here often.

I explained to her how I moved for work, and then she asked me if I was down to hang out with her and her friends. I told her I was, she then asked me for my number. Everything seemed to be going well, and although there were no plans set yet I assumed she was interested because she was the one who approached me and invited me to hang out. About a week passes and we're talking a lot but not making plans so I invited her to hang out. She turned me down saying she didn't have the money to go. I let it go and didn't think much of it, and assumed a lack of interest.

A week later I'm at Starbucks as I still go there often, and I see her there. I keep things friendly as I shrugged off what I perceived as a lack of interest and I don't really care at this point. Then when I go to keep my coffee cup I see: ""Thank you let's hang out soon :)"" written on the cup. Another barista tells me it was the girl before who wrote it. I asked her if she wanted to meet up at all this week she told me she was busy but maybe next weekend, and that she would let me know.

She said that since we’ve been having issues (she has BPD and it’s led to a number of fights), she’s been searching him pretty much weekly. She said that the way we fight reminds her of that relationship. She also said she’s not sure why she keeps thinking about him to the point of searching him. She then said I’m the only guy she thinks about romantically. She also said that she searches him to see if he’s succeeding because she hopes he isn’t (but I don’t see what our issues have to do with that).

I began to feel very disappointed with my works, even at the start/bare-bones stages, but I was able to ignore it, but not for long.   
After around a year at the start of 2017, I lost the ability to ignore this mindset, and because of that, I haven't completed a Minecraft house or anything that isn't easy ever since, and yeah, I said it right, I haven't been able to make a Minecraft house for almost THREE YEARS.  
I'm not even talking about those easy to build survival huts, I'm talking about full-on houses.  


Anyways, this has not only affected the stuff that I used to do, I am currently unable to join any new hobbies as they take effort, and my mindset makes it impossible to learn anything, and thus, I give up and move on to another, only to repeat the cycle.  
I tried to fight my mindset by spending around 2000 hours (I'm not joking) in this level editor for a game, and after all that time spent, I still haven't made a single level, because I gave up before the bare-bones of it were even laid out.  


Anyways, I'm not exactly sure how to describe this mindset, but I'll give you all my best.  
My brain basically tells me at the start of learning/doing anything hard ""this isn't worth the time and effort, it's not going to end up good, and be garbage, just give up now"", and it's really hard to fight, in-fact, sometimes, it's impossible.  
This mindset makes it impossible to learn anything, even if I spend thousands of hours on it.  


I've asked for help on this, but most people don't understand that I have a hard time flipping this switch off for longer than 5 minutes, and expect me to say to my mindset ""nah man, I'm going to continue working on this"".  


Anyways, this has made a life a living hell, I tried to learn programming, and I gave up at the start, and I even tried to learn pixel art, and that didn't work out either.  
I even tried to make maps for the first two Doom games, and even though those are probably the most easiest games to map for, I still haven't got the motivation to complete an even simple map.  


I really hate this mindset, and I wish I could go back to the old me, who didn't care if the end result was bad or not.  
This mindset is preventing me from learning, and it's killing me.  
I have such a strong creative mind, and because of all of this, I can't satisfy my craving of making something.  


Sorry if this breaks Rule 3.",26Oct2019,1
335,"My family and I are on a road trip. My parents, me and my brother. About 20 minutes ago, there was a dog on the highway and my dad immediately braked as safely as possible or we would have gotten injured. However the dog got hit on the side of the car.

I immediately looked back and it was on it's back moving it's legs in the air. I think it was getting up? Anyways I was relieved it was alive.

My brother is sitting in the front, and the dog hit the left side of the car, the side he's sitting on. He saw the dog getting hit. He's sitting very quiet, not using his iPad which surprised me. the only time he talked when he said my dad should have gone slower and if we should stop to check the car's front. But since we're late my dad said we could check when we get there.

I'm afraid my brother will be traumatized by seeing a dog getting hit so close. I'm also scared if there's anything on the car when we get out, my brother will definitely not forget it. What should I tell him to help?


TLDR; our car hit a dog and it's alive last time I saw, my brother in the front saw it, how should I comfort him?",26Oct2019,2
336,"So basically it’s getting colder now (40s-50sF outside) and my roommate prefers warmer room temperature whereas I prefer colder. The other day I was home by myself and set the ac to 68. She got home and woke me up at midnight to tell me she was too cold, and I said it’s no problem turning it off. So then she put the heat on and I woke up at 3am sweating! She’d set THE HEAT to 74!! 
  
So it’s been a week now and we still haven’t figured it out. I used to keep my window open but now it’s colder outside and even slightly open makes my room too cold. I also put tape on the air vent except for a small hole. 
  
We agreed on 70F on heat for during the day, but that is way too hot for me during the night (normal is 60-66F for sleeping). I’ve been waking up every night at around 4-5am because 70 on heat is too hot. So I set it to 66F heat tonight and sometime after I had fallen asleep my roommate changed it back to 70 again. 
  
I do t know what to do and I can’t afford a fan right now, and the noise from it would be too loud for me anyway.

338,"So as the title says I’m trying to get disability. I guess the advice I’m looking for is kind of complicated. I’m trying to figure out if I should keep pursuing disability or just give up. It’s more than that though. I’m just looking for some reassurance I guess. I’ll give you some of my medical and life history and I want you to tell me if it’s worth pursuing disability. 

As a child I was diagnosed with ADHD, PTSD (from abuse both physical and emotional), dysthymia (a long term form of depression), some form of sleeping disorder (I was afraid to go to sleep and as an adult still have issues sleeping until I’m completely exhausted), and something else that’s basically psychological terms for an issue with authority. I can’t remember that term at the moment. I have Wolf Parkinson’s White Syndrome (have had cardio ablation surgery) and have arrhythmia episodes and pain because of it. I also had a head on car accident in 2010 which resulted in a shoulder surgery for a labral tear, damage to the cartilage in my knee, scoliosis, and hip issues. I also had some brain damage but it wasn’t severe as far as I know. I did lose some memories before and after the accident. I had nose bleeds up to a year after. I would forget long periods of time and the year after my accident was pretty hard for me. My day to day routine is at this point basically me staying at home relying on my wife to take care of us... we’re barely making it. If I go out on my own which is rarely, if ever, I struggle to do basic tasks like shopping for instance. I get into the store and the multiple steps I have to remember to “get the job done” sometimes will set me into a panic attack where my heart starts beating so fast and I feel like I can’t breathe enough to compensate. I don’t have the patience anymore to do basic things. I get overwhelmed very easily. I’m afraid to go out anymore because I guess I’m afraid to be alone. My body has let me down and it’s a scary feeling to feel like your mind has so much more to give than your body does... I guess I’m afraid if I go out without my wife something bad could happen like I pass out from my arrhythmia (yeah... that happens). 

I’ve been trying to get disability for months now and going to drs and all the stuff they require. I haven’t gotten any decision from them yet but I’ve looked at the statistics and for a person initially filing without legal representation the odds are very low... I’m sure I’ll have to fight for it... if I do. Do I qualify for disability though? I think I do but that’s a biased opinion. I have been unemployed since my heart surgery 2 years ago. I just can’t seem to pick my self up and this is the lowest I’ve been my whole life and I don’t feel in control anymore. I need constant assistance from my wife and I hate living like this... I don’t know what to do. I feel like at least if I got disability I could contribute to my family (just my wife and I, no kids). I feel so useless right now and I don’t know how to make this better if not for disability. 

Thanks for reading about my problems...",26Oct2019,2
339,"I had a major car crash a few weeks ago. The car was completely smashed by a truck but I didn't have any injuries. 

Since then I've been having nightmares almost every night and I will wake up with cold sweats and very agitated. Of course I can't remember most of my nightmares but I know most of them are associated with danger situations. 

I also became very reactive to car horns. I'm immediatly on alert everytime I hear one. Is this normal?",26Oct2019,1
340,"I just feel like a failure. Like I never had a shot at ever having a good life.

My mom is extremely abusive. She was abusive in nearly every way. I have a lot of issues because of her. Growing up, it was like living in a prison. I couldn't hang out with friends, couldn't do anything after school, it was just extremely strict. And it didn't help how we moved to an entire different state &amp; she put me into online school. For 2 years, I barely left home. For months I wouldn't go outside unless I was throwing out the trash or receiving the groceries from the driver who delivered our groceries. I didn't have friends. I didn't do things I enjoyed. All I had was the internet.

My last straw was when my mother almost stabbed me when I defended myself over her belittling me. I moved in with this guy who I met from the internet who also had a toxic family. However, his situation was different. His mother actually loved him &amp; helped him out. Still does. So, he took me in. Currently pays for everything while I try to get on my feet. 

Now, I'm currently not working or in school. I'm trying to get my documents and even that was hard because I realized my mother had lost nearly everything that she had for me so that I could identify myself. It was only on Tuesday where I FINALLY got my SSN card after months of trying to find ways to identify myself. 

But that's not the issue. I didn't realize how unhappy I was until I moved out. I don't have my life together. I don't have friends. I have an eating disorder. I'm extremely depressed. I have social anxiety. I just have anxiety in general. I'm broken. A disappointment. And I'm constantly reminded of it daily by the world.

And I tried to get help, I had a 7 day betterhelp free therapy trial. And I found a therapist I liked. And even he had I was broken. But, repairable. But I couldn't afford him because, well, I have absolutely no money. And when I do start getting money it'll be months away from now.

But I'm losing hope. I'm losing motivation. And instead of me being upset all day about how messed up my life is, I try to change it. I even created a Bumble page to make friends. But, I have never felt so...different until I went on Bumble. I just don't fit in.

And quite frankly, I'm embarrassed about me. I'm embarrassed how I've gained weight and seem to keep gaining weight. I'm embarrassed about how I don't even have my GED yet. I'm embarrassed about how I don't work. I'm embarrassed about how there's nothing interesting about me. I'm embarrassed that I'm a loser.

And it sucks, so bad. If hurts so much. To keep trying, and trying and it seems like you're barely going anywhere. I know my life will get better when I get a job. I intend to get a job very soon. But to get the job that I'm most likely guaranteed, I need my GED, and when I complete that, it'll be December or January.

I don't even think I have that long. It's so hard for me to even do normal things. I have to force myself to get up and grab something to eat. I have to force myself to study. I have to force myself to even go outside sometimes. And when anyone is somewhat aggressive, I get extremely scared.

I'm broken. And from the looks of it, I've always been broken. And I don't have one good thing that I can cling onto to keep going. And I fear when my hope runs out, it can get dangerous.

Now, I've never self harmed nor do I intend to. But.. I find myself keep asking myself, ""what's the point?"" 

Because let's say I hold out a little longer.
I get the GED, then I get a job that has great benefits &amp; pays well but I also have to deal with disrespectful people everyday, and then what? I go to college? For what? I'm not good at anything. I have no passion. So, then I go back into that depressive slump. Unhappy with my life. And then something comes up, I try to do that. And then I get unhappy again. And while all of this, trying to maintain friendships &amp; trying to date, but that'll never work. So, I get even sadder. And sadder. Then, I think that maybe if I looked better physically ill have a better shot at happiness. But happiness doesn't work that way. So I get disappointed again. And repeat.

So, what's the point?",26Oct2019,1

My sister has recently begun to identify as non-binary. My parents and I have fully supported her (they?) in their quest for self identification, but we are unsure if this is what makes her happy. 

My parents have been very supportive of them throughout their journey, but this breaches our comfort zone by a LOT, how should I react? Thus far, I have been extremely supportive and I think that is the right move.

My parents said that they support everything that makes us happy, and they don’t think this transition makes them happy. I can’t help but agree, they seem less comfortable and happy than ever before, what should I think? This has been bothering me for a while, and all I want is for my sister to be happy. 

Should I still call her my sister? Is she still she to me? What do I do? Disclaimer: my family has a pretty long history of mental illness, and while I don’t think this falls in line with that, should I? How do I react, especially since I just want my sister to be happy and comfortable.

351,"I need advice, and this seems like it may be a good place for it?
So, I'm being harrassed.
Let me explain the whole story and then my current situation. 
On Thursday, 10/24/19 my creative writing teacher wanted us to write a horror story for halloween. I banged one out in one day, just kinda comes naturally to me. The story was about a man who loses his wife in a car accident then goes through occult methods to revive her, but she just kinda turns into a zombie. Anyways, I had a friend who liked my writing so I named the wife character after her. I told her I had written a story and used her name for a character, I didn't physically describe her, and i didnt describe her personality. She wanted to read it, and when she did, she became very very angry with me. Not because I used her name in the context that her name was used, but because I used her name without describing her, as if she was the only person I should be thinking of when I used that name. We got into a long fight about it, and she ended up blocking me. Pretty ridiculous right? 
Where these events get weird is yesterday, 10/25/19 , I received a text message from a random number saying my number was posted to 4chan saying to send me gore and traps, he was a nice fella who was just trying to warn me. But, later I received a few texts and a few calls from blocked numbers. I didnt respond to or answer anything of course. Then early this morning around 12am est, 10/26/19, I started getting spammed by random numbers with fake advertisements every single minute, and I had to mute my notifications. I have plans to get my number changed on monday. Just, the worrisome part to me is, she knows my address. Is there anything I can do to stop this kind of harrassment? Should I be worried about further harrassment?",26Oct2019,1

I do not care as much about universities, even though those in England that are weak to their standards would be like 10x better than the ones we got here and it is way harder to get in one, they offer so much more oportunities in every aspect.

Yes, it will be a hard time as I have never worked before (will have to work to support myself) and don't do a lot of chores around the house but I think I can manage.

My parents are against it because they say that they devoted their life to raise me (mainly my mother), which is true. Also, they argue that I won't make it and I will be a slave to 'the strangers'

While these are the arguments, they are mostly concerned with the fact that I won't visit as much due to money, but I promised I'd visit every holiday and one more time a year until I finish my degree and can work full time (I am going to visit each month when I have a job). 

I want to leave because I don't like the values of our society/country and I don't really fit about everywhere I have been. I have like three friends but that's about it. I don't know how to explain here or to them why I want to live but I hate my life most of the time and I think moving there could be a fresh start where I could do anything I want without people judging me at every step. 

I love my family very much, even if I stayed here it pains me to hear the words they throw randomly, saying that I am the worst, how they won't talk to me anymore. I could live here as well, probably not as happy, but I could manage, you know? However, I don't understand why I have to accept everybody's wishes and flaws but no one can seem to accept mine without being a jerk about it. 


I would be happy to receive some advice as I feel this will affect my whole life and I don't think I am  prepared to make this one without have a regret for whatever I choose. I will always think what could have been like to live there and the same goes for when my parents will die, what life could have been if I stayed here.

Yes, making projects is an unnecessary task. Anyway, I am currently trying to make one and if it becomes successfull I will send it to TUBITAK.

The other girls in her class has been bullying her almost since summer, calling her names and making fun of her because she has pimples and saying stuff like she has a big (fore)head, is fat (which she is not) and is ugly. The teachers have seen it happen and does nothing. Im also pretty sure they have hit her as she had some marks she tried to hide and didnt want to talk about.

So when i heard that i got pretty mad but my girlfriend (which was in the room with my), told me i shouldnt do anything because that would just make it worse and i should just let my parents handle it(im 16 btw).

But really what i want to do is just to go over and talk with Julie(the girl who is like the main bully) and threaten her to stop. Because its obvious to see my little sister is depressed and my parents are just talking about moving school from next year. I want this to stop now, and i hope my chat with that girl can make it stop, and if it cant i might also be inclined to do more to that girl to make her stop.",26Oct2019,2
360,"Hi friends! 

I'm just trying to leave behind my past in which I did a lot of self-harm. I'm all good now! Just have the issue of hiding some very stubborn scars. 


Fortunately most of them are hidden but the a bit on my non-dominate had is very obvious and I feel awkward of having it open and uncovered. Usually I wear long sleeves and never wear anything cut short but my job sometimes requires me to roll up my sleeves and other people catch a glimpse and it makes things awkward. I have used big bandaids but they don't last too long so any coverups need to be waterproof. 


I'm now working with a new group of people and no one have seen my scars (at least not that I know of), so if there are any tricks or advice on how to fade/cover the scars are appreciated! 


I wear a big watch and a thick paracord bracelet which does a great job to cover the scars on my wrist but I think anything more with be perceived as effeminate. Not trying to be overly macho! I don't mind how others dress, just don't think anymore wrist trinkets are my style plus the rest of my scars are further up my arm.


I am making an appointment with a dermatologist eventually once my situation is more stable to try to get rid of some of these scars. They're that obvious and embarrassing so any advice is appreciated. Thank you!",26Oct2019,2

364," 

It's not like I hate life, I actually love it, I have lots of great things in life that make me feel so grateful everyday, though I know I don't deserve it. When I was 5 I threw a cat by its tail after spinning it and that wasn't the end of it, I once brought a cat inside and locked it in the cabinet, I also almost suffocated a cat because I brought one inside and then my mom came in the room and I put a cushion over it to hide it, when around 8 till 11, I kept on chasing cats, even some kittens, when they tried to hide under the cars or got in them I would bang the car so they would come out, I once also actually caught a cat and put it in a cage.

I was also always very unhygenic till 14 years old,picked my nose and wiped it off somewhere I never cut my nails showered and changed clothes after weeks and once i had this habit of wiping pleghm of the wall if I couldn't spit it.

I also had these very very messed up fantasy since I was young about someone getting raped and brutally tortured, I started having them about myself too later on regularly, I didn't exactly get arousal from them but they were weird.

I also have intrusive thoughts about all kind of disgusting stuff nowadays and I hate them

My parents have hopes for me and I love studying, but I once had a phase where I acted very stupid and cutesy( I was trying to imitate someone) and had alot of fights with my mom at that time and wished she would die all the time

Now here's the ugly thing, I wish that I was just an good person who deserves to live, I just very want to be a normal person with a normal life.",26Oct2019,0

366,"For context , I’m 15, I have two younger brothers (twins). 

I love my brothers to bits, My mum picked up working because she’s tired of staying home all day, often working night shifts (5pm- 3am ) and sometimes overnights ( 9pm-8am) and my dad works mornings/afternoons (5am-3pm) I’m currently in my last year of school. 

Since my brothers turned about 1, I helped out around the house, taking care of them, baby sitting them when it got a bit busy. But the older my brothers got the more my parents relied on me, I lost connections with good friends and became much more anti social. 

The only time I have to myself is after 8pm, when they’re asleep. But even then, I need to put them to bed, get them dressed, bathed and fed, I often get yelled at if I speak up, getting told it’s my responsibility. 

Being a teenager, I don’t see anything wrong with staying up, especially on weekends. I have been so exhausted lately that I never do anymore, (apart from once every two, three weeks when I find the energy.)I’M the one who gets up around 7, preparing breakfast, dressing them and looking after them until my dad comes back home. If it’s a school day, I get them dressed, fed, and ready and sometimes my mum would get up to take them to school; though most of the time it’s been me. Often leads me to be late or not going at all to school for myself. I haven’t seen my best friend for the past 3 months outside of school due to the lack of energy or me having to go look after my brothers.  

My parents relie on me for everything and often call me from my room when I’m either studying or playing with friends for simple tasks they could do themselves (example; bring them something, check on my brothers in their room. MY BROTHERS DONT HAVE A DOOR AND ITS LITERALLY JUST A DUCK AROUND THE CORNER FROM MY PARENTS ROOM, LITERALLY JUST STEP OUT FROM THEIR ROOM BY AN INCH, AND YOU SEE IT THEM.) 

I’m so exhausted and tired emotionally and physically, I feel like a mother and I lost so many connections with amazing people because of this. My parents don’t show any fucking gratefulness towards it, yet still decide to be upset with me if I tell them I had a plan to go out with a friend (which they agreed to weeks prior) or tell me it’s my responsibility to take care of my brothers and that I should study more because I’m failing school, I want to be a good daughter but it’s been so draining, Maybe it doesn’t sound bad but I don’t feel like a teenager like I should, I feel trapped, as if I conceived those kids. 

I don’t know what to do anymore with my parents, I posted on here to let out some desperate feelings and maybe get enlightened if someone who had a similar issue with their parents, any advice or anything I can say to my parents to help them understand I’ll be so grateful.",26Oct2019,4

Apparently everyone had some high expectations of me to get a really low time. I was also hyped of doing it. But it went like dog shit and I feel so bad now. The first 2 things was to jump up on a big thing named ""plint"" in swedish and grabbing ropes with rings and swing once and jump down on a big mattress followed by 2 PE benches which are flipped upside down making it harder to balance on. I went to fast on the 2nd bench and when I was about to jump of with 1 foot to the left side. My foot made the entire thing flip over on it's side and me making me hit my hip right on it. I had to do the rest without any glasses and was still dizzy. This was all on time. Everything was blurry and on only 10 seconds I made everyone cheering on me to getting completely quiet. I don't remember what time I got exactly. It was either 2:36 or 3:36. I was to busy. And I even gave up on doing the last one after 1 try. I felt like a big let down and failure and I still do. Everyone saw me completely fuck up after cheering on me. And my ignorant head couldn't take what my friend said. You still pushed through and tried. In my head at least. All I see is that people only want to see results and not how well you tried. I was the only one who fell on the first seconds and I just hate myself now knwoi I probably let everyone down and how probably everyone else who tried seriously got a way better time. I think I need some serious help because I can't stop comparing myself, I can't stop thinking People have high expectations.

Thinking about how if I pull the trigger there will be a moment when I know I’m past the point of no return and that this is it. I am past the decision but I am still not really better mentally. 

Life is full of ups and downs, right? In life you have to work hard to get what you want. Just like how I worked hard for years straight to do well in my courses. I don’t want to feel like that. Always working. I make myself busy, either I am doing a shit ton of work at once or none at all. I hate it. I got to my lowest in my life and just stopped caring. I got four C’s.

I want to go back there I was safe there I felt happy there for the first time I felt happy then they moved me here, I've been seeing an art therapist to help me then these pigs cancel it cause it costs too much I've built up a bond with this person over the past 3 years.



That's not the worst, a few weeks ago I was bashed by a co client I could have suffered serious brain damage (luckily I only got a bump on my head. I've had water thrown on me been punched carers just shrug it off because it would be paperwork which they hate.

I pick up and say 'Hey Dave what's up' but he doesn't respond, at first I thought nothing of it, probably technical difficulties or some shit I don't know. I keep trying to talk to him for a few seconds but hear nothing in return, so I hung up. Literally 5 seconds later he calls again and I pick up the phone, still nothing, but this time I hear something in the background, sounds like a TV or something really unintelligible, it's really faint so I had to listen really hard, I kept calling him but still nothing. After a minute or so I begin to think he is joking around. But after the phone rang for the third time I listened to those background noises for 15-20 minutes, and you will agree that's a bit beyond joke, right? I began to worry and called some other friends who claimed not to have heard of him since wednesday or so. I called Dave back a few times but he didn't answer, but after a few more tries he declined my call and sent me one of those 'call me later' quick automatic messages. I called again and he picked up, again it was just some background noise for a minute but then it sounded like someone whispered something, I didn't understand what it was so I said loudly 'What?' and he hung up. At this point I started to panic. I drove to his house and he wasn't home ( He lives alone ) His car was there but he wasn't home, I kept calling other friends and no one knew what was happening, I just got back home to write this and ask for some serious advice because I feel this could be dangerous since there are some people that don't get along with us but I doubt they would do something like that.

394,"The house is run down. The bank owns it currently and they’re being evicted in 3 months. The dad has a room upstairs so does his brother, and my boyfriend is left with a makeshift “room” in the living room downstairs which consists of a bed and box spring hat sits on the floor, a headboard, and that’s it. You could see him sleeping when you walk into the house. I’ve been with my boyfriend going on 3 years in April, and spend a good majority of my time at his house. (Dealing with a different situation at my moms house). 

To try to make a long story short, the dad favors his brother, but mostly himself. I was raised differently on my parents did their very best to put their children first, even if it was giving up their own room at the time for me or my little brother. So in reference to this, seeing his dad take so little notice on his needs pisses me off. The dads never home because he works and then runs around with his drunk girlfriend who bitches at him whenever he ACTUALLY decides to do something for his son. 

The rats were in the walls. Then they were in the kitchen. Then they figured out how to get into the walls upstairs once it got colder, and then they’re running around everywhere at night. Now, I’m waiting to wake up to one of them running across us. 

I’m pretty sure they chewed the wiring because only two outlets work downstairs. There’s no electric in the kitchen or living room. Cool. They’re leaving soon anyways. But the rats. The only food in the kitchen was the dog food and they got into it. The dad still feeds the dog, in the kitchen, in the dark, before he leaves for work, and I’m starting to notice the dog doesn’t even want to eat his food until it’s very light out and the rats go back into the walls. 

He makes jokes about shit running around, he’s aware it’s going on, but doesn’t care. It pisses me off, how can’t you care that your son is sleeping with rats running all around him? How can’t you care that the dog is being affected by it ? How can’t you care enough to buy some rat traps (we can’t use poison because of the dog and we also don’t know how we’d get the dead and dying ones out of the walls). 

My boyfriend has brought it up to him but he never has an actual discussion. It’s like “oh yeah I know” or “hahaha that happened to you? They tore up your garage?” Or whatever they did. It’s fucking annoying. My boyfriend is currently unemployed and trying to find a job, and everyone else in the house, but the dad, is extremely tight on money. I don’t know a clear solution to the rats because a few traps won’t do much at this point. It seems the dads solution is waiting for the time to be up in the house. In the meantime he seems a-okay in letting his son live like this. I don’t judge my boyfriend, it’s not his fault and he doesn’t have the means to change it. But the dad does, and imo should be his responsibility. My boyfriend is 20 and trying to find work to change the situation but it’s not easy right now. 

I’m sorry if this is all over the place, I could’ve make this post about several different things his dad does, but this is the most serious one because rat shit and piss gives you up to like 20+ diseases. I need to figure out a way to approach his dad, and find a solution to the rats.",26Oct2019,1

I don’t leave the house except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. sometimes it’s ok but other times it’s very difficult. I always get put on the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some fat young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking yet he had severe acne all round his mouth and was vastly overweight.  don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job and a girl and her dad was standing drinking the girl looked at me with a blank stare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s wha I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face, yet she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask, it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once. Also the there’s a guy who’s a higher up authority on my part  I work and he’s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I’m skinny and on the way home I went the shop for food and a guy was smirking at me looking me down and stared at me facially still smirking. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh.  I have bad depression too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re snotty I take it personally. The most painful thing is when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s a complete douche. 5 years ago a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(",26Oct2019,0

406,"Hi, I (19M) am still studying and might be for a few years ahead too.

My father (50) has a business that he himself started from scratch and he earns enough to support our family more than sufficiently. But since he started working early with not so good working conditions he is now very tired out from work and is stressed out regularly. 

He wants me to continue with the business when I'm ready (which i don't mind, I have some interest in the field too) but he and I both want my studies to take priority.

The problem is my studies will take a few years at the very least and I'm pretty sure my father's will might burn out by then to keep working on his own (the daily work is not very easy too, it's a lot of physical labour which even I cant handle with my current stamina). He even though never forces me, he does mention me that he wants me to take over very soon, as soon as possible, because he is very tired of it. And he can't exactly just shut down the business because it is his life long work and I don't expect him to either. 

He's a very closed off person so I don't know exactly how much tired out he is with his work life but I can see that he is very frustrated and often lashes out with the family. I don't know what to do.

I've read (and tried) all the online lists on ""how to make a lot of money fast,"" and it's all the same BS if you ask me.

409,"This is probably going to be a long post so bear with me. 

For the past year, I have been enrolled in a full-time Design Bootcamp, thus meaning I can't have a day job I do work part-time through the Bootcamp but that will bring in at most 150 dollars every 2 weeks and I do try and give myself some downtime I the effort of not overworking myself like I have in the past. To put it simply I am vary broke, my parents cover my expenses like gas rent and other types of bills. here is problem #1 I live with my GF for the past year we've been together for almost a year and a half I do have my own apartment that I pay rent at but have only stayed there for a handful of times. (I know dumb right) the reason I didn't get rid of my apartment I wanted a backup plan in case I and my GF didn't last since we kinda rushed in to move in together and I didn't want to screw over my friends who I lived with.

so I pay all my bills my other place and my GF pays for the ones at the apartment we share and pays for food that I eat and lots of other things witch a first I was said no its not your job to pay for my things but she says she loves me and its ok I still think she shouldn't be paying for me but when your as poor as I am its hard to say no to anyone willing to buy you some food or something like that. also her family is super nice to me just took me on a week vaction to Mexico paid for everything. her family really likes me and I really like them and I love my GF but i don't know if I want to marry her and I know that is was she is looking for and wants to get to that point with me someday. I make it clear Idk what is going to happen in the future which isn't a cop-out since I really don't know my finish my Bootcamp in three months and I'm starting to look for jobs but my city does not have a lot of design jobs im looking for so I might have to move and I won't pass up a job since I've been working really hard. ( note: she just signed a new lease for a new apartment that we will be splitting rent but if I were to leave the city for a job she would be able to afford on her own)

I also forgot to mention my GF has a lot of anxiety depression issues and can really be a handful when her insecurities get turned on me.   

on top of all of this, I don't get to hardly see my friends they live 25 mins away, downtown they all have good jobs so they want to go out and get dinner and got bars that I can't afford, they think it causes I'm whipped by my GF witch isn't true just don't have money to do that thing they want to do.  (note: we have done things that don't cost money but in your mid-20s partying a was what we all want todo) Also, me and my GF have the same friend group.

so Basically im feeling like a piece of shit for lots of reasons and Idk what to do 

do I leave my GF since I don't know if I want o to marry here and I know that was she wants? Even though I will proply look like I was just using her for her money.

am I an asshole for not doing this sooner since I was afraid of how it might affect both of us?

so around 7am i woke up on my stomach with my pj pants slightly down. he was on top of me then i was like what are you doing. he went inside of me for about 30-45 seconds. i told him to stop a few times while he was then he finally did.

412,"Before I ask for the advice it’s a little bit of a story, sorry. Also this is a repost.

Too embarrassed to post this on my main account, but I literally feel like I’m wasting my life. I’m 16 which is supposedly the prime of my life but all I’m doing is sitting in bad all day depressed. I’m practically a mute at school, my mom is and was abusive to me my whole life so I never really learned how to talk or communicate with people. I can’t really explain it without telling a life story but I pretty much drove myself into depression staying in my room for pretty much all day. When ever I do come out my room it’s always a fight with my mom and sister, they pretty much bully me to be honest. I have bags under my eyes from sleeping too much, becoming suicidal but too much of a pussy to put myself in any pain but can’t afford any painless methods. A while ago I came to the conclusion I’m going to get treated like shit either way so I gave up on keeping my grades up and started skipping school(also I got into a pretty bad drug habit, daily weed smoking that brought me to a psychosis, and pretty much anything that can get me high, especially psychedelics). I’m supposed to be in 11th grade but stayed back twice but got my credits back last year so I’m in 10th grade. 

What should I do? I don’t think I can deal with my mom or sister anymore(it’s really bad, honestly it might sound like a teenager overreacting but they really do bully me, for example today I missed the bus and the whole way to school my mom told me she hated me and wished she listened to my dad about getting an abortion when she had me(I don’t understand why she was so mad because she literally drives my sister to school everyday) when I brought that up she tried to hit me. This happens weekly. I would go to the councilor but I’m too antisocial and think it’s too much work, and if they call any child services I’ve heard nothing but bad things about living with them, and I only have 2 more years until I’m 18 and I can leave, I might get treated like shit but I’ll still have warm meals everyday. 

I also don’t know where to go, I want to go to Canada for college but I don’t think I’ll get very far with terrible grades. If I were to get straight As for this and next year and make my credits back would any colleges accept me? 

I’ve quit smoking weed because it makes me feel terrible. Actually I’ve quit most drugs except for lsd or shrooms once a month(I’m pretty sure this has no effect on me and honestly it’s kinda sad but if I didn’t try psychedelics I probably would’ve killed myself a while ago)

I also need to fix this antisocial thing I’m doing right now. I probably could have friends and I used to before I started hiding in my room. I’ve also lost and could’ve started relationships but I’m just terrible at talking to me(I’m a pretty good looking guy and have had a few girls come up to me trying to start something but I’m just too awkward. It’s not that I don’t know what to say my voice is just used to being quiet so I talk quietly). I’ve met a couple people at my school but I only talk to them in school, people know that I have a quiet personality and a fun personality, but the teachers don’t and I’m pretty sure all my teachers think I’m going to be a school shooter or something. I can honestly see why I’d give off some shooter vibes but I don’t really care that much.

My plan at this point is to get a visa, move to Canada and hope I can get into college if I fix my grades. I think I can write a really good letter about my struggles in life and how I made a 180° turn and got my shit together, I hope they’ll understand and accept me, I’m not doing any activities for school and I’d be lying if I said I would join a club or something. If that doesn’t work, I don’t have any other goals and know other plans so I’ll probably just kill myself or something, it might sound awful but I doubt I could do anything with my life after that except be homeless or a drug addict.",26Oct2019,3

414,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons...

Alright, I guess I'll just start typing.

I was a loner for most of my life, pretty much troughout the entirety of elementary and middle school I kept my friend circles tiny, and my romantic circles basically nonexistent. In high school I finally thought it was about time to try something like a relationship (I was always a romantic which gave roots to the desire).

And so it was, I got a girlfriend in high school.

Now, the journey was quite rocky. My social and ESPECIALLY romantic skills were practically zero, which resulted in us breaking up after a while. Now that's when the ""you don't know what you have untill you lose it"" mentality ate me alive. I never stopped persuing her considering we were amazingly compatible and I was CERTAIN I'd never even come close to anything like that at that point in my life.

Now some shit hits some fans.

While I was desperate, she wasn't, at least not yet. She made out with a couple of guys which she later on described as ""just wondering if I got over you"". Long story short, a few sleepless nights and tears later, we were back together. Note I stayed focused only on her, never giving any other girls as much as a chance, although I could have. This will be important later.

It's been two years now...

""Oh that's lovely, you're doing great"" you might be thinking. Well, WE are I guess, although I necessarily am not. See, I've learned to suppress the effect of what happened with her and those guys over time, to the point where I finally barely even thought about it. She was my first everything, and I was her first... Well, most things.

You might see where this is going now...

See relationships progress, and some issues occur here and there, nothing large. We rarely ever legitimately fought over anything, maybe a handfull of times in these two years. But something's off...

See, I value experiences over all. As an atheist, I'm firm in my position this is the only chance at life I'll ever get, so my goal is to experience as much of it as humanly possible. Which brings us to the current issue.

I do love her, which might sound weird after such foreshadowing, but I really do. But I'm yet again eaten alive by a different mentality this time. That mentality being: ""I never fooled around, no matter how much she did.."". Basically, I'm starting to feel like I'm waaaay too fucking young, and have *experienced* waaaay too fucking little to commit at this level without doing ANYTHING else EVER, unlike her. Keep in mind, she has full blown plans about going to college in the same area, living together, all of it. She's full on 100% commited, which just makes it all so much worse.

Now when these thoughts started, none of them were powerful enough for me to even CONSIDER doing anything as drastic as breaking up, especially after all this time. But man... These things stack up quite fast. It really is one of those ""I wish we met later in life"" types of situations, considering I'm still not certain I'll ever meet anyone like her ever again.

Now what makes this situation even harder is the fact that after all this time, we now of course share friend groups and many people in her life and now invested in mine, and vice versa. And I have NO CLUE what a breakup would do to those relationships she or I have with those people. Basically, I'm terrified.

That's pretty much it, I don't even know what I'm hoping for as an answer. A part of me desperately hopes this is just a teenage phase, yet a part of me is slowly coping with the fact that it might not be.

So, what do you think?",26Oct2019,1

416,"So.. Usually I’m not the extrovert I rather listen and just reply and be the wise friend with the good advice.. but still if I tell something (which is rare) I expect my friends to listen to me. For clarification this is in a group of 4 including me. (2 females : me and my friend and 2 male friends)
So my female friend is more the talkative one who really likes to be listened to and given attention to. And I don’t have an issue with that because if I don’t , at least her boyfriend ( one of the male friends) or the other friend will give her the “attention“ that she seeks. 
Sometimes she be talking about unnecessary shit and everybody listens even if it’s pointless or long as fuck. But when I try to say something it goes unnoticed and in a way I feel shitty. 
I shut up most of the time and just listen (that’s just how I am), this mostly applies to regular conversations, not jokes, but still I don’t think they get that I be quiet for a reason (like: the less I speak the more it’s appreciated because it’s rare). I think My friend (the female one) doesn’t even know about that and to say it I’m not the person to approach how I feel about it (to her or to them).",26Oct2019,3
417,"For 2 years I (14F) have wanted my hair cut super short with a dark green steak, a pixie cut kinda thing but shorter on the sides and  spikier. I currently have VERY VERY long dark brown hair, very thick and absolutely beautiful freshly washed and dried.. but that's it. Within a day or two the ends are dry and rough (they're dead ends, I have several inches of it) and it just doesn't feel good. 

Pros: Lovely scarf in the English weather. Loads of compliments. Make mustache and beard out of it. Uhhhhh??? 

Cons: Heat + my hair = frying pan. In the way constantly. Tangled as soon as I move. Doesn't suit me. Literally all.over my carpeted floor, seriously I so like 20 minutes just scraping up massive balls of hair. I look awful with my hair tied back, and I'm on an animal Care college course which requires hair tied back every Friday, I also bake and cook a lot.

My bf is completely against cutting it that short and I understand why, hes fine with the green tho. My Nan however thinks I'm being stupid for wanting to cut such long hair that I've been growing for 14 years with only 1 haircut (in like year 2 or 3) and that I'll regret getting it cut like that. When I was little i was completely against cutting it, and I kept saying that even though I was slowly liking it less and less. Recently a college friend has said how much short hair would suit me and I agree more than ever. I'm broke, so I can't get it done myself, Nan refuses to help me with that for reasons above. And tbh I'm terrified that if I get it done that she might be right and I'll regret it, or that she'll make her usual comments about my decisions. In fact, she is constantly insulting the hairstyles I like when she sees them (short on the sides longer on top) and I unfortunately go along with it to avoid pissing her off (recently said that she doesn't need to comment so much and oohhhh boy).

419,"Hi guys,

Going through different waves of post-break up emotions. I broke up with her, then keep telling myself she was the one even though I've had several chances to try and I always ended up feeling the same way.

The thing that gets me is thinking of her with a new man, new dates, new adventures. It breaks me. But today I finally blocked her on social media and checked a post she made and a comment she left under the photo to her old 'good friend' who she used to sleep with, so not really an ex as such. But I know he's a good guy, the comment was clear that they were together.

I almost felt weight off my shoulders knowing that she's not with some random guy but a guy that I already know about.

Does this reinforce my feelings of not wanting to be with her? Otherwise, whoever she was with would break me because it's not 'me' including this guy I already know.

I've been struggling with a lot of thoughts recently which I've put down to the ego and a sense of loss.

It's almost like the suspense was worse than the reality.

420,I started smoking weed about a year ago before bed as a sleep aid due to Ptsd from family trauma. I have smoked weed every night before bed for more than a year. However I'm doing much better in life and I'm extremely motivated and doing everything in my power to work and get as much work in my personal life and university and work life to get somewhere. I started sleeping 6 hours a night and started meditation twice daily as well and I'm feeling great but I have now reached a point where I'm wondering if the smoking every night is helping or slowing me down. Worth noting that I work from waking up till bed and I usually take the last hour before bed to smoke weed (only one joint ever night before bed I limit it to that) and relax while I drink my green tea and mediate afterwards I feel it keeps me sain. My question is is it good or bad and if so what are better night routines or things I can do an hour before bed to relax.,26Oct2019,1

However recently I have smelled cigarette smoke in my moms car. And in her room. And in the house. I EVEN FOUND A PACK OF CIGARETTES IN HER DRAWERS! I am pretty upset and disappointed as, coming from such an anti smoking home, smoking is such a low and damaging thing to do yourself. We especially would know eg: my grandmother having to carry an oxygen tank around with her as she couldn’t breathe properly from smoke damage. She seems to be smoking every day as she smells of it every day and is always chewing gum. I have no idea if my dad or younger bro know and I’m too scared to ask. WHAT DO I DO???

424,"I graduated NYU Magna Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa and scored in the 96.6th percentile on my LSAT. I have a chance at getting into T14 law schools. Maybe even NYU Law which is ranked #6 in the country; however, I don't want to be a lawyer. I love working in politics and want to keep doing it. If my team wins the local elections this cycle, I have a well-paying leadership position doing work I love and high standing in the party infrastructure. This opportunity only became available after I applied to law school. If I don't get into law school and my team wins the election or vice versa then there's no decision to be made. If my team wins, and I get into NYU law or another prestigious program then I have a very hard choice to make. Lots of people would kill to go to a top law school, and it could provide a lot of opportunities down the line. On the other hand, going to law school is skipping out on building my network back home where I want to continue to work in politics. My instinct is to not go to law school because I never wanted to go - it was something I was doing to please my parents. My folks are worried that without a law degree I could be putting a ceiling on how far I can advance, but I think the work you do and the experience you get are more valuable. It's not an easy decision, and it's one I can't even make yet until after election day and then if I actually get into law school. It's hard not to feel like I have to make the decision now.

425," 

hello everybody! I'm using a throwaway for this post but honestly I kind of hope the person I'm seeking advice about sees this because maybe it'll help somehow.

**BACKGROUND**

I started doing a very specific type of amateur performance art about two years ago. A woman who also does this art that used to live in my city but has moved to a larger one where more people in the scene live has a personal vendetta against me and I don't know how to proceed.

This all started about a year ago and I'm happy to provide more info about the details of her beef in the comments if people feel it's relevant but the gist of my issue is that this woman is obsessed with me. She tries to relentlessly shit talk me to anyone who will listen, including people in my local scene and hers (of which there is a lot of crossover). She also posts about me on social media once every few days basically calling me ugly, stupid, bad at my art, a hater etc. even going so far as to call me a predatory incel (of which there is no basis for this claim). It's gotten to the point where when she posts on social media, even if she's not using my name everyone knows she's talking about me.

The worst part is I have only met her in real life twice, both of which were after she started her smear campaign against me. I have never gone out of my way to engage with her when we ended up at the same events, but she has purposely sought me out and been very friendly to my face, only to immediately start speaking ill of me afterwards.

**THE ISSUE**

At this point I'm starting to get concerned with how long this has gone on and the frequency of which she feels compelled to post about and talk about someone she doesn't really know. I am somewhat concerned about professional repercussions of her speaking ill of me to others, but more than anything I just want her to leave me alone. I recognize that there's definitely mental illness at play but I don't think I should have to bear the brunt of this.

I'm worried that blocking her on social media would set her off, and I've considered speaking with her directly but again, she doesn't keep this energy in person and because she has never explicitly used my name on her social media posts, I suspect she would just deny they were about me and it wouldn't be a productive conversation.

But I'm coming here for advice on how to deal with this situation because it's making me feel crazy and also kind of scared? All advice is appreciated and like I said I'm happy to provide more information!

**TLDR**

I need help dealing with a person who obsessively speaks ill of me to people who have an impact on my career in a very specific art field.",26Oct2019,0
426,"Hello, all. I share an apartment with my best friend (possibly former best friend) and last weekend we had a pretty distressing, awful fight about something work-related that became very personal. I was insanely mad at what he said and the argument was very close to getting physical. I don’t believe I was totally in the right, but I certainly wasn’t in the wrong. The thing is, we both deal terribly with conflict and are prone to passive-aggressive behavior. In my case, I am very introverted and find it hard to discuss my feelings with others, including him at times. We have gone without talking to each other after arguments in the past, but it feels different this time. We have stopped acknowledging each other’s existence completely and the silent animosity going on is insanely difficult for me to handle. 

I am at a disadvantage, because he has a girlfriend, other friends and family who live in the city and he can turn to them in moments like this (and always does), but I have no one here except him, which means that if we’re not talking, I am not talking to anyone, and he knows that. The isolation combined with us not even looking at each other is godawful to take and it has made me resent him even more. He knows I am prone to feeling lonely, alienated and depressed and this feels like punishment and pure insensitivity on his part. I was prepared to talk to him last night. I was sitting in the living room when he got home with his girlfriend, but he turned his face and refused to even look at me while his girlfriend greeted me. That really made me give up, it was enraging. There are other microaggressions happening. For example, he started locking his bedroom door before he leaves the house (I only know this because I can hear him locking it), which I know sounds normal, but he NEVER does that, he wouldn’t even close this door before the fight. I am not sure what this is supposed to mean. That he does not trust me and thinks I will do something?  

I feel incredibly uncomfortable in the apartment now and honestly just feel like moving out without even saying a word. I resent him a lot for taking this so far, and I realize I am also guilty for not starting a conversation and also doing the silence thing, but now it feels like talking to him would be a sign of weakness (and boy do I know I sound weak in this post!) and like he won this shit or something. I can’t even sleep properly because the negative environment is affecting me terribly.

I guess I am just looking for some advice on how to handle this properly, without doing something stupid. Thanks.",26Oct2019,1

433,"Tldr; asshole when drunk friend picks fights with strangers wants to go on big trip while drunk

Hey reddit I’m dealing with a friend right now that I need advice for. He’s a good guy when he’s sober but when he drinks there’s two sides of him. He will either be happy and make everybody around him have a fun time or he’ll be an asshole and try to pick fights with anyone for any reason. 

We used to go on trips with our friend group and now that he turned 21 he wants to go on a big trip.  all of us decided to go to either the Florida keys or San Diego. 

Here comes the issues when we went on fun trips he was sober and wasn’t stupid. He picked a few fights over the stupidest reasons last night he tried fighting a guy over the fact he was listing to really old country music. I de escalated that situation then he got into it with a native lady because he kept calling her Mexican and speaking Spanish to her. 

I’m afraid if we go on a trip he’s gonna piss off the wrong person and it’s gonna end badly and we’re gonna be half way around the country and he’ll be either beat badly or in jail. 

What should I do now I have to approach him about this and he will absolutely refuse to not drink and get drunk on the trip.

435,"Hey there r/advice. I’m on a throwaway and also omitting some details for privacy lol. 

I (23F) got a job at a different branch of the same company my parents work at. All has been well and good- it’s a great company, my coworkers are awesome, and I work in a bit of a niche field where there aren’t many other options for the work I want to do. My coworker know my family is at the other branch, but it hasn’t been an issue until now. 

My boss recently assigned me to a project that involves collaborating with the other branch and (guess what!) my dad is also on the project. He and I get along really well and can work well together on projects. Everyone else on the team also knows we are father/daughter. 

However- I don’t know how to address him. All my life, I called my parents “mommy” and “daddy” and frankly I know it’s childish and has weird connotations but it’s also what they called their parents. I don’t feel comfortable calling my dad “daddy” in a work meeting or around coworkers. I’m trying to establish myself as a young professional and I feel like calling him that will undermine my own competence at work. 

Our work is relaxed- everyone goes by first names, but I’m not sure if I should switch from “Daddy” to his name when we are in public together or maybe just switch to “Dad.” I think he’ll be a little more open to being called something different than my mom if I just start calling him something but will probably blow things out of proportion if I address the topic directly (i.e., tell me I’m overthinking things).

Grandma didn’t want to press any charges against my mom, so the cops couldn’t really do much at all.

The medications helped but made me feel numb emotionally and also caused other side effects. In May of 2019, I talked to my psychiatric physician's assistant about this and we agreed that I can taper off both medications. So far, the taper is going well and I am not done tapering off the medications, but I am almost done. One thing that was on my mind however is whether the sexual side effects would improve after stopping the antidepressant. I talked to my primary care physician and three psychiatric physician's assistants and they all told me that my sexual side effects would improve within two months after stopping the antidepressant. However, when I Googled this, I got something else.

I told my PCP about this and he told me this...

I do think that part of it has to do with the fact that she’s at the age most people are grandparents, but she doesn’t have any grandchildren so she spoils the dog instead. 
I also think that because I’m 15 she isn’t taking me seriously. another reason she might not be listening is because the dog technically belongs to my older brother, even though my brother is listening to what I’m saying, and when my brother is working ( he travels weeks at a time for work) I am the one in charge of the dog. 

I love my dog a lot and it makes me furious that she doesn’t listen to me when I’ve insisted that me and my brother with take care of the treats. But it also just belittles me when she doesn’t listen.

So I followed a girl who I dated a long time ago even though I’m in a relationship. Think she just realized that I had a girlfriend and unfollowed me saying what do I want from her. 

That it would be different if we started off as friends but we didn’t and that the last time we spoke ended very badly.( Which it did end terribly with her getting really hurt) She said that she is always be more into me than a friend and that I can’t be in her life. She said she can’t understand why I thought it would be a good idea to add her while I’m in a relationship that I know she still has feelings for me and that I’ve brought up things she didn’t want to think about.

It's now 5 years later and I still have it saved and think about it all the time. We basically stopped taking after I graduated but the letter still lays heavily on me. Everytime I'm working out it crosses my mind once. I don't want anything romantic with her and I don't want to bother her but I still feel this drive to talk to her and give her the letter. The letter is me confessing me feelings to her from five years ago. Is this something I should just forget about? Is there some sort of closure I'm looking for?

So I took a lot of the advice and someone commented how I could get replica from China. I carefully researched this to find a really really good knock off. I had to order from different suppliers and spent close to $500 between the price and shipping to get the highest quality replica.

So I came home early from work before he came home. I laid everything out on his bed and wait for him to come home. Just so you know he has been giving me the silent treatment since this time and is still upset .

So I surprise him and he is in awe! He could not believe it! He was literally crying with happiness . He instantly put on the outfit and everything fit. He even made me take a bunch of photos with his phone. ( he is super protective of it and never lets me even hold it ) he started to post everywhere on his IG, snap, Tik tok. He even made me help him with a edit where the clothes were throw at him and edited to be on him. It was a great bonding experience and I felt like the wall between us was breaking .

I had some extra cash and took him out to dinner. We were able to chat and he said “I am so happy you found a way, I knew you would be able to afford it”

So I didn’t let him know the clothes were a replica . Then the next day at school, I get a call from the superintendent. It turns out that a lot of the kids at school saw his social channels and started comparing his clothes to the replicas . (Side note it was incredibly hard to distinguish) anyway the kids in a crew that have “drip” questioned him and they proved somehow that his clothes were not real. He defended me and said that dad bought all this etc . They said “your dad is a hypocrite you said yourself ... Dripocrite”” and they all chanted and called him a dripocrite. This lead to a fight with him and 3 other boys. One of the boy’s got pushed and fell and knocked out a permanent front tooth. When I saw my boy he was crying and had blood all over his ripped shirt . He and the other boy’s are suspended for a week and the superintendent says I have to get him anger management . To further complicate things one of the parents iluded to me paying the dental bill for the boy who’s tooth is knocked out. 

It is just one thing after another .  My son won’t talk with me, I feel alone and helpless and all I wanted to do was make my son happy. Is there anything I can do to help ? I can’t afford any of this What do I do now ??",26Oct2019,2
478,"Hello all,

I met a bumble boy about three weeks ago and I invite him to an almost weekly trivia night that I have with other graduate students. He enjoyed it and came a second time. Afterwards everyone goes to a nearby gay bar and around 1 I decided that I should leave. Bumble boy invites himself over and we are drove to my place. 

When I get home I realize this guy is way drunker than me so I stop any making out - fearing I would cross any boundaries. After he attempts to start the second makeout session he asks if he should take an uber home and I say yes, but then he backtracks and starts saying “Lets go to bed”. I was taken aback, but he could have been implying many things. I told him to take an uber several times. 

He does not leave and asks to use the bathroom instead. Queue him vomiting for like half an hour. Its now after 2 am and I am frustrated. I give him a couple of blankets and a pot. In the morning, he apologies profusely and cleans the pot he threw up and suggested that we get redemption tea this weekend. I am not attracted to him anymore, but Should I have tea with him? I don’t how me not getting tea together will affect the dynamic of the trivia group.

480,"First of all I want to apologise about the post length but it is a confusing situation and I want to explain everything in detail. Second I'm on mobile so sorry about any formatting issues.

I was just wondering if I should keep in contact with my friend we have a great friendship and she has genuinely helped me through a lot of things but after talking too my boss and college (in a small shop and everyone is very close all good friends and talk about personal issues a lot) over time about some of the admittingly weird things we do they have been concerned about if she is using me for attention. I genuinely love her and everything about her and she is one of those people I feel like I can talk about anything with but after the discussion with my boss I just want the opinion of a third party.

First for context I have a crush on this person and it has been kinda, kinda not reciprocated at different times. She is very much lesbian a Leaning bi, but has admitted she does find me attractive and would be willing to go out with me but is unsure about going out with a guy after she has been hurt before. I understand this and am happy too stay as friends but admittingly would love too be in a relationship with her if it was a possibility. We are both very open about ourselves sexually and both don't really care about nudity around each other. For example some of the weirdest things we have done are.

Shower naked together.

Sleep in the same bed naked or pretty much naked and hug.

Talk and actively show each other the porn where into too.

Repeatedly touch each other's sexual body parts when around each other.

And a few more things friends wouldn't do like naked massages, talk about moving in together etc, hug frequently whilst watching movies etc.

Obviously these things aren't normal and both me and her both know that and tbh I don't really care. 

My main fear is She is using me for attention. Personally knowing her I don't think she is but the comments from my boss has kinda got me worried that I am looking at this from a bias perspective. Obviously I love spending time with her and she is one of those few people who I feel like I genuinely have a close and loving bond with. This person has helped me through family deaths, my anxiety and depression and too my knowledge has never lied too me about anything and will be honest if I have done something wrong and help me improve on myself. But is it possible that I am looking at this all through rose tinted glasses and she is really just using me for the attention. I understand this is a difficult situation and hard too know without knowing me personally. But I'd like a third parties perspective. 

Again sorry for the length but I hope it was at least a interesting read despite my terrible grammar and punctuation.",26Oct2019,1
481,"So, I work with a girl who I went to high school with before I graduated. She is currently in her junior year of hs while I’m in my sophomore year of uni. Ive known her for a couple years now and we both recently started talking a bunch and making plans to hang out and what not. She’s definitely giving me a lot of the “lets date” kinda vibes. Anyway, I’d like to think I’m a person with good morals so this is all pretty difficult for me to wrap my head around. In my state, the age of consent is 16, but I’m finding it difficult to accept that. I have a lot of respect for this girl and we have a lot in common, I mean, more than I’ve had with any person before. I don’t have any intention of doing anything sexual with her until she turns 18, regardless of the AoC, thats just due to my own morals. That being said, I really do think I want to date her, but My biggest issues is convincing myself that this is 100% what I want to do. Im just worried of what may happen from this.

482,"So I just wrote all of this down and sent this to the company itself because I've been without a phone for a little bit, I just got out of the military and I've been trying to look for a job that will work around my back problem because it's pretty bad. So I did, sort of. I work at a car wash now and I have been for 3 days and everyone there's just been sort of treating me like shit. So I'll copy and paste it and I'm gonna let you guys decide whether or not I'm in the wrong, and if I'll be able to keep my job.



I'm writing this in email because I don't have access to a phone at the moment. But there was a situation with one of your assistant managers today where he decided to get very aggressive with me after telling him I was going to contact HR because it felt like they all were ostracizing me. He proceeded to say ""the bow tie can come off and we can go outside"" and then he told me to go out by the dumpsters. This all stemmed from an issue where a student employee was micromanaging me because I also believe he has problem with me as well. There have been several times where I've asked him nicely to stop and he continued to do so. So I did actually tell him to ""stop micromanaging me because its pissing me off"" and right after is when everything happened with the manager in charge at the time. Who I believe is driving to work without a license and is close friends with a number of people including the head manager, who's wedding is today and he was supposed to go to but he was left as the only manager on duty. Which is actually why I think he thought he could get away with what he did, but I've been in a management position before and his leadership skills are very unprofessional and he was very violent. He also today was walking around saying that ""is everyone who works here a f*cking idiot"" which he emphasized so I could hear it. And then he went on to say he was going to choke slam another employee because he didn't do his job right. The same exact employee that went and told the manager what I had said.

The problem is he's not the best educated, i don't really know how to say that without sounding like a jackass. But here's why that's an issue. I've always had an interest in things like literature, politics, and philosophy, and I'm not saying I'm some genius intellectual, I'm pretty average, but I enjoy studying and engaging with that kind of stuff. The issue is I can't have those kinds of conversations with him. Which again may not seem like a big issue, and at first it wasn't, when we first started hanging out just cracking jokes or talking about cars or a movie we liked was enough. But as we got closer I felt more and more like I was having to hold back when we hung out. I couldn't really talk about a lot of the more independent movies that I like, or books that I enjoy, opinions on world news and politics because when I try to he just doesn't understand what I'm talking about. And on the rare occasions that he does ask me about a book I'm reading or my opinion on a political issue I just feel like I'm talking at him. The real issue though is that the more this happens the more I find myself getting frustrated with him, and the more frustrated I get the more guilty I feel because I feel like I'm sometimes treating him like he's somehow less than me, which I know isn't true.

And I know I'm not always the easiest person to get along with, I'm pretty needy even in friendships, and can sometimes be a little moody, which is part of why I value our friendship so much, because he's always overlooked my flaws, and yet I can't even look past something as mundane and idiotic as not being able to always have the conversations I want.

495,"I'm in a long-term relationship with someone who supposly sees animals the same way I do : they are like my kids. 

Right now we have some pets, all found by my bf, tho I have to pay for almost everything they need, literally the only thing my bf pays ( smtimes I have to pay for these anyway) is for the snacks he likes to give to them. If I don't do everything that needs to be done like clean the water or food recipients, he wont do either, doesn't even notice till its extremely dirty or without any water at all, etc. 

 Last year smth really unfortunate happened, I cant describe it, but it showed my bf's true colors not just in terms of his personality but also the way he actually sees pets. At the time I didn't had the guts to leave him, we still had one cat who grew up at his home, and I was extremely weak from what happened. Now almost after a year, things got a bit out of control, we have 2 more pets, one of them is a big euphoric dog (H) . When he found H, the shelters were completly full and kennel is not a choice, streets are better than that tbh. I freaked out a little cause we don't  have space nor money to take care of this animal, so my bf preceded with his typical emotional blackmail, for example "" after all you don't love animals as much as you show; everyone will know about this, you are a shame; I can't do anything more for H I have to work, not lazy like you"". He didn't exacly love H when he found him cause he's all over the place, "" not really his type of dog"", basically H is not submissive at all, he thought I could take the dog to my house, but this didnt work, already have another dog and they hated each other. After a while my bf managed to find a new cat (B) . Well B is his favorite now, and H is "" just a host"". Somedays he's ok and treats H well but most days he's very nervous, never loosing a chance to say negative things to H, if H goes after the cats or does anyting wrong he hits him with a lot of frustration and manaces that he will kick H's teeth, if I defend H he menaces me and yes he has hit me too before.

 I tried to break up and asked if we could make some deal about the animals, I know they love him but he knows I see them as kids and he does the same supposly + he can't maintain them. The answer to this is "" the pets are mine (even H) and I can do whatever I want to them, you will never see them again, if you try to take them from me I will kill you, I fuck your life"". Sometimes he says this out of nowhere just to remind me. 

I'm afraid that if I leave he might end up giving the animals to his mom for example, who has no idea that there's food for animals and they cant eat human food, and will open the door to the street and never open again and just say they are gone ( happened before). I'm afraid he will forget to feed them, or smell the cats litter and just freak out with them (also happened before) etc etc

I have no life, everyday I'm afraid smth bad might happen to me or H. Somedays I have the oportunity to leave with the pet without him knowing, but I allways think that is also unfair for them, they will miss my bf and start a completely different and stressful life with my other pets at home, and maybe if Im gone my bf will gain responsability towards them? Idk, feel so indecise and stuck.

500,"7 months ago I got a job at my local arcade which I've been playing at since I was a baby but then a month later I quit due to it being a crappy job. It was my first job wasn't the worst but I had a lot of stress and problems in my life. The owner was the rudest bitch to his workers a lot of the time but if it was now I probably could have handled it. And you had to run around to do everything when there was like a few customers in the store and other employees to deal with the customers. It was also very busy at times and it was still the off season. I live in a coastal town and 6 months out of the year it's very dead and from the end of June to mid August being the height of the season and it being very busy on the weekends from mid May to mid September. It was only mid April and I couldn't handle the stress then easter was coming up which would probably be to busy for me at the time and I was worrying about memorial day weekend whihc is the busiest WEEK of the season.  

Anyways I quit a month later on easter weekend and the manager and the owner said ""Your always welcome to come back"" with a smile. The owner is actually one of the nicest people you would ever meet not to his employees though. I continued to come back but the other arcades started to be open every day but now the arcade which I worked it which I'll call arcade A is the only one open. The arcade has excellent customer service but again I decided I wanted to take revenge on the owner even though he almost defiantly won't be the worst place I EVER worked.  And I was only getting one day a week to work due to ""bad work peformance"" which I tried to keep up when the other newbies (mainly 14 yo's) were getting 3 days a week (friday-sunday) when the schools had off on friday. This is also the only hangout in town all year long. So should I go back there?

The pins and needle sensation spread to my leg and then across my body to my other arm briefly and into my face.  I had trouble breathing and was light headed.  This happened over the course of 20 or so minutes.
I chose not to go to the doctor as I do not have insurance (yay USA!) and naturally wanted to see if it would go away.
Today I rode my bicycle(I love biking) to work(I am cooking for Widespread Panic which seems ironic) and noticed it was much harder to ride and once again briefly out of breath but no pain.

So my question is this, while Im sure most will simply say go to the emergency room, what could they do for me?  I dont know if this was a mild heart attack or what but is there anything they can actually do?  I dont want an enormous bill which a single father can't afford.
Any help/advice/etc. will be appreciated.",26Oct2019,2
504,"I just discovered that one of my best friends (F) is bisexual and has started dating someone (F). Honestly the people that told me probably shouldn’t of even know but the person she is seeing revealed their relationship to a chatterbox. It is high school after all. My friend had previously mentioned something hinting at her being bisexual a couple of years ago but I could tell she was still uncomfortable with that part of her. How do I tell her, without revealing the information I know, that I’m always there for her?",26Oct2019,2

508,"My boyfriend of one year recently moved in with me. He has two medium-large sized dogs. They're not mean or aggressive in the least; however, they do get excited over the smallest noises and have a tendency to jump and (depending on if you're sitting/laying) trample you. I'm a very small person, about 5'1"" and 100 pounds, so I'm routinely left with scratches/bruises from their excitedness. It's kind of off-putting and almost takes away any desire I have to play or cuddle with them. A few days back, we were discussing how nice it's been living together so far, but he did mention it would be nice if I ""bonded"" more with the dogs. Does anyone have any advice on how to get more comfortable with dogs? I've only ever owned cats, so this is a learning experience.",26Oct2019,1
509,"I dated my ex for about 2 years back in high school and she was my first love. She left me because I didn’t like staying up late with her since I enjoy waking up early and because she wanted to find herself. We remained friends and 2 weeks later she had another bf and didn’t tell me. We stop communicating for years and recently started talking again. The feelings are still there I do love her and she claimed she loves me. Something just doesn’t feel right and I just don’t want to have nothing to do with her because I can’t stop thinking about the past. So it’s best to move on. I tried multiple times, I blocked her on everything. She made a new snap, then she got a new number 3 times, and now she started using texting apps. I always start back communicating with her when she finds another way to get in contact with me and this cycle keeps repeating. Should I give her another chance or just keep moving on? I just hate how she carries herself now and treats me. She acts like a hoe now and treats me like garbage in my opinion.",26Oct2019,0
511,"I live live in WV with my entire family. Everyone stayed here to be close the family.

I however, want to move to Cincinnati, which is only a three hour drive.

I wanted to move for multiple reasons.

(A) To have some independence.

(B) I’m a musician, and it’s really hard to find band mates in a rural area like this. If I move to a more populated area, it’s more likely I’ll find some bandmates and some more opportunities to grow my career.

(C) I want to be myself. I can’t do that around my family. They are too overprotective.

(D) I haven’t had much luck in the dating scene here. Maybe I’ll have better luck up north.

(E) I’m tired of this place. Between the corrupt judiciary system and the junkies out at night, this place isn’t great.

(F) I love going to concerts, but the big bands never come to WV, but they always stop somewhere in Ohio.

I’m almost prepared to leave.

I have a few grand saved up.

I have a good chunk of what I’ll need to live on for the first month or so.

I’ve already been scouting out places

And Because of my music and online merch sales, I have a small amount of income that will support me until I find a  job.

I already have everything planned out, but I don’t know if I’m ready to leave my family.

What if something happens and I’m not here?

512,"Been like this forever. A defence mechanism? 
I work in customer service (hate it Becuase I’m painfully shy and quiet but I’m trying so if anyone has any other tips on that) and I know it’s normal (please let me know if it’s not lol) to have a ‘customer personality’ like when you’re Uber nice when you’re serving people etc but at work I feel soooo inhibited and unable to be myself. My ‘customer service personality’ and politeness translates into how I am with coworkers etc. It’s so frustrating I feel unable to be myself. I’ve always been shy and reserved my entire life and I’m really trying to break that cycle of things and show my true personality. I think it’s like people pleasing? If I don’t know someone well enough (like super well) I’m really inhibited and polite and like oooh sorry ooh. It’s so annoying bc no one likes that. I’m not a suck up at all, just elements of people pleasing (although I couldn’t care less if they liked me???) I also find it hard to make real friends Becuase I have such a barrier of like politeness I can’t show me true self and connect. People like me, but they don’t know me. :(

I used to think I had like an inferiority complex type thing? I was scared of authority actively as a child, I wouldn’t talk to my teachers (ages like 4-8). If anyone can tell me what the fuck my problem is and how to stop it and stop giving a fuck what people think and embrace myself and stop feeling shy I will literally give you my first born child. How do I stop being ‘too nice’?",26Oct2019,2
513,"My sister (I no longer consider her as such) from whom I'd been estranged for a number of years recently betrayed me in such a way that reconciliation will never happen.  It was the most profoundly hurtful thing she could have done to me and our deceased mother.  My son (26) loves her (they don't see each other often, she lives far from the rest of us) and when I told him what she'd done (and he knows the situation very well) I said that he could decide for himself what he wanted their relationship to be and I would respect that.

In principle, I meant it  - it would be toxic and unfair to force him to choose sides.  And he won't, and I feel even worse that with full knowledge of what this means to me he won't be 100% supportive.  But I can't be angry without backing him into a corner which I know is unhealthy for us both.  I really don't know how to have any kind of conversation with him at all while I am still reeling.  I love him more than anything, but I have to make peace with myself before I can carry on as the mother I should be.  He lives half the country away.  Any advice would be so welcome.",26Oct2019,1
514,"Context: My cat Athena has been my child for 7 years now. My family does not like my cat so I’m the sole person that takes care of her. She’s been exiled from the rest of the house and has lived in my room and bathroom for 2 years now. It’s not too small a space and she’s got all her playthings and a cat tree by a big window so she’s ok there. I go to college 1000 miles away from home and I’m in a dorm so I can’t take Athena with me until next year when I can live off campus. Last year my family took care of her alright, they fed her, scooped her poop, and sometimes played with her. I always felt bad that I wasn’t there to properly take care of her but this was the best I could do. (Side note I am not close with my family for many reasons and I’ve tried to move out before)

This year the summer before I went back to school. My mom said I would have to give her away because they refuse to take care of her again. I refuse to give her away and eventually I talk my brother into taking care of her if I pay him $50 a month. It’s overpriced but worth it if I don’t lose my baby. I ask for picture updates of her to make sure she’s ok and every so often I get pictures of her outside. Apparently they let her outside sometimes, which isn’t that unusual since I do so also. The difference is that I stay with her outside to monitor her and make sure she doesn’t eat the plants bc some could be poisonous. She’s an inside cat and isn’t used to being outside so she’s less scared if I’m there. 

A week ago my parents flew up to visit me from Fri-Tue. On Monday I found out that my parents let Athena outside on Friday and my brother had not seen her since then. He had purposely left her outside to fend for herself while he went to the beach with his friends. I know this was on purpose because when I confronted him about it he just said “she’ll be fine”. You can imagine how upset I am. He doesn’t listen to me so I get my mom to talk him into looking for her which he puts off until the next day. 

This becomes a recurrent pattern of me giving them suggestion after suggestion of where to look and what to do and them not doing it until the next day or so because they’re “busy”. Or they just straight up don’t respond to my texts. I am doing EVERYTHING I can do 1000 miles away to help find her. I’ve told them what streets to look on, neighbors to check with, what shelters to call, I’ve posted on websites, I’ve made flyers. She’s been missing for a week now and they’ve given up looking and still haven’t passed out the flyers I made.

TLDR: I paid my family well to take care of my cat while I’m away at school and when they lost her they don’t care enough to look for her properly. 

Idk what else to do. This is the last straw for me and I really want to cut my toxic family out of my life.",26Oct2019,968
515,"I recently accepted a position with a company where they did some restructuring. A 3rd party contract role was brought in house directly. The previous person holding the position interviewed but did not get rehired and I took on the job.  It was made apparent that she did not full fill the position in the greatest way and also transitioning to direct hire for such a large company often requires more skills. I have not said anything negative about this person to my customers and simply stated it was restructured.

I have another employee I work with that is an ""ambassador"" per se. Its a very social job for both of us pretty much entertaining with company funds but I do business both during the day and evening. A delicate balance as some people know. Turns out our ambassador is roommates and friends with former employee. Once I started my role I saw many bad business transactions and habits this former employee created. Again never speaking negatively but gently reminded the ambassador that I have a different way of doing business than the previous person. She does not report to me but its clear my experience is far greater than hers.The ambassador was helpful in the transition when I accepted the job and I never asked what her roommate did and the former employee hasn't provided any transitional information or offered to help in any way. (another reason I feel no need to suddenly be a friend due to mutual relationships).

Since I have started the ambassador, 26 has brought the former employee to just about every event. Some are open but others really are company functions or events we prefer to bring customers clients to versus ""friends"" (the former stopped at a company dinner and joined us midway at the invite of the ambassador) My manager was present and he was cordial, spoke with her. I did as well asking her her career plans etc. (She is pursuing a different path and did interview for other roles in our industry but did not take them. Clearly she is young and doesn't know what she wants to do. ) Also she did not take another job until months later and was unemployed for quite some time but consistently attending company events with the Ambassador. This former employee provides no growth opportunities to us in her new roles. Once again another reason I feel zero obligation to ""befriend"" her. It appears to me that she is still enjoying the ride of her old company. 

The other event was a sporting event in which she was given tickets by the ambassador. I had clients that would have liked them but the ambassador had already offered them to her and another friend of hers. I am doing my best to build a relationship with the Ambassador but I find it difficult to do when a former employee is constantly present. She is always wearing our brand items were given to her while employed and acting as she is still in her position.  I dont feel she should be hearing our conversations that pertain to a job she no longer has the privilege of holding. Obviously its a very social job and the more the merrier at times but I feel at some point I may have to speak up and request that she not invite her to certain events. It just seems to diminish the respect for me now being in the role as buyers see her and I think it can easily create confusion. I am confident in my job but never expected to be looking over my shoulder at every event seeing her.

Also this former employee is eating drinking and generally still enjoying a paid social life for somthing I dont feel she earned the right to any longer. The ambassador  is also very young and prides herself on showing up to meetings looking like she hasnt slept showered and assumes being hungover is okay when taking meetings with clients together. Moving forward I do most meetings without her as I would prefer. She wines and cries about bring repsonsible and for the lack of better words its said ""perhaps if you didnt get drunk with your roommate for the 20th time this week you wouldnt be so stressed out with simple tasks.  Being roommates is easy to see the patterns they developed working together that I dont find acceptable. How would you proceed ? I feel as if the ambassador is being disrespecful of my new role.",26Oct2019,1
516,"I am so scared and so tired of living to be quite honest without trying to conceal it, I am only a 14 year old female and because of my actions and the immature person I decided to tell and do illegal activities with I am in constant stress and denial, all of my relationships are failing and I feel like I am hopeless and I have no idea what is going to become of my life.

I decided to finally try smoking weed on September 27th 2019 a few weeks before I turned 13 and I couldn’t have done it with someone worse, the female I did it with is such a big mouth and she cannot keep anything to herself she even went as FAR to tell my fathers ex wife about us smoking it if it couldn’t get worse and more close to my father finding out about because they still have secret contact from time to time.

I am now considered a smoker I have anywhere from 1-5 a day and I think I’m quite responsible with it, I never tell anyone about it, I always have money to afford it and I always have someone ti buy them for me, but my friend seems jealous of my lifestyle since she can not be mature about it nor afford them all of the time, it seems like this constant jealousy is taking a big toll on our friendship because I cannot trust her with ANYTHING, even getting drunk on birthday she decided to tell others; and that’s the last thing I’ll be telling her, she has no common sense about what is acceptable to tell others about me and thinks I will find it comical that I could get very badly hurt when my father finds out about my reckless actions; she is aware that he is very very strict and I won’t be able to do anything for the next 30 years much less hang out with her ever again considering.

My online friend never talks to me anymore, he treated me awfully and I started to distance myself from him because of his manipulation and name calling all of the time trying to hide it as “omg it’s just a joke!!” I really got tired of being put down and gaslighted so I just stopped talking to him and playing with him, and now he’s made a bio post about what a clown I am and that I raise the circus bar lmfao.

I always try to walk around with a brave smile on my face and all I want to do is burst out and cry everyday, I have been sick everyday for the past month is like a hangover that never ends I have dealt with severe depression and trauma for 2 years with no rest and it’s just so much I don’t want to deal with anymore. Everyday I get home and I sleep for hours just so I don’t have to face the day anymore and I feel safe in my sleep, I no longer have an appetite and eat sometimes as little as 1 thing a day with medium fluids, I have dropped 7 pounds in as little as a week and I just could not careless I can tell that my ship is going to sink soon because it is such a big load to carry sometimes for someone just being entered into the world and still a child with no concept of a lot of things. I have no idea why I am always in pain, whether it’s physical or mental I am always in pain I have been sick for a month straight physically and going on 3 years mentally and I just do not know where my life is headed anymore I have no goals, no plans, and no future.

I am so bad I don’t even bother to exercise anymore because I just don’t have the energy to pull myself up and do it, no matter how many naps I take I still need more it’s like 2017 all over again and I feel helpless like a leaf blowing in the wind, I’m still proud of myself however for not going back to self-harming but how long am I going to last without hitting myself I do not really have anyone to talk to about the pain and heartache that I feel and all I can say is I’m sorry for the consistent mistakes that I made and still make I’m still trying to learn and grow but sometimes it’s hard when you have to keep stuff in for so long I am trying really hard to not crack under pressure until the whole smoking weed story blows over.

It sucks that I have nobody to trust and talk to, sometimes you just have to handle the consequences and that’s what I’m willing to do if anyone can prove to my father I did infact smoke weed, I will be willing to accept any punishment given with no hesitations I was aware of the consequences before I decided to even smoke, drink, smoke a joint, vape or any of it but I didn’t think about it at the time but now I have no choice but to deal with it and think about the actions I have done and feel regret even though it was nothing more than an experiment to see if I liked it or not, my friend doesn’t care if I get in trouble and neither does my dads ex wife she would like nothing more than stress in our family dynamic.

I just wish I had tips or some advice on how to deal with this consistent guilt and dwelling fear that washes over me from the time I wake up til I have a nap.",26Oct2019,2

So, basically, I am 16, almost 17 male and till a few months ago, i had no clue about what profession  i want to choose. I am studying at a math and computer science highschool, and i started realising that those things aren't made for me and that i am not that good at them. I decided finally what i wanted to do: go to a music university and become a musician. Music is the only thing i consider myself  good at, and i can play and study drums, guitar, sing etc. Even if i said i want to be a musician, my mom considered it as a joke at first and kept forcing me to learn and to things i dont like/im not good at. I kept telling her i want to do music, and tonight she said : ""U ARE ACTUALLY  SERIOUS!!!"" And started saying that if i keep wanting to be a musician she will forbid me to go to practice if i dont learn to become a programmer as she wants. Then she want downstairs to talk to my dad and she was desperate and asking what will they do with me if im serious about that. I feel like i have to mention that i don't have a good relationship with my mom and never had since i was born. I never liked her, because she was overprotective and made me do things i didnt like. Also, she is always historic and yells a lot.
This thing made my anxiety and depression way worse, things that my mom doesn't know about too(i also tried explaining her that i haven't been happy and smiled in years -thing that she uses to complain about - and that i am always scared and dont like talking to ppl, but i dont want to get into more details about these- maybe one day in another thread).

525,"I am 27(M) living in Canada. 

Coming from a dysfunctional house that was full of vicious violence towards my brother, my mom and I. My father was a narcissistic and  abusive liar.   Religous indoctrination and sexual abuse from an outside source that haunted me for quite a while.  I struggled all through life. I loved school, but slowly stopped doing my work, due to a brutal home life and massive amounts or bullying at school.  Horrible hazing like behavior, essentially. I stopped going to school at 16.  I knew if I returned to the tormented routine, I would kill myself. Shortly after leaving school, in the 9th grade,  I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I was melting away in my parents basement, absolutely broken. Reading books, avoiding my parents warzones and my fathers physical abuse. Attempting to understand my life, why I was the way I was.  I spent 5 years in my parents basement, never leaving home. I gained massive amounts of weight, I ballooned to 370lb. 


My brother was having issues as well, but he was not reserved or introverted like me. I internalized everything, my brother raged against the world. He was angry all the time and acted out.

 Life  changed after I seen a doctor and my Mom realized how toxic our environment was.  She was never physically abusive or emotionally abusive. She was a women that had children too young, and  with the wrong person.  She was too concerned with my horrible father. Regardless, she wanted to help me. She was genuinely sorry for her lack of awareness and her role in her children's suffering.  My mom took me to get a social card, to the disability office. She took my stubs from disability, she opened a bank account with her name and mine, she did my taxes and everything.  She attempted to set my life right, in the ways she knew how. She stopped giving my abusive and horrible father her paycheque, and saved up money for a bike, for me. 

My father was not happy  after he realized my mother's gaze had been altered. He had been accustomed to having her paycheque and focus. He lived for the vicious fights and attention. My father continued to rage and undermine our household in every imaginable way. 

My brother was more lost than I. I wanted nothing more than for my brother, my mom and I, to escape my father, to greener pastures,  but my brother was too far gone. He was full of deep seeded anger and had started drinking. His substance abuse was the focal point that year, it ended in a massive brawl and his removal from the house. My father left soon afterwards. 

My father went to be with his newold person.  My mother fell to pieces. She was no different than me; Lost. 

My mom was kicked out at the age of 16 for dating my father, because he was black. Racism, basically. She was not ready for the world or my dads level of manipulation, no one could be.  I never met half of my family. The other half ? Poisonous and dysfunctional.  Emotionally unavailable and manipulating.  The only person I could  ever talk to was my mom. Our relationship got much better. A best friend really. 


My dad left, my brother was gone and my mom and I were wandering aimlessly.  She told me she felt like she had been  alseep for 20 something years. I knew she was co dependant or something. My dad leaving really tore her up, even if she knew he was bad.    One night, she went out to have some drinks, which was  odd to me, because she had always been completely against  substances like alcohol and drugs.  I woke up the next day, and got a phone call saying my mom was in the hospital about to die.  She had been in a single car accident and almost died. She was drinking and driving. 


My mom was in a coma for 3 years or so. I was forced to grow up and learn life in a few months. It was an unfortunate accident that forced me to grow up and fight through a horrible mental disorder that had debilitated me for years.  

I feel proud about making it through it all, in retrospect,  but everyday has been hellish. I still feel in hell.   I was on disability, I was able to find an apartment with my workers help.  My mom's accident was in the news. I had her cell phone ( she left it in the house that night). I was receiving phone calls from people I did not know.  I was a sack of impressionable sadness.  One of the calls was from her former employer. She was a nice lady and offered her thoughts and prayers.  She offered me a job. In fact, she would not let me say no. Something about me being a man and needing to work. I felt like a worthless  mooch and missed my family. I said yes. I worked my first job for 2 weeks of light work. I eventually had a panic attack and left. 

The lady contacted me again,  a month or so later, saying, ""no hard feelings"". She understood my scenario after I tried to communicate.   She offered me another chance. I did it, same result.  A month or so pass, I am lingering in my empty apartment and I decide to take more control of my life. I opened up tons of mail my mom had for me and try to be an adult. I read  my disability forms for the first time and I noticed it said something about you have to tell your worker about work you did or education you gain or courses you take etc etc,  So they can make note of it. I realized I had broke some sort of law. I was so scared. I already thought my life was a waste and I was a worthless mooch, but then realized I was a law breaker, and all I ever wanted was to be was a socially responsible person. I want/ed to help people that were like me. 

I knew I should of told my worker( who I was not familiar with at all, which led me to make a dumb choice) when I found out. I was scared to death of being homeless and not wanting her to take my new  stability away.  So I lingered, for years. In some sort of stunted state( still there). 


Around the age of 24, my brother tracked me down. He had been swallowed by the streets. Drugs had a hold of him. I would not let him in my apartment, we went across the street from my apartment to talk.  He told me he was sorry for the stuff he did. I have no anger towards him, but I have been left with permanent fear from what he told me.  He told me he copied my social card when he was desperate for booze, and how he either used it or sold it. To be honest, he is not the same person I knew, my brother. 

For 3 or 4 years, I have been frozen in fear, thinking my brother totally screwed up my life, well, a proper future for myself. I felt like there was an anchor in my stomach, a black cloud over  my head.  My mother came back to the world, she woke up from her coma.  Last year or so, and I feel so sad that I cant see her, and I want to craft a life that enables me to see her, to learn to drive so I can do things myself.  She is not being taken care of too well and all these worries and issues are paralyzing me. 

I live alone, I have no credit, I have little education( grade 9). I try to edify myself through reading. I have a plan to go back to school, but I legitimately  don't want to go to jail for  my admitted mistakes and my brothers potential drug addled choices.  I have no friends or family. I don't know how to fix this. I want to be clean in the eyes of the law. I have never been in trouble with the police, dont take drugs or alcohol, I just want a proper life. I want to go to school and then work, and help people, give back to my city.   I feel apprehension  every day, even if it is irrational. I feel like the government or police will kick my door down for some sort of fraud, for my mistakes and whatever tragic shit my brother felt the need to do. 

Does anyone have any advice ? I appreciate anyone that reads this. I feel like it my post was too long, and maybe too full  useless information.  I want to change my life quite badly. I feel like I cant without a good foundation, and not sure how to get that.  I have taught myself proper eating habits and learning good life skills, but I feel like a criminal and very far behind the curve.  I take responsibility for my life, my actions, everything. I just need to know how to fix this, and hopefully not be in jail. 




TLDR: Screwed up kid, did not learn life properly, family blew apart,  made mistakes, brother scares me.  I want to be an honest, productive, socially responsible adult, do not know how.  Feel like a criminal.",26Oct2019,2
526,"Me and all my friends are currently college student attending the same college. There is this room where we usually all are in while waiting for our next class or for some other reason; we are all welcoming to other people coming into the room even if we don't know them.

Starting this semester, there's been this guy that's been coming to this room that makes us uncomfortable due to his ""jokes"", how he talks like he's superior to everyone else and if you challenge him he gets hyper-defensive, and how he talks with less respect when talking to a female compared to a male.  I've also heard that there was a professor last semester that they did not get along, but I don't know much about that. 

This person is starting to become a problem as he is discouraging my friends and other people to come into the room. A few weeks ago we had a well respected professor of the college talk to him, and while it seems like he changed for a few days, he reverted back to the way he was before after a few days. 

The biggest issue that is happening is that some people I know are starting to complain to the higher up at the college, and I don't know if that is the correct course of action. Currently, me and two other people are starting to ask other students and faculty what their interaction with this student has been like, how they see this student interaction with other students and faculty of the college, and what course of action should we take if any.",26Oct2019,1

I messed up big time ever since I broke up with my long term girlfriend, I was so lonely and broken I decided to find a rebound to make the loneliness go away. Now it’s an issue for me since I have been bi curious for a while, I went on a gay dating app and found some older guy who catfished me, but I went with it anyway and went out and did sexual things with this complete stranger, I feel so disgusted and I talked about it with my now ex girlfriend, she’s very supportive and helpful. I found out that the bisexual life is not for me in the worst way possible I can’t help feeling used and taken advantage off, while it was going down I felt like my life was in threat from this person, I guess I did learn from my mistake, I just can’t get it off my head feeling so worthless and disgusted by myself, I wanted to take my life last night but decided to sleep instead. I am also diagnosed with OCD and Depression, every time something bad happens in my life I can’t seem to control to my emotions and act upon compulsion that I regret afterwards, Im not sure If Im gonna be able to feel normal again after all this, I could really use some advice and help.

At this rate I'm failing my classes and I'm really scared I'm going to be held back for my senior year. I'm only 17 and I don't want to self diagnose anything but I think there's something more going on here than me just being lazy. I also have trouble doing other basic things like cleaning my room and brushing my teeth. I don't feel like I can explain my situation that well so telling my parents or a psychologist might not even help.

542,"So really I've only ordered two things because I don't have a ton of money. But I'm 18 and I ordered a bad dragon toy, and some lube to go with it. 

My grandma is nosy and will go through my things sometimes. I have it hidden in an old draw in my room(wrapped up, that I don't open much anymore and it's just filled with old junk nobody needs. My grandma is a bit of a hoarder. I've also got a vibrator in a little baggie I kinda just leave out in plain sight since nobody ever comes over, and my grandma isn't gonna notice it laying around my game consoles.  

This is getting really nerve wracking because she always does the chores around the house and will go into my room to take my trash out and make my bed for me. 

Which is another story altogether, because on one hand she complains about me not doing chores around the house but I was not taught to do chores around the house growing up. She would literally pamper me as a child, and it stuck over the years. It's just a bad habit, but I think it's unreasonable to expect me to automatically know exactly what chores to do and when, and never actually get asked for help. I mean if they'd just ask, I'd be more than happy but because they don't I get so distracted with whatever I'm doing I'm not really worried much about what they are doing. 

Anyway, sorry for my little mini-rant. But I've got stuff like an old weed pipe I no longer use, lighters, and a bunch of cash saved up in one draw as well. I'm super worried one day she's just going to go through all my shit and find all my secrets. And she doesn't keep my secrets.

543,"I really need advice on what to do. My dad’s girlfriend lives in Michigan and she’s really abusive toward her kids. She’s a single mother and constantly stressed out, but I don’t think that excuses her behavior. I’ve seen her hit them, slap them, punch them in the head, twist and pull on their ears. She will scream at them, call them names (“piece of shit etc”), threaten them with violence. They’re really not bad kids, just very hyperactive, which is normal for boys of that age. I also suspect that she will give them pills to make them fall asleep when she wants alone time. 

She smokes weed on a daily basis, at this point she’s never not sober. She once popped 8 pills and drank an entire bottle of hypnotic because she was upset with my dad. 

As a victim of child abuse, I feel the urge to report this to CPS. I’ve never reported child abuse before so I don’t know what to suspect. I also don’t want to reveal my identity as it will cause a huge family drama that I simply do not have any energy left for. Any advice would be appreciated.",26Oct2019,1
544,"I want to preface this with a content warning for emotional abuse. This will be a long one.

I'm in my 20s, recently graduated &amp; have a full time job I love in the field I studied. My dad and stepmom live across the country from me, since I moved out of state for college. I had 1-3 jobs at a time while in college, and my dad sent me money every month to help with living expenses. He helped me with getting loans for school. All of this is important because it factors into the complexity of my situation. 

Since my financial situation is much more stable now, I've been able to obtain financial independence. I pay all my bills myself, and my dad &amp; I have arranged a plan where I pay my part of the family phone bill &amp; send him money for the loan he took out for my education. I can't fully cut him off for this reason. 

Why would I want to cut my dad off? Well, now that my life has stabilized with my finances (college was a mess for me) I have time &amp; energy to work on myself. I've always struggled with depression and anxiety, and have been to therapy on and off over the past decade. My therapists helped me discover that the cause of it all is repressed trauma. Well, that trauma decided now was the time for it to crawl out into the sun. I'm remembering so much shit that he did to me growing up, and I'm having a hard time coping.

My parents divorced when I was fairly young. They fought a lot. I was often woken up at night as a kid to their yelling. My mom was an addict (she's been sober for almost 2 years now!). This was obviously very difficult to be around so young. It caused me great anxiety &amp; triggered a severe depressive episode that I'm just now emerging from. After I moved in with my dad in a different state, my depression got so much worse. I was having a hard time fitting in and my health wasn't great. I should mention that I didn't have a great relationship with my stepmom at the time either. I didn't really have a mother figure in my life, so I leaned heavy on my dad. 

Growing up he believed in whoopings for punishment. I was generally a good kid, scatterbrained and messy (I was depressed but none of us knew it at the time). This meant I got whooped &amp; yelled at for things like forgetting I had homework or for having a messy room. It was always punishment before help. 

When I was 13 I attempted. Got hit with immediate regret and told on myself. I wish I didn't feel this way, but I wish I would have kept my mouth shut. Obviously my dad was upset. Him and my stepmom took me to the hospital. The ride was mostly silent, and I was crying. At the hospital my mom texted me saying she loved me and it made me cry more (she didn't know about my attempt). My dad told me to 'shut up and put my phone away.' I can't remember if it was on the ride there, home, or when we made it back home, but he yelled at me for attempting. One of the things he said that I can't forget, was that I did it for attention and would now likely get taken away by CPS. He later took away all my books and journals and said I could only read the Bible or other Christian literature. I was a book nerd who wrote all the time so this was devastating for me, they were my only outlets and not having the freedom to choose tore me up. I would write poetry in my school notebooks, I had to hide it. He kept them away from me for at least a month. 

Things started declining after this. I was clearly a fucked up kid that needed help and love. He started taking me to therapy, but then pulled me out when one of my therapists suggested I may have bipolar &amp; referred us to a psychiatrist. The pysch interviewed me in the same room as my parents (which is always a bad call), I didn't answer honestly because I was scared. So woohoo, no more therapy even though it was helping me get better. 

My dad would always yell at me, make fun of me. Constantly made jokes about how I belong in special ed &amp; should take the short bus (at 20 I got diagnosed with autism, so extra ouch in retrospect). Would tell me he couldn't wait to kick me out. Told me he'd emancipate me as soon as I got a part time job. Said he would have saved up money for my college education if he thought I'd finish. That my conception was a mistake. Just awful things that generally made me feel unwanted. I didn't dare to attempt again though. At the time, I was scared what would happen if I failed again. Now I like to think the rational part of my brain knew things would get better once I could leave. During this time, I developed an eating disorder. My dad and my stepmom confronted me about it and basically just yelled at me and shamed me and told me I wasn't ready to be an adult (this was around the time I was about to graduate high school). My stepmom would sometimes call me disgusting. I often overheard them talking poorly about me when they thought I was asleep. My heart was in a constant state of conflict because on one hand they offered me refuge from my mom's addiction and were making an effort to care for me, on the other they were emotionally abusive and making my mental health worse.

All of this fucked me up so bad and I didn't even realize the full extent of it until this year. I've just been able to call it abuse this past month, though I still try to rationalize all of it. 

I usually visit them for the holidays. This last Christmas I came out to my dad. Not intentionally, he just asked me about the whole 'LGBT and transgender/no gender' thing he's always hearing about on TV. He wanted to know if what he was hearing about essentially the gay/trans agenda was true. I tried to explain it objectively but had to switch to the first person to get my point across. He didn't say anything, just seemed to be listening and absorbing it all. This gave me false hope. The next day I showed my family an article about me. The writer used my correct pronouns, and my dad and stepmom made fun of it in front of my face. I don't want this thread to turn into a discussion about transgender people, please just take away that this was very hurtful, as my gender identity is something I've questioned &amp; explored for years, and I finally found a community that understands me and gained a lot of self-confidence and self-love. I hardly ever come out to people because it's something that's very personal for me. So it took a lot to tell my dad, especially since he leans conservative &amp; is very Christian. To have that thrown into my face after a long, heartfelt discussion really really fucking stung. 

Over the past couple of years I've watched my dad get farther and farther right. It's not the difference of political opinion, rather his sudden inability to think critically. I don't want this thread to start a political discussion, please give me a moment to explain what I mean. It's not because his views are Republican. It's because he doesn't fact check anymore, instead trusts the blog posts my stepmom finds on Facebook, and only watches one news channel for political opinion. I don't think that's healthy or good for anyone, no matter where they fall on the political spectrum. He raised me to value critical thinking, to always get a second/third/fourth opinion &amp; perspective, to measure people based on what they do and not what they say. He seems to have forgotten these values himself, as he now makes no effort to fact check what he reads and is wholly uncritical of our president. (I am of the belief we should be critical of ***every*** politician and government leader, not doing so is how democracy erodes. He taught me this). All of this to say, I can't have a level-headed political discussion with him anymore. We used to do this all the time, would watch the news together or listen to a news radio show and then get into long discussions/debates about what we just heard. It was one of the interactions with him I deeply valued.

And now, I don't know what to do. My sibling lives in the same state as them, and tells me some of the things they say. The last time I talked to my dad he mentioned wanting to come to my state for Christmas. I don't know how to tell him I don't want to spend Christmas with them. Every time I visit they make fun of me or the communities they know I'm a part of. Or they make fun of my sibling or otherwise make belittling comments toward them, which is hard to hear because I know how it feels, but you can't really stand up to them. They'll make you regret it. We don't talk very much these days, as they never call me and I don't have a desire to reach out.

I guess what I'm asking for is some guidance. I don't know who my dad is anymore (and clearly, I never did) and I don't know how to move forward. I obviously need some distance as I heal from these recent revelations, but I'm having a hard time seeing a day where we'll ever be able to \*really\* talk. I want to emphasize that I don't think my dad is a bad person, he had a rough upbringing with an abusive parent and this is just the cycle of abuse. I'm trying to break out of that cycle. And I don't think he's a bad person for his political beliefs, I just wish he'd fact check before making a sweeping, moral judgement. 

This has been weighing so heavy on me. I think I still love him, I still want to see him happy and healthy. I want to have a good relationship with him, but I don't feel like I can even say hello right now. I feel so guilty for all of these feelings too. Like I'm being a bratty, bad child. But he made me feel so small for years, and now that I'm not dependent on him to live I'm realizing how wrong it all was. I want to talk to him about it, maybe get some reconciliation, but I'm scared it'd go south and I don't want to fully lose a parent because I stood up for myself. Maybe it's a small price to pay, but it would cut deep. I'm a believer in communication, and I'd rather talk to someone before cutting them off, but I just don't think he'll take me seriously. I'm worried in his eyes I am the proverbial snowflake. 

**TL;DR** I've recently realized the full extent of emotional abuse my father put me through for my whole life, and on top of that is a complete pivot in morals that makes him very difficult to level with. I don't know how to say I don't want to spend Christmas with him &amp; my stepmom, or how to set a boundary as I owe him money for loans and am still on the family's plan because I'm paying off my phone, and would rather not lose a parent.",26Oct2019,1

569,"TLDR at bottom since it's super long and kind of goes off on tangents a lot.

Also this is my alt account since coworkers could find my normal reddit.

Background: I had to find a job out of college within a half hour of my parents' because i was too poor to move, I was also too poor to find any internships near where I lived while in college (it was in the middle of the country near no major towns). This left me with very few options, with my savings nearly depleted (despite living with my parents I paid for all of my food and other bills aside from rent which they only charged $100) I finally found a job offer within commuting distance, unfortunately it only paid 2/3 the average starting wage for my field in my area but I took it anyways mostly because I had to due to the aforementioned financial and experience situation. 

I was hired as an estimator for a construction materials distributor who also operates a retail sales storefront via a couple branches in my state in the northern us. I was told that I would be doing sales work for the first month while i was brought up to speed on the estimating work. It wasnt in writing but I agreed to it because of the stuff in my first paragraph. I ended up doing almost entirely retail work for the first 3.5 months. Then I left the sales counter and started answering phone calls from my office (on a side note it is actually a 1/3 cubicle with no walls that i share with 2 loud salesmen lol). By the 4th month I basically stopped doing any work outside the scope of my actual position figuring that if it becomes clear how little estimating im doing, I'd finally get some training. Well that was two months ago and I have yet to get any meaningful estimating training. In addition to this I was forced to take a couple weeks of classes on a proprietary structural design software because it seems as though my bosses expect the estimating department to do entire structural plans in addition to estimating despite us having an engineering department and not even being an engineering firm in the first place. We also do not have a licensed engineer on staff so despite my qualification to do work under one, any engineering I have to do at my current job will not be countable for licensure in the future should i choose to pursue it. 

My department head had me come in on a saturday (we otherwise dont work on saturdays) for training like 2 months after i started but he spent 20 minutes scribbling on a piece of paper and jumping around to random topics before spending the rest of the day talking shit about coworkers and telling me stories about random events. He also regularly tells me he will get around to my training but then nothing ever comes of it. I've also been given 3 different projects basically to train myself which i then spent days on (each) and then theyre never reviewed by my superiors and theyre effectively forgotten. Supposedly my dept head was too busy but i regularly see him gossiping with other coworkers for hours at a time which makes me doubt his claims. Another member of my department whose job isnt even my training did give me a bit of material that i could reference which was better than nothing but im still weeks of meaningful instruction away from being up to speed on company methods which are almost entirely nonstandard which is why I learned like none of them in college (I was very upfront about what I knew in my interview so after being hired I was pretty surprised at the lack of any training).

Another item is that I had moved into my own place nearer to my job due to winter making commuting from my parents' impossible. That in addition to thousands of dollars in vehicle repairs have left me unable to seek alternative employment for at least a few months.  Clearly I'm stuck at my current job for the time being but how long would it be appropriate to continue working at my current job? I dont want to leave too soon because I assume it'll get better eventually but at the same time I dont want to end up having wasted too much time on a seemingly dead end position. Should I try something different at my current job in the mean time, and if so what? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Been at job for 6 months and received practically no training. Been forced to do retail sales and other work (that isnt my job) in the mean time. Too poor to move for a different job for the time being. How long would it be appropriate to stay at my current job? Should I try something different at my current job before I commit to leaving?",26Oct2019,2
570,"Hi,

I have posted before about a lighter issue and found the community to be extremely helpful. So, I am hoping that I can take the plunge with a more personal issue and request advice again please?

I have lived in a small and remote town since childhood and experienced racism growing up from peers and some teaching staff. My stepfather was physically and mentally abusive towards me and my mother and used to do things to me, which I dont really want to discuss. 

I experienced sexual abuse from an older male when I was 15, and continued to be denied equality of opportunity due to prejudiced and discriminating attitudes of those around me, including the police, I think due to my race, but I had an attitude too, which didnt help.

I learned that when it comes to justice, race definitely presents a major barrier. \*Please be aware that I am of mixed race, I am not black and would never attempt to present myself as having experienced life as a black woman.

I internalized the hate I experienced from those around me and developed a severe substance addiction which took all my time and money, leaving me trapped in the place I hated. 

At age 27, I discovered I was pregnant and quit my addiction. Cold turkey. It is one thing ruining and risking my own life, but I was not going to put the person I brought into the world through the same thing.

I went back to school, raised my child and got a well paid fulltime job. My child has settled into school, which is especially important as my negative experiences at school are largely attributable to why I became so unwell and missed out on an education.

We are still in the town I hate.

I hate it. I hate seeing the people who looked down on me and verbally and physically abused me. I see the man who sexually abused me several times a week purely due to how small this place actually is.

I know this isnt forever. Once my child has completed secondary school in 6 years we intend to move. Until then, I am starting to really struggle with the anger I have suppressed for so long and am experiencing depressive episodes (around three weeks has been the longest, with gaps of around two weeks) which gives me violent and distressing nightmares (usually about animals being harmed, I am a big animal lover, so this really upsets me) drains my energy and makes every day feel like an ordeal.

I am really struggling to keep my head above the water here, its impacting my health and I don't know if I can keep this up for another 6 years. But I know that I have to.

Any advice would be HUGELY appreciated.

Thank you.",26Oct2019,1
571,I’ve realised the amount of effort I put into my friendships or relationships is greater than what i receive back. I’m naturally a caring and giving person and I feel like maybe people take advantage of that. I don’t know how to change it because I always eventually get hurt.,26Oct2019,3
572,"To start things off I just want to point out that English isn't me main language so if this story is a bit hard to comprehend apologise. 

I don't even know how to start this post or if me asking reddit will really help me but I will give it a try.

So as you can see this is a question about college and life in general. I'm 18 and I just spent my first month in college. I don't know how college works in other countries but in mine you have to get the best grades possible in high school in order to enter the more prestigious courses. For example if you want to follow Medicine you need to get grades from from 17-20 (here exams are graded from 0-20). 

Unfortunately I pretty much wasted my high school years worrying about things other than grades and I ended up having a pretty poor final score of 13.7. This didn't leave me that many choices to go for and I decided to choose environmental sciences with the hopes that this course would get me a job in the future since it's pretty obvious of what the current state of the planet is and what will it be. I only made this decision like 1 month before going to college and wasn't really sure what to think about it but my mother was really proud of me for choosing something that could help change the world for the better and I was also happy about it.

In order to continue this story I need to say I'm a very shy person and the ideia of going to a place where I didn't know anybody terrified me. Plus to reasons that are hard to explain I only managed to enter the course 2 weeks after it started so I was put in in a class full of people that knew each others for 2 weeks. So, as expected, this was really tough for me. Although being shy I always managed to make good friends in the schools that I went to but this was different. Since I only got in 2 weeks after it started I wasn't really able to make connections with the people there. They aren't bad guys but they have already formed groups of people and (at least for me) has been very hard trying to integrate them. This has made me think if I'm really going to be able to finish this year. I am not depressed at all but I fear that I will be if I keep attending this course. 

With that in mind I am considering dropping out of college and spending a year working and studying for exams that can change my high school grades by a lot. Pretty much spending a year going through new experiences, going to the gym, changing things about myself and trying to rediscover my motivation for learning and to be successful. I don't think that I am a dumb person due to my high school grades because I never really had the will to be the best at what I do but it hasn't always been like this. When I am focused on something I can do the thing so I believe that I could improve my grades a lot by stopping a year to study for those exams mentioned before.

I know gap years can be lonely sometimes because you aren't going to school or hanging out with people on a daily basis but as I said, although being shy, I do have some very good friends in my life that I believe that can make this year bearable.

To be fair I don't think I would hate environmental studies as a whole because it is kinda interesting but I am really afraid that I won't be able to make new friends and that it would be some painfull 3 years to bear. The problem is that my parents wouldn't understand this so I kinda had to lie to them and say that I hate my course and that this is not what I want to do with my life. 

This is where the real trouble begun. My parents are great people and I couldn't truly wish for better people to guide me in my life but since I did so poorly in high school they don't think this gap year would be good for me. They think that I am quitting the course way too early and that I should give it more opportunities. The thing is if I want to leave college I only have until Wednesday to do it without having to pay for the whole year. If I leave before the 30th of October I will only have to pay for 1 month of college and I will be free of other expenses. In my country college isn't really that expensive (only 1000€ per year) and my family doesn't have money issues but I don't want my parents to pay for something that I am not happy with. Plus if I really do repeat my exams money would have to be spent with other things to help me get better grades.

I don't know what to do in my life at this point. I don't think I can last a year in college without fixing a lot of things about me ( being shy, being lazy, having no motivation) and I think that a year focusing on improving those things could help me a lot in life. If I do leave my parents and my family will be really sad and disappointed with me and seeing them like that kills me inside since they are amazing people. 

My friends think that I should leave but I don't know if I am cable of doing this to my family. Plus I don't even know if the gap year will help me get through some stuff. 

I know that posting my story on reddit will probably not help me since everyone is different but heck it I have nothing to lose. So yeah if I could get some opinions or some advice that could be helpful I would truly be grateful.",26Oct2019,3

578,"Hey Reddit,

I graduated college in May of this year. I received a job offer in December before graduation. I had two previous internships and it was my first “big boy” job that was a 9-5. 

That job was not a fit for me and I have had a really hard time adjusting to life after college and living completely on my own. I recently resigned (this week) from my job due to it being mentally and physically exhausting. It was not a fit or what I thought it would be and I have no bad blood or anything with that employer, I left on good terms. I have been looking for a new job for over a month now and am continuing to apply and interview for a new job. It is getting exhausting and rejection sucks, but I need a job not just to pay my bills but I am the type of person who needs to stay busy or I go crazy. 

Not only was my first job after college a failure but I have lost contact and friendships with people that I talked to every single day in college and this whole “growing up” thing has not been easy for me at all. I have never been this overall sad or emotionally vulnerable. I also started going to therapy and have days that are great and some that suck, it is very up and down. 

I am 22 years old and have never felt this confused or lost with my life. I graduated college with honors and with an accounting degree and was very involved and successful. My first two internships also went very well, failure is a new concept to me and I am not doing well with accepting it.

583," Today I had a lot of work all over the city so I was on the roads and places constantly. In a not usual place, a small road, I saw my dads car and instantly thought to honk to catch his focus. It didn't took me long to realise a woman sitting next to him, nothing suspicious exactly as he sometimes carry his co-workers and we are aware of it.

 I decided to not do anything, thought my friends would laugh and make fun of my dad is out hanging with a younger chick. After an hour and a half later I was home and this is where things got weird.

 I thought my dad would be home, as he usually did after dropping co-workers. He wasn't. Asked mom about it and she got curious as a wife would probably do. She instantly called dad, no responds.

 My dad just came, 2 hours late. It was time to ask, what was up? We checked internet for the woman, she was added on my dads Facebook list. We asked my dad, he says he wasn't even around the place we saw him, no accepting dropping that or any woman. I am sure I saw the car, my dad and that woman. 

 I am sure because I saw my dad t-shirt he wore in that car, was the same with the one he came home. And that woman can't be my imagination because Facebook clarifies that this woman exist.

 Arguing between them is going. Dad still insisting he wasn't there, he didn't carry anyone and all. Mom still asks the same question wanting to learn what was going on.

 What the hell do I do here? Im an young adult but I really feel so weak right now.",26Oct2019,5

Long story short, I worked in online pickup at a grocery store and yesterday I got into an argument with management because they refused to help us when we were severely understaffed. I've been struggling with this job for a while now and last night I finally snapped and I decided my mental health had to come first. However, now I have another wave of anxiety because of the uncertainty.

Anyway, this is the only major job I've had. I'm 22 and a college dropout. I've worked this job since high school and the only other jobs I've had were small campus jobs when I was still in college. So, I know that I've lost any shot at a reference from the only people that could give me one. Not sure where to turn from here in terms of finding something else.

I live at home still, which of course has led to arguments with my mom over this decision. She works in the same place as me (as manager over a different department), so she's upset that I've now put her in the position of being bombarded with questions about me.

I get tested and I’m fine - 2 months later I break up with Chad - 2 weeks later I start seeing Mark - 1 month later I hook up with Jason(condom was used the entire time) - 2 weeks later Chad calls telling me to go get tested because I’m “dirty”

So Chad calls and tells me to get tested, still super angry with me. I tell Mark to get tested as we had been having unprotected sex, and he goes to do so. I get tested, get treated and am now cured from the sti. I assume Chad told me to get tested because he had it? But Mark also alluded to the idea he could have given it to me. That just leaves Jason, now Jason was a bad hookup, and actually used to bully me a lot for being “a whore”. He apologized to me for it and opened up to me about how he felt bad which led to us sleeping together. 

We used protection the entire time and I had no idea I could have an std considering I tested clean not all that long ago, plus we were using protection. Do I tell Jason I caught an STI?",26Oct2019,0
594,"Girls of reddit (I think you'll have the advantage on figuring out these hints) there's this girl in my class that asked me if she could sit next to me so we could work on an english project (it was a paired project so it was only us two) and I said yes, she laughed at everything I said and when we finished the work we just started talking about random things. I asked her if anyone had asked her to prom yet, she said no, but she also said that I was one of the few people she would be comfortable going to prom with. I was caught really off guard as I'm really introverted and people usually don't want to do things with me. Was this a hint that she dropped or was it just a vague thing she said?",26Oct2019,0

596,"So I recently started a new office job. I went in pretty confident and I made many friends within the first month. Most people say I'm very positive, I give off good vibes and I'm generally a fairly popular person. I feel as though I've fit right in with most of my team, three of whom are guys, two of whom are women. I am a fairly attractive, intelligent and driven, social and confident person. I get along with women of all ages because I am fairly girly, I can talk makeup etc. I get along even better with guys because I'm nerdy, I like cartoons, I can be a bit of a savage, etc. I have got on the best with a colleague of mine who is a pretty good-looking mid-twenties guy (let's call him James, relevant later). It feels like I've known most of my team forever, and I really genuinely like them all and I have a great time going into work which I don't think many people can say.

On top of this, like I said, I'm intelligent and driven. I have two degrees from two top 10 universities and I go into any new opportunity looking to impress. I think I have done this because within my first week or so I drew up an excel calculator which my team seemed really grateful for because it massively helped with the calculations we have to do. I've tried to get to know everyone on their levels and I also treat to donuts etc every so often. Even people outside of my team in the wider office have said great things to me and they've all given me the impression that i'm well-liked. I take detailed notes, produce accurate work, take accountability for my own growth and i'mm very proactive about learning. 

All this to say, there is one team member, one of the three guys, who seems to give me a really bad, distant vibe. I get the impression I irritate him greatly and I can't understand why. For context, I am a female in her late twenties and I am not white and this is a gay male in his late twenties, white. At first, I won't lie, I had the impression that it could be racial but I've noticed he has many brown friends on his social media and he's very left-wing politically (quite passionate about it). In the first week he seemed nice enough, if a little socially awkward. I soon moved to sit between him and James. This is when I noticed the change. Every time I say good morning he seems practically angry to see me.  He has in depth conversations with others and will outright ignore me even if I ask a work-related question. The only time in the past week he speaks to me is when he's able to involve James. Call me crazy but it really feels like he's jealous of the fact that I get along with James very well. This is really the only thing I can see. If I speak to James, I can feel him staring at me/a general bad vibe from him. 

 It's annoying because he's a bit senior to me and I always like to have a good relationship with my seniors.  I try to get along with everyone and I've tried hard to get along with him and ignore this. I will go out of my way to ensure I have chosen treats for the team that also cater to his unique tastes (he likes really gross ass food, like chilli-ginger chocolate -_-), I try to talk about his interests, tv shows he likes, but he gives me nothing. This is really petty but even if he sneezes and I give him a 'bless you', he says nothing but thanks others on the team when they give him a 'bless you'.

On top of this all, our direct team leader is disliked by the entire team except me. Obviously I;m new but I've come into a tense situation between them all. The guy who seems to hate me constantly talks about the team leader to me and I've tried to make it clear I refuse to make any judgements as I barely know her and honestly she has been nothing but nice to me. Every other team member has been understanding about this but this team member in particular made a comment which rubbed me the wrong way. One evening I was working a bit later with him and he was shit-talking the team leader. After re-iterating my position in a polite but firm manner, he said that I'm ""obviously the kind of person who won't say anything bad about anyone ever"". I resent this because of the tone, and it was said through a sneer. I do try to avoid office politics and gossip and I don't think that makes me a ""goody-two-shoes"", it makes me.... not a shitty person. I'm not going to join in on slandering someone who has done nothing to me and demonstrated nothing of ill-character. In fact, this team member seems to be respected (not hugely well-liked but not talked about negatively) but I feel like, what I've witnessed, he's just not giving me good vibes.


I haven't really ever been in this situation where I have to work in close proximity with someone who just doesn't seem to like me for being me. How can I deal with this? I don't know if I'm totally off-base with the jealousy thing but that feels like a realistic area for irrational dislike? He's also, like I said, pretty socially awkward. When he initiates conversation with other colleagues they listen politely then seem to pretty obviously tune out so I don't now if it's the fact that he's been there for a couple years and I've come in and made quite a few friends there.

Anyone been there, any advice? It's awkward and uncomfortable having this hostile vibe emanating from someone right next to me.",26Oct2019,1
597,"I’m a year 13 (high school senior) student literally in my last year of secondary school, the final push before university and I have honestly lost all my will to actually do school. No I will not quit because I know I’ll regret it in the future but I feel like I have no reason to even try. School life isn’t amazing and the workload is too much including out of school activities (studying 3 A levels with 3000+ words coursework essays for each one, private tutor that gives me homework, swim training, badminton training, violin). It just feels so weird that I don’t want to do anything anymore considering the fact that I’ve worked sooo hard to get to where I am today. Maybe I just get sad because all this work comes down to some exams that can honestly ruin everything by just 1 cruel question. Maybe I’m washed up XD.

598,"I have struggled with recurrent depression for over ten years now (from mid-teens into adulthood). Looking back to those ten years, I think I have been depressed for maybe 65-80% of the time. In those years, I've had a lot of therapy, and I learned a lot about dealing with depression (and anxiety, from which I no longer suffer). I have learned to control my thoughts (which goes well, except for the imposter syndrome thoughts), and how to best take care of my mental health (which unfortunately doesn't stop me from getting depressed again).  Now, I usually had high functioning depressions, but lately, I find it harder and harder to get things done (including things I know are good for my mental health). I think it is because I feel like it doesn't matter anyway; the depression will return soon, even if I manage to get out of it now.  And I feel like I don't have the energy anymore to do so. If it weren't for my dogs I would stay in bed all day on my free days, I stopped eating healthy (mostly eat bread now), I don't do anything for university (really falling behind), don't work out, and so on. I know that it is better for my mental (and physical) health if I have a set schedule for sleep, workouts, healthy meals and so on; but I can't get myself to do any of it. 

Thus, my first question is this: how do you get yourself to do the things you should when you feel like you can't anymore?

My second question is: did you ever take medicine that worked for you without horrible side effects (I'm always a bit weary of medicine)?  

Final question: did you ever tried alternative medicine that worked? Like acupuncture or small amounts of drugs (such as magic mushrooms)?",26Oct2019,3

I would also ideally like to take the day before off as well, as that's also been a horrific day historically.

I don't know what to do; part of me wants to email my soon-to-be supervisor and tell him that I have a negative anniversary coming up, and that I'd like the 2 days to ""mourn,"" (for lack of a better word) but another part of me also just wants to wait until the night before/morning of and then tell him that I'm sick, but it's also a Monday and Tuesday (Tuesday is the anniversary itself) so I feel like that's super suspicious.

600,"I just want to say that I realize there are a number of things wrong with this situation, but I’m just focused on the cheating aspect.

Finding out my partner had relapsed into porn made me feel pretty insecure.  Maybe this is related, maybe it’s not. (Side note- after learning about porn addiction, I can now say that I shouldn’t have reacted the way I did.) Anyway, working at a grocery store near campus, one of my professors regularly came through my line. He’d compliment me on my looks sometimes. I guess I found this somewhat validating. So in my homework, I said possibly a few, but definitely one flirtatious thing that I remember. I didn’t think there was anything wrong with what I wrote at the time; I didn’t even think that it was something to confess/hide from my boyfriend.

So my professor made comments in my writing that were flirtatious back. At school events he’d take selfies with me and asked for “some way” to send me the pictures (note-I offered him my school email, then my other email, both of which he declined). Then, the weird comments at my workplace were increasing so I eventually passively-aggressively brought up that I had a boyfriend.

I find myself over analyzing this situation a lot because I was quite shocked by how strong he came onto me. I told my boyfriend the situation—the flirtatious writing and all—as soon as it occurred to me that this might have turned into something which I did not intend. 

So do you think that this was unfaithfulness or cheating? If I find my old homework assignments (this happened 2 semesters ago), do I need to show my boyfriend?

Note: I never wanted to act on anything with this man. He is almost three times my age.

601,"So, it's been two months since I moved out of my mother's house. Nearly every day we speak, she either speaks about wanting to see me and where I live or trying to schedule a day for me to come see her.

Thing is, I know my mother. The reason I moved out is because she's extremely bad for my mental health. I already know what's going to happen if I see her. First, she'll act like she's proud to see me. Then she'll comment on my weight. Then she'll belittle me. Then she'll say how I was so disrespectful for leaving her home abruptly. Then she'll immaturely tease me about how she thinks my roommate and I are dating because she simply cannot understand that a male and a female can be friends without being romantic. She also cannot understand that I'm not into him because of many reasons that I've expressed to her.

And to top it all off, she'll try to keep me there. She'll try to make me stay. She knows I'm financially struggling, so.. she will pay for me to get a bus ticket to go there but won't pay for a bus ticket for me to go back. She'll delay it. She'll say how she doesn't have the money right now, and whenever she does have the money, she'll just say she doesn't have it. That way, she can trap me and force me to live with her again 


I moved out because my mom was very abusive. And she's only inviting me because she wants me to come back to have control over me again.

But I don't know why I can't just tell her no. I'm just scared. Scared that she'll do something drastic. When she doesn't get her way, she does everything she can do to hurt me. She doesn't understand that because of who she is, what she does, is exactly why I don't want to be around her. 

And all I can think about is losing 20 lbs in 4 weeks so she won't make fun of my weight. That's extremely unhealthy but I don't want to give her a reason to yell at me or attack me.",26Oct2019,1

603,"To start things off I just want to point out that English isn't me main language so if this story is a bit hard to comprehend apologise. 

I don't even know how to start this post or if me asking reddit will really help me but I will give it a try.

So as you can see this is a question about college and life in general. I'm 18 and I just spent my first month in college. I don't know how college works in other countries but in mine you have to get the best grades possible in high school in order to enter the more prestigious courses. For example if you want to follow Medicine you need to get grades from from 17-20 (here exams are graded from 0-20). 

Unfortunately I pretty much wasted my high school years worrying about things other than grades and I ended up having a pretty poor final score of 13.7. This didn't leave me that many choices to go for and I decided to choose environmental sciences with the hopes that this course would get me a job in the future since it's pretty obvious of what the current state of the planet is and what will it be. I only made this decision like 1 month before going to college and wasn't really sure what to think about it but my mother was really proud of me for choosing something that could help change the world for the better and I was also happy about it.

In order to continue this story I need to say I'm a very shy person and the ideia of going to a place where I didn't know anybody terrified me. Plus to reasons that are hard to explain I only managed to enter the course 2 weeks after it started so I was put in in a class full of people that knew each others for 2 weeks. So, as expected, this was really tough for me. Although being shy I always managed to make good friends in the schools that I went to but this was different. Since I only got in 2 weeks after it started I wasn't really able to make connections with the people there. They aren't bad guys but they have already formed groups of people and (at least for me) has been very hard trying to integrate them. This has made me think if I'm really going to be able to finish this year. I am not depressed at all but I fear that I will be if I keep attending this course. 

With that in mind I am considering dropping out of college and spending a year working and studying for exams that can change my high school grades by a lot. Pretty much spending a year going through new experiences, going to the gym, changing things about myself and trying to rediscover my motivation for learning and to be successful. I don't think that I am a dumb person due to my high school grades because I never really had the will to be the best at what I do but it hasn't always been like this. When I am focused on something I can do the thing so I believe that I could improve my grades a lot by stopping a year to study for those exams mentioned before.

I know gap years can be lonely sometimes because you aren't going to school or hanging out with people on a daily basis but as I said, although being shy, I do have some very good friends in my life that I believe that can make this year bearable.

To be fair I don't think I would hate environmental studies as a whole because it is kinda interesting but I am really afraid that I won't be able to make new friends and that it would be some painfull 3 years to bear. The problem is that my parents wouldn't understand this so I kinda had to lie to them and say that I hate my course and that this is not what I want to do with my life. 

This is where the real trouble begun. In my country people don't do gap years. After they finish high school they go straight to college because our society has the preconception of believing that if you stop a year it's because you don't want to study and be something in your life. My parents are great people and I couldn't truly wish for better people to guide me in my life but since I did so poorly in high school they don't think this gap year would be good for me. They think that I am quitting the course way too early and that I should give it more opportunities. The thing is if I want to leave college I only have until Wednesday to do it without having to pay for the whole year. If I leave before the 30th of October I will only have to pay for 1 month of college and I will be free of other expenses. In my country college isn't really that expensive (only 1000€ per year) and my family doesn't have money issues but I don't want my parents to pay for something that I am not happy with. Plus if I really do repeat my exams money would have to be spent with other things to help me get better grades.

I don't know what to do in my life at this point. I don't think I can last a year in college without fixing a lot of things about me ( being shy, being lazy, having no motivation) and I think that a year focusing on improving those things could help me a lot in life. If I do leave my parents and my family will be really sad and disappointed with me and seeing them like that kills me inside since they are amazing people. 

My friends think that I should leave but I don't know if I am cable of doing this to my family. Plus I don't even know if the gap year will help me get through some stuff. 

I know that posting my story on reddit will probably not help me since everyone is different but heck it I have nothing to lose. So yeah if I could get some opinions or some advice that could be helpful I would truly be grateful.",26Oct2019,1

It would be a bonus for there to be social goals involved. For example, praise from people on a finished job.

607,"So my friend has been acting super weird recently, super distant, when i finally asked what was wrong, he said that it was just personal stuff. I had also asked him if he wanted to hang out over the weekend as we always do, he said no (extremely unusual), so I asked if I had done something wrong, he replied with “No I just don’t see us hanging out anytime soon.” Throughout this period he has been seemingly out of it, and all of his other friends have also noticed that something is up. I found out from my close friend who is also friends with him that he is not taking his medication and actually selling it to make more money. This has happened before and his parents actually sent him to military school because of this issue, about two years ago.

609,"Dear Reddit, 

I believe I am VERY emotional, extremely stressed, and very reliant on other people. When I have a problem, it suddenly becomes the end of the world and I mean it, I text 12 people, I cry and strangers help me.  I become irritable, rude and just a borderline terrible person.

I also do this to my professors at university. I e-mail them very often, often saying things like ""I cannot solve my code problem and I am getting nervous about it."" Basically, when octopus has a problem everyone needs to help. 

I hate it. To me, I am always on edge, always on the brink of death. I cry every day when I don't get an exercise, or I cry because I hate everyone. I also truly believe that if I am not on edge, crying and making my body feel like it's death or nothing I will not make it. I will not finish my assignment, I will not get a good grade, I will not get a day off. In my thought process' defence, it has always worked. Also, I am extremely disorganized and finish everything super late because of it. Else, I think it will not work. 

I am writing this to say I want help. I already attend therapy, but it is useless and in my country waiting lists for a new therapist are months long. I was supposed to be contacted weeks ago and nothing. Does anyone have a method or suggestions on how to deal with my emotions? I really notice that they are mostly academic-related (I am very scared of failure and I am attending a very demanding program). I have lost friends, my hair is falling out and I am just tired. There is no way I can get another therapist because of the healthcare system here. 

Next period of my university is supposedly easy-going in comparison to the remainder of the bachelor. What would you do to in order to live a more balanced, less stressed lifestyle without compromising academic success? I need help!

611,"I've had lots of trouble with being anxious about pretty basic stuff, mainly applying/asking if businesses are employing and for the most part I didn't really feel like I could do anything about it (there's no immediate financial need to btw). Today I discovered a new way of dealing with such fears where I'd basically split my thinking into two parts, allowing the first, rational part to have absolute power over my actions. I was basically commanding myself step by step to do what had to be done (by telling myself stuff like ""put your shoes on"", ""close the door""...).
My anxiety was interfering way less with my actions but I feel worried that this method may lead to me bottling up my anxiety in an unhealthy way by not dealing with it (which would be typical thing for me to do). Should I go on with it or is it just too risky?",26Oct2019,3
613," I believe my roommate is genuinely the thickest person I've come across. We took a 12 month lease, cause both of us were moving to a new city on short notice and needed a house as soon as possible. She's almost never at home and is quite social. We've been living together for about 3 months now. The early months it was fine. I took the trash out, cleaning the kitchen after every use, and on the weekends. I did not seem to mind it too much because she was hardly ever there and it was all my mess.

Lately however, she's started having friends over and cooking for them, about 3-4 times in a week. Forget that fact that the party goes on till 11-12 on weekdays, which I have complained about but it still recurs. When she cooks, she makes the biggest pile of mess in the kitchen like you wouldn't believe. ALL the utensils get used, she doesn't even have the decency to put the dirty dishes in the sink, the leftover food just lies there on the slabs in my utensils, and she won't clean it for days, despite me reminding her to clean, through texts, in person, nothing. We talked about it, and she says okay she will do it, and we made a chore list. She didn't even bother to do anything even after that. Basically, I have sort of given up that she will be convinced to. Every time a party happens, I do her friend's dirty dishes, I clean up the kitchen, I take the trash out, remove the beer bottles, everything you can think of.

She always leaves her clothes in the dryer, the three months we have been staying together she's defaulted on rent every single time (we even got a legal notice), and leaves all the lights on, leaves the front door open. There is no solution. I have a 12 month lease. She may move out in December, as her contract job with her company may end. That is the only reason I'm waiting before subleasing the place and moving out earlier.

What can I do meanwhile? Should I just let her chore build up and live in this mess? Or should I do the cleaning like a servant for her and her friends? I have thought about dumping her dirty dishes in her bedroom and putting the trash inside her room, but out room doors don't have locks and I'm scared to do anything drastic in case she damages my stuff.

614,"I have been working for this company (in-Home healthcare for elderly/disabled) for a year and a half, started as a caregiver and about 6 months in we got a new assistant director (internal promotion) and she took a liking to me, I was promoted to lead caregiver in January with the promise (during that initial conversation/promotion) that this was to put me on track to being promoted to assistant director, that I would be receiving a raise (came into the company at $12/hr, currently making $13.50), etc etc etc. 

Since that conversation, my second “promotion” date has been pushed back 6 months, then 4 more, for a total of 10. I have been making 13.50 since January. My boss/“director” of the program, keeps pushing these back as they come up, feeding me all kinds of promises that she never follows through on...

She is a good person, but she is super disorganized (keeps the company schedule “in her head” which has caused a lot of schedule fuck-ups that she then blames on the staff members and creates a lot of unnecessary drama. Has a lot of certifications and 20+ years caregiver and facility experience but no degree, no long-term management experience until now as far as I can tell. 

She has trust issues and has repeatedly told me she “knows I will stab her in the back”. I have anxiety issues and that shit drives them through the roof. When they do spill over she acts like it’s 100% on me for feeling that way and that I need to “get over it” rather than understanding that she has any part in it. I try to explain it and she just manager-splains back to me about why I am feeling how I am feeling (has said things like “I don’t know who hurt you but I assume it was a mother figure” just totally inappropriate speculation.) She regularly will make meeting times for us to talk about this stuff then cancel last minute, or make me drive 30 miles out to her house instead of meeting in our office 5 miles from my house. 

It’s basically just her and I in “management” positions although since being promised more responsibilities and less client shifts (I don’t mind clients, I love helping people, but I have a bachelors of science in business and I just feel like Caregiving as a career job is way underutilizing my skill set and ambition and career goals), I have basically become her errand girl and am at her beck and call to take shifts when people call out (sometimes at 4am, sometimes at 10 pm, because I need the hours, my schedule is all over the place because she sets my hours and offers me the “extra duties” as she sees fit, so some weeks I work 20 hours sometimes 50...) 

I’ve gotten to the point that I know I need to quit, following a conversation last week where I basically called her out on why there has been no discussion about my promotion or raise when the second push-back date has came and went with radio silence... after I made an accidental comment to a social worker who asked about a case that we had closed and let my boss know (she insists that I text her about anything and everything I do related to the company when I do it) I let her know and she flipped out on me (all phone communication, she is impossible to get a hold of in person), yelled at me, told me I “had grossly overstepped and she needed to hang up and think about what to do”... 

I was pretty sure I was gonna get fired because she liked to “put people on the do not staff list” to basically force them out of the company if they mess up in her eyes. When we talked later I came out with all the stuff about how these promises I had been made and the only reason I stayed with the company were not being fulfilled, she basically insinuated that I was having a freak out and that she didn’t know where this was coming from, so I demanded a meeting (in the office) politely and professionally to go over my future with the company and talk about these apparent professional boundaries I had never been trained on. 

A little back story, my degree (from Cal Poly SLO, a good school) is in Wine and Vit and business. Prior to this job I worked in the wine industry for 8+ years in production and sales. I was making $18/hr with benefits when I left my old job, but my soul was being crushed every day. I had also sustained a back injury while working harvest that was getting progressively worse and messing with my ability to walk and I just needed a break to heal mentally and physically. I thought working in an industry where I was making a difference and helping people would help, and it did for a while, but it’s to the point where I am living paycheck to paycheck just to make other people’s lives easier. My boyfriend of 5 years and I are about to do long distance for 6 months so he can further his career opportunities, so I need to be able to pay part of his portion of the rent and just be in a good headspace while my life gets a little bit more challenging. 

Also, I am just baffled that I have been working for $13.50 with no benefits for almost a year. 

The reason I’m even still here is because it’s literally just her and I at “management” level. There is a doctor who owns the company but I have only met him once in passing the whole time I have been at the company. His wife who does I’m not sure what probably something legit but also just lording over my boss (Director) and making life difficult, sucking at communication then coming in hot with unreasonable demands... she also has a brother who does something (no idea what although again he will pop up randomly and make a bunch of demands that throw everything off course, also the one time I met him he demanded I text him everything I am doing for the rest of the day if it is company related. Never had to do this before and have never had to do it again since that one day????) ... as far a I can tell it is a clusterfuck of mismanagement at the top, but I wouldn’t know forsure because I am actively kept out of any meetings, emails, etc. and any contact with the doctor, his wife, or her brother. 

We have no HR person. We outsource our billing. There is literally nobody else in this company I can turn to for advice or info... or if I did I know my boss would see it as me “stabbing her in the back” (one of her fears she has accused me of potentially doing in the future multiple times). 

I am just so done with this place. I can not believe I have been led with a non-existent carrot for so long and believed it. I’m actively looking for a new job. 

BUT I am super freaked out about the exit process. I really do not feel comfortable trying to quit without a mediator. We do not have one. Any attempt to use any other employee of the company would be taken poorly I know. 

So, what do I do? I’m gonna do this right, make sure I have a new job set in stone and signed contract or whatever before I put in my two weeks but how do I keep this woman from going psycho on me? What other shit might I have to look out for? 

She has literally lied to me and then been grooming me and straight up abusing my loyalty to the company and real connections with my clients to keep me on this sinking ship.

When I asked about a raise and title change/promotion last week she gave me some bullshit about how I would be stuck at $15/hr (for an assistant director position..?!)... for reference, we charge $32 an hour for services. I am the highest paid caretaker. We have to buy our own uniforms, pay for our own gas, often spend money on clients and do not get reimbursed.... just like what the fuck. I’m not an idiot. I know all that profit just goes right into upper managements pockets. 

She then told me about all these new programs we are launching (I do all the marketing for this company, I bring in at least 50% of new clients, don’t make commission, drive an average of 200 miles a week to do intakes, work the initial shifts with clients and put together personalized care plans, drive all over the county to drop off fliers at places the company approves even if my ideas for where we should market would hit our demographics more... no direct-to-client marketing as per the company’s rules, has to be through doctors offices or community centers...) and told me to “give her a year” and that she would get me to where I wanted to be... but then we never even discussed numbers?? And she has said that she can’t give me a job description because then she can’t ask me to do anything outside of that and it will “limit my potential”, WHAT???

Since we had our “come to Jesus” meeting my boss’s attitude toward me has totally changed. I told her I need a 48 hour break (usually I am semi-on call during weekend, although I don’t get paid unless I take a shift) and will call her on Monday. I plan on blasting out my resume this weekend. 

I’m sorry I just had to get this out because this last week has honestly been one of the most bizarre of my life, going from staying with this mismanaged shithole of a company because I thought I was climbing some kind of ladder, only to find out that it’s covered in bullshit. And then be told that’s the way it is and that if I can’t accept that then there is something wrong with me. “You would laugh if you knew how much I made. We don’t do this for the money”.... FUCKING. WHAT. 

I need help, advice, someone to yell at me to get the fuck out and how to do it safely. Please.",26Oct2019,3

616,"To start things off I just want to point out that English isn't me main language so if this story is a bit hard to comprehend apologise. 

I don't even know how to start this post or if me asking reddit will really help me but I will give it a try.

So as you can see this is a question about college and life in general. I'm 18 and I just spent my first month in college. I don't know how college works in other countries but in mine you have to get the best grades possible in high school in order to enter the more prestigious courses. For example if you want to follow Medicine you need to get grades from from 17-20 (here exams are graded from 0-20). 

Unfortunately I pretty much wasted my high school years worrying about things other than grades and I ended up having a pretty poor final score of 13.7. This didn't leave me that many choices to go for and I decided to choose environmental sciences with the hopes that this course would get me a job in the future since it's pretty obvious of what the current state of the planet is and what will it be. I only made this decision like 1 month before going to college and wasn't really sure what to think about it but my mother was really proud of me for choosing something that could help change the world for the better and I was also happy about it.

In order to continue this story I need to say I'm a very shy person and the ideia of going to a place where I didn't know anybody terrified me. Plus to reasons that are hard to explain I only managed to enter the course 2 weeks after it started so I was put in in a class full of people that knew each others for 2 weeks. So, as expected, this was really tough for me. Although being shy I always managed to make good friends in the schools that I went to but this was different. Since I only got in 2 weeks after it started I wasn't really able to make connections with the people there. They aren't bad guys but they have already formed groups of people and (at least for me) has been very hard trying to integrate them. This has made me think if I'm really going to be able to finish this year. I am not depressed at all but I fear that I will be if I keep attending this course. 

With that in mind I am considering dropping out of college and spending a year working and studying for exams that can change my high school grades by a lot. Pretty much spending a year going through new experiences, going to the gym, changing things about myself and trying to rediscover my motivation for learning and to be successful. I don't think that I am a dumb person due to my high school grades because I never really had the will to be the best at what I do but it hasn't always been like this. When I am focused on something I can do the thing so I believe that I could improve my grades a lot by stopping a year to study for those exams mentioned before.

I know gap years can be lonely sometimes because you aren't going to school or hanging out with people on a daily basis but as I said, although being shy, I do have some very good friends in my life that I believe that can make this year bearable.

To be fair I don't think I would hate environmental studies as a whole because it is kinda interesting but I am really afraid that I won't be able to make new friends and that it would be some painfull 3 years to bear. The problem is that my parents wouldn't understand this so I kinda had to lie to them and say that I hate my course and that this is not what I want to do with my life. 

This is where the real trouble begun. In my country people don't do gap years. After they finish high school they go straight to college because our society has the preconception of believing that if you stop a year it's because you don't want to study and be something in your life. My parents are great people and I couldn't truly wish for better people to guide me in my life but since I did so poorly in high school they don't think this gap year would be good for me. They think that I am quitting the course way too early and that I should give it more opportunities. The thing is if I want to leave college I only have until Wednesday to do it without having to pay for the whole year. If I leave before the 30th of October I will only have to pay for 1 month of college and I will be free of other expenses. In my country college isn't really that expensive (only 1000€ per year) and my family doesn't have money issues but I don't want my parents to pay for something that I am not happy with. Plus if I really do repeat my exams money would have to be spent with other things to help me get better grades.

I don't know what to do in my life at this point. I don't think I can last a year in college without fixing a lot of things about me ( being shy, being lazy, having no motivation) and I think that a year focusing on improving those things could help me a lot in life. If I do leave my parents and my family will be really sad and disappointed with me and seeing them like that kills me inside since they are amazing people. 

My friends think that I should leave but I don't know if I am cable of doing this to my family. Plus I don't even know if the gap year will help me get through some stuff. 

I know that posting my story on reddit will probably not help me since everyone is different but heck it I have nothing to lose. So yeah if I could get some opinions or some advice that could be helpful I would truly be grateful.",26Oct2019,1
617,"I'm worried about the children of my niece. She has six children (from five different fathers) who are mentally abused and neglected by her. I don't think she means to do so, she thinks of herself as a very good mother; but she has borderline and has a very low IQ (she is almost or already mental retarded). Physically she manages: the children have clean clothes (that mostly fit), they have toys and get 3 meals a day + snacks. Mentally or emotionally she doesn't support them at all, and even damages them. She derogates them, yells at them, embarrasses them, is dismissive about their feelings, makes mean jokes, uses them as an emotional shield with other people, she has unpredictable rage (verbally), everything is always their fault, she uses guilt against them, she keeps them away from loved ones (when she is angry at those loved ones), and so on. 

A view examples for more clarification (which you can skip if you find the post to long, the question is bellow this paragraph): (1) When I was speaking with the eldest child, she (the child) said that she (the child) was a loser. I asked why she thought this and she explained that her classmates called her a loser. So I asked if she believed this to be true just because her classmates said this ans she said that she believed them (which is vert common for children who get bullied).  My niece was standing next to us and listing to the conversation: all she did was laugh about it (in a mean way). She did not correct her child by saying that she was not a loser, nor does she take any action against the bullying at school. (2) When one of her children was trowing a tantrum she decided to film it, so that she could sent it to other people. That way they would see that the child was indeed a misbehaving little \*\*\*\*\*\*, and not as sweet as they thought. She als explained to the child why she filmed it and to whom she would send it (at the time that child was about 4). (3) Other family members tried to talk to her about her parting style (in a respectful and calm manner): they are no longer allowed to see the children even though those children are very close to them. 

Now, my question is: should I report her to the Child Protective Services? I'm not sure what they can do since she doesn't physically harm them and despite her mental limitations she is a very smooth talker (to those who don't know her). She already gets some help from the government and they apparently do not see the depth of her abuse (even though the kids all show behavioral problems, especially the older ones). I personally think it would be best if she was no longer allowed to raise them (since she is incapable of admitting she is doing something wrong, and incapable of feeling empathy); but even if they where removed from her care they will most likely be places with their fathers (separate from each other by another toxic parent). If I don't do anything they will probably be removed from her care when they hit puberty (which will probably worsen their behavioral problems), but I think it will be too late for them at that point. I think they need help now, so that they won't be damaged for the rest of their lives.... So its a bit of a dilemma. (Other people don't want to report her because you don't do that to family, so they will also be angry if they found out I did something like this.)",26Oct2019,1
618,"I don't really know where to start off with this. I guess I should start off by saying a year ago I thought I had everything figured out. I had a full time job and a was renting a house with my brother and took care of my responsibilities such as college and paying rent. I'm 20 years old and I thought I had a pretty good situation up until this point.

About 2 months ago, I received a call from my uncle who lived across the country asking if I could help take care of my sick grandfather. I thought it through and decided to move across the country and move in with them and take care of him full time. I didnt have to pay rent or anything of the sort and I could work on my college classes because I take online courses. Everything worked out for about a month before my grandfathers health declined rapidly and they decided to put him into assisted living. I want aware that they were also behind on the mortgage of the house either. So they house is being foreclosed and now I have nowhere to go. I've been staying with my girlfriend and my friends waiting until I can find a job to get back on my feet. I'm not sure what to do at this point other than that.

I'm in a new state with nobody to really help out except for a few friends. My brother wants to move out here as well and start a new life. However I dont have anywhere to go at this point in time. I have a good amount of savings which had been keeping afloat and taken care of. However, eventually that savings is going to run out. Any advice?",26Oct2019,1

620,"When I first got pregnant, I already had depression then it got worse because my relationship with the father of my child was not really hard working, cheated on me, and did not really try at all. I lost my apartment because it was partially my fault for letting him stay there plus I lost my job.
During my months of pregnancy, we end up yelling at each other so much and i hated him... it made me hate the child I was carrying. I wanted him to die
Even when I was in labor, we argued alot and I had a  Contraction too long which made my son not be able to breathe while inside of my stomach. So they put a breathing machine to make him breathe. He came out healthy and everything but I did not want to hold him or do anything with him. I didn't feel any connection whatsoever for him. (Me and the father of my child are not together anymore). 
I let my grandparents take care of him while I did my own thing because I know if I was around him...I would act on the thoughts I had towards him.
So I stayed away so I can not hurt him but over the past year and a couple of months, I honestly felt a bit better about trying to raise him myself and with my husband.
I already got married and I been taking my medication for my anxiety and depression. I know I can support him and I live about an 1hr and half away from my son. I'm ready to take him as my son.

623,"I don’t know I had this realization that the dynamic that I have with my family is just not normal at all. Yesterday we went out to eat, and I smoked some weed earlier on in the day so I was still slightly buzzed which allowed me to see a lot of things more clearly. 

I simply have subconsciously been trying to distance myself from my family, I don’t really talk to my dad about anything, and with my mom I used to be able to talk about school stuff and other things but now it seems like that’s hard too. 

I just don’t want them to know any thing about me really and in the past they’ve used things against me, broken my trust countless of times, and just never really showed any regard for my opinion or who I was as an individual. I was always thought that I never had a school bully growing up it was always my dad who picked on me, made fun of me, and put me down, and somewhere along the consistent cycle, after feeling like I was continually betrayed, I just said I wouldn’t trust him again and I just don’t really want anything to do with him.

And mom is kind of complicated and long story short, she made me go to the highschool that she was working at, I didn’t know anybody there, had no friends there, hungout with her at lunchtime till junior year, and she sometimes searched up my friends to see what they looked like, they’re grades, and also idk why I remembered this, but one time she knew my crush and there was really no way she could’ve known without talking to maybe that teacher and doing some snooping.

And the idea I’m trying to get out here is that my mom is intrusive, overbearing, paranoid, and even as a sophomore in college now, since I live at home while going to college, she is very strict so I have to lie all the time.

All this constant watching and snooping has just made me want to just stay away from her and I can’t really trust her as well, and as a result I don’t talk to either of my parents about anything meaningful, but I at least feel slightly comfortable around my mom. 

The point where I’m getting to is that it seems like I have valid reasons to act this way, but I just don’t know how to move forward from this. It feels as if I have to censor myself all the time and just dodge questions all the time, just so I can keep them guessing on who I am so they don’t find out too much, and start pestering further.

So I really like the idea of interspecies love as well as the idea of abduction. I've always found both the regular Gray aliens and the more grotesque, monstrous types of aliens really attractive - because of how similar and different they are, respectively.

I think it started when I was a teenager and I watched this weird Christopher Walken movie called Communion and I found the idea of him being hunted, stalked and abducted by aliens.. just kinda hot. Idk why. I thought about him being stuck down on a bed and them probing him. Okay, I know how fucked up that sounds, that's why I need advice. 

I would originally fuel this attraction to aliens and abduction by looking at explicit artwork online but it's gotten to the point where it's started to affect my relationships because I've always been kind of pushy about forced/alien dressup role play. The forced stuff is usually fine but the alien part always weirds them out.

Idk. It's just something about me I wish I could change and I had to get it out. It's already made my dating life rocky and awkward and I don't know what to do.

640,"Alright I am a 17 year old male living in Europe. I will finish high school within the next two years and i was pretty certain i would go to college in my home country (Ireland) as tuition is relatively cheap and I already had accomadation with my grandparents at one of the top universities in the country.

I began looking at different universities throughout Europe and i came to the realisation, yah know maybe i dont want to be living with my nan for the next four years, doing no work, no cooking, no cleaning, just not experiencing as much as i would like to. 

So i looked at many different universities who are known for the field of study i want to do (physics and engineering), and these universities have far better facilities and resources than the university at home while also having a much better employer reputation. I narrowed the list down to about 5 located in Germany,Switzerland and Sweden. I looked at living prices in these locations and if i took a gap year after high school to work i could probably easily manage my rent i reckon.

So i just kinda need advice is this the right decision to be making. Living in a different country miles away from home doing all my stuff independantly at 20 or should i just take the easier option of living with my family for 4 years and focus on my study more. Like it sounds very hard and a huge change for me but im up for the challenge and obviously id have to learn many skills like cooking and cleaning and paying taxes and whatnot but id love a change somewhere different and exciting.

Am i being daft?
Also if i was to move to a different country such as germany is there anything id need to know regarding health insurance and that kinda stuff as i have no idea about that kinda craic.

Any advice is appreciated and thanks for reading my dilemma. Sorry about grammar aswell, this was probably very painful to read. Thanks.",26Oct2019,1
641,"...more specifically, with my parents. I’m a high school senior and I’m so stressed out. I’m taking a lot of difficult classes and I have a lot of college applications. As a result, I’m sleeping 5-6 hours each night so I’m always tired. 

I go to school at around 7 so I only see my parents for ~10 minutes in the morning if even. Because they both work long hours, I also only see them at night for ~2 hours, and I’m usually doing homework or studying or something. And every time I see them, I’m often curt or rude or  snippy. My mom likes to ask a lot of questions about my applications and schoolwork, and I know she’s trying to help me, but it’s often annoying because I feel a lot more pressure. I’ve mentioned this before to her but she still does it. I hate the person I’m becoming around her, because I know she (and my dad) don’t deserve this attitude.

Any advice?",26Oct2019,1

643,"My best friend and I (both 23M) have known each other for almost 10 years now, and since the day we met we have consistently talked almost every day of the week via Discord/Skype, and played games together. I love this guy to death, and honestly can't imagine my life without him in it.   
So, here's the thing... Occasionally we'll have little hiatuses from each other for one reason or another (typically it's just because we're playing different games at the time, or a mix in sleep schedules), and over time I've realized that it's during these hiatuses that I make breakthroughs in my adult life. For example, last time this happened I stopped having interest in games altogether (something that typically takes up all my thoughts and time), caught up in all my classes, and started working out. Then we started hanging out again and I stopped working out and neglected my studies entirely, falling behind again.   


**Obviously this is in no way his fault.** However, there is a clear pattern here that I cannot deny. When we talk I tend to get so involved in whatever we're doing (usually playing games) that I neglect other parts of my life. I don't want to lose him as a friend, but I also love this productive side of me I only see when I'm not hanging out with him for an extended amount of time.

644,"Life isn't about success or wealth at all to me. I think going through depression so young has shaped the mindset I have today. I know I'm smart and can get a stable paying job in the future, but I have no desire to push myself to whatever expectation/ potential that is set out for me, simply because I value being a good person and staying down to earth over losing myself to success. I'm satisfied with settling down, living a quiet life and doing my part for the world, but I don't acquire the 'live life the the fullest' mantra everyone around me seems to have. I know I'm not special, that life is all meaningless anyway , should I feel guilty for not wanting more?",26Oct2019,10

646,"Just be yourself. Just go with the flow and have fun and meet interesting and lovely people, Do never be someone your not.

If you like someone then you can tell the person you like them, Who knows what will happen.

Do not just see someone then try to make that person your gf/bf. If you have a crush on someone then tell them, Do not keep it secret from them, 

That will hurt you on the inside. Who knows maybe that person will like someone else in the future and you never got a chance to tell that person how you really felt about that person.

Always try to have fun in life and always show your true colors and show everyone who you truly are.

Let life hit you. If you hang with someone really awesome and that person says sorry he/she probably likes someone else or he/she is not interested then that's okay, 

Always be there to love and support that person.

Life is all about meeting interesting people and having fun, Not searching for a relationship. Your soul mate will be in your life soon, I believe in you.

Everyone will find their special someone and we have no idea who that someone is.

You don't need to be in a relationship to be happy, You do what you love doing to make you happy, Being with your friends should always make you happy.",26Oct2019,1

652,"yeah this issue may seem really silly, but its affecting most aspects of my life. when I first got into kpop I was honestly amazed by it and I started understanding why people who were into it defended the idols within an inch of their lives. they have the talent, personality, manners, looks, everything basically. western artists have privacy whereas kpop idols' lives are basically on show for everyone to watch. they arent just the people behind the music, they are the reason i listen to music. the fact that they provided a lot of content to watch, like tv shows and game shows for example, doesn't help my addiction either. I have started to become reclusive and dont really do anything apart from watching kpop stuff on my phone in fact. when a concert came by and I wasnt allowed to go, I was literally devastated, and sulked for days. my gallery is filled with pictures of kpop idols, my instagram feed is about them, even my google suggestions are kpop related articles etc. i feel like my whole being is devoted to them. I realised I was addicted when I deemed the kpop group I follow up on, the most important people in my life. I knew it wasn't right because my family and friends have provided me with everything I could ask for, but then again, this group has given me undeniable happiness and not a single moment of sadness or sorrow. but i also knew that while I'd pick them over anyone in a heartbeat, they'd pick each other,and their families over me. and they'd certainly not want me to prioritise them over my own blood. I tried resolving the addiction by unfollowing the group on social media, logging out of my fan accounts, unsubscribing etc but I keep coming back. maybe it's also worth mentioning that my best friends who I text every single day are kpop fans who actually got me interested in the first place. I really want to stop being so addicted to kpop, I'd much rather listen to their music only without worrying about the artists themselves. im starting to loose focus on studies and academics (my social life is in ruins already so not affected lol) to the extent where even I want to stop.

I dont want to COMPLETELY stop I just want to tone it down and not be so obsessed. any advice would help thanks and please dont bash me for liking kpop since I get that enough in real life.",26Oct2019,1

656,"So I am friends with two people who broke up last year. Which has always put me in a very awkward position as I was in the very middle of their breakup as they were both talking to me about each-other and I felt like I was being a snake to both of them by being in the middle of it. They broke up amicably in Febuary this year and have remained friends but the problem is, he started seeing someone around August and told me not to tell her or anyone else. I tried to honour his wishes since then and I hadn't told her. Even when he tried to sleep with her a couple weeks ago, I kept my mouth shut. But today I met up with her and we were in the car and she asked me if I knew if he was seeing anyone. I'm a terrible terrible liar, especially when put on the spot. I could've just said that I didn't know and left it at that but my face gave it away instantly and she dug and asked questions. She is over the moon for him and isn't bothered at all, the only thing she minds is him trying to sleep with her that time a couple weeks ago.   


I feel unbelievably terrible. I will try my best to keep someones secret but if someone flat out asks me I just cannot lie. I should've thought of something better to say but in the moment I just fessed. This guy has been my friend for years and he is the best friend of my boyfriend, who I worry would also be really upset that I told her. I am going to have to let both of them know that she knows as I hate secrecy and I would feel doubly worse if he didn't know that she knew. She feels terrible for digging and putting me in an awkward situation so she is fine with me telling him that she knows.   


My question is: How would you feel if you were him? I tend to overthink peoples reactions but sometimes I have been pretty bang on the nose in gauging how someone would feel.   
and   
How should I go about telling him? I honestly worry if this is a friendship ruining thing and he and my boyfriend are never going to be able to trust me again.",26Oct2019,1

Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Juts before this they asked how old I am and I said I’m 29 and they both reacted nicely saying ‘awwwwww are yer?!’ Loudly, Meaning I look younger coz I do get told I do a lot.

 So then after that she starts screaming banging on the walls and then causes a whole fight makes the tension in the house rise and now my mom left the house I dont even know where she went and my dad is mad and she does this all the time and I feel like it was my fault but at the same time all I did was try to shower
 So if you touch her door handle she will freak out start screaming at the top of her lungs and start Cloroxing everything I don't even shower in the bathroom she does and every night she usually bleaches the whole tub before she gets in
 In the mornings she takes me to school since my parents give her a free car with free gas if I'm less than a minute late she gets really angry, speeds, and then calls my mom while shes at work screaming
 One time 2 years ago about my dad sat on her bed as a joke and she then she screams and crys and washes her whole bed and Cloroxed her floor and then ruined the whole day

He said girls tend to be raised without opportunities to be humble, whereas boys do have that opportunity. He didn't explain the takeaway of this.

I said it didn't make any sense to try and generalize a group of 4 billion people and say they are more or less the same and it's because they were raised the same.

I am in two minds about what to do...
On one hand, it's stable and it provides a slightly above average wage, the business is also run by a family friend and it would disappoint my parents to leave so early. 

On the other hand, I feel sick about going to work, I don't like the passive aggression from all of my other co-workers, I get a hard time for not having baby-sitters for my kids and therefore can't pick up extra shifts, when the workload gets behind it's automatically my fault, I have been promised a wage increase and a forklift license when I pass an online course that I still haven't been given, and as I mentioned earlier the mere feeling of standing in the actual store gives me stomach pulling anxiety....

She became really close with her sister and I get that because family comes first and having a good relationship with your sister is a beautiful thing. The thing is that my “best friend” will always say she’s busy, or just flat out ignore me when I ask to hangout.

I know that’s not true because when I ask to hangout she says no but then hangouts with her sister or toxic ex. I truly believe her boyfriend is the one who’s making her change because this always happens right around when they start dating.

However other new staff members did the same and got invited to hang out for lunch etc. I genuinely don't understand what I am doing wrong.

I would not consider myself creepy. I am a small woman, of I'd say average appearance. Me being friendly to people definitely shouldn't come across as creepy, so I don't understand why they look at me weird.

Another example is one of my classes has a group chat specifically for class work etc (sending homework for people who were absent etc) but I am the only one not in it. My teacher even asked them to add me so that I could catch up etc (which I found embarrassing) but they still ignored the request multiple times. 

I don't feel people NEED to be friends with me, but it feels like people are just being rude to me for no reason. I am friendly to people so I don't understand why they are so rude.

TL;DR : I try to be friendly to people but I get ignored and excluded for seemingly no reason.",26Oct2019,0

We had a play room, my dad built it there. Except, it wasn’t it’s own room. It’s a bit weird so i’ll try my best to try to explain. My room is connected to my dads room and my living room.        Basically my door to my living room is a door i can lock, but when I can’t close it like a normal door. So, I can lock it but if i’m in the kitchen anybody can get in without even pushing. Even my dogs, and it’s really annoying considering my dog sleeps in my room and my other dog likes fighting with him.
The door that connects me to my dads room the most annoying. He can enter my room but I can’t enter his. My siblings can just go through this room to my room and annoy me and i can’t do anything out it. I hate it so much, I can’t even have piracy without people barging in. Help?",26Oct2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

We are an Armenian family living in California, we moved here from Armenia in the late 90's because my father had bought a business company here in California, so we had to live here. The tough time started at about the end of last year, when dad and mom started having a bad relationship with each other, the causes were unknown, but I noticed that they started to argue and not agree often.

I had a good relationship with one of my father's employees, Scott, he was younger than me, he worked as an accountant for dad, he was incredibly smart. Dad wanted to give him more responsibility within the company because he was a good worker and reliable. Dad invited him to dinner every Friday at our house. My mother had started going on a course, to get a license so she could start helping dad with the family business. The problem was that mom didn't have a driver's license, and we couldn't drive her to the course all the time. Dad decided to let Scott drive mom to the courses, and with that he didn't have to work in the company so much.

So Scott spent Monday to Friday every week with my mom, because he drove her to the courses and back home. Mom also had errands that she used to go to after the courses, so he spent those times with her as well, and that was their daily routine. He picked up mom from the house early in the morning and left her home at night, all the time. I thought he was strangely nice, because he didn't have to do this, he was already the company's accountant and had much else to think about than driving around my mom.

In March of this year, I, dad and five other employees went on a work trip to Tokyo, it was about business and agreements. Mom would stay home, and dad didn't want to leave her alone in the house because he was afraid of robbery, burglary and other things, it wasn't safe for a woman alone. Scott was willing to live in the house with Mom until we come back from the trip, we would be there for 27 days.

In the middle of the work trip, I saw a picture my mom had posted on Instagram. The caption to the image was ''Enjoying the night with friends''. The picture was of her, Scott and two girlfriends. They were apparently outside a nightclub, well-dressed and posing for the camera. Mom and dad used to go to nightclubs sometimes so it was no big deal.

A few days later another picture, it was very late at night, a Friday. A picture of snacks and beverages, mom sat on the couch with crossed legs and lightly dressed, the caption was ''Cozy with the best'', which I thought was strange. Here it started to feel a little strange and uncomfortable because it was late at night and mom was lightly dressed in front of Scott, because he must have taken the picture, it couldn't have been anyone else at the time, it was too late.

When the trip was done and we came back home, dad didn't even bother to greet mom, he walked into his room to do some paperwork. I greeted Mom at the door, she was going out to eat with Scott. This is what it looked like, Mom and Scott started to spend the days together, from morning to evening. To be honest, I was not so excited about this. He also learned to speak a little Armenian. Mom went home to Scott every now and then to cook for him, after all, he lived alone.

Mom and dad's relationship got worse, dad was involved in his work, things were bad for the company, he took out all the anger on mom, everything led to dad divorcing mom. Mom felt bad and had a hard time, Scott tried to make her feel better, take her out, comfort her, invite her to food, shop and other things.

My girlfriend Minar and I tried to spend a lot of time with my mom to show her that we are there, that we are there for her. But mom was hard to comfort, it felt like Scott was the only one who could make her smile sometimes, I didn't know why. So I asked him myself, to take an absence from his work and the company, to spend time with my mother, he agreed. Dad took the house because it was on his name. He told me that I was allowed to stay there but that my mother could not stay in the house anymore. Scott took her to his house, she had to live there, it was no problem for dad, it took me time to accept, but in the end I was forced to.

A couple of days ago, my girlfriend showed me two clips from her cell phone, it showed my mom making out with Scott, one was at his house and the other outside. I was trembling and did not know what to do. I started yelling at Minar, telling her when she filmed this and when it happened and all those crazy things. She told me it happened some days before but that she was scared and didn't want to tell me about it.

686,"I moved to another country with my husband (M26) two months ago. My dad and stepmom came to visit late Wednesday and leave on Sunday this week, so they are still here. For context: I work from 9-18 so wednesday to friday I was busy during that time but free over the weekend. I'm kind of hurt after what has been going on during the visit, but don't know what action to take if any, or if I'm just overreacting.


I thought they were coming to visit us and spend time together. They had talked about two museums they wanted to see, and before they arrived I said I really want to see those exhibitions, that I hadn't been to see them yet and would want to see them.


First day here they see one of them on their own. No big deal, we'll see the other one on Saturday maybe. Nope, they went to see it and another one on their own while I was at work, instead of saving one to do together. So three really great activities to do as a family, they do on their own. Allright, we at least can have some meals together.


During lunch on Thursday and Friday I try to plan a get together but they flake, say that they'll let me know and then didn't.


I understand doing things while I'm at work, that's completely fine and normal! But when I was finished with work at six on Thursday, they seemed disinterested in getting dinner and my stepmom said ""I'm not so hungry, just something quick.""


When I called after work on Friday to have dinner together they say that they are tired and we'll see each other on Saturday. At six in the evening! I told them, well you have to eat something and we have to eat something, shouldn't we grab something together? So we do that, grab a cheap italian place.


Today, Saturday, they come over shortly after lunchtime to see our apartment. They had talked about wanting to walk around the city and see a spot that had a good view, so we did that which was great. Everytime we got together during the visit we had a good time with everyone in a good mood.


It was around five today, Saturday, when I asked if there was anything in particular they were interested in seeing or doing but they said that they had already seen most of the city, sights and museums they wanted to, and they just wanted to eat early. So we did, ate dinner at five in the afternoon (very early to me).


Afterwards, I thought we could maybe do something since we had eaten dinner so early. I suggested dessert, walking around the old town, a wine bar, riding scooters, sitting down for a quiet hot chocolate. None of those suggestions were met with enthusiasm. So my husband and I walked them to their hotel, just to spend some time together.


They leave around six in the evening tomorrow and said that they are just going to take a look around downtown and go to the shopping street before they leave. ""That sounds nice"" I thought, assumed I could join. Nope, they started to say goodbye like the visit was just over! I said that I'd like to walk around town tomorrow and they said ""okay we'll see, we'll call you""


This is all just sooo weird!!! We don't spend a lot of time together so I thought this visit would be a great way to be on our own and make some memories, just them and my husband and I.


I didn't want to spend every waking moment with them but I'm just so confused as to why we weren't included in any of their plans the whole trip. I didn't want to bring this up and ruin the mood, but I'm feeling hurt, but even more confused.


Has anyone been in a similar situation or have any insight as to what to do?

688,"Hello, throughout the past year i've had some minor issues with my mental health, if you could say that. Recently I've been panicking about doing PE at my school. Every time my PE for the week ends, I begin dreading the next time I have to do it. I feel like my life is turning into a circle of dread and I can't focus on anything apart from PE. I don't enjoy going out like I used to and talking with my family has become a struggle as it feels like PE is always at the back of my mind. Why do I dread PE? I honestly cannot tell you. Whenever I am at PE I feel like crying and running out of the room, this has happened 3 times during PE. I don't know why I feel like this, I only feel like this elsewhere when I am under extreme circumstances, but when I am in PE it is constant. My mum has recently offered therapy to me but I feel like my problem is pathetic and I'm just some stupid kid who will waste the therapist's time. 

Last year I would panic and run out of almost everything social in tears and heavy breathing. This has gotten better, but PE has made me feel this way again. I don't want to go back to the way I was last year but I feel like my pathetic problem may turn into something worse. Should I wait before it gets worse before I go to therapy? Is my problem invalid?",26Oct2019,1
690,"I currently live with my ex and our son. Our relationship started 5 years ago and has consistently gone down hill. Our son is a toddler and I am 6 months pregnant. 3-4 months ago, we broke up for good. My ex wants me out of his apartment and I want out as well. He is the sole provider for income right now as I have used up a significant amount of savings over time to pay for our food, items for our son, and extras. We also own a car together. I have been looking for work, which is difficult while pregnant. I am high risk and will need to take a potentially longer maternity leave (before or after) the baby arrives. Currently most full time positions will pay for the care of our toddler while I am working, with a remainder of $100 or so. I know that $100 is still something but I will need to afford an apartment and transportation when myself and son move out. 

Recently, I am at my breaking point with residing with my ex. Myself and son are not able to stay with our families who are 2 hours away. How do I go about getting out of here now? Is my only option a shelter? What does getting back on your feet from that point look like? As I will need childcare, a job, and transportation - in the beginning having no money at all.

 I really can't go on much longer here. I do 100% of our cleaning, cooking, laundry, pet care, doctors appointments, etc - frequently needing to clean up messes my ex leaves behind who is disorganized, chaotic, and messy. It amounts to a lot on me. This is besides the personal issues that linger between myself and my ex that still come up while living together. The relationship has taken a huge toll on me emotionally, psychologically, financially, etc. I am concerned about having to bring our new baby into this living situation as well. I know I can manage to take care of my children on my own. I don't think I can in this environment though - with the added stress of another adult, their issues and irresponsibility.",26Oct2019,2

695,"I've lately had a pile of issues with her; from stealing, to snooping through my vents, journal wise &amp; computer wise, to insulting me, our relationship is extremely strained. As someone who suffers from depression &amp; anxiety, my own room isn't a safe place, let alone home whenever she's there. We're forced to ""share"" a room, much to both of our dismay as our parents could hardly do anything to resolve it, such as giving us our own rooms, even talk to her -- which they don't, if anything, their ignorance enables her. We've had events where we have reached ""neutral"", that lasts until she goes through my things and fuels the fires again, let it be 10 days ago in regards to my latest vent, and thus we're bitter again.  


The following is what I'm not ""allowed"" to do according to her:   
\- not allowed to touch her things -- the recent issue was me holding her given up Pikachu plush, she gave it to our baby brother and has been sitting there for god knows how long, because of that, she tried to take it back because *I* was touching it; luckily she got her ass called out on it  -- yet that doesn't stop her from stealing/touching mine, if anything, I touch her stuff to take back something she didn't ask to have/use.   
\- not allowed to have my say of the room ( i.e., I don't understand why the blinds need to be up 24/7 while it seems to be a custom to let them down at night, or the curtain being up also 24/7, then again this may solely being me paranoid and she does ""allow"" it to be done if we're undressing. ) basically, if I want anything a certain way, she has to argue and it has to be how *she* wants it.  
\- can't even be in the room while she's in there, we both want to be in the room alone, however, she can hardly respect that on my part when I want to relax after coming home from work, instead, I'm always ""obliged"" to leave the room after she comes in. Once during her episodes of sitting at her desk all moody-like, I ask what's wrong, by the time, my hearing was shit and didn't clearly get what she was saying ( worse yet, muttering ), assuming she said ""nothing,"" I stayed there, until noticing later she was writing on paper telling me to ""get out"" like a psychopath.  


Other issues is me being nice and never getting anything in return; before, we would watch videos together, this was until she was taking this for granted and wanted to watch videos EVERY. GODDAMN. NIGHT. Getting pouty if I didn't want to, I'd lie about being sick if it meant she would leave me alone. After I got a new computer, I let her have the old one, to which she abused by watching videos all night in that same night. After repeating a series of her rage-quitting over a game ( my mom perceived this as her being cranky due to the lack of sleep ) this was my moment to call her out for the event of thinking everything goes by what she wants. I've bought her stuff. During one ""Tree Festival"" day, I bought cookies for everyone, and earrings for her -- I wasn't asked, I didn't owe anybody. I did it to be nice, she didn't bother to wear them, now, I can understand getting earrings recently and unable to switch them out, but they were the common for newly pierced year, I'd imagine, plus it wasn't literally yesterday she got it done. Over time, where she regularly switches them, still nothing. I even got her ""Let's Go Eevee"" for her birthday per her asking initially ""are you going to get me something for my birthday?"" Or something to that affect; rarely plays it, even now. Doesn't even touch it, let alone express any form of gratitude, she would for anything else she got, but not me. I was commenting per her ungratefulness that I'd take it back -- which many of my friends responding to my vents of this agreed I should -- of course, with her being nebby, commented back ""it's my game."" Like ?? Along, Easter, we get plushes, I was given a Llama, where she got a bunny, she first assumed the llama was for her -- no, it was for me. Again, being nice and to be not annoyed with her usual ""nothing goes my way"" attitude, I let her have it, however -- given her recent treatment, I'm very leaning on returning what's supposed to be her's and get it back.  


Now, with Christmas coming up, though not dangerously close and HOPING I don't end up having to end up getting something for her ( we have another tradition where we act as a ""secret Santa"" for a member of our family ), I frankly don't want to get her anything should it be so, but she ""reminded"" by the respective vent that ""we have to because it's the house rules."" Personally, she deserves coal or something that doesn't match her interest/likes just to spite her, or something poorly thought of. Along, her birthday -- I'm hoping I'm not around or I can be somewhere else during it, same deal there -- I don't want to get her anything because she doesn't deserve anything from me and it's a waste of money if she doesn't even interact with it if it's from me, funny considering she's always bitching about me ""wasting"" money on my rabbit who will at least interact with the things I get him. Should I even bother or reluctantly oblige as to keep everyone else off my ass who couldn't see the obvious toxicity from her?",26Oct2019,1

He basically said he doesn’t know what he’s doing with his life. Him and his father are not on good terms to the point where his father has told my friend to kill himself. He doesn’t care about academics or anything other than working out and this one girl who has not been healthy for him because she’s an hour away and just some tinder girl he’s head over heels for (We have all told him that it’d be best to drop her).

We just sympathized with him and heard him out and did as much as we could. It was hard on everyone, it was the first time this friend had ever been vulnerable and none of us were prepared for it.

So my mother is into spiritual and religious stuff which I'm not into at all. I'm not talking about normal religious stuff because she literally waves coconuts around my head and goes to throw them into the ocean.

She doesn't let me talk to my step brother and sister who she believes want to murder me for some reason. I'm 100% sure she has several mental illnesses but she won't go to a doctor.

I have a whole long list of reasons of why she is insane but in summary narcissistic and crazy.

Anyway that's my weird introduction over I'll cut to the chase. There is over £2 million in inheritance on the line which she said she would give away if I didn't listen to her. Is it worth changing my name for her and letting her live with me for the rest of her life? She wants to move in with me when I'm older...not to mention I have to be religious for practically the next 40 years because of her!


TLDR: I want control over my life from my crazy mother but I also don't want to let  over £2 million slip away from me.

Should I cut ties with her or should I stick with her for the money?",26Oct2019,2
704,"Hi, my name is Narek, I am in a difficult situation and need advice. The text is quite long, but I did my best to summarize as detailed as possible. Hope you can take the time to read and offer advice.

&amp;#x200B;

We are an Armenian family living in California, we moved here from Armenia in the late 90's because my father had bought a business company here in California, so we had to live here. The tough time started at about the end of last year, when dad and mom started having a bad relationship with each other, the causes were unknown, but I noticed that they started to argue and not agree often.

I had a good relationship with one of my father's employees, Scott, he was younger than me, he worked as an accountant for dad, he was incredibly smart. Dad wanted to give him more responsibility within the company because he was a good worker and reliable. Dad invited him to dinner every Friday at our house. My mother had started going on a course, to get a license so she could start helping dad with the family business. The problem was that mom didn't have a driver's license, and we couldn't drive her to the course all the time. Dad decided to let Scott drive mom to the courses, and with that he didn't have to work in the company so much.

So Scott spent Monday to Friday every week with my mom, because he drove her to the courses and back home. Mom also had errands that she used to go to after the courses, so he spent those times with her as well, and that was their daily routine. He picked up mom from the house early in the morning and left her home at night, all the time. I thought he was strangely nice, because he didn't have to do this, he was already the company's accountant and had much else to think about than driving around my mom.

In March of this year, I, dad and five other employees went on a work trip to Tokyo, it was about business and agreements. Mom would stay home, and dad didn't want to leave her alone in the house because he was afraid of robbery, burglary and other things, it wasn't safe for a woman alone. Scott was willing to live in the house with Mom until we come back from the trip, we would be there for 27 days.

In the middle of the work trip, I saw a picture my mom had posted on instagram. The caption to the image was ''Enjoying the night with friends''. The picture was of her, Scott and two girl friends. They were apparently outside a nightclub, well-dressed and posing for the camera. Mom and dad used to go to nightclubs sometimes so it was no big deal.

A few days later another picture, it was very late at night, a Friday. A picture of snacks and beverages, mom sat on the couch with crossed legs and lightly dressed, the caption was ''Cozy with the best'', which I thought was strange. Here it started to feel a little strange and uncomfortable because it was late at night and mom was lightly dressed in front of Scott, because he must have taken the picture, it couldn't have been anyone else at the time, it was too late.

When the trip was done and we came back home, dad didn't even bother to greet mom, he walked into his room to do some paperwork. I greeted Mom at the door, she was going out to eat with Scott. This is what it looked like, Mom and Scott started to spend the days together, from morning to evening. To be honest, I was not so excited about this. He also learned to speak a little Armenian. Mom went home to Scott every now and then to cook for him, after all, he lived alone.

Mom and dad's relationship got worse, dad was involved in his work, things were bad for the company, he took out all the anger on mom, everything led to dad divorcing mom. Mom felt bad and had a hard time, Scott tried to make her feel better, take her out, comfort her, invite her to food, shop and other things.

My girlfriend Minar and I tried to spend a lot of time with my mom to show her that we are there, that we are there for her. But mom was hard to comfort, it felt like Scott was the only one who could make her smile sometimes, I didn't know why. So I asked him myself, to take an absence from his work and the company, to spend time with my mother, he agreed. Dad took the house because it was on his name. He told me that I was allowed to stay there but that my mother could not stay in the house anymore. Scott took her to his house, she had to live there, it was no problem for dad, it took me time to accept, but in the end I was forced to.

A couple of days ago, my girlfriend showed me two clips from her cell phone, it showed my mom making out with Scott, one was at his house and the other outside. I was trembling and did not know what to do. I started yelling at Minar, telling her when she filmed this and when it happened and all those crazy things. She told me it happened some days before but that she was scared and didn't want to tell me about it.

Should I tell my dad? What should I do with Mom and Scott? Should I take my mom out of Scott's house so she can live with me and Minar in a house of our own? Who am I to blame for this, Mom, Dad, Scott or myself? 

I turn to you here at reddit, I am in great need of advice and guidance. I do not know how and what to do in such a situation. Thoughts and opinions works alo.",26Oct2019,1

706,"TW: Mention of rape

So, I was talking with my friend\[M\] about our Halloween plans, and he brought up how he was planning on losing his virginity to this girl, and how my two other friends were planning on doing it on the same night with these two girls. I was thinking ''oh, cool, he's finally doing it great job man'' until he mentioned that they were planning on getting the girls really fucking drunk and that they'd stay sober. I told him that this was wrong, and that this could seriously fuck someones life up, not to mention land all three of them in jail but he just brushed it off like I was joking. I'm seriously not sure on what to do, because on one hand maybe they won't get them drunk, maybe they won't even have sex at all, but on the other hand, these poor girls could have to deal with this for their whole life. I'm disgusted that he even wants to do this too, because we've been friends since we were both only starting school (I only met the other two guys a year or two ago), and even if I only knew him for a day that doesn't excuse raping someone.

legs of young women can cause lust in men. Banning young women from wearing shorts can probably help reduce rape, harassment, and simple leering. When women hit an older age like maybe 40, they can start wearing them. Some say men need to control themselves however to say that those men can control themselves is futile, it's like saying a shark seeing a piece of meat should control himself",26Oct2019,0

I had a friend I knew since 6th grade (U.S) we where super close, he was there for me throw thick and thin, he had seen me throw my darkest moments. Then around our late sophomore year/early Junior I got my first serious boyfriend, who I was and still a part of me loves. He seemed to hate him and I was extremely shy and timid so I didn’t speak out about how it made me mad. He seemed to get drunk more and more (he drank slightly but no where near this much) at first I just assumed it was just stress. 

(*importent note here I was a huge self harmer and was in recovery for the rest of the story, I have been out of recovery for a long time now *)

He then started to use drugs to get high, and I told him I do not like that shit. He would then pressure me for sex when I told him “no you know I love boyfriend!” He just seemed to get annoyed and went off to take Adderall. I begged him many times to stop and get help. Then one day he told me he was inlove with me. 

I ended up telling him I loved someone else.....he then sent me photos of him cutting and told me how it’s my fault. I was so new to recovery At that point that I fell back into it my self. 


For a few weeks he kept telling me how I did this to him. He kept me in my state of depression, when my ex boyfriend found out he was pissed he basically told me to cut him out of my life, but I didn’t listen..... after struggling but passing out of recovery (meaning I no longer self harm) I tried to help him out of this dark place, I thought it was working he got himself a girlfriend; so I thought he was finally moving on.  

Months pass and we lost a friend in a car crash, he took it harder then I did because that was his best friend. His girlfriend was basically what he fell back on. 

Skip to December

My ex bf told me he had cancer and due to that he wanted to just be friends because he wanted me to love someone who wouldn’t just leave me and brake my heart. I ended up sobbing to him in this as my rock bottom. 

(Feels months ago he got cleared actually but we are just besties at this point) 


I spent months in a hard depression where my minor eating disorder became hard core in my life.  (still in recovery)  and I barely was even keeping my self alive. I cut my hair (somthing I would hide in and keep covering my eye) then his girlfriend left him.

For a while he blamed her and even told me “you wouldn’t understand this pain is unimaginable!” As I was in my depression. As it was the later half of our senior year at this point. He would rest his hand on my thigh dangerously close to the no no zone.  I told him it made me uncomfortable I removed his hand form it often. He would listen to me sob about how much pain I was in then pressure me for sex even throwing in the fact me and ex had it.  A quote “you and boyfriend had sex so you can’t act like your a Virgin” and he kept calling me drunk and high just to scream at me as well as just starting fights. When me and ex bf would hang out he would spam my phone, same when I was with friends. He would calm I would never give him any time.

It then took a turn when he showed up to school drunk with vodka. A few weeks later he was put in a hospital for mental breakdowns. 

I thought it would be good for him. But he claimed I didn’t care for him at all, it really messed with me for a long time. He basically harassed me and his ex gf until she blocked him. I didn’t. 

After this whole mess he missed so much school that he opted to graduate early with a GED.  (I think it’s whats called it’s a equivalent degree thing)

For a few months he got more and more addicted to who knows what, he would often compare himself to Rick Sanchez and Bojack horseman.  At this point it was routine for him to take it out on me of blaming me for everything wrong saying how I didn’t care, it all came down to the night that he did meth, he basically nearly O.Ded and was rushed to the hospital claiming to get clean after that. I thought this would finally be it, but no it only got worse.

It went to a night of him telling me he was gonna kill him self, and I had an anxiety attack so bad that I called The nonemergency number. It sparked our biggest fight. 

This fight I told him I was done and in that call I basically told him I am done with his shit. I hung up and blocked him. 

Fast forward a few months he messaged my work email, then my Instagram dms, then he would try to force a neutral friend to try and talk to me. He even went so far as to befriend my ex bf to try to get me to talk to him, Lucky it didn’t work out. He would harass my friend who is the person closest to me. He would actually call this person and harass the hell out of them.  He only once tried to come to my house unexpectedly. Until.....


Yesterday. I currently am sick so I was trying to take a nap (with out pants) as my brother comes in and tells me my friend is here to see me.  As I put on the pants I go down and see him playing with my dog. Even when my throat hurt like hell I screamed at him to get out. I’m the months that had passed sense I last saw him I changed I got stronger. I pushed him out and he got me to go outside with him, he begged me to talk to him, like so meany times before he told  how he changed. Then not even five minutes later told me he was drunk when I asked him what he was doing here. He told me he now has control over his problems. Then I went off  I told him exactly what he did, I told him I now have a girlfriend (I am bi) and have been trying to improve my life, the entire time I am sick in the cold and rain. I told him to fuck off. My dad called me back inside and I ended up locking the door and everything then going to call people to tell my friends what happened. 


I’m no where new to people stalking me, as well as being genuinely creepy, but at this point I have no clue what to do anymore so please any advice would be lovely because I just need any advice.

712,"I had a crush on her since elementary school. We lived in the same town all our lives and she was my best friend but I never had the courage to tell her how I felt about her. Then she got a boyfriend when she started college. Then after a couple of years, he moved to another state to find a home where they could move to. 

I know I'm invitably biased but the only reason he moved is because he hated our small town life, and wanted to move to the big city. He doesn't have ambitions because he quit his studies to go live in his mom's basement in the big city and work at the closest department store

Him aside, he took his precious time and disappeared for more than half a year. During that time I was going through depression and she also got depressed. One thing led to another and I confessed my feelings for her and we basically developed mutual feelings. She kissed me and we slept together... The day after (no joke) he called and said he was coming to visit. Well the visit was an embarrassing public proposal, and regardless of her anger and confused feelings, she said yes due to public pressure. Shortly after that she moved away with him. 

I know this is going to sound pathetic but I've never had anyone. During the few months we spent together we slowly fell in love and she was the first person to actually love me, she was literally my first kiss and the first person to make me feel like I was worth something. I know there's a lot of gray moral areas in what we did and some would consider it downright cheating but just for the record, there were a LOT of other factors at play in the whole thing, so I don't think it's fair to say what she did was outright bad (both for me and him) or that what I did was a bitch move. Loneliness sucks. Being homeschooled by conservative parents and never knowing anyone your own age in your entire life also sucks. So does watching the girl who gave you your first kiss go away.

It's been about 6 months and I thought I'd have gotten over it by now and it sort of did, but in the past week everything just came crashing down on me and I miss her, a lot. A part of me still loves her and I'm confused, angry, and blame myself because I keep thinking if I tried harder or if I acted differently maybe things would have turned out different. If I had been more open about my feelings years earlier, but I didn't and I lost, and now I want to get over it and I can't",26Oct2019,1

We haven’t yet met in person, but we talk frequently. He lives a few states away, and our resemblance is uncanny.

714,"I’ve had a lot happen in this last month, mostly for the worst. I joined the Marine Corps and got sent home from bootcamp as a result of an injury about a month ago that continues to cause me issues. On top of that my long time girlfriend and I split for complex reasons. That, couples with the loss of the future I built for myself within the Marines and my deteriorating health made for quite the unfortunate month.

I am back working at my high school job I had before I left for the Corps. I have been here about 3 years, and it is a local family diner so it’s nothing like an interchangeable corporate job like a Burger King cashier. I’ve grown attached to the place, to the point my sister works here as well and my parents are invested in it. I also have quite the emotional attachment to the place, the workers, and the amazing family that runs it.

However, here’s the issue. In the last week or so I’ve been very irritable, especially when needing to report for work. I feel like a little piece of my soul dies every time I clock in, and I can’t begin to describe how much I hate my life every time I have to ask the hundredth customer how they want their stupid eggs. I have no idea if it’s the job or just everything in the last month.

I am currently in the process of trying to rejoin the military, as most of the branches said they’d take me back. However, I need to go through the painstaking process of the healthcare system to get healed (understandably) before I can go back. And by that point, who knows, maybe I won’t even want to.

I honestly have no idea if it’d that fact I don’t know what I’m doing with my life or just my job making things worse. I also have a second job that I don’t mind (for now...) if that holds any weight. I will answer any follow up questions. Thanks!",26Oct2019,2

716,"My best friend(f23) and I(f23) have been inseparable since grade 5. Even when we didn't see each other everyday anymore or talk every day, when we saw each other it was like nothing changed. We had our own language basically.

We tried things together and experimented with new things like drinking, smoking, drugs, all that stuff. We did meth together for a long time, both got pretty messed up on it for a long time. I finally had to quit for my own sanity and moved to another state with my husband. She didn't slow down like I did even though I encouraged her to.

Then her mom passed away, a year or so ago.I dropped everything and came home for her, her mom was there my whole childhood too, so of course she meant a lot to me. Anyway, after her mom passed away she sort of went off the deep end. She went hard on drugs and alcohol, hanging around the wrong people. Our communication sort of dropped off...I couldn't be around her when I visited our home state because she would promise not to pressure me into doing anything or partying, then go ahead and message her dealer knowing I would give in anyway. It just wasn't good for my sobriety.

I know she's hurting and hate seeing her hurt. She was doing good and had a job, getting clean but suddenly disappeared with her boyfriend (who is a shithead) and getting back on heroin. I've been scared for her and getting a phone call that she's dead somewhere. 

Before she disappeared,(the last time I talked to her), I was in our home state to be with my dad...who was on life support and eventually passed away. This happened early this year. On top of all of this I was pregnant, so it was a horrible time.
I decided to text her because I just wanted my best friend...and she grew up with my dad and I thought she'd want to know what's going on.  Seriously all she said to me was ""I'm so sorry just be there for him."" And then proceeded to talk about how she missed her boyfriend and needed to get some dick. It was like a slap to the fucking face, like I cried for days over that alone. Not only to me but to my dad, whom has been in her fucking life for years, and was a father figure to her when her dad was too busy hitting the bottle. (He's sober now thankfully).

It's like she's a completely different person...she didn't even call...or try to come see me, even though I was in the same area as her so it's not like she had to travel far. It hurt fucking bad. I understand addiction, I was stuck on meth with her for years and I'm still trying to kick the alcohol. I'm still so god damned angry at her and it makes me cry just thinking about it. 

After all that I completely quit talking to her or trying to contact her at all. Everyone encouraged me to get her out of my life. 

But about a month ago I finally got back in fb after deleting it for two or so years, So I could post pictures of my daughter for my extended family I don't contact much. I decided to try to get ahold of her, because I love her..she's my best friend ya know? And I just wanted to know if she was okay if anything. Now, everyone told me they hadn't seen her in ages and told me she ran off with her boyfriend(the shithead). I asked her sisters and family to contact me if they hear or see her. 

Last night around 6 pm I got a call from her dad and I didn't answer because I thought he might be butt dialing me. But he texted me telling me my friend was home and was trying to call me. Of course I said YES call me back! But I guess she fell asleep and he said he'd have her call me later. Well, I fell asleep and missed her call again (I suck I know) , but I texted her dad again and apologized for falling asleep. He said it's okay and he'd have her call me in the morning. 

Now it's almost morning, I can't sleep because honestly I'm nervous about talking to her. Like I said I'm so god damned angry and hurt by her...and I don't know what to say to her. I feel like I  should definitely not bring it up, atleast not right now, especially if she's trying to get her life together again. But then it feels like I'll never get to say anything about it because honestly it feels like it's all about how she is, and how she's doing. And I don't know how our relationship is going to be. I love her to death but honestly I'm just tired...and I dunno I'm just so hurt by someone who was supposed to be my closest friend...

How should I go about handling all of this?

Also, sorry about the long post..if anything is unclear let me know. Thanks.",26Oct2019,1

Hey everyone,

I'm the father of a 21 year old son - he is currently a college senior with nearly 4.0 cumulative GPA. He is one of the smartest students in the classroom I've ever seen - he puts in absolutely zero effort into school and outperforms everyone else. My problem is that he's been suffering from horrendous depression and blames it all on me.

All his life, he's always been an introvert. He got straight A's in high school without so much as a sweat, and always wanted to be a ""regular kid."" He had taken enough credits in prior school years to go home early and take it easy his senior year, but that was unacceptable to me. I forced him to take electives, join after-school clubs (like the indoor marching band for example), and I also forced him to take all honors courses, even though he wanted to take the ""normal"" classes. He already got accepted into college and had a 4.0 GPA, and just wanted to be a regular kid, but I thought I was doing him a favor by forcing him to do things he didn't want to do.

It turned out, me forcing him to do stuff in high school made him not want to go to college just out of resent. He eventually gave in and went to college, but that's where it got worse. When he enrolled in college, I forced him to join his school's English Literature Honors Society, because I figured it would help him meet people and expand his critical thinking skills. He told me up front he had no interest in the program, English was his least favorite subject in high school, and he absolutely begged me not to do it. He just wanted to be a ""normal kid,"" but that's honestly garbage - when opportunities like this present themselves, you accept them. So now, instead of making friends with the people at college he wanted to - the ""party people"" - he made friends with the ""artsy, nerdy - his words"" kids who don't go out to parties and he has a pretty nonexistant social life. And this ungrateful kid blames me for his mistakes, and now is depressed and doesn't want to talk to me.

Did I do something wrong? What should I have done differently? I think I did a great job as a father but I want my son to stop feeling depressed. Any and all advice helps. Thanks. -Steve",26Oct2019,1

727,"So my boyfriends best friends are also his flatmates, and it’s the weekend before exams start but it also was the England vs New Zealand rugby game which NZ lost sadly. His friends come home past midnight and start blasting dnb, which really upsets me bc I’m like borderline insomniac so it’s hard enough for me to get to sleep as it is, so my boyfriend asks them to turn it down a bit and they say “get fucked”. I understand that it’s all fun and games for them and they were also drunk but it was so bad that I had to just leave which was such an inconvenience for me bc I live across town and so ended up getting home at like 1am just so I could sleep. They said they’d turn it down in future (but they thought it wasn’t even that loud) so just looks like they really don’t give a fuck and I’m not down for that. I’m tired of faking friendships with people that actually don’t care about you. But what’s pissed me off even more is that a girl that I’m kind of acquainted with is hooking up regularly with one of his friends that sleeps right next to my boyfriend and he didn’t get to sleep until 3am bc they kept going at it, and this is two nights in a row! I’m all for it if you wanna hook up with someone but there’s no need for the obnoxiously loud/what sounds like moaning, like there’s a way to be a bit quieter if you actually give a shit about anyone else but they seem to not give a shit and it’s selfish and disgusting. I’ve already had hard enough time as it is connecting with his friends, what am I supposed to do now that this has probably made me deeply resent all of them as human beings? Thoughts?",26Oct2019,1
728,"When my ex and I broke up last year I went a bit overboard trying to get her back. 

It was an emotional breakup and she rubbed her new guy in my face and I cussed her out. 

She told mutual friends how she was afraid of me. 

I always wondered if she was and I always felt like a monster. 

I remember a month after the breakup she liked my mom’s insta post. Never really knowing my mom. Did the same with my sister. They both blocked her. 

Then a year later she came to my workplace. We are a company that offer paid surveys. She used to do them when we were dating. When we broke up I actually left that job cause I had to move out of town but now I’m back. 

So she came by my office and I asked how she was. She said she was great. She gave her survey and I told her the checkbook is at another location. She told me “I’ll just come back at another time” I called my co worker who has the checkbook in front of her and told my ex to come back in a couple of mins or just wait here for my co worker. She said “I need to go home. I’ll come back” 

So she came back. Check wasn’t there yet. So I told her and she grunted really loud. I apologized and told her if she wants to come tomorrow and she said she will around lunch time. I apologized for the inconvenience and she said “no problem” 

The next day I was at our other location but she picked up the check. 

TLDR: Any of this shows she still is afraid of me?",26Oct2019,1

730,"Hiya, to start off id like to apologise to anybody who actually reads my entire post because it will be long.
I honestly don't know where to start. I guess I'll go from thing to thing. I'm a 20 y old male, living in a very broken eastern European country. My family is quite poor but so is most families here. I've had a very rough childhood, isolated from and social interactions and traumatized by family issues. My grandpa committed suicide and left a huge debt on my mom, which she signed some clause or whatever when she was 20 to help my grandpa out, because he wanted to make it big. But everything he did failed miserably until his suicide. My mom was torn apart, and left with a whopping 700k debt, and some 100k to the mafia. I was even once almost kidnapped by those people go use as ransom but luckily my uncle was there. They also robbed us, held my dad at gun point, I've witnessed most of these events. Forward to otherside of things my school. When I say nobody was friends with me or wanted to talk to me I mean that. Throughout middle school to highschool I had one friend, that was half half there for me. Im introverted but it felt so lonely and depressing going to a class where I felt like I didn't belong. Then all the bullying, and hitting, making fun of me and Calling me weird and names. In highschool I started to cut myself and damage my body because there were times where I couldn't deal with everything anymore. Especially with my anxiety being so bad combined with very bad paranoia I developed because of trauma. Now at 20, I still have no friends, I have no goals, i have depression, anxiety, paranoia and a form of ptsd from my ex abusive girlfriend who did horrible things. From the start you need to know that, both me and that person made mistakes, and our personalities clashed so much that we didn't even know we weren't for each other.I went into the relationship looking for love, and honestly? I was at my lowest, I wanted someone to care. I basically bent knee over head, to make her happy, satisfy her and do whatever she wanted. Because I loved her so much I didn't ever want to lose her. I was introverted she was extroverted. She also has mental issues , she has very very deep anger issues. She hated that I was nice, wanted me to be more of an asshole and be strict with her. Almost like keeping her in check. But I didn't because it's not who I am.So she got more angry the nicer I was.The angrier she got the depressed I was.She started abusing me emotionally mentally and physically. That I need to get a grip and stop being such a whiny coward.In return, I became so distressed emotionally and mentally, I had break dowsn every day, I stopped eating I stopped talking.One day after a bad breakdown fo her, she hit me and said many things that hurt me, I'm talking personal stuff I confined in her. I cried and I left the house. That's when I attempted my suicide attempt. I thankfully didn't do it. So it kept going and going, fuleing each other, she destroying me purposely emotionally and mentally driving me to borderline immediate suicide attempts daily.One day she just said, I don't love you anymore, I don't want to see you, I hate you, I want you to hate me too but you're too much of a coward to do that. After that I felt worse than I've ever felt. I still harm myself when I get too bad mentally and emotionally but that's mostly because it kind of I guess drives away the emotional pain to physical so I don't have to think of it. Now to now. I'm unable to leave my country unless I get a super good job out of it and or marry someone. We're not in eu union yet so we're restricted a lot. Not to mention our country is crazed with religion. And LGBTQA is not accepted widely , you might even get killed if you mention that you're part of it. I am part of the LGBTQA but I never tell anyone and if I told my parents they would disown me. And I don't believe in God but still attend the usual religious stuff for family. I feel trapped, I feel like there is no escape for me. For a better life or anything else. I have no friends, I tried making some but I soon realize now shallow people are here. I trust people too fast and become too comfortable, and I got made fun of and even tossed away and called a poor broken man manh times. And it hurts because I start to believe they understand me, finally a friend you know? But I just kept getting more dissapointed in people.  My parents don't believe in mental health issues, they only believe something is wrong if I'm mentally disabled like the people they send to asylms. So I can't even get mental help, I never got any, and trust me I tried everything I can. So now I'm stuck here, with my issues, my mentality, my emotions, my sexuality and everything else, feels like I was bkrn in the wrong country and wrong time. All I know is I've been getting worse, really worse, Andi. Don't know how much I can handle anymore. I just want help. I want advice I want out of here. I want a new start I can't deal with anything anymore. I can't even think. Thank you for reading, If anything I got to vent. But it doesn't matter anyway",26Oct2019,1

We both explained the situation to the Ticketman and he said that my girlfriend would definitely get the ticket because this wasn’t the first time she got caught, but i could have a chance of not getting that ticket if I call the train company and explained my situation.

736,"So this started about 18 months ago. I was in a two year relationship, and got cheated on, 6 times, none of which i found out till she ended the relationship and i was told. It ruined me, i saw myself as worthless for nearly 6 months. i trusted non one, and lost quite a few close friends.

Slowly things began to get better and i regained friends and started to be myself again. Here comes person number 2, who i was in a relationship with for about a month, until she left me for one of my friends. Her words were “he’s so much better”. i lost it, and everything spiraled down hill again. i felt worse than i had done after being cheated on ^ and again, lost all self confidence, and began to think i was just not good enough for anyone.

Again this happens, and has happed a further 3 times until recently, where this person said i was amazing, and wanted a relationship, because she genuinely liked me, but had exams coming up so wanted no distractions. 

I see this as fair enough, but lo and behold, a week later she gets a boyfriend.

 I had finally felt myself again and it has gone downhill again. I keep having mini breakdowns and just start crying. I won’t self harm, or do anything worse as it won’t fix anything. I don’t really know what to do anymore, as i just keep getting worse and worse. Can anyone help, or has anyone had this happen to them. I just need some sort of idea what is so wrong with me, as i’m sick of being myself now, as i seem to never be quite good enough. I want this confidence back but i can’t seem to find it at all...

737,"My life has been filled to say the least. Was bullied growing up, didn’t have a sister connection, was very depressed all through middle and first year of high school, grandpa passed away JR year, Parents got a divorce, had to live with dad, had an emotionally abusive relationship with him after the divorce (i cleaned every inch of a 2 story house with a cast on, did heaps of laundry/dishes because my father began to drink and miss work), begged for jobs to support my sisters, fell out with mom, dad died after in January 2018, mom abandoned the kids and left us to do drugs and get lost on the streets, she spent allllll of my dads money, was given to family members that did not care for me, told me “it’s not that bad” when i had already been severely depressed, had a terrible high school relationship, had my first girl best friend Smoked a ton n did some drugs, got kicked out of grandparents, all keeping in mind my fathers family ignored helping me out after i confided in them about how terrible it was to live there, got kicked out on my 18th birthday, lived with my boyfriend for 6 months( loved it, love his family) however... boyfriend cheated on me sexually, forgave and moved on, got into an argument one day over it and i was being kicked out but i had zero family or any friends that could take me in, tried to commit and he told his mother who in turn told my fathers family after i begged them to come get me, making a huge deal while packing the car because I’m over emotional and wanted someone to be on my team.. ended up pissing off my aunt and grandma and they began to tell my uncle and my uncle got in my face and told me to ‘shut the fuck up and move my shit’.. i ran away after that.. i didn’t want to  be alive.. after that i had to be persuaded to come back because they were threatening more cops, dogs even a helicopter and i figured i was going to the loony bin... and i was right. That same night they drove me to their church(I’m not very religious i just feel invaded when they try to act like they’ve already ‘known me through Jesus, just makes me pissed off but i don’t judge them for it)  which I’ve repeatedly told i would be comfortable if we went the next day or if i just got to go sleep tonight.. they refused to listen to me and stood there with their pastor trying to get me to go inside, called the cops, the cops tackled me and took me to a 2 STAR MENTAL HOSPITAL. The next day i woke up and it was my grandpas death anniversary and they went out for breakfast.. i plotted my way to get out of there all the while my family never once checked up on me.. i called friends even called the same ex just so i could eventually reach my boyfriend because i suck at numbers..by 3pm i was out and 15 minutes later my boyfriend was reviving texts saying how serious it was that he did that even though they didn’t even know where i was being taken the night before.. i had zero contact info from them either which they’re supposed to fill out.. they had all of my things so i had to take my boyfriend and 2 friends to get all of my shit back including my damn debit card and phone that i was without for almost a week.. moved to College with boyfriend because i had no other plans or goals for my future i definitely didn’t think i was even going to make it to see my 18th birthday, attending school, has a job, been arguing for about a month with boyfriend and just was feeling overall so empty and lost. I would be stuck in a daydream loop all day sometimes it didn’t feel real to exists, then fucked up completely and emotionally cheated on boyfriend by texting  my ex again. I regret it so so much i felt every inch of my body curl up and my anxiety was awful. I wanted to tell my partner immediately.. i knew i didn’t feel anyway toward him but i felt a pull towards asking him questions about my relationship and how he was doing but more i wanted to yell at him and give him a piece of my mind for all the shit that went down between us, it wasn’t my fault we broke up and even during my morning my father he was tricking me and asking me for sexual favors and i was tricked into thinking i was cared for.. is it wrong to say i just wanted emotional attention.. my boyfriend always says he’s there but it felt like every time i tried to talk to him he was already shutting me down before i got to it... i suffer from severe anxiety and depression and i self sabotage myself everyday. I feel so empty. I feel so lost.. i feel terrible and disgusting, i just feel nothing. I’ve been self diagnosing myself for months and I’m reaching to my point where i think i need to get some actual help.. i just don’t want to feel so alone and that’s all that swallows me anymore.

738,"Hi Everyone

So I recently found out that I will be losing my career with the military due to a health condition that I have. The funny thing is that while they have been able to confirm that my health issues are real they have no idea what the cause of them is. But either way, being told that because my body is weakening for reasons they cannot fully explain the decision has been made to release me from service. Thus ten years of dedication is now over with and while I know that I will be able to take care of myself financially after my time in is done my concern is that I do not want to get out at all to begin with. 

I have no desire whatsoever to be a civilian again. The military has its setbacks no doubt and there are times where I am just as dumb founded as the next guy as to why things get as dumb as they do but if anything my experience both in and out of the military in the past has taught me is that at least in the military there is a level of dependability on the men to the left and right of you cause at the end of the day you dont want them to let you die when you are overseas. That doesn't exist in the civilian world.

What will happen is this, I will be released back into the world with a failing body that will most likely continue to get worse, PTSD/Anxiety/Depression, and count them ZERO friends to have for any kind of support. Oh family you may ask? Yeah i have one family member i take care of who I receive no help with from the entire rest of my family whatsoever. My personality is rough at best, I am soft spoken to a fault (and when i do raise my octave so that people can hear me they then accuse me of scolding them... no, my tone never changes only the volume so that is how i normally sound... harsh i guess) anyway me making friends is difficult, relationships are difficult, working with others who do not have an understanding of military personalities is difficult. But I already know the answers that people most often give;

\- Well you just need to learn to adapt to your new environment

\- You can't be upset with people over not understanding

\- Why dont you try to get your family to help you

\- You'll make friends eventually

\- You just have to find the right woman for you

\- etc etc

All the answers come back to me having to adjust for all of those who will be around me. It is always me having to adjust for others, every instance in my life has been me figuring things out so i can either support other people or make sure I am not rough around the edges for others. I never had that in the military, we all just took care of each other (yeah there were those who were individuals but they got sorted out quick).

Now in the next few months, i will have a permanent paycheck (supposedly) but I wont be able to do alot of the things i used to, i wont have my friends close by like i have had, and i will be back to being alone and the weight of supporting others thrust upon me with no sort of outlet to find. I will be alone and I am dreading that. I would rather be back in Afghanistan on patrol or running missions daily for the rest of my life then go back to feeling alone.

Any attempt to reach out for help will only be answered by those who get paid to listen or help me, and anyone i actually look to for comfort or a shoulder to lean on will quickly get uncomfortable and remind me that I volunteered to be in the military and experience those things or just tell me to man up and deal with. 

I really wish that I had someone I could have in my life to really help me and make me feel comfortable and safe for once, because I have no one there who makes me feel like everything will be okay, but I am expected to do just that for other people.

What should i do?",26Oct2019,2

I just want to know if what I said was weird. We are only friends and I feel like I might have messed that up what do you think?,26Oct2019,1
741,"   Hello there! So I have this idea of what I want to do. I already tutor kids after school with the National Honor Society, but I’m looking to start my own online “business” of advising parents and kids on how to make the most of high school and how to go to college debt free. This will happen next year after I’m already settled into university and have all of my scholarships sorted. 

   I won’t say too much, but I’m 17 and have had a very successful high school career. I’m on my way to a very prestigious school that shall not be named with enough scholarships to cover the cost and will graduate debt free. I really want to help other kids and parents achieve the same thing. I know how the system works and how to work around and with it. My mother used to work for college admissions and has helped me with figuring out which classes to take, apply for scholarships, and how to get noticed by colleges; she’s taught me all I know. I like helping people (probably why I’m going into the medical field, lol) and I want to offer my services for as cheap as possible. Currently I also do SAT tutoring for $10 an hour to students after school. 

   It’s absolutely insane that the cost of SAT tutoring is in the thousands! It’s entirely inflated when there’s so many free online resources that you can use! There’s so much that people generally don’t know and I want to make that information as public as possible to prevent people from going into debt! What I currently do is organize lesson plans and help students learn how to take and score high on the test. I want to give myself about another year before I officially launch anything because I want to find ways to improve my teaching technique and further educate myself on how to most effectively teach students and parents. Maybe I’ll start a podcast as well? 

   I don’t have any idea where to start to make my idea a reality, think you guys could help me out?

Btw I’m in Florida if that’s relevant.",26Oct2019,2

751,"I just now got back inside and washed my hands, because I had to pry a fire alarm out of a dumpster. My question is am I trashy for, (in my minute of anger) stomping it out and tossing it back in?

I ask this simply because of the ‘stomping’ portion. I saw no other way of disabling it and the battery was stuck inside. I live in a complex and our neighbors were all coming out to investigate, but somehow never found the alarm and I didn’t want people freaking out over thinking there was a possible fire. 

My stepmom brought it to my attention, when she started to hear the alarm in the distance, but couldn’t tell where it was coming from. Our one neighbor wasn’t home, and our other next door neighbors only speak Portuguese. We listened for awhile, before going back inside, but I could hear the alarm still, so I went out to investigate further, and it’s a fire alarm going off in the dumpster. I don’t know why it was there or how it was still working, because it’s been raining all day here, so I grabbed a stick, fished it out, and then stomped on it. It obviously stopped working and I went inside.

She's not one to take any kind of action usually, and her plan is to talk to her superior after the night shift, when they'd both be dead tired and not in the mindset for deep discussion. 

Is there any legal course of action against breaking leave? She has the email confirming that they granted the leave and everything.

Also I can confirm this wasn’t my hair because my hair is dyed  mostly blonde and I would find thick dark hairs .

760,"This is a long &amp; complicated story that I’ll try my best to make brief &amp; clear. My parents have been seperated since I was very young. Almost 10 years ago, I cut off contact with my father because he and my step mother (who he was seeing long before my parents split up) treated me very poorly. When I was with them I was verbally abused constantly &amp; they would say horrible things about my mother &amp; other family in front of me. Basically I had finally had enough, but because my half siblings were so young &amp; my grandmother’s extremely close relationship with my dad, I lost contact with basically everyone on my father’s side of the family, with the exception of the people he himself had cut off. 
Today, I was at a family party &amp; saw my uncle for the first time in 10 years (father’s brother). We didn’t go in depth about the situation but he did pull my girlfriend aside &amp; explain that many people I lost contact with miss me &amp; want to see me. I’m torn because I miss some of them, but none of them have made any effort to reach out to me in 10 years, even my own grandmother. The way it sounded it seems like they have more love for me in absence then when I was there. 
I understand we’re all adults now and things could have changed but I’m skeptical about reconnecting. I feel like I could me setting myself up for disappointment. Just looking for guidance.",26Oct2019,1
761,"The title sums up my problem pretty well.

So growing up I was pretty much traumatized by my three sisters, one older two younger, they bullied and harassed me for most of my childhood  (I'm 20 now.) Always telling me to go back to my room, never playing games etc. So I grew up fearing them, they never beat me but the verbal harassment really got to me, I stayed in my room whenever I would come home from school and I never brought friends over from fear my sister's bullying them too. My dad died when I was 6 so I never really had a father figure to help and my mom was to busy with work to really notice anything strange about it.

But now whenever a girl talks or texts me my heart starts pounding at an abnormally high rate and it's really starting to freak me out, I have friends who are girls and that's fine but the moment a girl I don't know all that well tries to talk to me, my mind goes blank and I freak out inside, so for people that have gone through something along these lines how do you deal with it?

Ill give you a bit of my background. I come from a poor household with lots of violence early on. Since elementary school I've been bullied and called am idiot until i graduated highschool. I failed every thing and barely graduated highschool so i cant get into any courses. I got into business in a low end school and got booted after a month from failing too many tests and quizzes.

During my 20s my ptsd from being bullied and laughed at i have no confidence with studying, getting girls or anything. In my mid 20s i finally got my insurance license to change my life. The pay is horrible and the job is tedious so i keep making stupid mistakes. 

Now im close to 30 married and barely living paycheque to paycheque recently diagnosed with bipolar and im feeling really down since all of my old friends who dont talk to me anymore became doctors and lawyers. I feel ashamed of myself ive been a leech to my  old parents and my wife is so supportive i dont deserve her i feel so ashamed i can't provide for my family im just a burden. 

I got one job that pays well but im too scared to do it after reading every statistic about it. Correctional officer. 

Should i bite the bullet and accept my fate that this is what i deserve to he harassed attacked and bullied by inmates or is there any career i can get. I just want my family proud of me so i can support them.  Does anyone have any ideas for an uneducated person like me to find a good carrer.

768,"I know I'm a total dumbass when its about relationships, and I'm sorry.

So I've (21m) been friends with this girl (18f) for about 8 months, since we met in college. We've been great friends so far, talking every day at least a little. 

Last week we went out with some other common friends and she was really touchy with me, holding my arm, putting her hands over mine when sitting down, etc. We've always been kind of touchy, so I didn't give it much thought and simply enjoyed the night out with them. The thing is, some other friends noticed that and began telling me that she's super into me and that I should make a move. She was not nearby, but she wasn't out of earsight (we were a bit drunk so they were kind of shouting), so I'm sure she heard us. After that, I was with her waiting for her ride home and she seemed pissed, not talking to me, looking at her phone and when I asked her what happened she said that nothing happened.

Since then she stopped talking to me. Not like she cut all relations, but she was much more distant all of a sudden. When I tried talking to her, she gave short and dry responses, and when we are together (on a circle of friends) she sits next to me but doesn't talk to me at all. I've caught her looking at me when I'm not looking twice, but she always look away when I notice. I dont know why she's acting like that, but I have two ideias: she's either embarrassed by having other people trying to ship us, and is distancing from me to dispel this notion, or she likes me and is disappointed/annoyed because I didn't do anything that day.

I asked her what's happening privately (on whatsapp) and  she said there's nothing going on. The answer really was ambiguous: ""There's nothing happening. I think that is the problem: nothing's happening."" I don't know what to make of it, maybe I'm overthinking.

I really like her and don't want to lose her friendship, but I don't know what to do. I want to ask her what's the problem so we can work it up, but since I already asked her what's happening once (without success), I fear I will be too clingy if I try to talk to her about it again. On the other hand, if I simply let her be, I'm afraid we will stop talking entirely. What should I do?

774,"My parents got divorced when I was I around 4 years old. I don’t have any memories of before they got divorced, but I know the night they called it off, my dad hit my mom. Since then, me and my brother (Joe) have lived with my mom and visited during school breaks with my other brother (Jacob) living with him. I’m not 18 and my dad has been emotionally and physically abusive to my brother and I. He hasn’t hit us in a few years (which he takes as progress). He still yells at us and bad mouths my mom constantly, telling us that she abused him despite my mom saying the inverse. I can’t get shit from my brother to know who is telling the truth so that’s a lost cause on finding out who’s telling the truth. Point is, my dad has hit us for stupid reasons, yelled at me for telling my friend I was gay, shamed us all for our interests and our problems, and acts like he’s a hero. One night, he was shoving my brother around and yelling at him, and my brother punched him in the face breaking his nose. My dad still acts like he’s saint motherfucking Theresa for not calling the cops. My brother had begged my mom to let him come back to Florida for years but she wouldn’t because she couldn’t handle his issues (he had a lot of undiagnosed mental issue which he has since gotten much better, that cause him to but heads with everyone and throw tantrums constantly). CThe final piece of backstory is that he got remarried and treats my step mother awfully. In public, after she asked a lot of questions, he said “One day someone is going to punch you in the face and you are going to wonder where it came from”. 

Coming up on two years ago, I visited him for two weeks. My mom was starting a new job that would cause her to be home only on the weekends. Everyone was worried about me because they didn’t want me home alone. After the visit, it seemed like he had changed and was nice. So we all decided I would move there with him since I apparently can’t be home alone (I was 16 at the time). To make a long ass story short, he did not change. Though he didn’t hit us, he would yell and get angry over to stupidest thing. It got to the point where just hearing someone walking up the steps would make me get so much anxiety. Any issue I discussed with my therapist, (which my dad hired because “my mom had really neglected me” despite her being the only person who actually cared about me besides Joe and did her very best to make sure I was taking care of me) he would brush off as “Oh, that’s cause of his mom”. I even told him the reason I don’t like talking about my problems is because he would yell at me that “Nobody has time to deal with your bullshit” and blamed me for holding on to that. This reached its pinnacle on Thanksgiving when our extended family was coming over. He yelled at everyone so much that me and my brother had to walk out because we were scared. We came back crying and he told us “Either help and stop sniveling, or fuck off somewhere”. We left again and my mom got us a hotel where we could stay the night (Her job got her a ton of points with Marriott). That night, we talked with my dad over the phone where he told me that if I came back, we could go to therapy and try and work this out, yet my brother had to beg just to be even considered allowed to come back. I decided I was done and we all went back to Florida with my mom. I had nightmares for months about being trapped there. Since then, he has ignored my brother for weeks, didn’t acknowledge he had any fault in the whole episode, and thought we were still coming back. Fast forward to now (I was with him for a year), he had given me money and bought me gifts, yet never apologized. In the whole time we have known him, my brother can only think of two times he actually apologized, both times were quickly repeated. It’s getting to the point where I don’t even feel like angry about Thanksgiving, it’s just the fact he doesn’t acknowledge it and apologize. I have never felt such rancor another human being. I find him detestable, manipulative, and the most selfish person I have ever known. I don’t know how to get over this, and I don’t know if I should even forgive him. I blocked him and I haven’t talked to him for over a year and everyone still talks to him like normal, which pisses me off even more. He keeps buying me gifts and it’s getting to the point where I want to keep him blocked just so he knows that somebody won’t tolerate this anymore. I wanted to reject a gift but my family said that was impolite and I’m not being the better man. I apologize if I’m overreacting, I know people in this sub probably have much worse stories about their parents, I just don’t know what else to do.

780,"I know most of you will just stop reading the moment I'm say me and my girlfriend are 16, but to those who won't, I honestly thank you.

We are in a relationship for 5 months so far, we are both each other's first relationship, and it went without a single argument, fight etc. even when we had opposing mindsets on some stuff, we would always talk it through without any passive-aggressiveness and so. She goes to a really demanding high school (special IT class for students who excel at physics and math) ((also we don't go to the same school)) so apart from her school she doesn't have much time. We are usually together on Saturday where we spend 3-4 hours together, and on Tuesday for an hour because that's about when our time schedules meet. It is worth noting that we are on different schedules so when my school ends her starts and vice versa. This summer she was vacationing a lot with her family but whenever she was here she would spend that time with me.

However, her tight schedule wasn't really ever a problem for me. I didn't want for her education to be at loss so she could spend time with me, and I never forced her anything. Generally when I met her she was really shy but opened up afterwards. In her class of about 25, most are guys (well it is IT) and almost half of them are girls. According to her, they are all like one big friend group and on Sundays (when she isn't with me) she often does something with her class. Which is okay by me but, she spends the entire week with them during work days while she only sees me that one weekend and on Tuesday for a short time. 

I never felt intimidated in any way that she goes to a class with most guys, not to be pretentious or bragging, it's just that generally (by the opinions of people who met me) I am a sociable, positive and entertaining person with quite a few friends and no people who dislike me, because I never gave anyone a reason to. I do believe in my honest opinion that is humble that I look good, not really smoking hot but on the handsome side of the spectrum, like a 7/10. I'd even go to the extent to call myself popular at my school - maybe a clown, but popular. I also like training. Most guys in her class for what I've seen of it are geeky shut-ins with big glasses, bad acne and no social skills. Now please **do not think I am saying this just because I want to talk of myself high or put someone down**, it's just I want to prove that I don't believe I am being in some sort of a competition with anyone. 

***Where the problem lies***, is that for me, who goes to an all-male school (it is a school specified for electrical engineering where most girls don't enroll, I'm not from the US by the way), and where most guys are cool and all but not people I'm close to, and a relatively boring life, she is the only thing that makes me happy and content with the position I am in. If you asked me how am I feeling - great, and everything is perfect just for the sole reason I have her. The Saturday we spend together, even a little chat we share on our breaks in Tuesday, is what keeps me happy for the past 5 months, to which before I really felt unhappy with my life and that it needed a change. **For me, she is not only my girlfriend but my best friend and only person I believe I can honestly lean on, while it is not the other way around.**

It's just that I feel like her friends are playing a much bigger role in her life than I am. She never did anything to make me feel this way, but the way all of them are so close and plan everything together and whenever she opens her phone next to me she has chats opened with a few guys from her class (she says it's usually just planning to do stuff with the entire class and I believe her). She sees them 5 days a week, they work and spend their breaks together, and yet for weekends, she spends one day with me and with her class equally. And she responds to my messages during the week very late, but when she is with me, she instantly responds to her school friends.

***Now please don't think I am being possessive and want her to cut off friends she sees every day just because of me***, it's just breaking my heart, really making me sad that someone that's so important in my life and that I literally feel could die for doesn't have the same passion for me, nor I am important to her to the extent she is to me. ***I feel like I'm not enough.*** Like she could do without me. It literally makes me want to cry and sorry for being a p\*ssy but I just can't comprehend the feeling of someone you like so much, and who likes you too, but not to the amount you love her. The love is returned in this case - but not to the needed extent.

I don't want to talk to her about this because she never gave me a reason to feel like this if it wasn't for my overthinking. I just feel really, really bummed down. Like I would give her the entire world if I could but for her I am just a boyfriend, even though she claims I'm also her everything, I don't feel it.

&amp;#x200B;

***The positive side to all this is,*** that she wants me to meet her family, and some of her closest friends. It makes me feel important. She also says she believes in first love to be eternal and that she thinks we are something bigger than just a high school relationship, that she dreams of a life with me. But what's it worth for if her friends are always gonna be more important for her?

***Please don't think that I'm being possessive, I would NEVER do anything that she wouldn't want, I just feel bad about all of this.***",26Oct2019,1

782,"English is not my first language, sorry!

My sister is really into a game (which name I will not mention, but that is very popular) and some months ago she became online friends with an older guy through it. I didn't think much of it at first, they would talk about normal stuff such as cultural differences and their lives. She would tell me some of the things he said to her and all seem normal, where he worked, anecdotes of his teenage years, etc. However, they started talking more and more to the point where if he didn't text her back she would get somehow upset. (Actually, I know this because one day when she seemed cranky I first thought that she had had a fight with her boyfriend, when I ask her, she told me that she felt conflicted because she was upset that the guy hadn't responded, I didn't know what to think about it so I brushed it off). She also said that she wanted to visit his county and stay at his house, this comment made me upset because she barely knew him at the time. She acted like I was exaggerating. She later said the same to her boyfriend and he obviously got upset, but like me, he also brushed it off. 

 The past week she started behaving weirdly. She didn't want me in the same room at times, although that is kinda normal. She likes to talk to her boyfriend and I understand that she wants privacy. We share a room, I get it. But I don't know this time it felt weird, I attributed it to me being on my period and feeling more sensitive than normal. She also would talk through the phone very late at night (this is very abnormal for her).

Today, while she was showing me something on her phone, a message pop up on the screen, because she is already very protective of her messages and because I want to respect her privacy, I made my best to not look at it while it disappeared, however, she took the phone immediately and dismissed it. That was super weird for her. I read two things, tho. His name and the word love. WTF? Maybe it was just me and I actually combined a message of her boyfriend and the guy in my head, right? So the next time I got an opportunity, I read her messages on the notification screen.  NOPE. He definitely said that among some other lewd stuff. But, I didn't read the whole messages just what I could from the notification so... I am not even sure?

Now I am very conflicted. I don't know what to do or if I should do something at all. Should I confront her? Should I ignore it? Is it not of my business, right? But for some reason, it makes me really upset. Maybe it has to do with the fact that she kinda pushed me to show her my own messages with a friend some days ago? Am I doing it out of spite? Or it is because I now that she actually really loves her boyfriend and she would be devastated if they broke up? He has done similar things in the past, but she forgave him. They have been together for almost five years. I haven't even had a boyfriend myself, why should I intervene in her relationship, right? What I do know? So... do you have any advice?",26Oct2019,2
784,"So this is kind of a long story so I’ll try to keep it short. My sister is currently getting bullied at school and as you can probably guess, I’m the big sister. The one supposed to protect and stick up for her. So I’ll start from the beginning, these girls about 7 of them started picking on her, but it isn’t just the normal teasing. Probably something that any of you may have been through, 13/14 year old girls blocking her in the hallways when she’s alone, making up rumours about her, posting on their snapchat stories to make it seem like she’s the bad person. Telling her friends to stop hanging around with her otherwise they would stop liking them. All of this sounds pathetic right ? But in her case these people who she called ‘friends’ were too weak and decided to walk away from her. While all of this is going on her confidence is getting Lower. She starts skipping lessons and then whole school days. I find her crying in her room when I get back from work in the middle of the night when everyone else is asleep. She says she feels alone and that there’s no one there for her. My mum makes her go into school as it’s important for her exams that are soon. She goes in one day, meets with the only friend she has left (I’m being completely serious) the only one. And they all surround her in the canteen, not just the 7 girls but a big boy group in her year and also others. There’s about 25 of them now. They start shouting in her face telling her to leave school, that she’s irrelevant, that nobody likes her. Fast forward a couple months, a rountine of the same abuse. And she’s finally been accepted to leave school and love to another. Now that’s where I come in, throughout this whole thing I tried to speak to these girls but every time got broken up by a teacher. And I risk losing my place in sixth form by doing this. Which honestly I couldn’t care one bit about. But the thing is I’m scared of confrontation, I don’t show it but I get all nervous and I never know what to say. They’re younger and I know I shouldn’t be scared but I can’t describe these girls like they’re just so disgusting and rude. They have no respect for anyone and their selves. They have the nerve to be staring at me wherever I go and I want to say something, but I don’t know what to do or say. But more then that, what’s going to put an end to it or make them scared. Because shes left school and they’re still messaging her. I just don’t get it. This kind of thing kills people? Do they not understand that. Anyway I just wanted to ask what I should say or do, because something needs to be done as all her school has done before she left is say they can’t guarantee her safety. Please help!",26Oct2019,1
785,"Okay, I've been trying to make new friends for like two years. And I am also interested in dating other girls (I'm a girl) but that's secondary to friendship.  


It's mean to make plans with someone and then just start ignoring their messages right? I'm not crazy to think if someone made plans with me they should reply, especially when I didn't bombard them with messages. I said a couple friendly chatty things, they didn't reply, and then a few days later I asked if the plans are still on. They're not ghosting either, they kept me added online, just... is it that they want me to be sad about them? Like an attention-hungry person? When I choose to ignore someone because I'm not interested even as a friend and they're texting too much, I at least block and delete them and I don't make plans with them. Come on, that's common sense. But I did not text too much at all. I just asked if we're still going to meet.

I shared my location with my friends but I’ve known him for a few months so I felt safe. I am scared to tell my mother that I went on a Tinder then was raped. I don’t know how to. I’m scared and stressed.

792,"Hello, I am  in grade 11 now and I have been bullied in school his whole life, last year it got to a point where I had a knife pulled on me and I was being harassed online etc... that i switched schools. I also happen to have adhd and be gifted. I am never ever happy and I wants to turn his life around My parents are my biggest supporters and always help me but I am just not sure how to be happy.  All I do in life is play video games and my marks used to be good. But they are starting to do very poorly. I want to just have a good future for myself and be happy. I am unsure of how to motivate myself in order to focus on school. I have gone cold turkey on the video games for now and I am unsure what to do. I also have a lot of trouble talking to people in school because of all of the bullying i am always worried to approach others. I have come a long way but I am concerned I am ruining my whole future because I am unhappy and because of my grades. I do not know what to do at this point. I want to have a good future and get my grades up. But at this point i am ""all talk"" and am unsure how to actually do it. I have gone cold turkey on video games but my life is just boring and i dont remember the last time i was not stressed. I really just want ot be normal almost and do well in school and be happy. My parents and doctors have done everything for me but at this point its really on me. I have never actually had to try in school until now and I dont know what to do I am panicking and am worried for what tis will do to my future.

793,"So, I've had a crush on this girl from my school, we've known each other for a couple of months now and we became really good friends almost immediately, and I realized that I really like her after a short while. We started flirting and teasing each other when I started to like her, so I started to think that she liked me back, and when she asked me to go with her and some of our friends from school to this party that costs money, I was first a little skeptical about paying 20€ but she just kept on telling me that I should go, so I thought that she was asking me out. She wasn't. The whole party she hung out with our friend that I'll call A. She and A just hugged each other for like 10 minutes straight in front of me, and when we wanted to take a picture with our friend group, she kissed him on the cheek.

I couldn't handle that so I immediately left the party and went home just heartbroken since I wanted to tell her that I liked her that night. But, after talking to both of them (but tip-toeing so I didn't reveal that I liked her or anything) I understood that she was just drunk and didn't really like him in that way, and A had the same feeling. So I thought that there was still a chance that she liked me. But that was shortlived. The next day, she sends a snap of a pic with her and two guys, and she asked which one of them she ""should try to get to know better and maybe get together with since I kinda like them both""

Well shit. I got super friend-zoned without even telling her I like her or anything. After talking to many of my close friends they're a bit split on what I should do, one side thinks I should wait until I'm sure that she likes me and not someone else, so I don't ruin our friendship, meanwhile, the other side thinks that I should ask her out and tell her I like her until it's too late and she starts dating someone else.

I have no idea what to do, I really, really like her as a person and a friend and I don't want to ruin that, but she's perfect for me, and I want to spend more time with her. So please help me, should I risk our friendship or risk never being 100% happy?",26Oct2019,2
794,"The other day my girlfriend told me that she rubbed off one of her teachers back in 8th grade and I don’t know what to do. We have known each other since the beginning of middle school, but didn’t start dating until last year. She says she forgot about these experiences but I don’t know how. She did it 3 times. It was all consensual, and it sounds like she was the one who initiated it. It’s been really bothering me. Bad. It hurts even more bc she was able to do something she couldn’t do with me (I’m trans). When we had sex last night, she said his name multiple times on purpose to piss me off (she likes kinky shit). It made me more sad that angry. She said she doesn’t regret it at all and it doesn’t bother her, so it shouldn’t bother me. Going to the cops isn’t an answer. That won’t help the situation, just make it worse. I can’t help but what to think (trigger warning) about hurting myself. I want to get rid of this but I can’t. What should I do?

TLDR: my gf told me gave a handjob to her teacher 3 times in 8th grade and I don’t know how to handle not feeling like shit since she told me. Going to the cops isn’t an option.",26Oct2019,0

work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’ and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Juts before this they asked how old I am and I said I’m 29 and they both reacted nicely saying ‘awwwwww are yer?!’ Loudly, Meaning I look younger coz I do get told I do a lot. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.",26Oct2019,0

799,"Hi everyone I'm an 18 year old male and I'm currently living in a very toxic environment. To scratch the surface of how my mom is she belittles me for cutting myself saying things like ""why don't you cut yourself more"" and ""only babies cut themselves, a psychiatrist will say the same thing"" that sort of stuff and tells me how useless/worthless I am as well as how I'm selfish, entitled, and disrespectful (there's plenty more but those are her favorites). That sort of jazz, I also am depressed and have suicidal tendencies to which she downplays as me asking for attention. All of this has been going on for about six years now. 

The issue I need advice with is my mom has threatened before that if I go and tell my family that I'm depressed (or anything of her in a negative light) she'll ""expose"" me to the rest of my family and make them lose all respect me. I know this is not normal but now after she threatened to kick me out I'm going to go through with what she said and just flat out leave. However she says that if I go to a family/friends house she'll again expose me to the rest of my family and call the cops on me. I don't think the police can do anything as I'm 18 (I live in Pennsylvania). My best friend has offered me to stay at her place for as a crutch to help me out and my mom wouldn't know where I'd be. Should I pursue this? I can't stay here as I know I'm going to attempt suicide. I just don't really know what to do, I'll be able to get a job and all that but I'm just scared about making my own choices as I struggle with having no sense of self and having no self esteem. I apologize for the long post I just really need some advice.",26Oct2019,1
