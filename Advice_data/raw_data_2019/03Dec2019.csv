Okay so me and my gf have been together
 2 years we meet through colllege and are both 19 and throughout all of our relationship we have spoken about how we want to get married and have a future but for the last 3 weeks she has been really distant with me not wanting me to show any affection toward her finding me more anoyying saying things like fuck off when I try to talk to her or don’t touch me when I go to put my arm round her give her a kiss or hug her and we haven’t had sex for 3 weeks and I finally asked her what’s wrong and she said she doesn’t know if she wants to be with me anymore she still loves me lots but feels like she has put grown me in someways and is still trying to figure out what she wants for her future and does not know if we will break up or still be together there was a lot of crying from both ends 

I don’t know what to do she’s my everything and I’m really scared I have been a bit to attached like I love texting her all the time but she doesent and I panic when she reads my messages and dosent reply or dosent reply for hours but I know now it’s not because she hates me or is sick of me she just dosent like texting all the time I just need some advice as I’m really scared and worried thank you",03Dec2019,1
2,"I literally never post on here but I figure it’s the best for advice. So, I’m 19 and I met this guy on Tinder. Things actually went really well and we started dating almost a month ago. His profile had said he was 18, but I was really questioning it at the beginning. I decided to not press about it and give him the benefit of the doubt until he slipped up on our last date and had said the year he was born.. 2002. So the bitch is 17. I have some people around me saying it shouldn’t matter, but the fact is he lied about it. Which is annoying and immature and something a 17 year old would do. I unfortunately do really like him though. We were in an actual relationship and it made me really sad when I ended things. We live in CA so as far as I know there’s this Romeo and Juliet law or something like that where basically minors can date people three years older so it’s not illegal or anything. But like I don’t really know how I feel about dating a 17 year old. But I also really like him. What would you do?",03Dec2019,1

4,"Hello everyone,   


I'm having a difficult time expressing my thoughts and knowledge with words when i'm talking to people or even myself. Everytime I try to explain something I often misdescribe that thing and dont get my point across. Is there any way I can start learning better vocally express myself. That is only in vocal form. I consider my writing skills to be sufficient (which is why I find this to be really weird. Why can I write better than I can speak?)  
What I currently do is try to read outloud and get used to word pronunciation in English.  
Is there anything else I can try to improve myself?",03Dec2019,1
5,"Ok, i work in a company freelance! I am a research analyst and i write my findings from multiple researchers and how some of them connect to each other - sometimes i simplify them, but not to the point that the meaning is altered. 
My supervisor is actually a proofreader, and she doesn’t bother looking up the facts. so she returns my reports for factual mistakes according to her beliefs. The points she makes are so stupid, i wonder how she still works there. For example, i was writing about the magnetosphere and ionosphere that protects the earth from possible solar flares (if they reach so close) she returned my report by only having read 1/3 of it; telling me that the ozone layer protects the earth from harmful radiation because “she just googled it” and not the magnetosphere! (As if that is what i said).
I was also writing about pesticides that were invented in WWll that killed cockroaches and the effects it had on other animals. She returned my report with the excuse ( how could they even invent pesticides! People had no money to fund such a project, review your facts)! I am not even joking. every time i get back to her, I write an 800 word document to explain to her as if she is an 8 year old, how things happened and work! The reason it bothers me is because as i work freelance, i waste at least 3 hours going back and forth with her explaining her stuff i shouldn’t have to. So i lose around $60 - 80 for that alone when i could be working.",03Dec2019,1
6,So I’m an engineering student at a very well known university and I’m honestly just now recognizing what my bad habits are. As of now I’m averaging C’s and D’s in all my courses when I never made less than a A in HS. I’m looking back on the semester and I’ve figured out the problem: I’m a perfectionist who can’t handle not living up to standards. It all started with my first few failed exams. I studied long hours and got tutoring and still can’t pass an exams. This has been consistent throughout the semester and I’ll probably barely have a 2.0 gpa for this round. It sucks. You know what sucks worse tho. Having your parents pay over 5 grand to help you on the hopes that you will do everything your suppose to do and get everything right. Every time I’m taking a test I think about it. Every time I don’t know an answer I think about it. Every time I get my C and D scores  back I think about it. I have a 2 year old sister and a sister just starting HS and the last thing I want them to worry about is me but I just keep failing over and over and over. It’s taking a toll on my mental health and I’m seriously thinking about dropping all contact and running away. My parents are not rich so I know that 5 grand hurts their pocket and now their going to have to find out it’s gone to waste. At this point I would rather have student loans. I’ll only have to maintain a 2.0 gpa and my parents won’t have to worry about my end financially. When I fail it would all be on me and not them too. It would take less stress off of all of us but they are really stressing not taking any. Any advice?,03Dec2019,1

8,"Okay, so backstory:

My parents got divorced when I was 8, no problem, they weren't right for each other. My mom started dating my stepdad. Now, I say stepdad though they aren't married. He's been living with us for a few months now.

He says I need to do chores to earn what I want. I'd much rather have a job, but I'm not old enough. He takes my phone when he sees fit.

I don't think it's right, 1) he's not my parent or family and my mom didn't say it was okay, and 2) they're not even married.

He's controlling. He likes to have control over everything and everyone. I'm not the only one who thinks this. I've been told by multiple relatives to me or him.

I don't know whether I'm in the wrong for thinking it's not okay or if I'm not I don't know what to do. 

TIA, will be reading all comments. I will post edits if anything changes or you ask for more backstory.",03Dec2019,1

10,"Hi.
I'm 23yrs old and I'm having thoughts of switching my career from apprentice Electricatrian (1yr now) to be an EMT with the pursuit in mind of being a paramedic.
I've worked my trade (electrical) for a year and it has been murder on my knees and back. I'm not one to shy away from labor intensive jobs but after 4 years in the army, my body aches abit more then it use to. Especially in electrical where most of my days on the  construction site are usually 5-6 hrs of my day on my knees installing outlets.
A friend of mine has worked a few months as an emt, and has said he really enjoys it but most of his days are driving and learning about care with alot of opportunity for those who want to branch into nursing or firefighting or paramedic. As well the job wont be as intense on my body but in the long run a paramedic will make 1/2 as much as a seasoned journeyman electrician. 
I'm afraid of making the wrong choice I tend to ponder the options for too long and think the grass is always greener then dont do anything. And if I really think about it the one thing I really would want to be doing with my life is helping people.
Finally the city I live in doing the electrical trade is hrs away from friends and family. The emt route is much closer to home, I would feel like I'm lieing if I didnt include that as a factor.
What's your opinion? Just really want some life advice or guidance.
Thank you.",03Dec2019,1

13,"I mean, i might be clingy. But anyways here’s my story. We have been dating for a year and one month now. He’s in college and i’m still in high school. He also has a job so he doesn’t see me often. he at least sees me once every week. But today kinda pissed me off. He made plans originally with his best friend and I was okay with that. However he didn’t tell me that those plans fell through and instead made plans with someone else even though he knows I’ve asked to see him. He becomes really distant when i’m not with him, he doesn’t talk as much. I might text him small things like “I miss you” or “i cant wait to see you again.” And he never says anything like that to me. I’ve talked about it with him before but like he told me it was because he’s busy. (Too busy to send one small text to make me feel a little appreciated? Even though I make sure I text him even in school.) Even if I hang out with him I have to constantly ask him to get off his phone and he never listens. He had a problem with my phone usage in the past but i don’t get on my phone when i’m with him now at all. I feel like I’m getting the cold shoulder and it’s moments like these that make me question if he still has feelings for me. I feel like i’m drifting away from him and that hurts. I feel like i’ve been out of my mind for feeling certain ways in this relationship. Like i have no room to feel upset or a little angry.",03Dec2019,1
14,"(Note: any names used are not real, just easier to follow than ""girl called T"" and boy called ""R"")
So, in a group chat me and my friend, Tyler, are both in, there was a huge argument between a girl and a guy. Tyler PMed me right when I was about to go to sleep (accidentally called me) and we ended up talking about the drama in the group chat. He then made a comment about how ""drama is to be expected especially when most of the people in the chat are women"". I told him the joke wasn't funny, and I might've left it there but then he said that he made the joke knowing I wouldn't find it funny and then brought up the fact his friend, Anna, laughed at the joke. I got annoyed because it felt like he was riling me up on purpose by mentioning that he knew I wouldn't like the joke and then trying to invalidate my response by mentioning Anna (it just felt irrelevant to mention). So, I left the conversation there.

He apologised in the morning for the joke, but upon discussing the subject further I only got more annoyed because he started saying that a joke couldn't be sexist if that wasn't its intention, which more or less meant he wasn't really apologising for the joke, he was just apologising for making the joke to me specifically. I don't know if I want to be friends with someone who would even make sexist jokes in the first place. At some point during the discussion, his friend Anna PMed me asking me to forgive him as he was in a bad place and felt terrible about the situation. Thing is, I felt like it was unfair that he could make a joke like that but then just dodge confrontation about it on the grounds that he was ""in a bad place"". I decided to delay the conversation for now until we've both thought about it, but I don't know if I'm being an asshole or not. I know in the back of my mind that it's probably unreasonable for me to want him to change his stance entirely about a sexist joke being sexist even if that's not the ""intention"", but I feel like that's the only outcome that would satisfy me. My frustration isn't about the joke anymore, it's about the fact he thinks that those jokes are okay to make. It just puts a sour taste in my mouth but I really don't know if I'm overreacting or not. My friends say I'm in the right, but obviously they're going to support me. I want an objective viewpoint so I can decide how to move forward with this.

Tl;dr - guy friend made a sexist joke, triggered a discussion/argument between us and now I'm not sure if I'd be overreacting by ending the friendship over this issue. I have no idea how to handle the situation.",03Dec2019,1

18,"This is in Australia, which is relevant for some of the details and organisations involved.

I live in a housing commission house. My grandmother passed last October, and since I was the only other person on the lease (news to me) I was made the tenant with no way to add others to the lease. Two people residing on property were problems, and I kicked them out; so it is now myself, and my father and sister (who reside on the property illegally, though the housing commission knows about it). We found out in June that we wouldn't be able to keep the house (after a lot of trying and appealing), and were given three months, and after hearings and trying to settle we're finally officially having a sheriff called to remove us.

We've had issues with the housing commission that aren't immediately relevant (they are to blame for our current situation, mostly). Long story short we are having the sheriff contacted today to remove us from the property (though they likely won't be arriving today). We have a place to stay, but all of our contents and furniture are going to be lost.

We have applied to over 60 properties since September (we were advised by housing commission not to apply beforehand, which they now hold over us as our fault), and have been denied by over 40 of them (\~15 are still up in the air, or never responded). We are never told why we are denied, only that we are.

We honestly don't look like great tenants on paper (only one applicant works and they receive little pay; no prior rental history outside of housing commission etc.), and, we've recently been told that it *may* be because housing commission refuse to be tenancy references, and have been denying giving out information about us (upon questioning we are told they ""don't do that"").

We are functionally homeless, meaning we're able to live on the lounges of friends and family, but we don't have a residence.

What can we do to find housing? What avenues can we go through? I don't quite know what advice I'm looking for, and I feel like I'm just writing for the sake of it, but we need help and I'm not sure what to do.",03Dec2019,1

I don't know what to do with it. I thought of keeping it as a memorial but it will still make me sad and I feel like it will get in the way of the ""moving on"" process (or grieving process?). I also thought of selling it but it just feels like throwing a piece of him away. With all of those things in mind, you'll think the obvious choice is to get a new budgie but I also feel like I'm just replacing him with another budgie just like if he doesn't matter at all.

29,"So I started a new ‘job’ of sorts about a month and half ago-ish. It’s event work and obviously this time of year is hectic, which is great; I’m doing on average 3 events a week. It’s a small company, basically run by this guy and a full time staff member, the rest of us are sort of contractors; I invoice my hours after each event with any expenses. They pay me well, and even pay me for the time I spend in the car to drop off/pick up equipment. I’m not too fussed about mileage, though the boss has mentioned it in passing, because the pay is good enough that what I get paid two drive out there in back would cover my fuel costs for two-ish weeks. I’ve even done a few out-of-city trips, and have another one next week. Prior to that I was working through a student job app, which is how I linked in with them (but was otherwise unemployed.) This has since become my main source of income, seeing as I dedicate at least 20 hours to it a week and I really enjoy it far more than the min wage hospo work I was doing before.

My boss briefly mentioned invoices yesterday when I was doing a drop off, and mentioned how he likes to do it in a timely manner. I send them when I complete them to this other woman, she’s the one that sorts them. I want to be clear that I’ve not had any issue with them withholding the money at all, they’re really great. But they’re not timely. I’m generally having to ask, every two weeks or so, for them to pay me something. They’ll fulfil one, it pops through as soon as they do and I’m good for another week or so. But up til now I’ve been invoicing weekly, I double checked with him yesterday that it was all good (I’m new to this) and he mentioned for admin reasons it’s easier for them to do one invoice per job so they can see expenses, which I have no problem doing. Last night I sent through the three invoices for last week. Now when I say timely, I’m not expecting those to be paid today or even tomorrow. But 2 other outstanding invoices for 6 or so jobs I’ve done going back 3-4 weeks. I’m aware that some larger companies usually have a set date each month where they pay all their invoices which doesn’t seem to be the case here. Is it unreasonable to hope that they get paid within a week or two??

I just get really uncomfortable about asking. I know it’s money that I’ve earned, but it feels wrong. But I’m also always asking at the point where I have like $20 in my account and need to buy food or put gas in my car so I can drop equipment off etc. I’m living paycheck to paycheck, which seems ridiculous when I’m working part time hours (more than the 6 p/w or so I was getting in my hospo job before) on a pretty good rate for my age, with $1300 in invoices outstanding. I’m also planning a trip with my friends in february which should totally be affordable given what I’m earning, but then I’ve got $18 in my account right now. 

Idk, I just feel really stuck. Because it really is a GREAT job, and the people themselves are fantastic to work with. It’s not a case of wanting to leave at all. I feel like I missed an opportunity to discuss this yesterday when he brought it up, I’m picking up equipment tomorrow so I’m tempted to bring it up then (though, I’m generally a kinda nervous person in general so who knows), but I’m just not sure how to navigate this seeing as I’m fairly new and don’t want to be unreasonable or anything.

Like the kind of friends who’s parents were rich, and would often brag about how much better everything they had was. The majority of the group was willing to look past it, but for a few of us it got to be quite annoying. They just weren’t good friends.

 Now three years ago what caused the split in the group is one of the “rich friends” let another friend in the group go to jail over weed and paraphernalia, when the weed and paraphernalia wasn’t even our other friends stuff. 

After that happened I called the “rich friends” and told them I thought they weren’t good friends and I just didn’t want them to be in my life anymore. Me and the friend who went to jail were the only ones to do this.

Now we are at present day, and I haven’t talked to them in years. My family gets an invite to one of the “rich friends” wedding saying we were all invited, my brother being one of the groomsmen. They asked me if I was going and I said no. 

Now my entire family is pissed at me because I’m not going. I tried explaining to them that I didn’t even consider him a friend anymore and I’ve felt this way for years, I also mentioned that I told him I didn’t want to be friends anymore so I really wasn’t expecting an invitation anyways. The only persons feelings I care about in this situation is my brothers, because he is still close friends with the friend getting married.

Hi, throw away account just for this btw.
   I have a friend who is female and recently turned 21.  She works for a restaurant chain and has enjoyed it a lot until she recently had to switch stores.  It came with making some new friends but also some new problems, chief among them her manager who is in his mid 40s-early 50s or so and a total creep.  She’s confided in me multiple times that he is constantly staring at her, making comments about her looks/being into her, trying to get her to spend time with him outside of work, etc...  She took it all better than I would have and politely declined him at first followed by telling him exactly how little interest she had in him (still overly politely if I had to bet) when he persisted.  She recently turned 21 as I mentioned earlier but she doesn’t drink, smoke, drug or anything like that.  Most if not all of her co-workers are aware of and respect this.  However, she made a joke to a coworker about finally being a “real adult” since she’s 21 and as if summoned by these very words Mr. Creep pops up and starts asking if she wants to get a drink with him later and when she instantly replies “no” he follows with “why not?  I’ll buy you drinks all night!?!?” which received another “no” as the coworker she was talking to initially looked on until he f****d off.  I’ve raised the possibility of going to the company HR rep, speaking to the district manager, requesting a transfer back (she’s on good terms with her old manager), or anything that will at least start the process of forcing him to back off or getting her away from the situation.  My question is for any suggestions on how else to do this. Do I have grounds to file on her behalf or make an anonymous call to corporate?  Any suggestions would be great as my hope that she would do something, while slim to start, are fast diminishing.  

She tends to get walked on in her day-to-day life a lot and is willing to compromise to an unhealthy extent to avoid causing what she views as problems for other people.  She has gotten better about this, but I’m worried this situation might be too much for her budding confidence and may keep her stuck in that overly passive state she’s worked to move away from in recent months.",03Dec2019,1
34,"We had this little dog, by the name of Gracie, and my sister always seemed jealous of her, sometimes making comments that our mother loves Gracie more than her (my sister). Gracie went septic and we thought we would lose her, but she got better, and for about 4 or 5 months, everything was fine. 

Then one day, my sister runs in holding Gracie, and she is having a seizure and screaming. Several days and thousands later, Gracie passes away. I hate that I am thinking like this, but I really don't know what to think at this point. My sister got angry at my mom yesterday and basically used the grief of Gracie passing as ammunition. That got me thinking about how I don't know what happened, Gracie was screaming when my sister ran her into the living room ""freaking out"" (potentially, I don't know what to believe.) I haven't done any research, but is it normal for a dog to scream during a seizure? I've seen people have seizures and for the most part they are silent. I don't trust my sister at this point, she steals things from us all the time. Not anything huge, I'll just find my things in her room, and she takes makeup from my mom. Hopefully someone can ease my mind.",03Dec2019,1

38,"16f, 11th grade, currently in public school

A lot of stuff happened to me at my highschool. I'm just going to say the worst thing, I was sexually assaulted multiple times and tormented by someone at my school. Some people knew about it and still decided to blame me when I said I get panic attacks being near them, because they're a ""changed person"" now (nevermind the fact that they never apologized to me for anything). I see that person, their boyfriend (that used to make me feel horrible for not being around the person who abused me), and people associated with them. Them tormenting me to my face has stopped, it died down at the beginning of this school year but I still feel scared, and I often get horrible thoughts when I see them (i take off my glasses,  look at my feet often in the hallways, I even cover my face with my lunchbox, i do everything i can to avoid them but I still feel horrible). That's why I know I have to leave.

One of my options is online school. I'm doing some research on it now, I've read success stories on students who thrived on online schooling and also people here on reddit saying that they regret it. Public school for me is incredibly boring and slow paced, besides my two AP classes. The thought of doing the work at your own pace sounds wonderful to me. The social interaction wouldn't be a problem for me I think, I'm taking jiu jitsu classes and I go to italian school every saturday where i talk to people my age. not only that, I have a friend who said I can visit her anytime after school. I'm still scared though. I don't know if I'll be okay doing it. It's foreign to me, are my fears justified?

My other options are charter and private schools. I'm going to start calling public schools around me to see if I can transfer to those schools. 

The idea of homeschooling just seems really nice and beneficial for me. Should I do it?",03Dec2019,1
39,"Some additions, I think they may be important.

1. I am not from ""the West"". I am from Ukraine, it's the second poorest country in Europe after Moldova, maybe even the first poorest - don't follow the news, but situation is definitely not going to better. And I can't simply go and ask some guidance, help, and training from the government - it's not Scandinavia. Social care here isn't as good, even for elderly and children. For ex-addicts, or another non-elderly individuals of hard situation (ex-prisoners, ex-mental institution occupants, and so on) - social care is nearly nonexistant. Or horrible.
2. I think, my advantage that I do speak (NOT good) English. But I can't find how can I use it. I was think that probably be a guide to foreigners, but we have not a lot foreigner tourists here, the majority of which came from post-Soviet countries, speak Russian (everybody in Ukraine speak Russian, not only Ukrainian), and simply have no need. For this few who are ""real"" foreigners, like from European Union countries (yes, Ukraine in Europe, but not in the EU) - they usually go to tourist popular destinations, like Carpathian mountains, or Kiev - the capital. In fact, Kiev, or Kyiv if you wish, is not too far from me - only 70 kilometers. It's possible to go there and back everyday by commuter train - it would be a pain, but not impossible. I did contact some tourist agencies in Kiev, but nobody is interested - my English isn't that good (especially when I speak - to strong accent), I have no formal, official education in English, no diploma of English studying, and also... the one agency which interviewed me... well, the person who did interviewed me also whispered to my ear at the end ""sorry, friend, apart from your not very good English, it's also your look - your face, your clothing. We won't hire guides of this representation"". I don't know... but maybe there are some other uses to my English...
3. I am not a believer, I am pretty much atheist, so hardly can receive some help from religious organisations - and anyway, here is not the West, the temples aren't rich, and help is very rarely provided even for believers, adherents, and in very limited level.
4. I am in really hard situation. I have almost nothing to sell - mobile phone, probably? Nobody wants to hire me. If this would goes on, I am very soon would live on the streets... You know, in a sense, it's very funny. I'm not from the bad family. In fact, from the good one, pretty much of comfortable living - even little above middle class family. And, when I was at school, I wasn't a bad learner. I was a very good one, at least by the standards of small provincial city of Ukraine. Maybe even the top of the class. But when I was 16, well... that's started... Today my family would not provide me any help, and would not provide me accommodation under any conditions - its not because they're evil, no, they're good, but during many years back in the past they did try - the give me money so I did spent them... not on what I said... they accomodate me at their flat, apartment - only to see I am not there next day, and also the TV set and money is also gone from the flat - together with me. They give up on me totally, absolutely, they would not provide any help - and I do understand them. This door is closed for me too.

I really don't know what to do. I feel there is no chance for good life for me, and that all will finish for me sometime soon, and with no good. I feel very afraid, in panic...",03Dec2019,1

I still want to let her know that I like her. We both go to college now in the same state but our campuses are like 6 hours apart. I have been contemplating dm’ing her on Instagram and telling her “haha I saw you on Tinder what’s up” or something like that. Should I start a conversation, if so, what should I say?

Anyways, I talked to her saying it’s fine no reason to feel bad, it’s life, it’s just how it goes. I tried being the bigger person and I was fine at the moment. But at the end of the day I saw her twice and throughout the day it just hit me really hard. How do I get off it? I also have class with her so how do I deal with that?

45,"Basically just to put things into context, I personally find it very hard to gain long lasting feelings for a girl. In past relationships I have not felt much or any emotional attachment to that person. In this case I have actually gotten strong feelings for this girl, I believe this is because she’s a lot harder to read and is the complete opposite of clingy when we’re apart. So maybe the whole “absence makes the heart grow fonder” has worked on me. Anyway she is moving to a university which is about a 3 hour drive away from where I live. She’s also stated that she will not be coming back home for the first few months. She’s a very outgoing person and she’ll want to enjoy freshers week and all the partying. My fear is that she will have so much work to do and on top of that will want to be going out clubbing with her new found friends at the weekends. This would mean I would rarely get to spend time with her or see her. On top of this as she’s a very good looking girl, with a six pack I may add. She’s going to get a lot of male attention in an environment like that. This wouldn’t normally be an issue however as a boy at her uni would be a 100 times more convenient for her and being so far away where I wouldn’t have a clue what’s happening I fear she may leave me for someone else. 

I’m now thinking do I split up with her closer to the time in the nicest possible way because of this. Or do I stick and see what happens regardless of how hard it’ll be to maintain our relationship at that distance. I just highly doubt I’ll get feelings for another girl to the level I currently have for this one. 

Any advice would be gladly appreciated, and before anyone calls me insecure... I completely am.",03Dec2019,1
46,"I've decided to leave my abusive relationship after he was recently violent again.  I have several options for this but would like others advice on which one to pick.  

\*Current Circumstance\* 

\- I recently left my current career track to pursue a nursing degree and I have 3.5 years left of the program.  I'm financially dependent on him.  We have moved from state to state for his career and my career has been severely damaged because I've only stated at jobs for a year or less at a time.  

\- I live in a very rural area and there are no other nursing schools and the job market isn't the best for non medical jobs.  The nursing program I'm in is AMAZING and I would be able to get a student nursing job next year and basically have guaranteed employment upon successful graduation and passing boards as they have a nursing residency program at the school and local hospital.  

\- I have not called the cops on any of this but I do have photos of bruises etc.  I haven't called the cops because he would loose his job and that would screw me over too as we share finances.   

\- I have no family or friends close by as we have moved so much around the country.  I don't have many family members- the ones I have love me but are not in a place to be able to help financially but they wish they could.  

I could....

1. Move in with a friend in NYC and drop out of nursing school and return to my previous career (administrative support: executive assistant/ office administrator jobs).  
2. Continue with school and move into student housing (I'm 29F though and that seems super lame at my age), or find an apartment (there aren't many here though) get a nursing assistant job and be able to buy the house from him after I'm done with school (he has said he would sell it to me because he wants to move to another city after he is here for several years).  The mortgage is in his name but I am on the title as well.  I feel upset because I don't want to leave my home and would prefer him leave.  

Please let me know what other information you may need or options you see.  I'm trying to keep this vague for obvious reasons.  I am not in immediate physical harm right now.  Right now I'm planning my escape with my counselor and just wanted other's perspectives.  Thanks in advance.",03Dec2019,1

I've tried anti-depressants, multiple therapists, and I moved to a new state three years ago.  I don't have kids, barely any friends, no savings to speak of, but also minimal debt (which I'm working to pay off and am almost through), and I'm making $85/year as a desk jockey software engineer (which I'm not really I into).

As I spent most of my years from 20-30 with my Wife (throughout bouts of illness from cancer), we practically had no chances to travel, form new friendships or go live out our youth as most people do in their twenties.  As a result, it's been hard for me to form new friendships since.  My loneliness and depression have adversely affected the few friendships I have, as well as my job performance.

I dont value myself, I didn't before she passed.  My therapist says people can change, but seldom do.  Has anyone out there changed their situation drastically out of similar necessity?  If so, how did you do it?  And what do you think you would try if you were in my shoes?  Thanks!",03Dec2019,1

I sometimes use that e-mail address now to sign up to get into protected wi-fi at public places and just for general spam. Today I decided to look through it deeper and in my sent history I found an e-mail labeled ""Evidence to Report"" written in May 2014. This e-mail was sent BY me TO myself.

60,"   So, you've probably figured this out already from the title but this is a problem my 21-year old sister is having, not me. She doesn't have a Reddit account and she asked me for advice since I'm a guy, so I thought I'd run it through you guys since I honestly don't know what she should do at this point. For convenience purposes, G = The Guy, S = My Sister, X = His Ex.

   So anyways, S has been friends with G for about a year, two years, and don't get me wrong, he's a super cool dude, we all get along with him pretty well. For the majority of this time S has had some level of feelings for him, and I'm not certain if he's aware of this or not, but I'm pretty sure he is.

   Anyways, recently, X moved back to near where we live, and she and G ran into each other a couple weeks ago. Apparently the two really hit it up after being separated for so long. He and S both work at the same place, and G and X have been constantly texting each other back and forth for the past week. Just yesterday he admitted to S that he still has feelings for X. Then he goes on about ""But we're just friends, right? This shouldn't be affecting our relationship at all.""

   Currently she's got no idea what to do. She feels some separation for the time being is better until G gets over his feelings for X, because she doesn't want to give up on this guy so easily, but G keeps asking why she's being so distant and how he still wants them to be friends. But S just can't seem to handle a relationship under those circumstances, despite how much she wants to be able to express her feelings to G, and I can't blame her. G has been kind of ignorant about the whole situation since he probably knows S has feelings for him yet still wants to be friends with her under the circumstances. So she asked me what I think she should do from here, and honestly, I have no idea. Any advice?",03Dec2019,1
61,"I'm 16f and I'm the oldest child. I'm the most independent but my parents constantly limit me. Every activity/extracurricular that I want to do they always put me down. I was on the school dance team least year and I tried out again this year and made it. The team is really hard to get onto and I tried my hardest practicing and staying up late to make sure I practiced because I really wanted to be on the team. Being on the dance team was like family. They let me try out but once I made it, they told me, ""You're on your own this year. We're not driving you. Your siblings have other activities and they come first."" They forced me to quit and leave the team. I worked so hard for that spot on the team and I wanted it so bad but once I got it, they made me give it up. Meanwhile, when my younger sister makes the volleyball team, they praise her and encourage her, going to all her games. I wanted to do fencing because since dance was my only fun way of physical activity throughout the year, I needed something else to keep me active (also because I've been wanting to do it forever). I asked them if I could do fencing since there is a club 15 minutes away from school and I even planned my public bus route if they weren't going to drive me. They said no again, saying it's too much for me to handle even when I specifically told them my plan if I were to do fencing. I wanted to do the school musical since I've always been shy and I wanted to try something new. The only requirement is that you would have to come to practice during February break (mandatory can't miss). I told my parents and they said no. My mom said that she took off February break and didn't want my activities bothering her while she rested that week. I'm just so tired of this. I honestly cannot do anything I want to anymore because they always say no or my siblings come first. Hell, I can't even go out with my friends anymore if I wanted to. Honestly, if I could drive I would love to handle this all by myself but they're not letting me learn how to drive until I'm 18. They won't let me Uber either. I can't talk to them either about it because they're Asian parents and will never listen. I feel like.. I'm trapped...

63,"So I’ve been in a relationship with my wife for two years, and have been married to her for another two.

During the course of our relationship, I saw some red flags but I decided to ignore them, because why not? I was madly in love and I didn’t care- I thought that our differences would be either lessened over time or we’d grow to be compatible despite our differences.
So for the first two years, I’ve noticed that she continuously lied to me, about anything and everything. Literally about things you don’t even need to lie about- like I’d ask her if she put something over here and she would say no, when I knew she did. Stupid things like that. To say the least, our relationship wasn’t built on trust but I thought it’d be okay over time.

Once she went to a college party and I found out from a mutual friend of mine who was at that party that she was sleeping on some dude’s lap that night; not sure what the fuck that was all about but she just told me it wasn’t anything. She just chalked it up to being drunk, but I remember she was that naive girl who said rape was okay if the other person was drunk (huge red flag or real naïveté? Lmk) so who knows what else was okay in her eyes when someone is drunk. 

She went to study abroad once and I wanted her to have a good time at the end of the semester, when she would be free to travel Europe for a week or two. Her parents wouldn’t give her money so I just gave her what I could, do that she could have a good time. Turns out she spent all the money I gave her on raves and drugs and kept lying to me about it.

When she got back from Europe, I wanted to spice up our sex life &amp; wanted to have a 3sum so I asked her to download tinder &amp; find someone. When she let me look at it, I found her matches from when she was studying abroad (she was matching dudes on my fucking birthday too) but no conversations. When I confronted her about it on three different occasions, she gave me three different answers/explanations as to why she downloaded tinder. She said she deleted the conversations bc she didn’t want me reading them. 

After all this, you ask why I got married? Well let me just begin by saying that she was the one who wanted to get married- her reasoning was because she didn’t want to lose me; lmao after all I had more than enough reason to leave but she didn’t want me to go. On my part, I agreed to marry her because love is a fucked up mysterious thing and I really loved her despite the lies, the hurt, etc. Also because before college, I was depressed and suicidal but she was the one who pulled me out and made me feel whole again. She was there for me even during the hardest times and I wasn’t going to let her go, because I really thought that she was the one for me. I had so many good memories with her, good experiences, had many of my firsts- first time getting an apartment together, first time getting a cat, first time of many other things. I wasn’t going to let her go after making those precious memories.

So after I got married, we’ve had more good times, but there were also some bad parts. For example, she would body shame me, telling me I’m fat, etc. Remember I said she gave me three different reasons why she had tinder downloaded on her phone while studying abroad? One of them was apparently because she wanted a bigger dick &amp; mine wasn’t good enough for her. 

There was this one time our marriage was at its lowest and we were taking some time apart but she went ahead and downloaded tinder and made plans to hook up with some dude at a hotel- asking him to choke her and do some kinky shit. She also exchanged messages with some other guy- and you know what she told me? She was telling me all about the things that she liked in this guy- all the things that I wasn’t and couldn’t ever be- like being a certain race, height, body figure, dick size, eye color, hair color, etc. Proceeded to tell me everything that I wasn’t.

During our relationship and marriage, money was an issue too, as I’d be working so that we can travel, eat well, and do fun things. She worked, but only spent that money on herself while I was putting everything I earned to support us both. 

So here we are, at the face of divorce. I guess after all I couldn’t deal with the differences. 

The thing is, I’m from a different country and decided to stay in the US for our marriage, got permanent residency, and I can’t really afford to move back. I’m now faced with divorce and possibly losing my permanent residency. What a life. What do I even do?",03Dec2019,1

65,"I've decided to leave my abusive relationship after he was recently violent again. I have several options for this but would like others advice on which one to pick.

\*Current Circumstance\*

\- I recently left my current career track to pursue a nursing degree and I have 3.5 years left of the program. I'm financially dependent on him. We have moved from state to state for his career and my career has been severely damaged because I've only stayed at jobs for a year or less at a time.

\- I live in a very rural area and there are no other nursing schools and the job market isn't the best for non medical jobs. The nursing program I'm in is AMAZING and I would be able to get a student nursing job next year and basically have guaranteed employment upon successful graduation and passing boards as they have a nursing residency program at the school and local hospital.

\- I have not called the cops on any of this but I do have photos of bruises etc. I haven't called the cops because he would loose his job and that would screw me over too as we share finances.

\- I have no family or friends close by as we have moved so much around the country. I don't have many family members- the ones I have love me but are not in a place to be able to help financially but they wish they could.

I could....

1. Move in with a friend in NYC and drop out of nursing school and return to my previous career (administrative support: executive assistant/ office administrator jobs).
2. Continue with school and move into student housing (I'm 29F though and that seems super lame at my age), or find an apartment (there aren't many here though) get a nursing assistant job and be able to buy the house from him after I'm done with school (he has said he would sell it to me because he wants to move to another city after he is here for several years). The mortgage is in his name but I am on the title as well. I feel upset because I don't want to leave my home and would prefer him leave.

Please let me know what other information you may need or options you see. I'm trying to keep this vague for obvious reasons. I am not in immediate physical harm right now. Right now I'm planning my escape with my counselor and just wanted other's perspectives. Thanks in advance.",03Dec2019,1

Fast forward two years, it comes to light Friend A cheated on his previous girlfriend in the past and i dont have concrete evidence but I think it was with friend B. Me and some of our other good friends confronted him but it really didnt accomplish much, he apologized and said hes gotten better and we were satisfied at the time. Looking back at it, we really let him off way too easy for what he did but his SO was ( to the best of our knowledge ) OK  with it and more or less wanted to move on so we just moved on. Fast forward some more months, friend B comes out and says friend A mostly only used her for sexual things and she dosnt want to associate with friend A or anyone who associates with him anymore. 

Looking back at it what friend A did was mad fucked up and he really shouldn't have been let off like that but it really feels off coming back and trying to punish for lack of better words friend A for stuff in the.

72,"I thought I knew where I wanted to go after high school. The first thought that came to mind when I was applying for college was computer science, so I applied there and got accepted. I already had a bad feeling within the first few weeks of college that maybe this isn't what I want to spend the next four years of my life on. 

But I lingered, I thought that eventually my feelings will change and I'll get over it, but right now 2 months in I hate everything about my life right now. I find no motivation to work for college because it disagrees with me too much, even though I know that it would of course be a good thing to get my shit together and power through 4 years of this.

At the moment I'm conflicted between a few options that I have... I either stay here and hate every minute of it, but if I manage to do it I'll have a diploma at the end of it and probably find a job more easily, since I would have a degree in CS.

My second option is to transfer to another course in a completely different direction than Computer Science. My fear is that I even with a degree from there I doubt I'll actually be getting a job in that field of work (English) any time soon, if ever. And I don't want to spend years of studying for a piece of paper that won't serve me any good in my employment.

My third and currently preferred option is dropping out, at least for now, go work a normal job, while learning how to program on my own at home. In high school I never found time to pick up on programming and I feel like if I gave it a shot and became really good at it I might seek employment as a programmer eventually.

The reason why I'm hesitant on dropping out is because I'm not sure about anything I want to do in the future and any path I take would be a big risk, not to mention the huge disadvantages (financially speaking) I'd get for switching courses or dropping out for a longer period of time (if I perhaps decide to sign up to the other course after I gave programming a shot).

The safest choice for sure would be to stay where I am now and struggle against my will. I'm afraid my mindset on this won't change and I'll hate every minute of the four years I'd have spent here.

The second choice is ""riskier"" as I've already explained why and is also somewhat more expensive. The third choice is where my heart points at but it's also by far the biggest risk should my plan fail and I would have to return to university at a later date and only in this case have to pay for my own tuition (which would be a huge expense, living in a third world EU country).

76,"For obvious reasons, I am posting this on a throwaway account...

You see, I don't have a lot of friends. However when I think of a ""friend"". There are 2 people I always think about. And they happen to be my best friends. Let's call them Sophia \[F12\] and Emma \[F15\].

I \[M14\] started talking to Sophia, in the beginning, a while back now. And I met Emma through her. I just really connected with them and we've been super good friends for a long time now! I and Emma connected better I assume it's cause we are both a bit more mature and just have more stuff in common.

I remember me and Emma used to talk all the time. It would end up one calling the other at maybe around 6 PM and we talked and talked for ages until eventually, it was either around 7 AM. And I just sorta said hey you need to sleep. Or until we both fell asleep. However, about 2 weeks ago she stopped... She just quit texting me at all. Our calls ended. And she was super cold towards me. At first, I panicked thinking I had done something wrong and that she was mad or upset at me but nothing popped into my head why she would be.

I decided to talk to Sophia about it, But that gave no results. These girls have been best friends since they were young so I didn't trust Sophia when she said everything was fine and that Emma was just busy. Because it wasn't just the lack of texts, calls and such. It's that I tend to have this sort of ability to just know when something is wrong with them. I can just hear it in their voice, The way they talk, The way they write. In my head, she was clearly covering for Emma somehow. Why I had no clue.

I began to get aggravated, lonely, sad after about a week. And at this point, it wasn't just Emma who ignored me it was also Sophia. I ended up writing a long message to Emma about how I am super sorry if I had done something and how I felt about the whole thing. Because I felt super abandoned, She usually tells me everything. But now both she and Sophia had been ignoring me. I told her how I had cried almost every single night. Which I had.

I got a cold and short answer back which looked something like this.

""Hey, I am really sorry. You haven't done anything wrong but something has happened and I'm not ready to talk about it""

This, of course, made me just worry even more, Not only worry but I started blaming myself. I didn't believe her, In my head, I had ruined everything I had with them. Probably said or done some stupid shit that got them to dislike me. Because as I mentioned earlier they tell me everything. I tried to get her to tell me more but no luck.

However just about an hour ago I opened an image she had sent me. I saw it super late and she sent it about 11 hours ago. And I am really mad I missed it. I saw a portion of her beautiful face but what I saw in the image barely even struck me at first. I've never been filled with so many emotions and thoughts in my head at the same time. Part of me just wanted to not believe it. Like it never had happened. But of course, that's not an option. What I saw was sort of blackish/grayish? [( Sorry, I am colorblind but there is an image attached. )](http://tinyimg.io/i/5YR66GM.jpg) marks on her neck.

I didn't know how to react, I instantly tried to text her to see if she was awake, I also texted Sophia. I was filled with anguish, panic, anger, sadness. So many emotions that I haven't felt in years now. Hell, I am crying as I am writing this. As I said a part of me doesn't want to believe it but there are so many parts of me that have mixed emotions. I wanna take a bus to her house and just give her a big hug... Talk to her, Be there for her,

Another part of me just wants to find out who it is and beat the shit out of them. I have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADD ). I don't know if it is because of this but I get mad super easily and often. Right now I am madder than I have been in my entire life. I have family members who have been frightened of me when I have been angry because my mind shuts off. I get violent, To the point where I've had the cops called on me several times.

And me saying I want to beat the shit out of them is an understatement. Oh god, I want to do so much fucking more to them. I am scared of myself right now. I understand that doing this would solve nothing. But still... I want them to fucking suffer for what they have done to her. My heart hurts so fucking much. She is a wonderful girl who has had so much shit in her life, And this isn't the sort of shit she needs.

Sometime's I wish there was more I could do for her. And right now I am blaming myself, I don't know what to do with myself. Please Reddit I beg you... I need advice on what the smartest and best option to do is. I am scared and lost on what to do...

TL:DR my best friend was strangled, I have anger issues and such. I am scared of myself, I am confused about what to do, I need help on the best and smartest option to do is.",03Dec2019,1

The ironic thing is that despite spending a great majority of my day studying, I still struggle with school and my grades. I can spend days writing a paper or studying for a test but always fail miserably. I feel that I should care, but failing doesn't seem to phase me much anymore. 

  
 The only downfall is that I'm afraid my professors will think I'm not trying due to my reaction to bad grades.

I am a college student of 18 years old currently struggling with what I am guessing is depression.

Lately my life has been going somewhat downhill because of some experiences the last couple of months and due to this I have been struggling with a lot. College being one of them
Falling asleep is tough to me the point where I don't sleep for an entire day just to be able to fall asleep the next day. 
My ambition and focus are nowhere to be found and honestly I'm planning on quitting this year of college because of that.

I am planning to go a therapist to get hopefully some help.

But the way things are going in my life and college I believe it's smarter to stop college for now so I don't lose too much and try fix myself again. Obviously with the intention of trying again next year without hopefully the self-diagnosed depression (haven't gone to a therapist yet)

84,"

We’ve been friends for about three years. He’s always had anxiety and depression issues but now he’s getting into drugs (beyond just cannabis) to cope with his problems. (I’ll call him N)

At the start of our friendship a few years ago, he was dating a slightly overweight girl. However, me and some of my other friends started giving him shit about it. Looking back on it now I really regret it because it went too far and even though I thought it was all in good fun and we were joking, he didn’t take it lightly and we almost ended up ending our friendship over this. However, nobody really apologized or said anything about it and we all moved on from it. 

Last year, my friends and I begin to notice that N was becoming increasingly distant and less outgoing and productive as he usually was. I was away at college at the time but my other two friends were attending a local community college at home with N. This is when I found out that N was blowing off class to stay home and get high. 

Shortly after we made this discovery, he ended up failing out of that community college and has since worked a variety of dead end minimum wage pizza delivery jobs with no ambitions or passion to do anything else or to have a career or at least a good paying job. 

Fast forward to April of this year, one of my other friends happened to stumble upon N’s reddit account (that he has since deleted). It basically went into how he abused drugs before and during our friendship such as cannabis, his previous addiction to robitussin and other cough syrups, microdosing on LSD, xanax, and even some opiates (which also led to him losing his girlfriend who ended up cheating on him because of how distant and high he was becoming), how he went to various psych wards due to anxiety and depression issues, how he’s considered taking his own life, and how he just drives around getting high in the woods because he’s so lonely and unmotivated. 

He told my friends and I (essentially the only support system he has) NONE OF THIS

However, over time I have noticed that he always puts me down, picks on me, disrespects me, and never pays me back for anything I buy for him. He very rarely does this to our other friends and I believe he holds resentment against me for my friends and I (but especially me) “roasting” his GF in our group chat. I totally understand I was in the wrong and it was a shitty thing to do in retrospect but I just think he never really forgave me for it and holds resentment towards me. 

As it is, I almost ended my friendship with him over the summer because we got into a slightly drunken physical altercation over him being unwilling to share his vape with me after I bought him an 18 pack of beer and dinner that night and he again refused to pay me back. However, for the sake of our friend group I decided to forgive him and eventually moved on. 

Currently, he spends all of his money on cannabis and smokes about 7-10 grams a week, only works 20 hours a week at a mediocre local pizza place with no sign of wanting to move on or get an actual job since he’s not attending college. When he isn’t working, N goes to various scenic places around the area and gets high all day and still lives at home with his parents, who he has a dysfunctional and negative relationship with because he has a history of stealing and lying from them. When I do ask him about what he wants to do after moving on from the pizzeria he’s currently working at (which is at most 20-25 hours a week), he literally said to me “It doesn’t matter I’ll be gone soon anyway” and when I asked N what he meant by this he just said “probably dead I guess”. This actually scares the shit out of me. 

N also engages in drag races a lot and has been driving increasingly recklessly lately. This sort of makes me uncomfortable to be around him as I’m worried he’s just living off adrenaline at this point with no consideration for his future or well-being. 

I really care about N and love him as if he was my brother. I want to help him but he is stubborn and in denial and unwilling to accept or deal with his problems. I was planning on finally confronting him about his disturbing reddit account when I get back home from college for break in a couple weeks but a part of me is just considering ending our friendship because I think it’s just becoming too toxic and revolving around getting high and occasionally drunk together. In a way that’s all we do anymore and while it’s fun, I want our friendship to be more than that but it’s being restricted by N’s toxic habits. 

I also just feel like we’re going down separate roads anyway as I’m graduating college in May with my bachelors degree and most likely a solid career ahead of me, while he’s still living with his parents and working menial jobs making money that just goes to weed. 

TL;DR: My relationship with my friend has gone downhill over time because of his destructive drug use and his resentment towards me for past events and I’m currently considering if I should move on from him as a result.

However, because my siblings had a different childhood and upbringing to me (first child tends to have stricter parenting I think), they tended to rebel more and care less about stuff like academics, so my dad was more critical of them. This created resentment between them and led to some scars for both of my siblings. There has often been a vibe that my dad doesn’t really believe in them. This is not the case with me, and has been hard to accept because it’s so unfair.

My younger sister (now 22) went thru a realllly rough phase a few years ago when we moved from our home city to a completely different continent. This was when she was 15-18. Threatened to hurt herself several times and was generally very aggressive and angry, or withdrawn just spending all day smoking weed and sleeping. This has since passed and she feels horrible about how she treated my mum at the time. I had gone to university in yet another country when the worst of this was happening, and went back home as often as I could to help my mum. My youngest sibling (brother, now 19) saw all of this happen and was quite affected by it all, and really hurt that my sister could treat our mum the way she did. He was so marked by it that he would often talk about how he would never do anything to mess with her etc.

————

Current problem:

Flash forward to the last couple years. My younger brother, let’s call him V, has been more and more secretive and shady. It started with him smoking weed more and more, to the point where he’s a very much a pothead. He kept this secret from my mum very well, and she very much respects our privacy so wasn’t nosy enough to find out. This started when he was 16-17. It progressed and because we have a very liberal family, it’s pretty much been accepted that he smokes (only from time to time though, not pothead level) since he was 18. The not OK part started happening when he would do shady shit like take money from my mum’s purse without asking, having shouting arguments with my mum being really disrespectful, having parties messing up the house when mum was away, and he even crashed her car when he drove it (drunk and/or high) once - without a license. This is really unlike him to be dishonest and shady but we thought it was the worst of it. At this point he was also smoking a lot and not making efforts to hid it from my mum (18 years old at this point).

Then his friend got stopped by some metro ticket inspectors and started mouthing them off, V joined in and was filming the altercation that broke out as a result. So they arrested him and obviously searched his bag. They found 80g of hash and stuff for dealing. I had honestly had my suspicions before that but told myself he couldn’t be THAT stupid. This kid comes from so much privilege and has everything he could possibly want, there is NO reason for him to be doing this.

It was a nightmare after that, he spent the night in jail, was charged with possession to deal (idk what it’s officially called) and aggressive behaviour (also unsure of offical name), the police came and searched the whole house, and he had to have weekly urine tests until his court date. He stopped smoking for something like 100 days and then stopped mentioning it to my sister and I, and then eventually started smoking in his room again like he doesn’t care at all. We all asked about the risk of being caught out by a random urine test but he’s convinced it won’t happen because he knows people who have gone thru the same thing. His lawyer told him that this year after the first charge is really important to not fuck up in, because if he does the consequences will be severe, especially if it has anything to do with dealing drugs. If it’s after a year it’ll be a new charge, which is not as bad but still really bad. He’s affecting his chances of ever going to uni/travelling/jobs.

Anyway, I was home for the weekend and noticed some weird behaviour like people coming into the house for 2 mins then leaving (like 4-5 times in a row) or him quickly going outside then coming back. Im sure this happens when I’m not around and my mum just doesn’t think too much of it. 

I could tell this was probably him dealing again, as much as I didn’t wanna believe it. I didn’t really know what to do and considered asking him about it to give him a chance to be honest, and then checking his room to be sure (he doesn’t even try to hide his stash usually, that’s the level of idgaf and blatant disrespect he has). He was super baked and my mum was home so I couldn’t talk to him about it, so I just checked before I left today and ofc I found a bunch of stuff for dealing (a small brick of hash, baggies and a scale).

Now I really don’t know what to do. I don’t want to ruin the trust I’ve built with him by outing him. But i know if I ask him over text/phone about it, saying I noticed that behaviour and I’d like him to be honest with me, he would 100% lie (because I have asked him on several other occasions, gently, if he still does it a bit, and he said no not at alllllll). I thought about asking him to be honest then saying “ok can you let mum have a look in your room right now then” if he said no, but he would still manage to hide the stuff for sure. And lie his way out of it by saying it’s old stuff/ the hash is his to smoke /etc.

My sister thinks I should just tell my mum and fuck him, because what he’s doing is actually unsafe. And also as she says “if he wants to act like a street kid who comes from a rough background and has a rough life, let him gtfo the house and be alone and actually have a rough life and stop fucking with out mum”. How can he have people he’s selling to come to our house???? My mum’s house, where she is a “single” mother. He can’t see consequences

Please help, any other ideas for approaches would be really appreciated. I really want to help him but idk how, and I need to protect my mum. All this stress isn’t healthy for her",03Dec2019,1

90,"She was my first dog, a little fluff ball. She was so sweet, so intelligent. She was my best friend. One day she felt different that usual, we took her to the vet. He said it was a tick, we argued it’s not possible. He said he is the vet and we don’t know anything, we have to trust him.. so we did. Not even one day passed and she was barely alive. We rushed to a different vet, it was a womb infection. We did all we could but it was too late. I never cried so many tears in my life, everyone was destroyed. I was only 14 back then, I feel guilty for just giving her a quick caress before she was put down because I was too hurt to look at her for any longer. I feel guilty for leaving her body there but I was too young to even think about taking her home to bury. I was too hurt to think about anything but cry my eyes out and now it haunts me. I know people say it’s only a dog but she was a family member.. and seeing her not being able to stand up, falling on the floor, peeing herself was so so heartbreaking.. I think about her every day. She was only 5.. she deserved a longer life. She didn’t deserve all that suffering. I’m a grown ass woman, I’m 22. I have a job, boyfriend, house. It makes me feel so weak that I break down at least twice a week thinking about her even if it’s been 6 years since her death. What can I do? Please help, how did you deal with your pet‘a death?

91,"I messed up. Last year, I didn’t show up to school for the second semester. I was stuck in a huge mental rut, and I didn’t have the discipline that was needed to make up for my lack of motivation. I told myself I would catch up during summer break, but then I never did. I enrolled in online school but I was kicked out of all of my classes for not turning in work. I was still depressed, and I still wasn’t disciplined.

When school started for the rest of my peers, things got better. I took up online classes again and started to actually do work, but it was nowhere near the amount of work I had to do to catch up. This resulted in me falling more and more behind.

For reference, I’m in middle school. I’m supposed to be going into high school next year. This is my goal. I want to be able to enroll in a public high school along with the rest of the people my age. The physical school setting and rigid structure are things I need in order to thrive.

I need advice on what to do. If I want to go to a physical high school next year, I’m going to have to complete 11 semesters of classes by the end of summer, where each 1 semester refers to 1 semester of a single course.

I’m not even sure if this is a realistic goal at this point.

My parents are not involved in my school work. Everything is student-led. This makes it extremely easy to fall behind.

My mental health has improved since the time when I refused to go to school, but it’s certainly not the best, so I have little to no motivation to do work. Instead, I’m trying to get through this with the notion that I HAVE to do it, so I might as well just get it over with.

I’m overall just not sure how to go about tackling this problem, so I come here seeking advice.",03Dec2019,1

Fast forward 3 months another, again I ask and she says she forgot to. I follow up a week later and she said that my dad was afraid to send me to therapy because they might give me strong medications (my parents are very very overprotective), I explained to her that it was highly unlikely and she just said ok and brushed it off. 

It’s been 2 months now not a word has been said about it. I’m thinking of talking to my dad about it but I think she just said that he was afraid to send me as an excuse or something, plus he’s not emotionally supportive/understanding.

102,"My family is a bit at odds on this. Our family dog is 14 years old, at the end of life expectancy for his breed. He has pretty bad arthritis and his back legs have lost all muscle mass. All he does all day is lay down and lick himself into mats. He smells, has cataracts, and his history with ear infections (breed is prone to them) has left him mostly def. He has also had incontinence issues to the point where our whole house has a subtle aroma of dog pee. I am at college and every time I come home he seems worse. I was talking to my sister and we thought it may be his time to go since his quality of life isn’t that amazing. We’d spend one last Christmas with him before saying goodbye, I want him to go surrounded by family and before he’s in a lot of distress. When I brought it up to my mom she said she couldn’t do it. She thinks he still has life in him and wants to wait until he passes naturally. While he does still enjoy his cuddles and pets (which he now rarely gets due to being so oily and smelly. Like legit he leaves a film on your hands after you’re done petting him). I’ve been his main up-keeper since I’m pre-vet. Every time I come home a do a full grooming to cut off all mats and bathe him, but in 2-3 days he’s just as smelly again so it’s not just us neglecting him.  I don’t think it’s fair to have him deteriorate to the point where his body gives out, most likely when he’s alone curled up somewhere in the house. I cry every time I go back to school because I’m terrified he’ll die without me being able to say goodbye. I know it’s slightly selfish and hypocritical of me to say it’s his time and still want him around for the holidays one last time.

103,"A few years ago, my dad got me an internship in the quality department at his workplace, and I have worked there every break from school since I was 18 (so like 3 years).

I generally don't like it, but they pay well and the commute is brief. 

However, I really like my current job making ice cream. They're understanding when I need time off, they let me leave if there's nothing to do, plus ice cream?! The problem is that it pays $3 less an hour and has a significantly longer commute, so I would be losing out on a lot of income.

109,"Alright Reddit need some help.

General background moved into an apartment building this Summer. Loft style, not a huge complex with a doorman and only about 20 apartments, wood floors and industrial (some of the vents are showing and historical). In general I can't hear my upstairs neighbor or my other wall neighbor. Upstairs I hear creaks but I don't hear anything, ever, from my other wall neighbor.

So from everything I've seen on the internet the general consensus is that if you live in a apartment you're going to hear some noises you're not ready for and to leave it all, totally understood. It's why I don't make a big deal about the fact that I can always hear their stereo and tv. I did have to ask them to turn their bass down about three weeks after I moved in because it was giving me a headache. For instance right now I can clearly hear their stereo through my wall when sitting on my couch. Annoying but not a big deal.

The real problem started a little over a week and a half ago when I got back from a work trip. These neighbors and I share a bedroom wall. I was woken up on a workday at midnight by their bed banging against mine, slaps and moaning. I had never heard them before this and I've lived here a few months. Alright, shit I'll just ignore it and fall back to sleep. Fall back asleep and 30 minutes later round two. Then pretty much every night since so it's interrupting my sleep. Also, our walls share the wall with the hallway so anyone walking by can hear them.

At that point it was relegated to the bedroom. About two days ago it's worked it's way to the living room during the day time and then it'll go to the bedroom. Yesterday it started at 6 and today 7. Today they put music on in the living room and I could clearly hear about 30 slaps plus moans, I'm talking huge slaps. Not little ones, ones that are reving through the pipes plus the conversation that I'll spare you.

I really don't want to walk over there or even leave a note but it's impacting my day to day, I don't even want to invite people offer at this point, especially my friends with kids. Is this something I should mention to the property manager? They definitely don't care about the noise they're causing so I wonder if sex noises will be any different. 
I never mentioned the music to the landlord either. Don't like making waves but this is a whole different level.

Any help for my sanity will be appreciated

115,"This girl and I have known each other for quite some time now. Never got close, just casual stuff  like saying hi to each other in person and making small talk when the opportunity arises. Basically, over the span of six months of course, it went exactly like this: I text her on fb, she doesn’t reply. I text her on the phone, she doesn’t reply. Both times asking her about something related to class. How would she think I was trying to hit on her? Anyways back to the timeline.: Third time I text her clarifying to her that I only wanted us to be friends and that I want her to have a good impression of me because we’re seniors and likely won’t see each other again. This time she doesn’t text back but calls me on the phone. She was incredibly nice, receptive and explained to me that the reason why she doesn’t talk to any guys in college is because she has a boyfriend. I made sure I was understanding and all, and we seemed to end it on a pretty good note. Everything is all good and I already told her that I would delete her number, and thanked her for giving me much needed clarity (genuinely had no idea she had a boyfriend). 

But then a few days ago she texts me out of nowhere saying that she thinks I’m a great guy and that if I want to ask her anything related to class she’d be there for me. I didn’t think of it anything but i’m just confused..why would she suddenly be open to answering my texts regarding class now when she would ignore them months ago? I asked a female friend of mine and she told me that maybe she feels guilty and doesn’t want to lose you completely. The thing is, how would she lose me if she never even had me? We were never friends, we never texted back and forth, we don’t have each other on social media. it’s just that we know each other and talk stuff regarding college. Why would she even care about losing me when she clearly loves her boyfriend? Another friend told me that maybe her boyfriend is okay with me texting her about college, but honestly if he was as possessive as he was about her not talking to any guy in college why would he suddenly be so open now to her having my number saved on her phone and texting me, if it’s for class? I know myself that I would never be fine with my girl giving her number to and texting some other dude, no matter the reason. It’s just strange that’s all. 

I’m just confused as to why she would feel guilty at that point, as I feel like I was polite and made sure I understood her stance. Why would she feel the need to text me out of the blue THREE weeks later, when it seemed that everything was cool? Just need anyone to explain this to me.",03Dec2019,1

118,"Hello, I really need to get this off my chest and I really need your advice.

Long time ago, when I was 13 years old (male), one day at school I touched a classmate (female, same age). I started doing it carefully by watching her reaction, but she didn't do anything, so I continued while she just stayed there (I really don't want to get into details on how I was doing it, I find it disturbing) and, from what I saw, she liked it. I stopped when a friend came to chat with us.

The next day, I did the same thing, but this time she moved to avoid my hand and I continued till she told me to stop, I asked her if she was sure I wanted to stop, and she said yes. I stopped and then immediately started to feel really guilty. I knew that it was a wrong thing to do when I started the day before, and I just did it. I told her that I was sorry, but my guilt started to increase during the day. Next day, I told her that I wanted to talk with her, I told her again, multiple times, that I was deeply sorry for what I did, that it would never occur again, she told me that it didn't matter and I asked her to please not tell anyone.

Lots of years passed and as time went by, I just forgot the disgusting and terrible thing I did. I never did something like that again. I became fully aware of how women are treated and how an abuser can destroy someone, as I helped a friend to get away from her abusive relationship with her ex.

Some time ago I was talking with some friends, when someone said that most men have abused/molested someone in someway (physically or emotionally), that's when the memory from that long time ago came back to my head and I started to feel guilty again. I started to think on how I might have affected her and her vision of the world. I feel really disgusting. Specially now that my vision of this matter has changed through the years, and I am aware of how women live with this kind of things that affects them. This started to consume me for weeks, and one day, I looked her up on Instagram, to see how she was doing in life, but I saw a post she made with a list of things that happened to her, the same woman I touched when she was a girl, and one of them was 'being touched without consent'. That's when I felt the most guilty and disgusting, and now I really don't know what to do. I don't know how to get over this. I don't know how to look her in the eyes if I ever see her again.",03Dec2019,1

120,"Hi reddit, i’ve been pretty conflicted about this for the past couple months so hopefully this can help give me some clarity. For context I am 20/f and so is my best friend, we’ll call her allie. Allie and I have been friends for about a year and a half now, we came into each other’s lives while we were both going through some shit and we have really grown into our best selves together.  When we became close we were both pretty depressed, so we would FaceTime often to talk about our progress and hold each other accountable to get the help that we needed, as well as talk about anything and everything. She grew up in a pretty religious household (both of her parents are devout catholics), and around the time we became close friends , she also started to vocally question her parents political and religious beliefs- which they did not take to very kindly. She also expressed to them her mental health state, which was pretty much dismissed and she was told she needed to pray more. Her parents and I have never met, I don’t live at home, and when I do go home it is more convenient for her to come to my house as she is friends with my brother and other people that live closer to me (she lives in bfe). She has told me multiple times that she never really has friends over to her house because she lives in bfe, and there is much more to do in town closer to me so i never questioned it. Lately her parents have been blaming her change in personality (change in style&amp; her questioning her parents beliefs more, as well as smoking weed) on me. She tells me that she defends me to her parents and tells them that she had smoked for years before she met me, and that she isn’t an easily influenced person, if anything she influences others. Her parent’s hatred for me has grown over the past month because allie and i plan on living together next year and attending the same college- and they do not approve. Allie had an argument with her mom about me the other night, and it ended in her mom saying she didn’t even want to meet me at this point.  I am pretty hurt by this because i have never had a parent feel this way about me, let alone without ever meeting me. 

My parents suggested that I don’t even make an effort to meet them since they expressed this, and let it happen naturally like when allie and i move in together or a scenario like that. I feel like that makes it seem as though I have something to hide from them (i don’t), and want to meet them sooner to show them that i’m the nicest and funniest bitch they will ever meet (i want to make them feel guilty for thinking those things of me, not the main reason of why i want to meet them though.)

Allie has always had a strained relationship with her parents, they don’t have a ton in common and it brings about quite a few fights. I’m not trying to take away from what she has to go through on a daily basis by ANY MEANS. I have been with her through many hard times, and consoled her when her parents are being downright cruel. I’m just wondering what is the best move for me at this point, should I make an effort to meet them sooner and be the bigger person, or hang back and meet them whenever it happens? 

(Sorry that this is so damn long, just felt the need to explain the backstory too.)",03Dec2019,1
121,"Today marks the moment where my landlords decided that my shitty roommate is more important to keep than me.

I moved into a shared 4 Bd 2 Br home with an old friend from high school. One of her roommates was the landlords' son and he was moving out due to drama. The other was a 40 yr old friends of the landlords who has been living with them before the landlords moved out and he and their son stayed. Well my old friend asked to move in because the son was moving out and I was with family. I said sure, because at the time I would have been paying the same I was with my family just on my own. 

When I moved in, I found out the the 40 yr was in jail and was on his way to being evicted. The house was a total mess and half renovated. I figure whatever itll just be me and my friend until we found someone to move in once the guy moved out, no biggie right. I would just make sure to clean my area and try to keep the house tidy.

Well to my dismay that shit just didn't happen. The 40 yr talked his way out of being evicted so woo back to 3 people paying. Well that was nope. Me and my friend paid for him to squat until he got a new job when then he'd pay us for paying for his rent. I was like okay whatevers it's one month and he will pay us back. What I hadn't known at the time was that he also owed my friend money for his side of utilities for several months. 

So one month goes by. Nothing then two and he finally gets a job. Woo I get to stop paying more than initially thought. Great. That went well for about a month and a half. I went from two jobs to one as I thought the payment would get paid on his part and I'd be fine saving will paying a mild rate. But he never paid us for the months rent and he started to be late for his side of utilities.
My friend roommate had enough and decided to move out in the next month. Putting me on the fucking spot. I wasn't even two weeks off of quitting my job when she bailed on me.

So now I have to scramble to get the utilities in my name so I have power and water because I don't trust this 40yr guy with my money to pay the bills. I can't imagine what he may take my money and do beside paying the bills. So I get all that in order and pay the next months Bill's on my end with all the extra payments added onto when transferring and opening a new account. You know what it's like. That first months set of bill was so high but I ended up using my saving on it. Then I gave the 40 yr the amount he needed to pay which he promptly did at the end of the week.

So okay, I am back to paying more than I was initially promised and down a roommate. I had people who were looking but they fell through and I told my landlords we need a new roommate soon. One month go by, I use more of my savings on rent and Bill's and 40yr old pays his part. No worries but I tell landlords that I will look but it's their job to find someone and if my roommate doesnt pay I will immediately let them know because I wont stand for it. (I honestly have no footing to stand on so yea). Next month goes by and I pay for the rent and Bill's and i am left with 10 dollars to my name. Posted the utilities to roommate, he doesnt have it all and will pay me in interest next week. Cause he gets paid every friday. Whatever I got something which is better than nothing but j need the payment by next week. He does.

At this point I tell the landlord what happened and that if he doesnt pay I will want him to leave. I also ask them about a new roommates to crickets. Right now there are two empty rooms. They are fairly small but at least one can be filled. So nothing and the next months comes and I am stressed. Bill's get post and nothing from 4yr old. I become broke a week before payday. Text roommate again, nothing. Now it's been a whole month and he hasn't replied. At this point I'm pissed. I text the landlords about the situation and then I go to pay my rent and tell them that I want him evicted. Turns out he owed them money too and was warned to pay on friday or else face eviction. Seems like there was a silver lining here.

This happened two weekends ago. I told the landlords I wanted another roommate and that if he is evicted i wouldnt be paying the full 1k for the place and that it's not my problem but I also wanted 40 yr to move out if he didnt pay. I asked them to keep me updated which never happened. Thanksgiving happened and my car broke down, another long story of me dodging a bullet. Well anyways a week passed to today. I texted the landlords for updates, Turns out his deadline for friday or eviction didnt matter and he ended up paying on Sunday. To me that sounds like they chose him an unreliable tenant over me who is always on time and never late to pay Bill's or anything of that nature. I am quiet I do my duties around the house (another whole drama I wont get into) and I have done nothing except be an amazing tenant.

Now that you are up to date, I need advice. I have no saving for a deposit to move out and I dont make enough to afford a place to myself without looking for a second job which is proving to be difficult. I am currently thinking about becoming homeless for a few months to get my finances in order and then getting a place of my own. I need peoples advice here. Is this a good idea or are there other better options out there for me? Please help!!!",03Dec2019,1

Her sister had tagged everybody that she found her dead in her room. I was freaking out and didn't know what to do. Me and the chat group tried calming eachother down, but we were really overwhelmed and confused. And I couldn't imagine how chaotic it was for her sister, who claimed she was dead in the room across.

She blocked him, but that’s not enough. Who knows who else he’s preying on. What do I do? I’m in Canada.",03Dec2019,1
128,"My friend lives with about five sisters and his divorced dad. He occasionally visits his mom, but he is usually at his dad's place. He has came out to me as Bi, and I was the first person to hear about it (except for his boyfriend. That's an exception, obviously). I always thought he was asexual, but he turned out to be the opposite!

But today, he texted me ""I have a question, what sexuality are you? Like, gender or something"" and I told him the usual answer (he asked me this question a lot) ""Bisexual aromantic, cisgendered. I don't like to label myself though, I just see it as 'me'.""

And he asked me ""And you know my parents are catholic?"" and I replied ""Yeah, I've known for a few years""

And then I literally predicted what he was gonna say next. Right when I texted him ""Is this about coming out or something?"" he texted something like ""My parents would disown me if they found out I was bi, I'm only 14, I can't live by myself""

I asked him ""What makes you say that?"" and he told me ""My older sister just got kicked out of the house today because my parents found out she was a lesbian"" and I was honestly shocked.

He even told me they verbally said that homosexuals and bisexuals didn't exist, and those that did ""exist"" were demons of some sort. He also sent me his ""secret"" diary that had pages of him ranting about how he really wants to come out, but doesn't want his family to hate him (He loves his family), and is going into a depression. I was wondering why he never answered my texts or played with me on the PS4, that was why. He was becoming depressed! He was also complaining about his annoying sisters, but that is kind of irrelevant to the whole coming out thing.

Now he's asking me what to do! I've never been in love before, I never had to come out for anything, not even for my bisexuality! I honestly forget I'm bisexual sometimes.

My instincts are telling me ""Tell Edward that he shouldn't worry about what his sisters and parents think, and that he should just accept himself for what he is or whatever. He should just try to hide his secret relationship or something. What? Don't look at me like that, I'm not the advice expert, go ask your brain.""

My brain is telling me ""Create a system where your friend gives you money to buy gifts for his boyfriend, give the gifts to your friend, your friend gives the gifts to his boyfriend. If the two want to go on dates, pretend that they are friends, and they want to hang out with you. Then go to the movies, buy tickets to a seperate movie than your friend and his boyfriend, and everybody is happy. Sounds irrational? Like Mr. Instincts told me; I'm not an advice expert either. Ask your guts.

And my guts are telling me ""I want chicken quesadillas and pork bao. Please end this dreadful diet!"" so I really have nobody else to turn to but Reddit.

What if I tell him something that will end up changing his whole life in a negative way? If I tell him to just suck it up and tell his family, they might hate him for the rest of his life, I don't want the family he loves to hate him! Or if I tell him to hide the relationship from his parents, that is obviously an irrational solution. I don't know the exact consequences of that choice, but I can tell it's not the best.

Or what if I tell him to talk to a counselor at school, what if the counselor ends up going ""I'm calling your parents, and you're getting a detention"" and then he gets double screwed? I know that sounds unlikely, especially the detention part, but I don't know what to do either way!

To summarize--I have depression(ahh sounds really mainstream, but this isn't a joke). I don't like to talk about it, but these days my depression has been really suffocating. Like, cutting myself, provoking thoughts, etc. I don't really want to get into that, but keeping this in for so long may have not been a great idea. I, for the first time, tried to open up about my depression to my close friends(individually) after one of my friends found out(I kinda ran my mouth off, leading to him finding out). The thing is, the first friend that found out started to avoid me. Like, they'd try and stop the conversation, run off, and become pettier overall if I did something compared to other friends. I thought maybe he has something against me that I don't know about, so I tried to brush it off, to cope with it. I overthink things, so this really took a toll on my mental health. A couple of weeks later, my other close friend and I were sleeping over at my house. We didn't know what to talk about, so she asked if I had any secrets. I told her(she already knew since I told her about Friend A, the first person to find about my depression that ended up ignoring me) somewhat about my depression, and poured out a lot of what I had kept out to her. She seemed fine about it, but when I saw her at school, she was sort of ignoring me, which is major deja vu from the first incident. Are they afraid of my depression, me, or something I did? I really don't know, and I don't think I can deal with anything anymore. I don't mean to rant or bash on my friends, but I'm at a loss here.

One of Tina's dogs died over Thanksgiving and Michelle was being sweet, asking about how she was doing. Tina pulls out some pictures and at one point says, ""don't take offense at this but I always used to say this was his black [I didn't make this word out but i think something akin to ""nanny"", from context] Because I got her to take care of him."" 

I kinda froze the second I heard ""don't take offense..."" Because that's always followed by something offensive but then cringed when I heard her continue. 
Michelle is quiet for a long minute, Tina continues on ""don't think that's racist, that's just what I say.."" 

Finally, Michelle says, ""that is kinda racist. ""

Tina says ""no.. I should have called her mammy like in Gone with the wind, because I've always been obsessed with that movie. It's not meant to be racist.""

Michelle says ""I don't know how else to take that except racist."" 

They go back and forth a few times, not loudly, but firmly on both sides. 

Another co-worker (who was HR at a previous job)  pipes up, ""Tina, you should run anything you're going to say by me in the future."" 

Tina just laughs and says ""he always says that."" 

I still haven't looked up (making myself VERY busy with some papers) because I'm mortified and really uncomfortable. But I'm sitting there thinking i should support Michelle in some way but I have no idea how. 

Tina goes back to talking about her dog, Michelle politely responds just like before and I pretty much ran to the bathroom just to get away. 


So I guess my questions are: 

* What should I have said in the moment, if anything? 
* what should I have said afterward - to either or both of them? 
* should I say something to either of them tomorrow? 


I really want to be an ally, but tend to freeze in what I would deem socially awkward situations, and also don't know where the line is between ally and (literally white) white- knighting. 

If it's relevant, Tina tends to say a lot of offensive shit and I'm not really her biggest fan anyway, so I tend to avoid anything more than small talk with her if at all possible. 

Thanks in advance for any advice you might have!",03Dec2019,1
151,"I (15M) have had this friend for almost 2 years and we’ve been very close but recently he’s been acting terrible. It started about a month ago on a school trip where he hung out with his girlfriend constantly and was all over her and no one could stand them. He then texted me “fuck you” and threatened me so I moved rooms, but was later forced back in the same room. He apologized but it was very insincere and I tried to act like it never happened but it’s been very awkward. He doesn’t really ever talk to me and when he does it’s because he needs help or answers, if he does have a conversation it’s always very rude and hostile. I seen he was on a party on Xbox with other kids in a group chat we had and the texted in their things about close friends turning on them for no reason. I’m almost positive it was him because he tried to make me do similar things when we were friends. I’ve been struggling a lot at home with family problems and this just makes everything else hurt a lot more because he was one of the only friends I had, thanks for any advice.",03Dec2019,1

So I’ve been good friends with this guys for a little less than a year, but we’ve done a lot and gone to different countries together. We were super close last year, and well into the beginning of this current semester when he started to distance himself. It was hard because he was the one that called me his brother first then after that I reciprocated it too. Throughout the semester it’s felt like he’s put other people first and put me in the back burner so Ive talked to him multiple times hoping for change but nothing has changed. Over the past month he stopped sharing location and turned off read receipts and it feels like he doesn’t trust/ care for me anymore and idk why since I haven’t done anything..

These were the final straws for me because at first he stopped sharing about how he was doing and then it progressed to these and for me friendship is about trust and he doesn’t trust me or ask how I’m doing so I’m just exhausted. I try to plan everything and half the time he’s either to tired to do anything, or busy which I understand but for other people he’d make the time and hangout with them. So it feels like it’s only me that he’s doing this too and I’m hurt and angry because he was the one who first said I was like a brother. I now plan on telling him that I cannot he friends with someone who doesn’t reciprocate trust and care. I’m telling him that I’m willing to be his friend once he’s ready because all he thinks about is himself but for the time being we’ll be acquaintances and nothing more but I won’t wait forever. So am I justified?",03Dec2019,1
157,"My father lost his left middle and ring finger a few weeks ago, in a table saw accident. It was pretty gruesome. Luckily, he’s right handed and it took out his left fingers, but for the meantime he cannot use that hand at all.
Just three weeks before he’d retired after 29 years in criminal justice.
Following the accident, he was his usual tough self, darkly optimistic, and genial in the least. A lot of his coworkers came to visit him (hour drive to the hospital!) and he felt pretty validated.
It’s been a few weeks and he cannot get any sort of work- blue collars can’t have him do any sort of manual labor, and he’s been rejected from three white collar jobs because “his typing speed would be too low.” 
My mom told me that he’s having breakdowns when I’m not home and he feels like he’s useless, and I know he shudders at the thought of having my mom and I work to make up for him (he’s a bit old fashioned).
I’ve tried to distract him, but that’s going nowhere fast (we have watched all of the Mandalorian about five times), and he’s in a depressive haze. I have no idea what we could do for it with him to elevate his spirits. I know that he’s not going to be the same person he was before, but he’s depressed.
He’s very hard on himself, and especially that he “did it to himself.”

From what I've read, once the repair shop (I was sent there by my insurance company) considers it totalled, it isn't mine anymore? Even though I have full ownership of it, they can take it and sell it at a salvage yard and give me the money it's worth.

""I often see a silhouette of people when I look into mirrors. It kinda looks like when you push your eye and you see the black spot. I’ve seen animals in my house like a dog with Short brown curly hair, I looked it up it was a terrier, I’ve seen a black bear in my living room and I sometimes hear my cats going around the house when I’m a hundred percent sure they are outside. When I was younger I hid in the bathroom because I thought someone was robbing my house because I heard heavy footsteps and an office chair rolling across the hallway. My parents came home and found that the office chair was behind a closed door and there was no one inside the house. Also not too long ago I saw a little girl with black hair standing on the stairs. Didn’t look at face but she wore a white dress. I also never look into dark places because I feel like someone is staring back at me.  Often I go into a kind of phases wear stuff that should really be true is stuff I’m convinced is true. What I mean by this is I seem convinced that my 10-year-old little brother is smarter than he seems and only acts dumb. I sometimes believe that my friends plan for my downfall and are in a cult-like thing where they speak in code with each other. I experience sleep paralysis a lot now and 2 of the times I’ve had it a white figure is either slowly pushing or pulling me off of my bed. I get too scared to look. Other than that, everyone watches me. My phone, the government, my parents, my computer, they all watch me. Speaking of my phone when I put my phone near my ear I can hear Morse code and the phone speaks to me. It’s random letters but it’s a code. Also everyone’s “life” is predicted before they are conceived. When something random happens in your life it is to distract you from looking further into something.

175,"My wife is **19 weeks pregnant** and has been the bread winner of our little family while I’ve been in pharmacy school and undergrad the last 5 years.

She recently started a job in June of this year, and we got pregnant a month later with TWINS! We were floored, but her constant vomiting, nausea, and extreme fatigue caused her to use up all her vacation time and it didn’t get better from there. After a couple trips to urgent care (1-2 weeks apart) for similar headache/blood pressure reasons, her **OB ordered her to be on strict bed rest** (he said he ends up putting every woman with multiple births on bed rest at some point, it just depends on the timing or onset of the inherent “High Risk” complications that typically accompany these pregnancies).

At this point her job couldn’t make an “At home” position work for her, and she was left on the razor’s edge of making a decision to either file for short term disability, or risk getting terminated. I feel like I should point out that her job has been pretty understanding in these matters, and to my knowledge, they’ve done all they could (maybe they didn’t and this is another legal issue)?

Anyway, the day she filed for disability was 1 day before she would have gotten her paycheck (our last full check before Thanksgiving, Christmas, finals week, etc.) and as soon as her work received the short term disability application, they canceled her check (no prorated amount or anything), and we were left with almost nothing.

She’s been back and forth with her insurance company about getting some disability pay, but that’s been a grueling task of emailing back and forth (getting told to wait 5 days for processing, then getting told the paperwork wasn’t right, so we have to re-file and wait another 5 days). Now our land lord has run out of patience, our family has no way to help us, we’ve pawned everything that isn’t nailed down or critical for our daily lives. We’ve exhausted short term loans, and although our church has helped us in the past, they’ve told us that they can only help further if it’s for food or utilities. She doesn’t qualify for FMLA cause she wasn’t employed there for the minimum 1 year, and we won’t qualify for government assistance because her paperwork isn’t final, and she was told the last paycheck she received the 1st week of November disqualified us from any government aid.

I’ve tried to describe our situation, what recourse we’ve taken, and so now I’m asking everyone that can see this what options we have left?

***Is hiring counsel an option at all?*** 

**1-** Could an attorney help us get what we need from the insurance faster? 

**2-** Is there a possibility her work didn’t handle this the right way, and we should look for counsel?

***Are there any agencies or organizations we're forgetting about that could help/protect us while she's unable to work?***

I feel like I'm drowning, and every time I test a solution to see if it's going to keep us treading water, someone either puts their foot on my head, or tells me to ""take a number.""

**tl;dr**: Wife’s the breadwinner, but her pregnancy has made it so she can’t work. We’re barely keeping our heads above water, so we’ve (I’ve) turned to y’all for suggestions. Thank you in advance!",03Dec2019,1
176,"I have an account linked to my social media so I figured I needed an account I can talk openly on, so here we are.
I need help and advice about my family. So I have a pretty big extended family, my parents divorced a few years ago and they both moved on to happy marriages. The problem is they hate each other. My sister manages to balance this all quite well as she is away at uni, but me and my husband live right in the middle of it. Let me give you some set up for the events of tonight-
My sister tells me about her life and her boyfriend and tells me not to tell my parents. Obviously I do. I know her confidence is important but they’re her parents and they need to know how she’s doing etc. 
My dad and his husband very recently adopted two little boys and they are joys, and because my family is a toxic cat of drama they asked me to keep them away from it all. I agreed to this.
My mum is, well my mum and I talk to her and ask for her advice. She’s narcissistic and a gossip but foolishly I trust her confidence. I tell her about how I’m upset some plans with my dad changed and how I feel like I’m being pushed out of my dads happy little family with his two adorable kids. 
So, my mum blabs you my sister about how I feel about my dad. She tells her she doesn’t know why I talk to her about this stuff and she’s rather not know. She tells her this, apparently in tears. 
My dad blabs to my sister that I told everyone she has a boyfriend. (Very childish)
So, angry, my sister tells my dad I “gossip” about them to my mum. I don’t, I just get upset sometimes and well, she’s my mum. 
So tonight it blew up. My sister called me to scream at me. She tells me I’m a liar, I live to hurt people, and nobody likes me. She tells me that everyone agrees I love to “shit stir” and live for drama and nobody trusts me. She tells me everyone is sick of me acting like I’m dying (I have a chronic illness) and I’m pathetic. 
I text my dads partner to talk to him only to find out he and my dad were in the room while my sister was doing all this and they were ok with it. They told me they don’t want my drama and lies around the boys. 
I talked to my mum and asked her why she didn’t tell me she didn’t want to hear when I was upset with my dad and I asked her, upset, why she told my sister a twisted version of what I said.  She got upset with me.
I basically told everyone to leave me out of it. I told them I don’t want to hear about anyone’s life or drama anymore since I “can’t be trusted” 
So here’s where I need advice. I’m a grown woman with my own life and I don’t need this. I suffer mental health issues, and I broke a 4 year self harm free streak over this. 
My husband and my best friend tell me they aren’t worth it and they’re all toxic and at some point, after you’ve been stung the 50th time by the same people you need to walk away. 
But how do you just walk away from family? Should I just walk away from family? What would you do/what should I do?",03Dec2019,1

185,"I feel to comprehend the whole situation I have to give a few backgrounds on different aspects of our lives. This might be a long one, so I'll try to sort it so its easy to read, hopefully its still entertaining to read. 

**Character background**:  My brother can be what you call a man-child. Being in his mid 20s and the youngest in the family, I hear its common that the youngest sibling gets the most spoiled. He lacks basic responsibility, and has no regard to other people's belongings, and is high 100% of the time. An example would be taking whatever he wants from my room at anytime, without the slightest mention, causing me to flip my room over just to end up finding the item in his room.  He is very easily irritated, and would shout back at our parents, and other siblings if anyone tries to criticize him or tell him that whatever he's doing is wrong in anyway. Recently he has had a handful of times where he tries to fight me when I lose my patience with him and have shouted back. I remember the day that in his early teens he actually slapped our elder sister for telling him off. (She would have been in her 20s). We have had several interventions that end up with him storming out the house and making our family worry about him running around outside bare foot.  I can assure you although I'm kinda venting, that all this is 100% accurate and not exaggerated.  

**'Dating' background:**  My family can be said to be considered 'well off'  and we all live together in a house. Since he turned legal age, as one would go out to experience night life, he wouldn't hesitate to bring girls back for one night stands, with (I'm quoting here) him saying ""Girls are so cheap, once I bring them back to the house and they see it, they just drop their pants"" My parents do not know the many escapades of his, but after bumping into random girls in the morning, they have strictly told him not to bring strangers to the house anymore. As expected, he just became more discreet and actively avoid getting caught instead. 

Now to **his partner** \-  He claims to have met this girl many moons ago, but from my brother's mutual friends, they met in a club. Where I quote again ""Jealous after seeing me talking to another hotter chick, she just jumped on me right away""  The start of their relationship was uneventful, our parents were happy seeing him staying at home more and being less of a club rat. It was until I started noticing and hearing awful stories of hers. From our mutual friends, people have heard her talking about her new rich boyfriend, talking about the perks of dating this guy etc. She has since quit her full time job and tags along wherever our family goes. Among other red flags.. Our cousins have overheard her asking him to move into our house ASAP, and that if he ever breaks up with her she will kill herself. 

Ill try to **summarize** here... So I have a spoiled man-child of a brother, who doesn't listen to anyone's advice. categorized as 'small man syndrome' by our family, dating a gold digger who has leeched on and will do anything to stay on.  When I talk to my parents, they don't seem to mind as long as he is happy.  Although they kind of turn a blind eye, especially since she treats our parents vastly different than how she treats the rest of the family/extended family. 

I don't feel like I will ever be able to get through to my brother, especially when he can explode at anytime when anyone criticizes him, not to mention talking to him about his gold digger girlfriend.  Do you have any advice on how I can manage or cope with this? I am planning on moving out soon with my fiance, but without someone putting a close eye on him, I feel he will just run rampant and escalate his doings.",03Dec2019,1

190,"I don't normally ask the internet for advice but I'm scared this is what is going to ruin my relationship... it's also kind of a long story so here we go. 

In 2017, I started dating a boy who I really really liked. He was my best friend and I eventually fell in love with him. I thought things were going really well with us, but after about a year of dating, he dumped me--seemingly out of the blue. This devastated me. I cried over him for about 6 months. I met a few other boys in this time, but no one seemed to stick because I was always thinking about him. After those 6 months, I was beginning to feel confident and was crying over him less and less. When I was finally at a place where I was ready to leave him behind, I thought I'd reach out to be his friend. He agreed and we talked for a while platonically but about a month later, he told me he loved me again. He said he didn't regret breaking up with me because if he had continued being unhappy it would have turned out badly for the both of us, but because he feels that we had both changed we could try things again. I, naturally, was extremely skeptical. He had to prove himself all over again to me. I was not going to let someone who broke my heart as badly as he had come right back into my life just because he asked. He has spent every day since then jumping through hoops and doing every thing he can to prove that he deserves to be back in my life.

It's been about 9 months since then and he and I spend every minute of every day either with each other or talking to each other. I really enjoy his company and he makes me laugh all the time. He also spoils me rotten with attention and love and has given me all the things I was missing from him the first time we dated. He asked me to be his girlfriend again sometime in those 9 months and I couldn't say no. I really love him and he and I have talked about a future together (marriage, kids, house, the whole shebang).

Our love story has been odd, but has mostly turned out for the better. The only problem is that I am 23 years old currently living with my parents to save money while in graduate school. My parents are very protective, very strict, and very Asian. The culture in the Philippines, where they are from, is very much one of ""if you hurt one of us, you hurt all of us"", and they have verbally communicated their disdain for my ex/current boyfriend many many times in the two years since we broke up. I've gotten away with keeping this relationship a secret from them for 9 months, but I love them and I feel horrible about lying to them all the time to get out of the house to see him. It is also important to tell them because my boyfriend (who is white and does not exactly understand how my culture works) is beginning to feel like I am hiding him because I am ashamed of him or am unwilling to go through what my parents' opinions are about us to stay with him. He also has stopped talking to me about ""future plans"" because he says he doesn't feel comfortable thinking that far ahead when we can't even tell my parents about us right now. This hurdle is causing a stagnation in the natural progression of our relationship and time is running out. I really have to tell them, but I am not sure how. Or when, for that matter, but I do know it has to be soon. Does anyone with parents like mine have any ideas?? Every time I think about it I get extremely anxious, so I have avoided it, but now I don't think I can. Please help me!

**tl;dr:** **I got back together with my ex-boyfriend who previously made me very sad but currently makes me very happy and I don't know how to tell my parents without them shaming me or us. Anyone have any ideas?**",03Dec2019,1
191,"My earliest memory is of me sitting on the closed toilet at 3 years old in tears, promising God that no matter what my family said, I would always believe in Him. I was raised by two atheist parents who taught me to be completely ignorant of religion. However, I always felt that I was different from them. I never accepted the atheist lifestyle, and I have always refused to call myself an atheist. I'm 16 and can't drive myself because I'm a dumbass (different story, long story), but I want to start going to church. I want to transition into a Christian lifestyle. My parents would kill me if I told them I want to go to church, and I don't really have any religious friends who could help me out. Even if I did, I'd be too embarrassed to tell them all this. There's something inside me that has always known I'm meant to follow God, but I don't know how to do it when I'm surrounded by atheists.

202,"Throwaway account as you can see. I won't give much detail but I'm pretty much low middle class and starting my volunteer work for resume experience and hours towards graduation and scholarships, so I can't really get a job for a few months.
I switched schools this year and I still keep in contact with a handful of friends from last year. One of them has been paying me to do her homework and it was fine except she took an entire month to pay me back and only paid me when she needed me to do something else for her (as I refused to do any of her work until I was paid, but to be fair I kept pestering her about it and practically begged asking if she had the money as I had broken a girls phone). 
I took another job from her and I finished it under 2 days later. It's been a little over a week and like last time she claimed to have no money but I've seen her go shopping, to the movies, and went to Disney although I'm not sure if I'm jumping to conclusions here and perhaps her parents have paid for all of this (last year we pretty much got confirmation that her family is really upper middle class I'd say? her sisters are fundraising for trips and yet i also see them go on expensive trips together all the time so maybe this family just has budgeting issues). I'm scared to confront her because we've had a falling out before and I'm not sure if I can take any action against her without getting in trouble myself if she flat out refuses to pay me. This time it's been 2 days since I asked about the money and she hasn't even replied but I know she's active because she's been posting on Instagram and texting other people. I really needed the money this weekend/today as I just wanted to get a really good deal on socks lol since all of mine are getting holes in them.

I can't tell her this because she would ""threaten"" me by saying she will kill herself if I leave her... I'm really lost about that, I hope someone will be able to help me somehow...

222,"Hey Reddit, I'm in quite the emotional labyrinth that I can't seem to find a way out of, let me explain.

Im a highschool senior, and a few months ago I started dating this girl. It was good at first but then I found myself in a seemingly one sided relationship. She said she loved me but she didn't show it. 

When I started dating this girl, I also met my future soon to be best friend (oddly enough the girl I was dating and my best friend have the same first name, but that's just an unfortunate coincidence) this friend would help me with advice and assist me in doing romantic things for my girlfriend. During this time she had began to develop feelings for me and I had felt the same way towards her. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not the type of guy to cheat on somebody. I enjoy doing nice things for my significant other often. 

I was being seemingly ignored by my girlfriend and the only other person I spoke to was someone I spent pretty much every day with and that made me laugh my ass off everytime I saw her. ; someone that I felt like I could pour my heart out to without any semblence of judgement.

One day, my friend and I hang out pretty late and we end up buying a blanket, snacks and drinks, then we headed to the nearest vacant part at about 10:00pm on a cold ass November night. (This was during a brief period if time where my girlfriend and I had broken up and my friend was keeping me company bc I was sad.)

We watched YouTube and laughed for a couple of hours. I was freezing and she noticed so she told me to hold her hands to warm mine up. After a few moments of silence I went in for the kiss without even thinking. She expressed that she was really happy that I did so.

A day or two passes and I am visibly upset about the break up. I wasn't necessarily sad that it ended, I just didn't like seeing someone I cared about so sad...

My friend and I go out to eat and she ends up feeling sick and calls a ride home. She later tells me that her brain is still processing the experience of being romantic with me
She tells me that she may just need to be friends because her emotions are really out of whack.

I tell her I understand and that I'm here for her no matter what

A few days pass and I get back together with my gf ( she tries to make things right and she tells me she will change so I decide to give it one more shot.)

My friend eventually stops talking to me (save for a ""happy Thanksgiving"" text she sent me)

We date and things do get better, but I have this underlying feeling that i just don't lover her like I did before... This goes in for about 3 weeks until I feel so sad that I just have to tell her how I feel. 

We broke up an hour ago...

They enjoy the band to an intense degree, going so far as to travel across the country for multiple concerts.

I recently designed some merchandise, and my friends were there insisting that they helped, and when I presented it to the band, my friends tried to take credit.

230,"How to tell overbearing boss and other night manager coworker that I will be leaving?

Long story.  I've worked at this airport motel since the beginning of December (I know it isn't a long time but hear me out). I was basically forced into the job by my mum because she has worked with my boss previously, however my boss is a very overbearing and is a sort of ""you have no choice"" sort of person when it comes to work hours. He's not all bad he is understanding of different situations but here's the problem. It is a night shift job so can be any hours between 9pm and 4am which I thought would be able to work into my schedule with uni etc.

 However, I have a puppy who's 6 months old and he gets me up at 6.30am every morning without fail and this make its hard to survive on 2 hours sleep and then be expected to do another night shift the same day. I am on a casual contract and originally the boss, the other night manager and I agreed that I'd be doing only a maximum of 2 days a week, which i was fine with. But now, this other night manager is constantly asking me to pick up night shifts for her and I've ended up doing 8-9 night shifts in a row on 3-4 hours sleep a night and it is getting too much. 

They also like to do their rosters for work a month in advance and I've only rostered myself to on the 31st of December and haven't given indication of work days past that. I am just wondering since I'm on a casual contract should I just give my notice now so they have ample time to find a replacement before my departure? I am just worried about my boss and co-nightmanager making my life hell from the day I give my notice until I leave. I don't like confrontation and would prefer to leave very quietly and quickly.

Sorry for the long story, any advice is appreciated :)",03Dec2019,1
231,"So my husband works at a local company at one of their warehouse distribution locations. It's in a high crime area of town and is on a secluded side street. As long as hes worked there ( 5 years ) there have been multiple issues with their work truck, which they park right in front of the door. People siphoning gas and smashing out the cab windows etc. They have put a locking gas cap in but that hasn't done anything, now people just drill into the gas cap or cut into the fuel line. 
Last Friday I dropped my husband off like normal, but when we pulled up there was a car parked in front next to the truck. We thought it was odd but it does happen ( it was 10am) I left and when I got home I got a call from my husband telling me that the guy who was parked out front was siphoning gas and when he went out to confront him the guy pulled a gun on him. He called the cops and his general manager both rushed over. The general manager said she was going to go buy security cameras that day, and my husband told her how unsafe it was to have the truck parked in front like that. There are plenty  of places close by where you can park work vehicles to keep them secure when they aren't being used.
 Today he went in  for his shift and the GM said she hasn't gotten the cameras but was going to try and get some this weekend or sometime soon... I'm really uncomfortable and upset that they aren't taking his safety seriously, we are new parents and I bring our daughter with us to drop him off often. My question is, is it inappropriate for me to write a calm but firm email to the GM and owner (who I've met multiple times) letting them know how upset I am that this situation isn't being taken seriously and the proper safety precautions taken. We know the company has the means to get security cameras it just feels like they are dragging their feet and just ignoring this constant escalating problem.",03Dec2019,1

Also, I know this sounds like a load of high school drama and BS, which is what I have been trying to tell myself, but I guess i need confirmation. Sorry for the long post. 
Full disclosure: this is a throwaway account.

Two years ago, me (20F, 18yo then) and a group friends went to a party.   We were all drunk  (drinking age is 18 where I live), dancing and having fun. All of a sudden someone grabs my hand and turns me around (I sort of go with it thinking it was one of my friends) , which makes me dizzy, and before I can even look at this person’s face they are kissing me. It took me some seconds to realize what was going on but when I did I pushed him away. The whole thing happened so quickly most of my friends didn’t notice,

The next day someone tells me and my friends that they saw who I was kissing, Apparently he was sort of a “joke” (I don’t even know why) and he had made out with a bunch of other people at the party. In a short amount of time everyone who had been there, and some people who hadn’t, knew that I had ‘made out’ with this guy. I was endlessly teased about it, even when I repeatedly said that the second I realized what was happening I pushed him away. At the time something felt wrong about the whole thing, but I know that sometimes I take myself too seriously so I tried to laugh with them about it. I know that it was all meant as harmless teasing and joking, but it did go on for a while and i kept feeling embarrassed and humiliated.  I promised myself I would never be that drunk again. 

So why am I still thinking about this? Well, since then, I’ve learnt a lot more about consent, and I’ve had more time to think about the situation. I had never looked at this guy before, had never talked to him, hadn’t given him any indication that I wanted anything to do with him.  Yes,  I was drunk, but that didn’t give him the right to kiss me without my permission. I think I know that now. I’m honestly not even that upset by his attitude; the thing that keeps hurting me is the way my friends acted. Even though I never said the words “I didn’t want it to happen” (and that’s on me), they didn’t listen to what I did say. They joked about it for a really long time , and I guess I’m hurt by the fact that no one thought to ask me how I felt about it. I know they didn’t mean to hurt me but they did, and every now and then (not often) someone mentions the guy in some random conversation and I feel hurt once more. Am I being too dramatic ? Should I just let this go? I’ve tried to do it but I’ve failed.  Is it too late to talk about this to my friends? I don’t want to sound ridiculous or like a drama queen, specially since I know that this guy didn’t really hurt me in any way. 

Thanks for any advice",03Dec2019,1

238,"Let’s say the person you thought was one of your closest friends actually:

-told people you didn’t even know your most personal info to make them hate you

-spread horrible lies that made you seem unstable / crazy / not a good person

-said you weren’t even friends you were just forced together

-tried to manipulate others into disliking you


And then when you found this out you didn’t reach out (but didn’t ignore them, they ALSO didn’t reach out) for one day and then they gossiped and flipped out on you for ignoring them. And then tried to sabotage you. Would you confront them? Or just let this friendship go? I’m so deeply hurt by the things this person has done and yet they continue to try to turn my friends against me (who tell me everything they say, so it’s not like I don’t know what they’re doing). And I’ve been so supportive and kind to this person and literally have always said how grateful I was for their support and also have supported them in turn. And now I find out we “were just forced together” and it just cuts deep. 

Should I address this and explain myself? I already apologised IN PERSON for “ignoring” this person, when I actually didn’t even ignore them, I just didn’t initiate conversation for ONE DAY, but neither did they. They accused me of like pulling someone aside to talk about them, but in reality I pulled this person aside because I found out they were cutting, and as someone who has dealt with this, I felt they would want it to be discussed in front of everyone but I needed to talk to them about it. And I explained that it was a private matter to said person, so I couldn’t elaborate. Idk. 

Part of me wants to just let it go but part of me feels I should call this person out because I actually apologised IN PERSON and you know what they did? Ignored me and put the air pods ( that *i* gave them ) back into their ears and blanked me.

244,"throwaway because my friends know about my main account. also, sorry if this doesn't make sense, i'm gonna try my best to explain the situation without writing a whole essay

So at the beginning of August, I started going to a new school. I didn't know anyone, so for the first month I basically isolated myself and didn't talk to anyone.

My school is fairly small, so a lot of students have almost the same schedules with each other. I had the same schedule as 2 girls who were already friends. These girls started talking to me and inviting me to hang out with them. We all got along pretty well and they introduced me to more of their friends.

By this point in the school year, I have about 4 close friends who I've become more comfortable with. I know that my actual personality is really annoying and probably unpleasant for a lot of people to be around. I felt like people had already become annoyed of me, so I tried to separate myself and talk less, but ended up acting the same way.

Then today, a boy I knew told me that he heard 2 of my friends talking bad about someone, but he couldn't say who. I asked one of them about this, and all she said was that it was someone that I knew. After that class, I stayed after to talk to the teacher, and then I went into the bathroom, which is where my friends usually meet up at this time. I entered the bathroom quietly and heard them talking about me. Three of them were saying that I was embarrassing to be around and that they want me to just be by myself again, while one of them argued that they couldn't abandon me, and that I would be left without friends. 
I want to try and separate myself from them, but it's difficult to. I've disliked my friend group for a while, but didn't want to tell them about it... What should I do in this situation to prevent getting hurt?

Than 2 days later she choked a child for attempting to take her lunch. There is what I feel the normal sibling behaviors between the two of them at home. I am not physical in punishments with my kids but my ex still spanks. This came from her husband who was asking me how they act with me, and informing me they are terrors with them.

Background on my ex. She has borderline personality disorder, depression, PTSD, and others I cant remember. She remarried within 5 months of the divorce, and did not tell her family, (I know because they get in communication with me since my ex wont let them talk to the girls). She also claims to be terrified of me physically, even though she filled out court documents saying she assaulted me, and I did nothing to her.

I have told the teachers and their therapists to come to me with any issues, but I did not find out about the stabbing until 2 weeks later when I noticed it on a take home calendar she has, which my ex signed and did not inform me of).

This morning 12:33 AM, she sent me an email. She thinks that her mom is planning to kill her. I've met her mom before, and she seems like not a great mom (still calls Emma he and by her old name, is rude, shouts often) but the vibe me and two other friends (who have both dealt with abusive parents) got was bad mom but not insane. None of us think the mom is actually planning on killing Emma. Something we can also all agree on is that Emma is weird. She talks different, walks weird, etc. Like I mentioned earlier, she is also transgender which may be piling more onto a bad situation or just her trying to cope. I'm also transgender and I'm not pretending I understand every trans person ever but it seems like her transgenderism may be a coping method to be someone else.

I’m trying to ship a gift to a lady on Reddit a gift for the holidays. How can I ship her the gift without her giving out info for privacy reasons?  
There was a company called karma, you purchase a gift, and the recipient would get a notification by email or on a social media platform like Facebook 
and then the recipient would enter an address to have it delivered to them. The company was bought by Facebook and the company faded out for whatever reason.

One of them is he dates every single female friend (I’m a female myself) that I introduce to him. He fell in love with my newest friend, he’s known her for a grand 2 weeks, and that’s fine, I’m happy for them. I’ve started dating a guy I’ve obsessed over for about a year. I’m happy. But I got paranoid about whether or not my BF actually likes me, he asked me out really fast and I had feeling for him long before we became friends. But anyways, I told jake about some really personal issues I was having, and how it’s hard to break up with my BF when he’s consistently being amazing and reassures me on every tiny thing. The problem is, as soon I (jake goes to a different school than me, my bf, and “Ella”,  my new best friend) got to school today, Ella addressed me and asked if everything was fine with my BF because she heard I was trying to break up with him. I never told her anything. I don’t open up to people, I put my trust in jake (whom I already told not to send screenshots to Ella, once before), vented, which I rarely do, and he just told his newest girlfriend (who happens to be my current best friend. Don’t get me wrong, I lover her, but she tries to fix my problems all the time. I act smaller around her because she has this “Alpha Complex” about her but it’s just gotten really annoying, because I have to keep dumbing myself down, or feeling weaker just to pass as someone she can baby) And I was going to open up about my doubts with my BF to her, but she just told me she was going to talk to him and see what’s up. I did NOT want that. I wanted her advice, not for her to confront him. And when I was trying to explain the conversation my BF and I had, I was basically stuttering and couldn’t form a complete sentence because of how overwhelmed I was. I had asked if sending her screenshots of my BF and my messages so she could understand it, but she said, “With his permission, yeah”. Generally, that’d be a good statement. But in my best friends, I want someone who’s willing to keep quite, listen, and not snitch on me when I’m trying to got advice. I want someone who’d rob a store with me, as silly as that sounds.

I didnt want to ruin our friendship so I just kept it a secret until I finally told lily about it (this was like 2 years ago).

265,"This happened 1 year ago maybe and I’ve been thinking about it randomly at times. 
So we went on this “family” trip...

It was me (20), My Dad, His girlfriend and my dads girlfriend brought her son (26) who also brought his girlfriend (23) on a trip with us. 

Let’s call my dads girlfriends Son (X) and his girlfriend (Y). 

(Y) was actually really gorgeous who also looked like my Ex. 
Anyways I’m the type of guy to not know when a girl is hitting on me unless she’s being very blunt about it. 

Long story short, we were on our way home. 

We sat in the back of the car  (Y) was in the middle and her boyfriend (X) sat on the right side. 

During part of the car ride (Y) put her hand on my thigh and at first I thought maybe we were turning and she didn’t want to lean on one side too much. But (Y) kept her hand their for a good 5-10 minutes and I was very confused. 

I didn’t say anything as I was pretty shy and just let her be. Kinda looked over to see if (X) noticed but I don’t remember if he did. 

Anyways, this was a pretty stupid post but do you guys have any idea why she (Y) did this? 

We don’t talk anymore, not like we really did anyways but always wanted to know what her intentions were. 

Like I said she could’ve flirted with me initially when we meant and stuff but I would never know because I’m dumb as fuck when a girl try’s to show signs.

So I've been asking some other people what they thought about birthday gifts and their meaning.  I got some mixed responses.  Any thoughts? Do birthdays define the importance of a relationship?

268,"So.. I dated this guy about like 4-5 years ago. He was a childhood friend, he's also on the spectrum even though I never noticed, his mother told me. My mom and his mom are still really good friends. We dated for about a year and a half. Honestly before my current girlfriend, he was one of the best relationships I've ever had. We broke up by force because my mom didn't want me dating someone on the spectrum. 

Back story over. Now onto the fucking t e a. I never stopped loving him, we stopped talking about a year after the break up. The next year I started talking to him again because I missed him a lot, and I wanted him back in my life. He had a new girlfriend and of course it was one of the girls who hated me to most for no reason at all, never did anything to her. We started hanging out and my feelings just returned and I was like shit. Not again. He couldn't bring himself to break up with her. And here's the thing that's fucking me up. He told me he still loved me. We were holding hands and stuff, he brought me home from school because we had the same after school activity. He was amazing but I felt like shit because it was like, cheating. But at the time I couldn't care less because I had him back kinda. And I took what I got. At the time I was very protected and not sexually active. One night after a party after a month of this going on. He drove to a park close to my house and things just escalated. We had sex in the back of his car. It went on the same, sex in his car, holding hands. Shit like that. For the next month or so. Then he came over to my house while my parents were out of town. Same thing. But before that he stopped saying I love you. Stop texting me back. But I thought to myself if I kept giving him what he wanted he would maybe love me again. But boyyyy was I wrong. A few weeks later, starting feeling ill. Keep in mind, all of this was unprotected. Every single time. Thankfully I wasn't pregnant but I was scared and so was he. I also learned he was a douchebag because he also said he wouldn't help take of the kid if I was pregnant. I understand. We're kids but damn that was rude. Not even slightly helping. After that. I kept blocking him and adding him back. I was so angry but I missed him. I still loved him. It was like an obbsession. I did everything he asked. Gave him my time and energy. And I got nothing but being left on read and attitude. After that went down. I went off and him and blocked him. That was 5 months ago. It was easier because school ended. 3 months ago my mom found the test wrapper I guess I left behind, confronted me, I told her. And she was mad. But not at me. It was the first time she was ever sympathetic towards my pain. She just sat and hugged me and told me it was gonna be fine. I loved her for that. I'm still going to therapy. Everytime someone talks about him, I just start crying and getting defensive. My girlfriend is a little concerned. And so is my mom. My dad still doesn't know and my friend are still trying to support me.

That's the whole story. I'm sorry for rambling I do that when I'm stressed. The last two weeks everythings been catching up. I've been crying s lot more over him. And paranoia, thinking I'm gonna see his face again. I've been having nightmares. The same as when he and I were dating. Him leaving me even though I don't even talk to him anymore. Or just me seeing him in general scared me half to death. I honestly don't know what to do. Im debating on confronting him about things to get it settled. But I know he has his own shit going on.

Thank you to anyone who have taken the time to read my last thread or responded. You don't know how much it help to know that there are someone out there that care, even if they are strangers.

I have decided to contact HR to explore my options. Today a person I know from HR got my case and let me know about family leave and paid family leave for New York. I have talked to my brother and my parents and decided that a viable course is to take the paid family leave of 10 weeks and try to find a new place of employment in Cali.

I will start to fill out the paperwork; hopefully I can help my mother to deal with her illness soon.

I'm a software developer so I plan to talk to my manager tomorrow if he would allow a short time of work from home before the leave so that I can come home sooner.

I am unable to just quit my job outright because I still need the income to help my parents. I am unsure if I am making all of these plans on a bad head, please advice if you think I can try something else.

272,"This is going to be a very long, messy, personal, and my first post so please bear with me. Is this a throwaway account if I never really use Reddit anyways?

I'm 15F, 16 in 3 months, and I want to save up to get away from my family once I graduate.

For a little background (warning for pathetic sobstory), my family is really toxic, borderline abusive, and just does not know what they're doing. My mom likes to treat herself at the stylist's or nail salon a little more than her wallet can handle. My stepdad skips work or leaves early at least once a week or two for no reason, and when he was unemployed, spent 3 months playing video games at home. I don't know if he was actually actively looking for jobs at the time, but he certainly didn't seem stressed about helping to support a family of 5. My mom can at least keep a steady job, but does nothing around the house. My stepdad does laundry, occasionally cleans, and is capable of cooking spaghetti, canned soup, and frozen food. They use me for free babysitting, and I do the dishes. My mom will go to the doctor for foot pain but neither me nor my siblings have seen a doctor in years, aside from once when I was in the hospital for mental health issues. On top of everything, they're just plain rude and disrespectful. My mom's word is law, there is almost no negotiating with her, she is very selfish, and has absolutely no respect for boundaries, especially mine. My stepdad loves to make his voice heard, and will always throw his two cents in even if it upsets someone. When he, on the other hand, is upset, will yell and shout and throw a tantrum rivaling those of his daughter, who is actually in the appropriate age range to be throwing them.

You can imagine how badly I want *out*.

I've already tried to. About a year ago I snapped and got the courage to get a teacher to call CPS on them. Really foolish in retrospect, my siblings and I would've been separated and any or all of us could've ended up someplace worse. But I was desperate for any escape, and for them to get the justice they deserve. I still think that's what *should* have happened, but the social workers left after the home investigation, said they'd be back later to check up on us, and never returned. However I did succeed in upsetting most of my relatives and my mother giving me one of the worst nights of my life after the social workers left. Woo.

I considered trying to get myself emancipated but quickly realized it'd be impossible. California is one of the most expensive states to live in, and I doubt I'd be able to financially support myself right away. I think even a part time job would be pushing my limits with my poor physical condition. So optimally, get out of California. Can't do that without money, and I currently have a whopping $3 to my name. From their reactions to me calling CPS, none of my relatives would be willing to take me in if I were somehow successful. I don't really have friends here, either.

I could try and do what my whole family wants ~~is pressuring~~ me to do, and go to college somewhere nice and start off from there. If there's anything they all love to do, it's pressure me about school. Because I am capable of getting near perfect grades, they believe that I should always do so, and push myself. ""Take Honors and AP courses, Hopeful-Piece."" I'm absolutely sick of it. If I'm going to torment myself, I at least want to do it for something important to *me*. I'm not even sure if I want to go to college. Maybe later, when the thought of my entire family's reactions to a couple of Cs doesn't send me into a breakdown. I don't have the motivation to do the work the teachers ask me to because I just can't bring myself to care. If I can't handle one AP and two Honors courses, I won't be able to handle college right after graduating.

Here's what I really want to do, and would have a chance of working out.

Drop the hard classes so school isn't dragging me as much, and get a part time job. Save up as much as I can until graduation. My best friend lives in Florida, and while it'd only be a bit cheaper to live in than California, I'd be happier than ever. Won't go too off the rails here, but they're probably the only reason I'm here right now. They've given my life more meaning than I could ever find on my own. I realize this sounds impulsive, but give me the benefit of the doubt. This is the only outcome for my life that isn't depressing to think about and brings a smile to my face.

With my state's minimum wage, including the minimum wage of -85% for the first 160 hours for minors, at 20 hours a week, the lowest I'd be able to save is $21,440 if I start in August of 2020 and stop when I graduate in June 2022.

Estimating the maximum I'd get with any part time job I can, doing 30 hour weeks with $15 an hour would net $39,500 saved up by graduation.

After graduation I could do full time in Florida (I hope to leave as soon as possible after graduation). Minimum wage (currently $8.46) and 40 hour weeks would be $1,353.60 monthly. Optimistic $20/h would be $3,200 a month. The small apartments I've been looking at have rents from $650-$800 a month. Because despite everything I am still just a silly teenager, I'm not sure what other expenses there would be or taxes, or whatever stupid adult problems someone will point out once I post this thread, but optimally I would have those sweet sweet savings to keep me steady if need be. Look at me, Mom and step-jerk, budgeting, instead of, you know, having to rely on relatives to keep us all from getting evicted.

There's still a couple of roadbumps I don't have complete control over, though. First obvious one is if I can't get a job, whether because I can't find one, don't have transportation, or because my mother won't let me. I still need to learn how to drive, and even if I get a license, we only have one car. Walking to/from work alone longer distances at night is just not safe, and it'd take more energy out of me. Really wishing someone bothered to teach me how to ride a bike as a kid so I wouldn't be so restricted to shorter distances. I should be able to manage my mom, and if she absolutely refuses to I can talk with other family members to try and help persuade her. I'll have to argue my point on why I should be worrying about money more than advanced classes, but they're easier to convince.

Then there's worrying that I can't *keep* a job, maybe because of the physical or mental drain. I think I mentioned that I have really low endurance, and most jobs minors can do require you to be on your feet the entire shift. While I hope I can just bear with it, I'm not entirely sure if I'd be able to. And while I don't like to diagnose myself, I've noticed that once or twice a year I get heavy depressive episodes and lose motivation for almost everything. It fixes itself with a change in my life, so I'm hoping a big change to my daily routine and the fact that I'm doing all of this for *me* will keep it from hitting too hard.

I *should* be able to learn to drive and get a license in time, especially if I'm working. There'd be no reason for someone *not* to teach me, and people have already brought the topic up before.

My mom and stepdad's financial irresponsibility really worries me, though. I mentioned before that they almost got evicted, and don't really make the best choices. It scares me that there's a possibility that they'll turn to what I'm earning and start making me set aside money for them, and I have no idea what to do about it if they do.

Any advice for any of my concerns are really appreciated.

TLDR; Family's toxic and pressuring, I've determined that the best way to escape them (besides going off to college and destroying my mental health) is to move across the country once I graduate. If I can convince my mom to let me, I want to get a part time job and start saving up, from my calculations I can save about $20-40k by the time I graduate, *if* my parents leave it alone. Not much transportation or physical endurance could make it harder to get/keep a job. My mental health could get in the way as well, though it should be manageable. I've also determined where I want to live, and that a full time job once I move there would be between $1.3-3.2k. Rent for a small apartment would be $650-800 monthly, but I'm not sure what else I'd have to pay for or how to adult. Please help a teen to adult.",03Dec2019,1
274,"I am a graduate from the UK living in the states.

There are a couple of areas in my life that I feel that I should address in order to be happier and more content.

1) Relationship: I am in a long term (long distance) relationship with someone here in the states. She is kind, funny, incredibly intelligent and genuinely cares about me. The only issue is that sometimes I feel sort of inadequate and maybe not smart enough for her. I think I worry too much about the relationship falling apart. She is 2 years older than me and seems to have her life more together.

2) Career: I’m currently completing an internship in the city. I have a bachelors degree in Art+design but feel it hasn’t  prepared me for  a proper career and has led me to working manual labor jobs in a field that is highly competitive while not offering many prospects. I’m thinking about going back to school when I go home but don’t know what I want to do.

3) General: Because of the issues above I often feel anxious, like I’m not good/smart enough and will probably never amount to anything. Also I was never diagnosed but I am fairly sure that I might be dyslexic. I am not a strong writer. I find that my natural state is laziness.

I wouldn't say I'm infatuated with her but I'd say I enjoy spending time with her and I try to spend as much time as I can with her. When I'm with her time flys, we just hangout and have fun. Maybe I like her so much because our relationship is innocent and she doesn't have anything to gain by hanging out with me. Sunday we sat for 5 hours watching movies, then we went for a walk on the woods for about an hour while it was lightly snowing. 

I don't know how to explain all the reasons I like her but it's mainly because I can let my guard down around her and I know she isn't trying to hustle me because she wants something. She just enjoys spending time with me.

284,"I currently have an A.A. degree (graduated summa cum laude) and I’m in my B.S. program. 

I’ve had some major life changes this year, and it’s significantly impacted my school life. For starters, I got pregnant earlier this year, and I’m due in 5 weeks. I also work at a very well known retail chain, and my manager quit so almost all of her responsibilities fell onto me (without any sort of pay increase). So my workload at my job has tripled, I’m 35 weeks pregnant, and a full-time student. I would look for another job, but nobody will hire me at this point I’m my pregnancy.

This semester is coming to an end and it’s been incredibly difficult. My pregnancy had been a breeze up until about 29 weeks, when this fatigue hit me like a bus. I can’t stay awake in any of my classes, let alone while I’m studying. If I do manage to stay awake while I’m studying, I can’t retain any information. I’ve been failing all of my quizzes and exams, turning in work late, and missing classes simply because I can’t bring myself to get out of bed. My job isn’t working with me either - I’m only part-time, but I’m scheduled 39 hours weekly and it’s just adding to the exhaustion. I would start my maternity leave tomorrow if I could, but my request was denied since they require 30 days notice before maternity leave begins.

I suggested we buy tickets today while the deal is there. We experienced some technical difficulties during the reservation process and her ticket cost $492 while mine went up to $548. Would it be unreasonable of me to ask her to split the $56 dollar difference with me since I was the one who saw the low price on the first place? I am not saying that she would pay me $56 but that we would split it and she would pay me $28. Is this too much for just $28?,03Dec2019,1
288,"So, for a little which now, I’ve just been feeling pretty bad lately, but I never really talk to anyone about it because I don’t want to bother them with how I’m feeling, and so I just internalise it even though it isn’t healthy. Lately though, I’ve been wanting people to care about me though, and like, not feel bad for me, but just like, be there for me and help me feel better if that makes sense. I’ve been trying to hunt at me not feeling good, which I don’t like doing because I feel like I’m bad for not feeling good, and because if this, if someone asks me if I’m doing ok when I’m hinting I’m not, I just say that I’m fine and just tired, but I don’t want to say that, I just don’t want to bother people with my problems. For some reason, I only want certain people to know I’m not feeling good, but I feel guilty for that because I don’t want to push anything onto them even if it makes me feel worse.

This past friday I went to my girlfriend’s house, usually when I go anywhere I turn the tv in my room off. At some point during my time there I decided to get on my youtube and I looked at my history because there was a song stuck in my head so I figured it would be there. 

When I got to my search history I found 24 hours worth of videos had been watched that I hadn’t watched. The only other device I’m logged in on is my tv, so naturally I change my password and move on....but the videos continue as if someone left the youtube app open and is just letting it auto play (I don’t do that on any device).  It’s been over three days and there’s still a constant stream of videos being watched that I can’t explain. 

I don’t know how to contact youtube about this problem and I don’t know where to go or what to do anymore so I resulted into ranting and asking reddit what to do...I guess it’s nothing more than annoying because i don’t know where it’s coming from.

I’ve recently started to feel anxious at times, I presume mostly from the stress of preparing for what’s to come when I leave high school, but it’s partly because I struggle making relationships. I have friends, but I always feel like the secondary friend: someone they rely on when their first choice isn’t available.

I think this feeling with my friends mostly stems from them all having girlfriends and me, of course not having one. 

I struggle finding girls to develop relationships with. I ultimately am afraid to do or say anything that would make someone think indifferently about me. There’s a girl I talk to on occasion but I’m too afraid to shoot my shot in case she says no then it’s awkward between us for the rest of eternity. 

My basketball coach doesn’t seem to think that I’m as good as I think I am. From an unbiased perspective, he doesn’t like me. I’m worried sick over it.

296,"Recently I had a panic attack in class that was triggered by the girl sitting next to me chewing super loud. It started off as just annoying but gradually got worse and worse until I was literally in tears. I was crying and felt like I couldn’t breathe and I was shaking like crazy but I got up and left before anyone noticed I think. It became like amplified and it was so loud in my ears that it felt like she was screaming at me. I can’t even explain it. It’s such a weird trigger I don’t even understand how it happened. I used to get pretty bad panic attacks when I was younger but it’s been like ten years since I had one. I literally felt like I was dying like it felt like I was going to explode. 

The next day I told my teacher about what happened and told her to tell the girl to stop eating in class next time. Today she told the class that you’re not supposed to be eating in class, but the girl didnt listen and she was eating some loud ass food today idek what it was but god damn it was starting to freak me out again.

297,"Let me explain. I was born with a rare heart problem called Double Inlet Left Ventricle. Basically, the right side of my heart didn’t work. When I was born, a new and experimental treatment for DILV was being introduced called ECMO. It was basically a machine that functioned as my heart for me, because my heart was too weak. It may sound more common today, but I was told by many doctors that if I was born just a year earlier, the common practice for dealing with kids like me was to let the parents take their child home and spend their remaining 3 or 4 days together. As a child of this new experimental treatment, I was kept along with the other children who were being subjected to this new treatment. (We called ourselves the lab rats.) There were 7 of us, and I still know some of them. One of them, I was very good friends with, he had the same name as me and we slept in the same room. One day when we were like 4, pretty much out of the blue (as far as I know) his heart stopped and he died. That was it. There goes my first friend. My sister was born that year. Sure I was happy to get a sister, but I felt like I lost a brother. After that, the 7 (6) of us didn’t really hang out much. To be clear, we pretty much lived in the hospital from birth to age 5. After my friend died, we all started moving into our homes with our families (unrelatedly to his death, we were just old enough) fast forward 13 years and here I am. 18 years old, out of school for 5 months, no job, nothing. I’ve literally done nothing. I’m such a burden on my family, they don’t say it but I know it. We live paycheck to paycheck to afford my medicine, I’m watching my parents work themselves to death and I can’t even get a fucking job to help them. 

His obituary is on my fridge. It has been for as long as we’ve lived here. Every now and then I look at him, same age, same name. I wonder what he’d be doing right now if he were alive. Don’t get me wrong I don’t blame myself for his death or anything. All I’m saying is that if I died my family would be much better off (financially speaking, I know they would probably miss me and stuff) and his family could have their son, and he could be alive, and he wouldn’t be a complete fucking waste of resources. He would’ve been smart, and he would be in college, his dad would be proud of him. Maybe I’m reflecting my own insecurities or something, but I can’t help but wonder all the good things he would’ve done that I prevented. He had so much potential, I did too but I’ve wasted it.

299,"So basically I’m a 17 y/o male who lives in a small town outside of big areas. I’ve been filling out applications at many places and went for interviews but I’ve been pretty unsuccessful so about two weeks later after applying to about 10 places a friend of mine suggested I come work with him on a turn pike plaza and said I would most likely be hired, and he was correct I went for an interview and I was given the job. This job makes 11/hr but is 26ish minutes away and I would start this coming Saturday. But my parents who were okay with me working there are now completely against it, and want me to go work for a company who’s 23ish minutes away that pays 9/hr and might be seasonal and to me that seems dumb to do that, my parents reasoning for all of this is because I have a relatively terrible car for gas it gets like 13 mpg on the high way, and the job that is furthest is only back roads to get to and the closer one is a highway to get to it. so personally to me it seems the job that’s 26 minutes away seems better to work at due to it paying more but only being 3 more minutes away, I just wanna know if I sound dumb for all of this or my parents are just overacting about the three extra minutes or is a highway just that much more safer and better.

303,"I was waiting at a bus stop with these loud kids. And one of them came up to me and asked if I was anorexic. Which feels pretty shitty because I've made a lot of effort in recent months trying to increase my weight. So I said no and this kid asks if we can have an arm wrestle. I said ok because he was annoying me and I thought I would beat him as he's a kid and looked pretty small/skinny (I'm 19 years old, he was about 11-13 I would guess).

But he beat me quite convincingly. And he asked for a rematch where I could use 2 arms and he'll only use 1 arm. And for some dumb reason I accepted this and I lost again. I felt like complete shit and this kid says to me that I'm ""weak as fuck"". I just walk away ignoring him and I bumped into him slightly when I walked away. He twisted my arm behind my back and said to apologise or he would break my arm; so I said sorry.

I was walking away but he was following me and clipping my ankles together to try and trip me and after a while I pushed him. He put me in a headlock. I was making a lot of weird gagging sounds and tapping out so he let go. And when I walked away I noticed I had literally wet myself (I don't think they noticed). And this kid has now messaged me online taunting me and I said something back to him and he threatened to beat me up again and now I get pretty anxious when travelling alone and actively avoid the area I saw him at.

I don't understand how he was so much stronger. [The top picture is his arm, bottom picture is my arm](https://i.imgur.com/QBP0wSv.jpg) it doesn't look like there's too much muscle difference and he was also a lot smaller and younger. It also didn't look like he did any fighting/strength sports or anything when looking at his social media. Was this a strength issue? A confidence issue? I've never been in a fight before and especially didn't want to get in a fight with a kid so I didn't really fight back.

305,"Myself (23M) and a friend (24F) used to talk everyday for about 4 months. Our relationship started off just as typical coworkers where we didn't really explore each other's being, if that makes sense. Anyhow after two years of working together, she and I became what I really don't allow and that's someone into my life. We worked everyday in the summer on her grad project for university and once I was doing some landscape restoration, she volunteered her time and I kid you not, she worked out there everyday with me too. She is the first person in a long time that I felt I had nothing to hide from her, she was my support. We would go out for dinners and drinks and stay up all night talking about our plans for the future and maybe she was joking, but she would include me in these plans and that made me think the world of her. 

Anyhow, university semester begins and everything is fine til October, we went a week without interaction as she was at a wedding and I was off camping. Things were okay but she was a little peeved when I didn't text her to let her know I actually made it back safe, though things still seemed fine for us. Two weeks go by and I have my first breakdown of the semester because I can't handle stress well and I essentially ran away without saying anything. Now I may be in the wrong but I had figured that if she did care, she would've reached out to ask if I was doing okay, but she never said a word. Now our conversations are short and we never text, we don't plan going out, we don't talk like we used to is what I'm getting at. Part of me feels as if I should bring it up, that I want to be like we used to, the fun times. Part of me thinks that she doesn't care and wouldn't notice if I left. The semester is ending soon and I don't want to lose her, she was the greatest person to come into my life.

Now I get really nervous around cops. Because of this experience I was forced to talk to the counselor at school for a while; he was really nice, and I liked him, but it didn’t improve my state of mind at all. For a while I was just dealing on my own until this year when I started seeing a therapist outside of school. I didn’t tell her that I self harm and I didn’t tell her about how I obsess over myself and believe I have cancer or how I worry that people in my life are going to die for no reason. I did tell her that I was sad sometimes, but I would always blame it on the fact that my dad is aggressive or that my mom doesn’t support my sexuality. In reality, those things don’t really bother me and my mind is just fucked up on its own; I can tell. Because I avoided the truth so often, after about two months of therapy I gave up and told her I was feeling a lot better and she said “honestly, I think you’re fine; you’re not depressed.”

I just don’t know what to do. But I know it’s bad because even my mom has been noticing how nervous I am and she thinks that I should be on anxiety meds. Is it possible to try that without therapy? I just can’t bring myself to talk to a stranger when I can’t even talk to my mom about some of my obsessions.

317,"Hi All - my wife and I are in a doozy of a pickle. Not quite sure to handle this one. 

We recently bought a house and decided to renovate it. We don’t have any skills ourselves, so we hired an outside contractor to take care of everything. Perfect. One of my wife’s friends, K, asked if we would be okay letting her husband, B, do the marble counters instead of the contractors as he has his own business. Great! Happy to support them. He said he would do them for the original agreed upon price we had with the contractor which would be a great deal. A higher quality material at the same price. All is good. 

We have him a deadline of November 1 so that the contractor could finish all the non-counter related items. Installing the sink, backsplash...you get the idea. The idea was once he had them in, the contractor would finish the rest. 

The deadline comes and goes as he’s ‘still working on them’. We push the contractor back another week as he promised to be done by the following weekend. Same thing happens, so he tells us ‘I’ll finish everything up for you guys. Not a problem.’ We tell the contractor we’re good and our friend will finish up everything. 

Fast forward to this weekend when he finishes the installation. He forgot to do an entire section of the counter so he decided to go with a grey plastic material instead since it was easier. He also caulked they counter to our stove and dented the new dishwasher in the process. One piece has clearly been miscut and filled in with a slightly different color material. He started doing the sink installation and backsplash, but not before sending us a text message basically calling us ungrateful for making him do those things and it was only because we’re friends he was ‘doing us a favor’. We told him don’t bother finishing (touching up and caulking the counters, attempting to repair the broken items, and finishing the backsplash and sink). He’s already angry with us for whatever reason and at this point we’ve already decided we have to redo everything with the contractor. Yesterday, he sends us a bill for the amount in full that was originally agreed upon (with multiple disclaimers about how much a plumber would charge for hooking up the sink amongst other things) and that we should be super appreciate of all he’s done for us. 

He also did a couple other separate pieces like a end table and coffee table that were more than pleased with and happy to pay in full. My wife and I have no idea how to approach them or deal with the kitchen as they’re 2 of our best friends although recent communications don’t feel like it anymore. He was over a month late, didn’t finish the job in full, and ruined several new appliances and items in the process. 

What’s the best way to come to an amicable agreement without ruining the friendship?",03Dec2019,1
318,"So we recently got a new door, with a lock pad and the ability to unlock it from your phone. I already felt really uncomfortable with it from the beginning. But yesterday out of nowhere the door unlocked(it makes allot of notice when it unlocks) and the door opened. I rushed downstairs only to see that there was no one there. I thought it was just me brother trying to prank me, but it happened again later when I was sure he was at school. 

This morning when I went out to run, I saw that the door wasn’t locked properly, and I could hear a engine noise coming from the outside, and something that sounded like footsteps. Now I feel even more uncomfortable and frankly a bit scared. 

Yesterday when I came home there was a mini van waiting outside my door. As I was parking my bike, he rolled down the window and said, I left a pakkage on the waste container behind the bushes. I was confused, because I thought that if he was gonna wait anyway, he might as well had given the pakkage to me personally. Also, from where the pakkage was, there was a good view on the lock pad(as far as a pakkage can have a good view)

Am I just over exaggerating or should I be worried? What should I do?",03Dec2019,1
319,"I (18M; senior) have had a bit of a rollercoaster of the past few years. I transferred to a public school from a tiny private school my sophomore year of high school. (From 15 people in graduating class to about 550 people) I knew about two people at the school from my early childhood, but they both had v e r y different interests from what I have.

Before I transferred, I was on the varsity cross country team as a freshman, and went to and won the state competition for the division the school was in. Fast forward a bit, about halfway through my sophomore year, I had an unfortunate event with a bouncy house that fractured two of the vertebrae in my neck, landing me in a neck brace for about twelve weeks. That threw me out of the running (pun intended) for about the next year or so.

Once I had finally gotten back into shape, (early junior year) I found that my body, now 6’1” from the 5’10” a year ago, couldn’t quite get me back to where I was.

I suspect that this started off a chain of events (failures and disappointments) during my junior year that led to my significant other (now 16F junior) breaking up with me. Any sort of interactions with people disgusted me at that point, me finding any and all reasons to get away from people.

That summer, I got my first formal job and worked about 45 hours a week at that, just working like nothing else existed aside from money and food.

Halfway through the summer, I was diagnosed with clinical depression (fun) and was put on an SSRI to help relieve the symptoms. That one actually made things worse, so my doctor had me try various medicines, eventually settling on two that seemed to mingle well. From what I can tell, one of them keeps me anchored in the real world and the other keeps me from wanting to suicide (not here to talk about that tho), albeit having the side effect of making my hands shake.

Now things are looking up, I’ve reconciled with my significant other, am back together with her (plan on marrying her), and have actually made attempts to socialize with more than just her and my family.

Also, I’ve had several bursts of inspiration recently, ranging from ideas for a video game (my career goal is to be the designer of game engines or at least an aspect thereof) to arranging one of my favorite songs in an a cappella format.

However, I’m now finding myself having to make decisions on colleges, but freezing up because of it. In addition to this, I’ve developed a severe case of senioritis, causing me to lack any sort of motivation to do schoolwork (grades are hovering just above failing right now).


My request is this: how do I pick myself up out of the rut of indifference and finally get my productive juices flowing?


TL;DR: I’m in my senior year of high school, went through some stuff beforehand that’s now led to apathy or lack of motivation towards most things.",03Dec2019,1
320,"So, I was dating this one guy for about a year. He was super sweet and we got along well. The only issue was that we went to different schools and he had so many extracurriculars and other stuff going on that we hardly ever got to hang out. Last year we didn’t talk for 7 months because he’d never respond. Things were better over the summer when things weren’t so busy, but when school started back up, we barely ever texted because he’d either just not respond or he’d leave me on read. I ended things about a week ago but gave him the chance to try and make more of an effort on his part. He agreed with me and we’re just friends now. We haven’t talked since then and another thing that’s been stressing me out is that as we were growing apart, my brain decided that I would start crushing on this one guy in my friend group. It was only a small crush like: “he’s kinda cute.” I never had any thoughts of cheating. The guy and I were pretty good friends and had known each other for about 3 years. The day I broke up with my boyfriend, the guy I liked texted me. We don’t usually text so it was kind of a surprise to me. He asked me if I was doing ok and if I ever needed anything that he was there and he’d try to help. He’s been super sweet and has everyday since been sending me wholesome memes and cute animal pictures to cheer me up. We occasionally play Minecraft together sometimes too on a realm that our friend group shares. We’ve even started small talking too. I don’t have any idea if he likes me back at all or if he’s just trying to be a good friend. What should I do? How do I know if he likes me back or not?",03Dec2019,1
321,"Straight up I'm at a lost. My current friends have done REALLY shitty things to me in the past and I've tried moving on. But everytime I feel like we're moving forward. They do something that makes me feeling like shit all over again. And I don't want to be a cry baby about it. But I have separation anxiety and hate being alone which causes a lot of issues with being excluded from things. Recently on my like 5th try on starting over with them, I've come to find out. My friends have created a textimg group that excludes me and the one I am in they dont talk in anymore they havent for days. I only found out because my fiance is apart of it. He doesnt understand how I feel, because to him it's not a big deal even when I point out all the shitty stuff they've done before similar to this and how this makes me feel now. He doesn't get it, because its never happened to him before. I dont know how to make new friends because I've just slowing become more socially awkward around people thinking I'm annoying or no one really likes me. He doesn't get the idea of supporting me when it comes to these friends and he always picks them over me. Which is totally another story. Just making a comment of how blind he is to it. 
If anyone had advice on how to handle these friends or how to just get the courage and let go of the extream anxiety I have of being alone and find better friends. I would love to hear advice. 
And yes I know not everyone is perfect that's why I've tried so many times to forgive them. And I know I probably have issues that may have caused them to ditch me. But...it still hurts and would like polite and honest advice on how to handle this. Or if you want to be my friend I'm cool with that too lol",03Dec2019,1

I love her and my family loves her. She’s amazing in every way. The thing is I’ve been feeling our run as a couple is starting to come to a head. It’s like nothing is wrong but I’ve been seeing us growing apart being that we are 2 hours away. Her moving to Sacramento for school really put a big barrier between us. We’ve tried very hard and for the most part gotten through a lot but I’ve just been getting so tired. I just feel like I have no strength left. I love her and don’t want to lose her but also do not want us both to comitt to being unhappy. I fear that even when I move out there in a month or so it might not be the same or how we imagined it.

She was my best friend for a year and a half until I finally worked up the courage to tell her I was in love with her the entire time. Now we are very happy and very gay. And I find her INCREDIBLY sexually attractive but she has very strong body confidence issues that at times seem to consume her and I’m so nervous that if I tell her I want to be intimate, I will make her uncomfortable or seem like I’m insensitive to her insecurities.

326,"I'm gonna start at the beginning: i met this guy at a houseparty and we talked for hours. During the following days we texted for a bit, he told me how much he enjoyed talking to me that night, but we soon stopped texting. He then suddenly started a rumor that i had i crush on him and made some advances on him that night. Neither did i have a crush on him nor did i make advances, i simply thought we were friends. Nevertheless i told him that i infact did not have a crush on him and  thought we cleared this up.

Fast forward til we met at a rave again. Same thing: talked drunkenly about absolutely everything. Then later a friend told me that he had a breakdown bc he doesn't love me and can't give me what I want (no clue what he meant with that).
Now my question is: why is he acting like that ?",03Dec2019,1

Currently no friends (they all moved to different colleges) and I still live at home. My grades aren’t too bad c’s and a’s but I feel like a loser still, all I do is go to work, do homework, and any free time I find I practice magic (been a magician since 13). I love magic and want to do it full time eventually but currently I hate my life, if anyone has advice on how to get through this/feel better about myself that would be great.",03Dec2019,1
328,"The title sounds stupid but let me explain. I have high functioning autism and I get upset over things easily and overthink, I also have ocd too, and it causes me to  overthink situations. could also be a part of my anxiety but I think it’s a bit of both.  I almost never argue with my best friends. Like we always have good convos. Of course we’ve had little debates and things like that every now and then, but they usually end in a way that makes it seem like it never happened so it’s pointless. We’ve never ever really gotten mad at each other. Well tonight, one happened. I will admit, I was being a little rude. I called her cause I wanted to talk to her(I know I should’ve asked first considering its 10pm for her. But me and her were on the phone later than that the day before, so I didn’t think anything of it), she didn’t answer then says she’s going to bed, and stuff like that. We told each other we loved each other, and then I sent another text afterwards, I made a stupid joke because of a typo that was made, and she responded with “oh my god I’m just trying to fucking sleep”. I should’ve probably waited till the next day to express my emotions but again, I never think before I do anything, so I explained why I was upset, i apologized to her, and then said gn. And all she said was “ok”. 
So either she was particular grumpy this night or she was legit mad at me. I know it was my fault for being rude, but I wanna know how to stop worrying about the friendship being ruined over this. 

It’ll probably be fine the next day when we can actually talk it out, but I just can’t stop worrying. I’m know my thinking Is so fucking ridiculous and irrational but I can’t help it.",03Dec2019,1
330,"So I've been dating a Brazilian girl for about 2 months now, and I've never been happier in a relationship before. I've had some pretty long term relationships in the past, my last one spanning 8 years, so I feel I'm a good judge on whether a relationship is genuine or not. But I'm also aware that Brazilian women don't like confrontation, that white lies are pretty culturally ingrained for Brazilians and that Brazilian women love to please foreign men to obtain citizenships. 

She is 26 years old and I'm 28. We are both currently residing on the Gold Coast, Australia. She has a pretty strong work ethic, currently holding down 2 jobs, so I'm not concerned about her freeloading off me for financial support. We are both extremely compatible based on MBTI personality types - She's an ENFP and I'm an INTJ, which is a statistically rare and strongly compatible relationship. 

We get along like fire, always joking and laughing, having fun going out with her friends and mine etc etc. She is fairly attractive, and I would say that I am equally as attractive as her and that I have just as many options as she does. I'm not desperate, or socially retarded, and I'm in a really good position in life financially, and socially. Picking up Aussie women has never been hard for me, and I never had any intention of going after an expat. In fact I had no idea she was Brazilian until I met her. 

However, recently some negative seeds have been sewn in my mind by certain family and friends who've heard of some horror stories regarding Brazilian women fishing for citizenships. On the one hand I feel like I've found the woman of my dreams but on the other hand I understand that one of her highest priorities right now is to obtain citizenship or an extended visa here in Australia. When something seems too good to be true it probably is and I feel like I've scored a girl who is too good to be true. 

I feel like I should put aside my cynicism and just enjoy the ride, but I am also paranoid that her survival mindset, and independence means that she's secretly being extremely calculative underneath a pleasing facade. Based on what I have described do you think she will leave me once she has got what she's seeking? The thing people often lose touch with when they fall in love is reality and I'm clearly looking past a lot of problems in favour of blind love. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. If you've got something brutally honest to say, hit me with it.",03Dec2019,1
331,"I have been really contemplating for the past few months what to do about this. My mom comes from the philippines, where its customary for boys to be circumsized. However I was born in the US from a hispanic father. They chose not to circumsize me and my mom didn't bring it up to me until I was 9. They got a divorce so my dad doesn't have a say in this but is rather neutral. The plan was for me to get circumsized at 9 yo in the summer on our vacation to visit family at the philippines because its cheaper, but it never ended up happening. I have done research over the years and I've come to the decision I don't want to be circumsized, much less in the philippines. My mom hasn't talked about this subject for 2 years but I know she still intends for me to be circumsized, and i know she won't take no for an answer. I am seriously considering running away. I've already started saving money, I know the location of my personal documents I will take, and I have a designated go to plan.

Every time she takes my order she gives me so many compliments. She’s so overwhelmingly nice to me and now I have a huge crush on her. She’s literally the only girl who works there and when the other guys take my order they never give me compliments or anything so at least I know it’s not apart of there job to give so many compliments?  She’s just so pretty! And  she says I look cute I just say thanks Because I get so nervous with flirting. The other day she made my latte and made a heart with the milk and thats not the way they usually make it I’m probably way overthinking it but yea. I also notice that she gets a little nervous talking to me telling me random things in the middle of me ordering something (I get nervous talking to her to) she comes into my store randomly and never buys anything but I caught staring at me as she walks out. I also somehow found her instagram didn’t follow her but she seems single. 
  
Here are some examples of things she had said to me. 

1.” You look so cute today “

2. “You always look so good everyday” 

3. “ I love the perfume your wearing or jewelry”

334,"So here's the thing: I'm 18 and finished my Abitur (highschool equivalent) earlier this year, currently I'm in my first semester studying physics at a very good Uni in Munich and I'm even lucky enough to be able to live with my aunt rent-free (+my uncle also studied physics). 

I realise I'm very fortunate with all these circumstances, but my issue is that I haven't felt any joy at all, basically since I left school earlier this year. I'm lacking any sense of purpose and the only real reason why I began studying physics is because I was sorta interested in it when I was younger and all the before mentioned circumstances.

I have no passion for my studies or anything else in life, I used to socialise from time to time or play video games and now I do nothing of the sort: go to Uni, come back exhausted, sleep, realise worksheets are overdue, notice it's already too late anyway, repeat. 

I have the feeling I'm doomed to fail my studies and got no clue what to do with my life, all I guess I want is to be able to independently provide for myself (without working myself to death 70h/week) and that's about it, but I don't know how or where to start.

Them: Work? 

Me: who is this ??

Them: Be careful.

Me: excuse me what?

Me: englighten me.

The whole time he was there he was hit with fat jokes as everyone laughed, him included but it seemed like he didn’t appreciate it at all and only laughed with because he didn’t know how to respond. I saw his face get more red and down as the time went by and it was pretty sad to witness. When asked for some of his information, he called his dad trying to ask for his ssn when abruptly one of the recruiters he was working with took his phone and ended his call saying “just give me the physical card man, damn” in which he replied “yeah I just tried to call him to see where he put it” (he had a folio with him with all his documents) while this was going on other guys working there were making small talk and laughing about how his shirt didn’t fit all the way down which exposed a part of his back. They then talked about how he needed to lose weight and such and he agreed he’d do so, but again still everyone was laughing and all about it.

343,"I (18M) met my girlfriend four years ago at the start of high school. We hit it off right away and we jumped right into a relationship as young kids would do. We dated for a few months, then we broke up because we weren’t “feeling” each other. After that, we took the time to continue being good friends, while still expressing feelings for each other. It was only a matter of time until we got back together again.
Fast forward a couple years and it’s the end of grade 11; she’s getting really clingy and I’m not ready to be with her again... I’ve been taking her for granted because we’ve unofficially locked down for each other over the last couple years. she’s different from any other girl I’ve met and I still want to be with her. But I tell her not now. I need to focus on other things. It’s too much now.
Shortly after, she meets him. Let’s call him Sam. Sam makes a move on her and before I know it she’s in a relationship with him. I was her first for almost everything and she was mine. So the idea of her sharing these things with another guy is sickening.
One thing they did that we didn’t was fuck. And I feel shallow for letting this be a big deal, but it’s gut-wrenching to think that he got to share that first moment with her and I didn’t. And even worse to know that it was my fault.
They dated for a year, and she claimed she didn’t want him but wanted me, and dumped him so she could be with me.
But why would she have spent so much time with him? I know, I know, because she needed to feel something and I wasn’t ready for her.
But why do I feel so sick at the thought of them doing all these things that she should have done with me. We’re dating now. And I’ve brought it up a few times, but she’s sick of hearing it. Hell I’m sick of hearing it. I just want to accept that I fucked up and that she’s with me now but he will always be her first, and it hurts more since I want this girl to be my wife one day. I just wish she could have waited a bit longer.
Am I wrong for being angry and upset at this? And is it bad that she keeps all the things he gave her? And texts him now and then?
Tell me if I’m out of my fucking mind so I can at least exert that anger onto myself. Thanks.",03Dec2019,1

346,"I read someone else's story on an askreddit thread that was almost identical to mine...and I was immediately overcome by the powerful urge to get violent. I literally stomped my feet in the noisiest way possible, punched my bedroom door, the fridge in the kitchen, and yelled at my cat.

I used to do this all the time, but a lot of time has passed and I went to therapy, I thought I had moved on from this crap, but I guess not.

I've recanted this tale countless times and it never gets any easier, so I'm going to summarize.

I'm on the spectrum and had an LSA  (Learning Support Assistant) for high school and the one year I spent at this sixth form college.

Incident 1:

* Usual LSA is gone, have substitute. She is incredibly condescending towards me and talks to me like I'm an idiot. I snap at her.
* She goes away and tells everyone how rude I was to her.
* The entire support team treats me like a problem student for the rest of the year.

Incident 2:

* Doing work in class.
* Usual LSA is back, but she's staring at me and my screen, making sure I'm doing my work. I'm finding it difficult because she is staring at me.
* Work we're doing is not related to any of our modules and doesn't contribute towards final grade, so I start slacking.
* Instead of telling me to get a move on, she tells the teacher, he leaves the class and brings the head of the support team. She takes me and the LSA to her office and they heavily imply that they could expel me to save money, and that I'm in trouble for ""disrespecting the staff"".
* I'm sent out for the rest of the period to think about how I've behaved.
* I told my mum what happened and she came in to complain, but they denied saying anything of the sort and nothing got done.

Incident 3:

* Usual hangout spot during breaks was a relatively large room set aside for the ""special"" students, and the office mentioned in incident 2 was inside. Since incident 2, I stayed the fuck away from this place and resorted to just listening to music outside.
* I missed some homework on Friday and was told I could hand it in on Monday instead.
* LSA tracked me down on a free period on Friday afternoon and demanded I do the homework immediately, either at the computer I was already sitting at, or she threatened to take me down to said hangout spot and have me do it there.
* I rushed the homework to get it over with and ended up botching it. That was my fault, but I still hated her for trying to bring me down there. I had to go to that place to hand it in to her anyway.

I tried to avoid going back after the Christmas break, but I was legally required to stay until the end of the year.

Incidents 4 and 5:

* Doing work on computer. Reading through what I'd written.
* Have resting bitchface.
* LSA sees me and blows up ""OH MY GOD, WHY ARE YOU IN A MOOD!?""
* I yell at her saying I'm not in a mood.
* She leaves and comes back 5 minutes later saying ""have you calmed down now?""

* Towards the end of the school year. All work has been done, all the stuff that's left doesn't contribute to the final grade.
* Slacking off in class again.
* Teacher comes up behind me and whispers a threat to have me removed.

This all happened 5 years ago, and this is just the stuff I can remember. 

I moved to a different sixth form college for the next year, and despite being entitled to it, I specifically asked not to be given an LSA this time. My grades suffered as a result and while I still got a decent grade in the end, it wasn't as good as it could've been.

I dropped out of university due to depression that is still ongoing, and I largely believe my experiences at ********** Sixth Form College is largely to blame.

**What the hell do I do about this?**

I've been on anti-depressants (not anymore, they made me feel nothing at all) and been to therapy, but evidently that hasn't helped as much as I thought it did.

After reading about someone else's similar story and wanting to put my fist through a wall, I really need to know what the fuck I'm supposed to do about this. I wish I could stop feeling bad about it and just move on, but the fact that they suffered literally zero repercussions for how they treated me makes me so fucking angry.

I should've taken legal action against them when I had the chance, but at the time it didn't even cross my mind, I just wanted to gtfo and forget about that place. Now I feel like I couldn't even if I wanted to because too much time has passed.

I want revenge how do I get it?",03Dec2019,1
347,"So, first off, this is solely for advice on how to best help my wife. She’s been in the same industry (civil service) for the last 5-6 years and wants out. Tough part is, her degree gives her some limited options within that field, plus, she doesn’t want to use it. 
She wants to keep her salary or at least most of it but have a less stressful position. Unfortunately, those two concepts don’t usually go together. 

I’ve tried being as supportive as I can, even spending the time to do career tests and hunt the job list websites with her but nothing seems to peak her interest with a reasonable amount of pay/benefits.

How else can I help her or has anyone been in the same boat as her and found a solution where we haven’t thought of yet?

348,"I don't know if this is the right sub to ask this type of question--please feel free to redirect me to a more appropriate one. I've tried to find a post with similar context, but haven't had much luck. If anyone knows of a post that applies to this I would greatly appreciate being provided with that link! 

To provide a bit of backstory here: I have a friend, we'll call him 'Doug'. Doug and I have been close friends for 6-ish years now and he's suffered off and on from depression in that time. It used to manifest in a way that made him reclusive during bits of time, but it's become more and more pronounced in the last year or so. He's expressed that his feelings stem from him feeling worthless and hopeless. 

His S/O, who is his age (26), is a college graduate and has a stable job in healthcare with great income. His closest friends are all more-or-less in the same boat--homeowners with good jobs. He, on the other hand, has been struggling through his college education for the last 7/8 years or so, failing classes, retaking classes, changing majors, etc. He'd also been working at the same fast food chain we had all met at when we were first getting our start up until about 6 months ago. The reason he left the job is because he and his S/O recently moved back to where they originally from, to live with her parents so that they can save up money and build a strong foundation to maybe buy a place of their own. He transferred to a university in that area to continue his education, but hasn't really been able to find the motivation to find another job for additional income yet. 

While he is going to school (and has been doing a great job this semester!), the fact that he isn't helping his S/O financially, is behind his friends (for now) in this game of life, and has spent so much time on his education without getting the fruits of his labor is really crippling him. He compares himself a lot to the people around in a way that is super demotivating. While all of these external factors are there, I do think that Doug has depression to begin with and that professional counseling and perhaps medication can make it more livable. 

I've spoken with Doug many times about this. We've had many phone calls that involve him getting vulnerable and speaking about how he feels, me listening and asking questions, and usually a conclusion where he feels better and ready to get back at it. The last couple talks though, there wasn't a conclusion like that and he'd brought up suicide, but worryingly specific. 

He talked about statistics behind people dying by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge, what it would feel like to do that, etc. He's sent memes off-hand with suicidal narratives. He says that he's not suicidal and that he's too scared to do it, but I see this as a huge red flag and would not be able to live with myself if he ever did it, knowing I didn't do everything I could/should to stop it. 

Doug does not have a job and therefore does not have healthcare, which is his reason for not seeing a psychiatrist/therapist. I found on his university's website that they offer free counseling appointments and after bringing it up in conversation as organically as I could, pitched it to him and sent him the link containing the information and phone number. He said he was feeling better at this point, so he brushed it off, saying he didn't need it at the moment, but that he appreciated my being there for him and my concern. 

I don't know what the F\*$% to do. I hate to make this post so about me, but I don't know how to support him best. I'm always worried about what I say to him in these conversations--if it's right, if it's not, is it helping? There's no way to know. 

At the moment, I feel the best thing to do for him is to get him to talk to a professional who knows how to navigate these conversations way better than me. But if he won't go, I don't know what to do. Do I push harder, risking irritating him and coming across as insensitive? Is he not taking it seriously because I'm not pushing enough? 

I would really appreciate some advice from someone who has experienced depression (whether firsthand, secondhand, or professionally). Thank you!",03Dec2019,1

350,"I met this guy online when I was 13 (wayyyy too young). He told me he was 17 at the time, and after video chatting, calling, and messaging each other for some time, I started to like him. One day he told me he liked me and I returned his feelings. He wanted to date but I didn't want to until I was 16, but he said he was okay with waiting. Over time, I opened up to him about my past traumas and pains, and he promised he'd be there for me. He made me feel safe and loved, something a emotionally scarred preteen me needed. He then would use those feelings against me, asking to sext, saying that that was love, and that it was okay. He kept pressuring me and I gave in. Once we did, I was trapped. It'd keep happening over and over, if I didn't want to, he'd guilt trip me until I gave in. He would use my traumas against me, would push me to hurt myself, and have panic attacks. If I cut, he'd ask to see and would tell me to not do it ever again, only to push me to do it again later. I attempted suicide many times, but couldn't go through with it. If I tried to leave or ask him to stop or if I brought up the things he was doing to me, he'd threaten suicide or self harm, ignore my messages, making me believe he went through with it, then would message me back later saying ""I'm okay"" or send a random picture (like what he was cooking for dinner, a video game, a picture of his dog, etc). After a few years, I did some digging and found out that he was actually 22, and that I'm not the only girl he's used like that before.

355,"Hello Reddit, 

I am a 21 yr old college student. Everything and I mean absolutely everything is going wrong in my life, and it’s 1000000% my fault. 

I’m going to be academically dismissed this semester. I never liked the school I went to. Every single semester/year, I’ve battled with bad thoughts in my mind and have had constant anxiety. The anxiety always subsides once the semester is over and I don’t have to face the pressures of school. Freshman and sophomore year, I was able to get by. Junior year, things started getting tough. Had to drop a bunch of courses. Didn’t show up to class. Couldn’t sleep. Lost 10 pounds. Stopped going to the gym. Last semester, my school had informed me that I have this semester to get my gpa up or I get dismissed. I overloaded all my classes this semester just so I can graduate on time.. and it completely backfired on me. I was worried and anxious aboht the semester since the summer, and it hit me like a brick once we started back school. We now have two weeks left in the semester and I am going to fail out. I’ve only done well in one of my courses, the others, not at all. 

My parents still think I’m going to graduate in May. This has been absolutely destroying my entire life. I haven’t had the balls to tell them yet. Anytime I’m home, I’m constantly anxious around them. Anytime we talk, I start sweating because of the anxiety. My parents legitimately think I’m on drugs because I’ve lost weight and I’m sweating a lot. I know it will make me feel much better if I tell them, but I just don’t know how.. and we have two weeks left in this semester. I need to take a break from school. Figure out why I’m feeling this way, why I don’t have any motivation to do anything school related. 

I’ve had an internship for the last year and a half and it’s been great. The internship is the only thing keeping me happy at this point with what’s going on with school. I recently found out that my company will be letting go of all the interns, and that completely destroyed me. With me getting dismissed from school soon, I thought I could work out a full time job with my company. I had a backup plan. Now it’s all gone to shit. 

Junior year, I was in charge of paying utility bill for my house. Long story short, my roommates and I were late on a bunch of payments and like idiots just didn’t decide to pay. Well, now it caught up to me. I have a collections agency now after me and I’m sure this going to fuck up my credit. 

I feel extremely alone. No one knows of my situation, I’ve been bottling it up inside and it’s been absolutely killing me. I will no longer be in school soon, my internship is gone, I’m in debt, I still have to tell my parents the worst news they’ll here. I guess this is just a way for me to vent and to get some advice. I don’t expect anything lighthearted. Maybe I need a kick in the ass; but I am just so fucking lost right now and it’s been impacting my sleep a lot.",03Dec2019,1
356,"So I got into an awkward situation with my recruiter today, I was answering some questions and She asked me what my parents age and my brothers age are.

Then at the end, she said "" Maybe you should ask them what age they are next time"" LOL... Wow, I didn't know she cared so much about my family business. None of your business, thanks.

I love my family and I congratulate their birthdays with all my heart. It surely ""Is"" a good thing to memorize their ages but I personally think it doesn't matter much.

361,"I feel I should preface this whole post by saying that my boyfriend is incredibly kind hearted, and he struggles with depression after childhood trauma and his sister’s suicide. Here goes:

My boyfriend (M 34) and I (F 33) met 6 months ago. We hit it off immediately and had an amazing first couple of months. We were so open and comfortable with each other.

We were painfully honest with one another. He shared with me that he was a recovering drug and alcohol addict. I shared deeply personal things with him. I had never been so intimate with anyone before I met him, never felt so accepted and loved. And we made each other laugh! Everything was perfect.

After two months of bliss, everything suddenly changed. He had some extreme stress at work he was trying to deal with and decided to take a lot of xanax. A LOT. I found him in his home the next day, on the verge of overdose. It was terrifying. I almost left him at that point because it was so traumatic, and he didn’t seem to want to get help initially. I called his mom and she stayed with him while I took a few days to think. I struggled with the decision, and decided if he was committed to getting sober I’d give him another shot. I didn’t want to give up on him.

After he sobered up he realized the damage he had caused. He decided to commit to gaining back his sobriety. I told him sobriety needed to be his top priority, and I would support him fully. He had 7 years of sobriety at one point, and he wants to get back there. He started seeing an addiction counselor and going to daily AA meetings. Everything was going really well after that, and I grew to trust him again. He achieved 60 days of sobriety, going to meetings every day, meditating, eating healthier, etc. Then he asked me to move in with him, and I said yes. We planned the move, and it’s approaching in 10 days. 

However, about a week ago I noticed he was acting strangely. He stopped using his CBD oil. Stopped using his CPAP machine for sleep apnea. Binge ate at night. He was stressed about money. He has a lot of debt as a result of his addiction. He also has a high paying job, so he’ll be able to pay it off but in the meantime it’s crippling him. His stress was causing stomach aches, and he wasn’t sleeping well. He stayed awake for 48 hours a couple of days ago. He also gambled online and spent his whole paycheck that night, regretting it immediately. (I believe he has bipolar disorder, but he refuses to consider that because one doctor told him that if he is bipolar he wouldn’t even need medication for it. I could be wrong, but I think he needs another opinion. The difference in him is like Jekyll and Hyde.)

Tonight, he recalled finding his sister dead, and he got very emotional. About 30 minutes later, I noticed his speech seemed slurred. He reminded me of a few months ago when he almost died, slurred speech, red eyes. He passed out as soon as his head hit the pillow tonight, and he was breathing heavily and tossing around. I had noticed he had a little plastic bag in his pocket he kept messing with the other night, so I stuck my hand in his jeans on the floor and pulled out a baggie of small blue pills. I did a search and am fairly sure they are black market benzos - like off-brand xanax. I hid them. Now I need advice.

Do I postpone the move, or will that mess him up even more? He said that if it wasn’t for me and his mom he would kill himself. I love him and don’t want anything bad to happen to him. I don’t know how I could live with myself if I caused him to get worse. Do I talk to him about it calmly in the morning? Do I call his mom? My head is swimming. When he is sober he is the kindest man I’ve ever met. But the addict inside him is terrible.",03Dec2019,1
362,"Used to have issues with carbon monoxide in house, fire department fixed and it was good for  many months. 



3 weeks ago I noticed numbers rising from like 33-38 around 2 am and up till later morning if the heat was on. We moved carbon monoxide detector and **haven’t had issues since.**




Here’s where things get weird. 




For the past few weeks my memory has been BAD, like just forgetting small things and stuff. Anyways I paid no attention to this cuz my memory had always been bad ( but not to this extent ) so I was like whatever. 




Yesterday at night time I had a super hard time breathing. I chalked it up to anxiety even tho I  wasn’t anxious and it wasn’t affecting my breathing. It eventually went away for the most part that night after like 2 hours. 


This morning before I head to the gym I am EXTREMLY nauseous. To the point where I debate not going. I go and low and behold going outside gets rid of a lot of the nausea ( as has happened before to me with this house specifically ) and by the time at the gym it’s basically gone. 


Anyways 15 minutes ago before I go to bed I look at the carbon monoxide detector and it’s reading 35. And now I’m like oh shit, what if the breathing and nausea was from that. I mean it’s a low number but Idk



It seems when the heat turns off in my apartment, the carbon monoxide detector goes to 0 quickly. So as long as no one turns the heat on it doesn’t show up numbers I think

I reached out by simply saying “hi sorry i haven’t messaged you in a long time. how is everything? how is school?” and we had a little back and forth. everything feels drier when we talk though.. which i can understand as we haven’t spoken for a few months. however i keep going back and forth in my head. i get frustrated because i changed our friendship dynamic for no reason and that i shouldn’t have stopped talking to her because 3 months later i’m still talking to her anyways. but also.. that feeling where i wanted to cut ties with her back in september.. i’ve felt that desire so many times in my life with her.. so doesn’t that mean something?? i don’t know if i should just keep our friendship where it is now, just civil and polite... or go back to the way things were where we would text every day and be excited about stupid stuff. i doubt she does it intentionally, because it is so subtle, but the way i always get pushed away from her and get pulled back is really exhausting.. but i do miss our friendship.. from what you’ve read, do you have any advice for me? i’m a mess",03Dec2019,1

370,"My long term boyfriend smokes pot - a lot. He is mostly using his vape pen (so he says) but holy heck does he reek of it. It's gotten to the point where I can't kiss him because his breath is so ripe with it. He brushes his teeth and uses mouthwash, but sometimes that barely makes a dent.

Right now I'm laying in bed with him and I had to put a blanket over my face because it straight smells like the earthiest skunk I've ever encountered. 

How can I help him? What can he do to not stink so bad? I'm mostly concerned about his breath. It's like its permeated into him, if that makes sense. Almost as if the smell is quite literally emitting from his lungs.

371,"To make a long story short, my girlfriend and I recently moved across the country after an honorable discharge from the military. Usually, the military pays to move you but they messed up some paperwork, and I ended up having to hire (and pay with my own money) a moving company and the military would pay me back once the move was complete. This was around $7500. My girlfriend and I are in our early twenties. I’ve called the company a total of 37 times in the past two months during open hours, only to be answered 8 times. All 8 of those I was promised a call back, and never got one. At this point they are ignoring my phone calls, and have told me twice now that the “truck is loaded and we’re leaving within 2-3 days.” The month of November.

374,"First off, let me give y'all some context. I met this guy back in 2014 in a convention and had a cordial relationship, like, never talked or messaged and our interactions were only likes in our Facebook posts. Since last year, out of nowhere we started talking...a LOT. Like, every single day we would message each other some dumb memes or share music, videos and stuff, our friendship grew  lot and then I started to get feelings for him. Let me tell you...we live in different countries, so that complicates a lot this thing, but i really want to give this a shot. I really like him and i am not doing this for closure, i am doing this because i want him to know and to see what happens after this. We will see each other next summer but i want to tell him how i feel on New Year's day.
Anyways, i need advice and your thoughts in this small love note i wrote to him. Any advice would be greatly appreciated &lt;3

********

So, first of all, happy new year and new decade! I hope you are having a great time!
I know 2019 was very difficult for you, specially in the last months. Let me thank you for all the trust you have on me and reaching me out or venting to me, it means a lot that there's that trust between us, which leads me to the main purpose of this message: 
I have been planning this maybe for months, this time I don't want to screw it up by saying some weird shit, but well, here I go: 

I really like talking to you, everytime you send me a message i feel genuine joy (also because probably the 60% of our conversations are memes, jaja) and I really enjoyed the time we spent together back in July. You made me feel comfortable and happy, and honestly just strengthened the feelings I have for you since a while ago.


I wanted to tell you face to face, back in the airport but i was a coward and it is probably one of the things I regret not doing in 2019. But hey! Better late than never. 


So, in a nutshell, I like you, and I care about you, a lot. I don't know if I was obvious with how I showed my feelings/interest during the year so that's why I am writing you this, to be clear and straightforward. 
This is the first time in a while I experience real feelings, so doing this and letting you know is very special.

I don't know how to end this message and i will probably pass out from anxiety after hitting send so...I guess I'll finish this with a: 
Te Quiero :)

376,"went to doctor and they want me to get an MRI because I have had optic neuritis, weird tingling sensations and other symptoms that might point to MS. my sister is going to have a kid in the next two months and I don't want to ruin the moment for her or to stress her out which might affect the baby's development in utero. my mom's dad died last year and she's been kinda depressed about that as well as worried about me in general as I'm kinda a fuckup as of right now. my mom doesn't have much to look forward to but I think she's really excited about the baby. my mom is a really sweet and caring person but I have a feeling that she might resent me on some level if I tell her about having MS. she might think I ruined the one good thing she had to look forward to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if early diagnosis really makes a difference or not but the reason I would even want to tell anyone in my family in the first place is so that we can change the food that we keep in our house. I've heard about some people being able to control MS to some degree with diet changes and we're not extremely unhealthy but we definitely have foods that are not ideal lying around. I've tried to change my diet to gluten free, dairy free but it's just so damn hard with good food here. I'm thinking that if I can convince my dad to say he wants the family to try a whole 30 challenge together then that could help to get the shitty food out of the house. so yeah I guess my plan right now is to see if I have it, if I do then tell my dad and try to get him to have my mom quit buying shitty food and then wait a few months after the baby is born to tell my mom/sister I have MS. please give me any advice/insight you might have

I didn't want to spend too much since I'd like to save some money and buy myself a flat somewhere in a few years hopefully, and renting an apartment seems a waste, I can leave my stuff at my uncle's place while I'm away, I'm already doing this so my mother doesn't sell my stuff while I'm away (she did once and I began doing this).

384,"Hey guys, I need advice on what would be a good enough, foolproof (or close to it) way for my older dad to search for christmas gifts online. He trusts me since I'm young and have a good track record buying things online, but he says he doesn't want to keep asking me to link him what he's looking for since he doesn't want to feel like a burden and all that. So when he asks me how he can do the research himself, I come to a pretty tough spot. Obviously, I know if I tell him all the nuances of what I do he'd just be completely overwhelmed. But at the same time I don't want to recommend him something that isn't good enough since he trusts me. Like he at least knows to just shop on big name store websites or amazon, but those can still be a hit or miss depending on the item. I am at a loss, really, on what exactly I should recommend to him.

Should it be normal advice of ""just stay on amazon and try to find large amount/good of reviews""? Maybe take it a step up and show him what fakespot is?

Is there some marketplace I don't know of that would be appealing, simple, and legitimate for him? 

Maybe there are chrome extensions that add another layer of security or spot scams?

Hard for me to tell for sure. He isn't like completely tech-illiterate and at least knows what a browser is, for example, he spends a good amount of time on the computer. But you know, older people tend to fall for some simpler tricks in the book on the internet.

387,"This incident happened a few months ago, and it's something that really impacted my life negatively. I am 14(F) and I constantly get told I'm lazy by my parents because as of now I'm not really super invested in any hobby or sport, but I actually do enjoy a lot of things and I have quite a few causal hobbies that I like, but I don't think my parents understand. Because of this, my mom had told me that she was planning to sign me up for a 45 minute golf club lesson because she's sick of me ""not doing anything with my life"". She said I should try playing and then she will enrol me into long-term golf training. Even before she actually signed me up, I had already stated that I was not interested in playing golf, and I told her that multiple times and tried to be as clear as possible. And then without me knowing, she still went and enrolled me, and she also enrolled my 12 year old sister. I was really pissed about that but I really didn't want to act like a brat so I tried my best and sucked it up and went to my class that day. It was after school, and I already had a horrible day at school, but I tried to hide my annoyance. The class went okay and I tried to act like I wanted to be there and that I liked playing golf to please everyone. Then at the last 5 minutes of the class, my mom came early and was on the side watching. She was also taking pictures of me and my sister playing golf. I don't know why but I felt really annoyed that she came and was even smiling as she watched us. I didn't like how she was happy watching me do something that I had stated I didn't want to do and didn't like to do. So I had a complete mood change and I was visibly gloomy, and I played badly on purpose during the last 5 minutes of the class, I guess out of spite? Thinking back now I was probably the biggest brat for doing that, and I don't normally act out against my mom, but I was really annoyed at the time. Fast forward after the lesson finished, my sister got praised by the coach for having good golfing skills. Then me, my mom, and my sister went back to the car for the drive home. The moment we entered the car, my mom launched into a big rage. She was yelling about how I was an embarrassment and how the coach could've seen how horrible I was, and how I couldn't even behave for 45 minutes. She kept going on and on and I'm surprised that I didn't cry during her rage because I was honestly so annoyed. I didn't say a single word while she was speaking, I didn't want to talk back, but at some point I had enough and I told her how I was actually behaving perfectly before she came, and how I was only moody when she arrived. She looked like she was about to hurt me after I said that, but she didn't say anything so I got really scared. She looked like she was thinking a lot. Finally she said that she was going to cancel my orthodontist appointment, that was the day after the golf lesson. I was going to go to the orthodontist appointment to discuss getting braces, because my teeth are absolutely horrid and also my biggest insecurity, my teeth are literally the reason I don't smile or laugh. At all. The dentist also said that I might have to get a few teeth taken out in the future if I don't get braces now at this age, and if I do get them taken out I will have to live without those teeth for the rest of my life unless I get dentures. I also get comments from people almost on the daily about how I have 'weird' teeth, so now I usually talk with my mouth as closed as much as possible. So after she said that I felt so so broken, like my only hope at being able to laugh and be happy again was taken away, and I felt it was ridiculous that because of a 45 minute golf session, my mom did something that could impact my life forever. I couldn't say anything after that, I felt that it would've been useless, like talking to a wall, because I don't exactly have a good relationship with my mom. I haven't bothered talking to my mom about this since then because I actually asked her about it a week after that incident and she straight up said that it wasn't her problem. She doesn't even care. I tried to think in my moms shoes but I really don't understand why she did what she did. So I'm now looking for a job to pay for braces, which will take me years to save up for.  Side note my sister also needed braces, and she is getting hers on very soon. I still have to face my mom everyday and act like I 'love' her but I honestly don't think I have anybody in this entire world that I truly love. I constantly feel like I'm only living to live, I don't think I've laughed or even smiled in a long time and I feel really empty, I don't know why I'm acting fine anymore. So any advice? And what jobs can I get as a 14 year old that pays okay?",03Dec2019,1
388,"2 days ago I went in and purchased a straight talk branded Motorola with a pre-installed SIM card. I have had few problems with straight talk but I had always used unlocked phones. But I need a new phone and there was a good deal. I picked up the phone and some minutes and went home to try to activate a phone. 

After several hours of failure and calls with tech support I was eventually told that because the serial code of the phone doesn't match the serial code that was on the box I would need to go and return that phone to Walmart. However the SIM card was the appropriate SIM card installed. Also it seems that the phone that I had was already registered to a different number and the phone was not new but used.

returning to Walmart as soon as I could I was immediately told that there was no chance of a refund because the serial codes codes do not match. I explained to them that this is how the phone was sold to me. Sales representative at Walmart suggested that I'm trying to scam them and asked me to leave the store. 

I call up 1 800 Walmart and explain the situation to be told that this issue would be ""elevated"". And I should expect a phone call 4 to 5 business days.

honestly I've no idea what's going on and everyone I've talked to on the phone very confused and everyone working at Walmart thinks I'm trying to scam them. 

I really don't know what to do because I need that phone or my money back but I don't know if there's any hope.

I have a ticket number for my complaint at 1-800 Walmart but that's all I have except for a phone that works just fine that can't be used.

TL;DR

Walmart refuses to exchange return a phone that I just purchased because somewhere along the line the packaging or something happened and I'm being accused of scamming the store and have no chance of returning my money or an exchange. 1 800 Walmart listen to me and gave me a complaint number that doesn't seem like it will go anywhere.",03Dec2019,1
389,"24, Male and very confused on how to go about my life. Graduated high school in 2014 and dropped out of college(law enforcement) that December (found out I was having a baby).

My little girl was born Feb 2015 and I started my job at Walmart in March. Was busy raising my daughter and working that I lost interest in becoming a police officer for the time being. Months pass and I’m now a CSM, and I pull out a loan to buy a car. Not even a month later I’m picking weed up for my mom and get pulled over. I was charged with Theft, speeding, no plates, no proof of insurance, and possession of marijuana. 

I ended up losing my job, my car and ending my relationship with my girlfriend. I start heavily smoking weed again, and only quit because a friend of mine hooked me up with a recruiter for the National Guard. 

I then went to basic training in 2016 and graduated that December. Right before my last RSP drill, i smoked shatter with a buddy. Went to drill that weekend and was randomly selected for a drug screen. GREAT. 

I get to my duty station that next month and of course they know about the drug screen. Very first drill at my new duty station I was stripped of my rank, kicked out of scouts, and loss of pay. 

Some very poor financial decisions later and I have a torn ACL/Meniscus, I’m still an E1 in the military and I have no hope In becoming a police officer. On top of that I was very verbally abusive to my girlfriend of 1+ years (although we have already reached the lowest point in our relationship, the verbal abuse has cleared up significantly).

Basically I think of my self as “not good enough” and I’ll never amount to anything. I’m still regularly smoking marijuana but I have this burning passion to still be a cop. Should I just give up and pursue other career options? Should I stop smoking weed? I don’t feel the same in my relationship that I did when we first got together, so should I end it? And if so, I would be homeless. Please anything helps.

392,"Im 23 and recently moved back in with my mom, I’ve been short on money and needed a place to stay until I could find another job. She knew I would be with her for about 4 months in total but when I arrived she had set up a mattress in the garage. Like under her apartment where one would park a car. It’s connected to the apartment on top but doesn’t have a lockable door. Just a wooden slide-across door and then a bigger roller door, the ones where you push a button and they roll up so you can drive your car in. 

My mom shares a room with her boyfriend, my younger sister who is 12 has her own room and then they have a spare room which my mums boyfriend uses for his computers and some of his other boy toys. 

I don’t have much privacy in the garage bc of the whole door situation mentioned earlier. And also because this is where our laundry machines are, so if anyone needs to do laundry they have to come in here. I also share the space with a bunch of house storage items, boxes, a bike and the odd spider. On top of this my mom asks me to pay $100 in rent every week. We got in a fight a while ago and I brought up how I’m sleeping on a mattress on the floor of the garage and she got very upset at how ungrateful I was being. 

I honestly don’t mind most of the time but sometimes if I’m being honest with myself it makes me a little sad knowing that a computer has a room with a lockable door and I don’t. I don’t really know how to bring this up to my mum without making her think that I am not thankful for what I have.

395,"Okay, so basically my parents (Early 40’s) guilt tripped me (18M) into moving across the USA back in June. The deal being that if I didn’t like it by December, they would help me move back and life with my grandparents. Now, because of my mental health being awful, my grades have slipped in college. They decided to force a new deal onto me: Get all grades passing at a C or they won’t help me get home. Now, I’m already mad about this but I decided to at least try. I’ve currently got an 81, 69, 51, and a 42. I’m kinda screwed. It’s kind of sad that my professors have been more sympathetic to my mental health problems than my parents have. Whenever I tried to talk to them about it, they’ve said “You pissed away your chance”. I’m going to own up and say that I didn’t get a job here, partially because I had to adjust and didn’t want more stress, partially because of my mental health, and also because I didn’t want to be that guy who quits in the holiday season.

So my question is, what can I do? What do you all think I can do in order to get my parents to agree to let me move back home? I’m at the point where I’ve had a couple of mental breakdowns and I was going to start begging but thought I would ask for some advice first. Thank you for your time.

My group of friends from 5 years ago has completely forgotten about me. I’m not perfectly healthy and happy, and I’m not loud or extroverted enough to fit in with them.

I’ve been hella depressed and suicidal for a couple years and recently it’s been better but my lazyness isn’t changing. Am I gonna fuck myself over if I drop out? I don’t really care if my job is enjoyable I really only want to be able to support myself. I am also trans so I imagine getting a job Is gonna be a little more complicated than for most people. I don’t really know if I can get my shit together and be able to pass anyway. Should I just drop out now?,03Dec2019,1

401,"TLDR; packages have gone missing after construction workers began work in my apartment complex. I am a victim of stolen AirPods. Any advice on who to approach and how to get this settled for myself? Thank you in advance!

I ordered AirPods last week and they delivered today. Upon coming back home 2 hours after getting the delivery notification, they were nowhere to be found! I was bummed and immediately connected to ups customer service and they told me to fill out a claims form. I knocked on the doors of some neighbors in the apt complex who said they didn’t have it. I gave up and went to the library to study. 

I came back a couple of hours later and checked around my apt complex one more time. In the basement is a parking garage and in a random space I found three packages that had been torn open. One of them was mine, one was from a neighbor, and the third was from the building adjacent to mine. I knocked on my neighbors door and she let me know that she was missing a package as well. 

Lately there have been a lot of construction workers working in my complex and the one that is adjacent. We believe that they have been taking packages and opening them to take the goods inside.

I was wondering if anyone could give me advice on how to approach the situation. I am nearly certain the workers took it because before the construction, packages would lay out for days by the mailbox without anyone picking them up. Now, as soon as the workers came, packages seem to be disappearing.

How should I approach this issue???",03Dec2019,1
402,"I've been unemployed for the past 2.5 years. I was working in healthcare and had 5+ years experience. I had great relationships with my bosses and coworkers and had no problems getting them to agree to be my references when I left. The problem is I told them I was looking to work elsewhere but in reality I felt burnt out and while I intended to find employment elsewhere, I had relationship issues that made me depressed and anxious and I stayed unemployed for 2.5 years. Not because of any reason other than me procrastinating and making excuses not to get back to work. 

So now I'm finally feeling ready to apply for interviews but do I need to notify my references that they might get a call? This makes me extremely self conscious because I'm reluctant to admit I've done nothing since I left. 

Also, when I get an interview, what should I say about that 2.5yr lack of work? My friend suggest I just say I was working on some personal issues but I worry it's too vague and cryptic is dismissive.

I really want to do it but I tell myself I couldn't bear to do that to the people I know but it's hard to remind myself of that. I feel so selfish. I'm scared to hurt the people I care about.

406,"Where I live there's this tradition on the nameday of Saint Nicholas (the inspiration of Santa Clause). His nameday is on the 6th of december and the tradition is that all young children, the evening before, put out a shoe with a carrot and a sugarcube (for the horse) and a list with gifts they'd like.  Other than that the same ''rules'' apply as they do with Santa. You behave well, you get toys and treats, you misbehave you get a ''stick''. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, on to the issue. I have a son, he's 7 going on 8 and i have been struggling with his behaviour for the better part of two years now. He's extremely manipulative towards his younger sister, very agressive and does NOT care about any of the consequenses his actions warrant. He's incredibly intelligent, thus gets bored and seems to find ''pleasure'' in creating anger/frustration/sadness in others. 

He has been going to both therapy to ''guide'' him and behavioral therapy, we implimented a solid structure and he is very well aware of the rules in my house. What is and is not allowed, and what repercussions his actions warrant. 

His intelligence mixed with his creativity make it virtually impossible to have a ''solid'' way to impliment a ''punishment'' (for the lack of a better word). A few examples: 

\- You're not allowed to watch TV/play Xbox for the rest of the day. ''Fine, i'll just watch tomorrow'' (this implies for any length of time)

\- You're going to bed straight after dinner. ''Fine, i won't sleep anyway'' (And he actually doesn't, he lays in bed singing, making up stories, etc) 

\- Time-outs are an absolute joke. If i'd put him in there for 3 hours, he wouldn't care. He does the same as when i send him to bed early. 

Lastly, i've implimented a system where my kids can earn ''points'', with said points they can buy things like extra screentime, save up for a toy they want, etc...   (Obligatory insert: i felt like this was a very good way of teaching them that you have to ''earn'' things in life and felt like it would be a massive motivation to literally ''see'' the way their actions affect their daily life. Where my daughter (5) treats her points as if they're holy, he schrugs them off and reasons that he'll just earn points another time to get whatever it is he's saving up for. (They can earn points by doing their chores, behaving well and sometimes when they do something exceptionally polite, nice, something that deserves a reward, i'll give them a point randomly). This entire ''system'' has been drawn out with little pictograms and hangs in the living room. 

But, clearly that doesn't work for my son either. I have tried on multiple occasions, both with and without the therapist to sit down and talk him trough things. Figure out WHY he acts out like this, no judgement, no punishments, just an honest conversation without concequenses. The only respons me, or anyone that has tried has ever gotten (like his grandmother) is that he ''doesn't feel like following the rules''. 

On to the actual question, would it be a horrible idea to not have Saint Nicholas drop off gifts/treats this year? I'm really conflicted about this, because it's a childrens holiday, all his friends will get gifts and he's really really stoked about it. I really don't want to scar my kid for life and i also kind of look forward to seeing his little face when he wakes up to a bunch of toys. On the other hand, Saint Nicholas drops off toys for kids that have behaved and despite my endless warnings and attempts to correct his behavior he knowingly, fully informed, refuses to follow the rules ''because he doesn't feel like it''. 

So, reddit. What are my options here?

408,"I guess this all really started last year. As a freshman in college, I made a concerted effort to become a better person and start living in the moment more rather than worrying about the big picture all the time. My efforts were successful, and it was the best year of my life—I got better at talking to people, enjoyed the little things in life more, did well in school, and just had a good time no matter what I was doing—sober or not. 

I’ve also been an over thinker, but over the summer, things started to get really bad. My job is one that involves a lot of sitting and doing nothing, which gave me a lot of time to think. Normally, this wouldn’t be the end of the world, but I started getting this thought which I found very odd and annoying. The question would pop into my head “am I living in the moment?” or “what if I’m not living in the moment?”, and I’m doing so, distracted me from focusing on what I was doing—reading, playing on my phone, etc—until I could get the thoughts out of my head and continue. Essentially, it was preventing me from living in the moment—ironic right? 

From the moment it started, it continued happening almost every single day, sometimes every 5 minutes, which is debilitating and extremely frustrating, sometimes once every couple hours. Some days when I was very busy it would only happen once or twice, which was nice, but that was few and far between. 

I was hoping that once I went back to school, things would get better, but they didn’t. The thought started popping into my head less frequently, but was still there. Eventually, it started happening more often again, and now it’s consistently happening probably around once every half hour to hour. 

It ruins my conversations, distracts me from doing my work, and annoys the living shit out of me. It’s now something I constantly worry about and have anxiety over because if it happens while talking to someone, the conversation is ruined on my end. If it happens during a test it delays my work. It’s so extremely frustrating and I don’t know what to do about it. 

I’ve done so much research trying to figure out what I can do to help myself and get this to go away (it honestly feels like it never will—I don’t see how I can just forget about having this thought). Recently, I learned about intrusive thoughts and anxiety, and that’s what this seems like to me, although it’s not of the typical nature of an intrusive thought. It also makes me worry that since I have this one, what if other things become intrusive thoughts. 

The best way I can describe it is if extremely similar to “the game”, if you’ve ever heard of it. It’s where basically you lose if you think about “the game”, and you have to announce “I lost the game” every time you lose. Kind of a meta concept that operates on the white bear principle (ironic process theory is the professional term). 

This has taken such a toll on my daily life. I was so happy last year—all of my relationships were great, I was doing well for myself in every facet of life. But it just feels like this has caused all of that to crumble. I don’t know what to do; going to see a psychologist scares the shit out of me because I’m terrified to hear that I have a mental illness and really don’t want to take Xanax every day for the rest of my life. I’ve looked into it anyway but the psychologists at my school’s mental health center all have wait lists multiple months long... it’s kind of ridiculous that people who need help more than I do couldn’t get it even if they really needed it—I had to wait almost 3 hours when I walked in to see someone who told me that I couldn’t start getting appointments for another couple months!

I really need advice on how to handle this. Like I said, I’ve always been an over thinker, and a very analytical person, but this is on a whole different level. Any help is greatly appreciated. I hope I can get the life I had back.

410,"Hey everyone,

Made this account specifically for this purpose. Been bouncing from post to post on this topic but finally decided to talk about this and ask questions pertaining to my situation. So, here it goes.

I am 19 years old, going on 20 pretty soon. I am still a virgin and had my penis circumcised over Summer 2019 because of a case of phimosis.  I have recently figured out that I may be suffering from ED. How so?

* I have seen that I cannot achieve a full erection with a girl I like and am attracted to very much. I had an erection that was maybe 70-80% hard and once I was putting the condom on, I became soft and could not 'stick it in'. Was very demoralizing for me since I was super excited to have sex for the first time, as I was scared to in previous occasions because of my phimosis and having the skin tear or whatever. I also try to stay away from handjobs because my penis is still sensitive to strong grips (or the girls not being able to give a proper handjob due to my circumcision case) but these still do not give me an erection. I should also note that after this one time, we did have closer encounters but I still did not really achieve an erection or was 'turned on' like I know I should be.
* I cannot achieve a full erection when masturbating anymore, and have noticed I am watching porn that is way more intense than what I used to. 
* I have looked into the NoFap movement and am on Day 3 of no fapping and even now, I notice that I do not get erections throughout the day (such as morning-wood) and do not really have a sexual desire. Granted, I would not get erections throughout the day before I had started but this was because I **would masturbate often (around once a day but sometimes more, would edge often, sometimes for multiple hour sessions).** Granted, I have cut down in the past couple weeks but if quitting masturbating and porn entirely (which seems like the way to go) is best, I am willing to do this. 
* Also, when I had my phimosis, during times when I should've been having sex with my partners (as I've been in plenty of these situations), I would just masturbate to get off and not really have them do anything, especially to make me cum as again, I was deathly afraid of the foreskin tearing. I realize now this is kinda fucked.

I should also mention that I am very skinny for my height (135 pounds, 6'1) and that I am an easily anxious person.  I have quit pot (over two months sober) and nicotine (almost a month without) so these shouldn't be an issue moving forward and that I have a pretty good willpower to get better for myself and those around me. I am trying to not overthink with my partner as I came clean to her about this issue and she told me there is nothing to worry about on her part and that she is here for me (I realize I'm a really lucky guy). Was wondering if I do actually suffer from ED and if it most likely is attributed to porn and/or masturbating and/or perhaps something else? I really don't know, and not being able to have sex (especially when I could if I didn't have these problems) fucking sucks. Cheers.",03Dec2019,1
411,"Ever since I can remember, my mom has always asked me what I ate for the day and what I plan to eat. But it wasn’t everyday that she’d ask me these questions. At first it was like okay, whatever. But now it has become an everyday topic of discussion. 

Let me give you a description of my body type and lifestyle. I’m 22F and I am about 5’8. I’m hardly over 200lbs but my weight is evenly distributed. I work at a indoor sports facility where I teach, but occasionally join in class and get my work outs in for the day. I’m part of multiple sports leagues and like to stay active. I’m not saying I’m in the best shape I could be, but I don’t have any crazy health issues. And I’m taking care of the minor ones I have. 

So back to my mom, it’s now become a part of my daily life and it’s the norm in my conversations with my mom. You can imagine that this doesn’t make me feel very good and it really puts a damper of my ego and self esteem. I’ve been known to be a confidant person, but when I get home and my mom raids questions about what I ate today and in great detail, it really sucks. 

I’ve told my mom how I feel and what it does to me every time she brings up those kinds of questions. And she says she doesn’t care and that she thinks that I have a problem. 

I don’t eat a lot and I only eat like 2 big meals a day, and maybe a snack. Every time my mom catches me eating, even if the last time I ate was 4 hours before, she says “you’re eating again?” In a very condescending way. 

I have realized that no matter what, if I lose weight or gain weight, she still will make the same snarky comments towards me. 

It’s gotten to the point where it puts a strain on our relationship, because my mom can’t see me for who I am. I’m obviously trying to be better, but when I’m hungry, I wanna eat something.  She makes it very difficult to be around her and I often want nothing to do with her because of it. 

Obviously I love my mom but this really hurts me and she knows it does.  There were a couple of times, one more recent, when I asked her to stop calling me out on what I eat and making snarky comments about it. And she promised she wouldn’t do that. But here I am writing this post because she hasn’t stopped and it’s gone to far.

For the longest time I have woken up in my sleep to myself screaming. It has happened as long as I can remember. I fucking hate it. This is not an every night thing it happens maybe once a month where I’ll sometimes go up to 4 months without doing it. This week is the only time I can remember where it has happened multiple times in a week. 

Its always the same dream something bad or evil is chasing me or I’m trying to tell someone something and I’m trying to yell for help but nothing comes out but mumbles . (The best way I can describe it is my mouth melts like Neo in the matrix when they put that bug inside his belly button.) the same mumbling noises I make in my dream I’m making out loud. My wife has gotten to the point where she has caught on and realizes when I’m about the have an episode and can wake me up before I have a full blown episode which makes things a lot easier on me. I’m usually huffing and puffing and I wake up really really slowly. (When you wake up normally you just open your eyes and your awake. Well this is a waaaay slower transition when I’m having an episode) if she doesn’t catch the episode then I will try mumbling in my dreams and in real life until I wake up screaming and it’s usually when I finally get a word out like “RUN” or “HELP” at the top of my lungs. Usually after I need to get up walk around get my heart beat back to normal and calm my nerves down even though overall the dreams are not that scary. If I don’t do this and I go right back to sleep I have had multiple times where I go right back into the dream again and it starts over.

422,"So last year I was living in another state. I had to unfortunately move back home with my mother and sibling. While I was away though, I had finally lost over 80 pounds. I went from 230 to 140 I think in about 8 months. I was a huge size 18 and was almost able to fit into a size 11! When I got home, my mom picked me up from the airport and had seen all the weight I lost (finally had an effing thigh gap!). Instead of being happy for me the first thing my mother said was ""I need to feed you a sandwich!""......TF? And that comment stuck with me ever since.

My mom is over 300 pounds and is a recluse. She has no friends, no husband, no family and never goes out (whole other story). She has told me stories about her jealous, vindictive tendencies when I was younger. I even witnessed her trying to technically kill her ""friend"" for reasons I'm unaware of. Obviously something petty. My mother is a genuine psychopath lol....ugggghhhh....🙄😟

Anyway, I've been gaining weight for the last year and I am now currently back to 210 pounds. I am depressed. Since October I have been doing the OMAD (this was how I lost weight to begin with). I was 190 in October and now in December I am 210.... And I can't figure out how I've gained instead of lost. I move around alot and only eat once. I'm even eating enough calories and macros for a sedentary lifestyle, but I'm STILL gaining weight. It's that serious!!. The only thing I can think of is that my mom puts something in my food. Since I meal prep, and work overnight, she has the perfect opportunity to do so. She has even started ""bragging"" about the few pounds she has lost.

He calls the previous owner a slum lord and lists off every way he was wronged by him, including a previous fence issue. He says the fence is my sole financial responsibility, but he must be home for my repairman to work, since the previous owners workers apparently stole tools from his yard. 

Anyways, I’m just trying not to ruffle this guy up since I’m going to be living next to him for the foreseeable future. I am trying to exit the conversation and he suddenly brings up the ‘terrible history’ of MY house, including rat infestations, pest fumigation tents, and a double murder in 1991. He even tells me there are strange noises around my house and there’s Ghosts of the murdered people floating around. WTF.

I’m rational and pragmatic, and I know this dude is trying to somehow scare me into leaving my house, but I am terrified of ghosts and this INSTANTLY got under my skin. I’m anxious and looked online for 45 minutes to confirm his story, but found nothing. I even paid $10 to cross check public records on a “did someone die in this house” website. Nothing showed up. 

Can y’all give me a reassurance that this dude is just trying to screw with me? I need the power of public opinion to ease my deep fears.",03Dec2019,1
426,"The title says it all. I know it’s difficult to answer since body language is something that can only be observed and analysed but I will try to explain in the most objective way possible. I (19F) have been told at every point of my life that something’s wrong with my body language and I need to correct it (by teachers and family)
The point is, I just don’t see where it is wrong, or how what I say/how I say is offensive. And many times, when people get offended, I GENUINELY don’t mean it in a bad way. But I don’t want people to keep thinking of me like this. 
A few days ago, my mom called the telephone and when I picked up, she asked me why I took so long to pick up. I found the question funny because it just naturally happened that I couldn’t get to the phone on time and I jokingly replied, “why, can I not pick up late?” I didn’t say it impatiently or rudely, I’m sure of that. I meant it as a joke because there was an air of laughter or playfulness but I guess it didn’t come off like that because she was hurt. 
Other times, my teachers always told my parents that they felt I had a superiority air around me, and a lot of ego. But...the point is, it never has been my intention to sound or come across like that. Fact is, I hate snobbish people. 
I asked my friends back when we were in school why teachers constantly thought that about me and they said that sometimes the tone of my voice made it seem that I was stating/questioning them, rather than asking. In fact these friends confessed to me that when they first saw me they felt intimidated by me...and this is when THEY SAW, not even talked. They couldn’t give a reason why. Is it possible because I have a major resting b**** face? I know there are times where I’m just sitting and my cousin came up to my and seriously asked me if I was depressed...just because of the way I looked while waiting for her. I know Smiling helps but there are situations where I just can’t smile for obvious reasons. This has made me ULTRA self conscious of my looks. Even when the choice of words is correct, I still come across as rude. I don’t know what to. I have a good relationship with my family but sometimes this gets in the way, and it really hurts me. 
I remember when I was 8 years old my mother was explaining something to me and I crossed my hands to listen to it and...out of nowhere she slapped me, asking my why I was showing attitude. I wasn’t making a face, I’m sure of that. And Jbtw, my mom is not delusional as teachers have at every point said something of the same nature to me. I really want to change. I know basic things like don’t fold your hands, smile more, be mindful when someone’s scolding you, etc.. does it have anything to do with my face? Do you know of someone with the same problem?

429,"I grew up with a mom who is mentally unwell. I always blamed myself when she had an episode and in turn, my step dad did too. She did a lot of things but there is one moment I relive over and over and it’s my reason for cutting her out of my life. 
My mother woke me up at 6 am, maybe I was 16/17 at the time, by ripping me out of bed by my hair. She was screaming about how I didn’t cook some ground meat that was in the bottom drawer of the fridge and now it was rotten. (She was in the hospital for a few days before this and she told me about the meat and asked me to clean the house but my dad said I could stay at a friends house and naturally I did that- I did straighten the house up a bit before she got home but I forgot about the meat). 
At this point, with her hand still in my hair and jerking me around in the hallway, I’m trying to wake up and piece together what’s going on. She then took the uncooked meat, and rotten, and shoved it into my open eyes, nose, and mouth. Then she pushed me out our door that had about five steps. I remember hurting my ankle a bit because I was wearing a night t shirt and was trying not to let it fly up since we lived near a busy road. 
Anyway, I washed my face as best as I could with the water hose and stayed outside with the chickens. My step dad eventually showed up and calmed her down. I asked for an apology from her, and her exact words were, “you don’t deserve an apology.” 
This is one of many things my mom did to me while I was growing up and I feel like this all was abuse. When I told my step father about all of this, he don’t want to hear anything she did and kept repeating she is unwell and this is just your perception of things. 
I haven’t talked to my mom in a little over two years, I’m in my late 20s now. I stopped talking to her when she decided to attempt suicide and then blames me saying that I called her and got in a fight with her. (Which never happened and I tried to show my step dad but he didn’t care) 
Now I’m back in America and my family expects me to do holidays with her, I never told my family about any of this out of fear of what they would think of me and what my parents would say or do. I can feel that my family judges me now that I don’t want to see my mentally unwell mother. 
I’m also pregnant and I think back on the stuff she did and the stuff she said and I don’t want that for my child, I don’t want my child to be touched by that. My husband fully supports me thankfully. 
My question is do I tell my family so maybe they understand why I’ve chosen to cut her out of my life? I feel like I’ll just be called a liar, like always. I think my parents genuinely think my mother isn’t abusive and maybe she isn’t and I’m just sensitive.",03Dec2019,1

432,"Ever since April I have struggled to find work. 

My last work place closed when they company suddenly bought themselves out of a contract and I was out of a job with no alternatives lined up. I have since worked a handful of jobs, mostly temporary work or seasonal work that didn't have any long lasting opportunities. Even with the gaps in my employment over the last 6 months I've survived well enough without taking too many hits to my credit or anything like that, a few late bills here and there and a couple reminder phone calls but that's it. 

Ive recently found myself a full time job with a potential to become something more, it is a work from home telecom customer service position which I've never done before but it has the makings of being a real job to make a survivable salary. Here's the kicker.. I hate it. I realize this may make me sound like a baby but I've never truly disliked anywhere I've worked up until now so I figured this is just me paying my dues. Everyone has a job usually at some point in their life they don't like but we have to do what we have to do. With this mentality I pushed on and continued to work to the best of my ability for as long as I could.

These last couple weeks the job has really been hard. I have been trading any shifts away that I can.. and calling off when downtime is available. In the case where I'm unable to get the shift off I become physically ill thinking about returning to work. It started off as difficulty sleeping, a little bit of anxiety, a knot in my stomach, pretty standard stuff for a new job so I figured it was just a comfort thing. I was very wrong. I don't know what it is but I am unable to keep myself mentally stable enough to get through a work day. It has started to bleed over into my home life as my s/o has noticed an obvious difference in my behavior. After a week of me sleeping all day, avoiding running any errands, not showering, being standoff-ish, and basically hiding from the world she asked me what was going on so I told her everything. She has been very supportive about me taking any time off I need and about me looking for other job opportunities but I haven't had much luck with employment. I've applied to just about anything else available with no response and limited interest when I follow up. So now I'm stuck..

I'm once again looking at my finances and what limited savings I have put together and noticing I have much less wiggle room than I did 6 months ago. My options are basically to put myself and my s/o into a scary place financially, or to just suck it up and push forward trying to keep myself as focused as possible.

I have never been a negative person, I don't have a history of anxiety or depression, and I am usually the quickest to make the best out of a bad situation; but even I don't think I can survive this job for very long.

My s/o brought up smoking a little weed to balance me out. Just enough to get me through the shifts. I'm not sure that's a good idea as a temporary fix but it's some creative thinking I suppose. What does everybody think?

Is pushing through correct here? Am I just being a bit of a baby? I honestly don't know if the stress of debt will be worse than the stress of the job.

6 months.. 6 months of not being able to provide for me and my s/o. I've felt like shit not being able to contribute and now this. I've never felt so weak in my life. I don't know what to do and I'm scared to make the wrong decision. Has anyone been here before? Did you tough it out and did it work out for you? I'm not even sure what I'm hoping for but when you cant sleep at 5am this seems like a pretty good place to work out your problems lol

434,"I'm on mobile, so please forgive typos and such.

My ex and I are still friends, and not because we ended things amicably, but rather because we don't want to let each other go completely. I want a friendship. He wants more.

When he mistreated me, I moved on to someone else. But he swears he's still in love with me and would do anything to have me, etc. It's hard to let him go because we've spent almost a decade being very close and sharing everything. He was beside me (online anyways) through some of the worst years of my life. He helped me to literally survive it. But was also one of the reasons I struggled. And I can't help but miss the way he used to be with me when the dark thoughts return. He used to send me the sweetest messages and call me multiple times a day. He was so caring and thoughtful. We talked all day every day. Phone calls, Skype calls, texts, etc. He was different before I ended the romantic aspect. For the last four years, he's been different enough to make me consider leaving him behind completely, and when I come across old messages or an old email, it breaks my heart. I still love him, but we can't be together. Our lives won't allow it and I fell in love with someone else. I'm not willing to destroy my currently happy relationship for someone who had no problem cheating on me and abandoning me literally within a couple hours, no matter what they promise me.

Every time I think I would be fine without him, I come across something that makes me think about how great our friendship used to be, and I've begged him to work on the friendship with me but he says we're fine and he sees no point in repairing anything else unless I'm with him and not my partner. He refused to accept responsibility for the things he did, even though I hashed out all my own issues and apologized for my own mistakes.

My partner is okay with us talking, and has encouraged me to repair the friendship. He has no issues with me being close to my ex or even allowing me to see him, which I haven't done yet because I'm worried about my ex's expectations ruining a visit.

I just want things back to normal so I can continue healing myself. This person means so much to me and has been a big part of my life for so long, and I don't know how to go forward.

I don’t trust that even with a new job description, I won’t end up dragged into project after project of the same work as before because I know myself: if no one else is stepping up, I will end up doing it for them. If my boss doesn’t have capacity to help now, why would he have capacity then? 

The problem is the business not being structured or set up for success and a lack of accountable people stepping up to the plate. My boss can’t solve for a systemic issue that’s Enterprise-wide.

Recently, (around 1-2 months ago) she got a girlfriend who was strange to say the least. All she focuses on ever is pronouns and genders and treats the fact that she’s gay like a personality trait if you get what I’m saying? I don’t like using the term “special snowflake” but she’s the definition. She gets off at absolutely anything. Basically all she talks about is gender, sexuality, etc. So last night, she referred to Una as “Max” over text. She wasn’t directly talking to me so I couldn’t ask her what that was all about. I haven’t spoken to Una yet because it was late and she was sleeping. It’s morning now, and I’m home sick from school, so still no opportunity to talk to her.

We clicked instantly and hit it off, so obviously we started dating. I didn’t get along with his friend (let’s call her Jane). 

Jane just didn’t seem to like me and thought I was controlling because my bf wanted to spend some time with me after classes. I thought this was natural because obviously she just wanted to hang out with him. 

It was rocky at the beginning, she would sleep at his house, and he would sleep on the sofa. There was one occasion where she broke up with her bf and cried in bed so he went and cuddled her for a bit. 

This pissed me off but I let it slide. Anyway long story short she hated me. She tried to convince us to break up, and talked shit about me because of little things like I got a tattoo and died my hair and stuff. 

Whenever I entered the room she would purposefully tickle my bf and flirt with him and draw on him with some highlighters to piss me off. 

Long story short, he eventually stopped heir friendship as it was turning really stressful for him and besides - they were going to different Unis. 

This was around 1.5 years ago and they haven’t had much contact since.

She messaged him randomly at the weekend and they started chatting. It got to the point where they discussed student debt and things, and my bf tells me they spoke about her poor income for around 6 hours or something. 

She kept saying how she had no money to buy Christmas presents and really needed some as it was Black Friday deals.

I don’t know what happened after that but should I be worried?! Is she trying to get money off him or is this just completely natural.

She is quite open with her emotions and her thoughts, because (what I learned by spending time with her and observing her behaviour in the crowd) I think she really enjoys attention people give her as they listen to her talk about her past. Since I moved to another country for uni, she was the first person I met and I guess I was happy that I had someone to talk to in the beginning. But as I started meeting other people I also started getting closer to them and met a girl who is something like a best friend of mine now. The three of us are usually hanging out together, but those hang outs turn into the first girl's rants which the second friend and I thoroughly don't enjoy listening to every single day.   
Now, it has become clear that she is jealous of the second friend for being so close to me that she's trying to imitate her behaviour or talk like her just so I would like her more. It's becoming annoying because I can tell she's forcing something that she is not. I want to be her friend and I want to accept her, but it's really starting to get on my nerves. Furthermore, when the second friend and I plan to do something and she hears about it, she just invites herself and comes with. I hate myself for thinking this, but she can be such a mood kill. Quite often.

I started therapy and antidepressants but I still feel such a lack of motivation or interest in much of anything. I listen to music and watch tv with my parents. I pet the cats. I browse the internet. I very occasionally write a sort of poetry. I don’t do any of my hobbies anymore. I feel like the life has been sucked out of me even if I don’t want to kill myself anymore. 

I’m incredibly insecure about who I am as a person (lazy, boring, pathetic, rude, a burden, etc). I am also very aware of my appearance. I feel like my beauty is fading at 23 and I still haven’t had a serious relationship. 

I feel almost nervous to go back to school. Like everyone will see how much of a bad person I am and it’ll be embarrassing for me. 

I went through a breakup about a year ago and I don’t know if I’ve honestly gotten over it. He just stopped talking to me one day after I made one comment. He acted like I was a stranger when I said I wanted to come over and he said “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  
I still think about him sometimes and I go back and forth between hating myself for fucking up and hating him for leaving without a word. I feel like no one will compare to how interesting and passionate he was and sometimes I think about texting him. 


I feel nervous to start my adult life in six months after I graduate university. These few months I haven’t had school or steady work and I’ve squandered the potential. I’m stuck in my head. 

Maybe this was too extensive and I’m not asking for clear advice. 
Has anyone gone through a rock bottom before and what was it like and how did you get out? 
Does anyone have any “starting adult life” advice?
Or just in general any advice or words that may have come up while reading this is welcome. 

Anything is appreciated, thanks guys",03Dec2019,1
460,"I'm about to finish university in a month and the question where to settle down started really bugging me recently.


I'm from the capital city area (in a European country), but currently, I live in the countryside in a city of 155k. My boyfriend and I both have stable jobs that we like and housing is really cheap in the surrounding towns. Future kids would have to travel about 30 minutes to their high schools. We have my boyfriend's family nearby, who could help out with the kids, babysitting and such.


My mom however, really wants me to move back to the capital city area. It's definitely more developed, there are more schools to chose from, better infrastructure, significantly more jobs and higher pay. I have more family there, my mom, my brothers, aunts, cousins, my grandpa, etc. Housing is really expensive there, renting costs two times as much as we pay here and there is no way we can afford to buy a house there anytime soon. The salaries we would be earning are maybe 5-15% higher there, but buying a house costs easily 3-4 times as much, maybe even more.


The third option is moving abroad. My boyfriend already speaks the language of the desired county and I can learn it too. The pay is twice as much as here and it's a great country. The cost of living is higher and we have no family members or friends there. My boyfriend says that he would be a bit afraid of the change, but if I wanted to, we could move there.


What other things should I consider before choosing where to settle down? What are your thoughts about my 3 options?",03Dec2019,1
461,"Pretty much the title, she says she's confused, not ready for a relationship etc we have kissed but I don't think she really wanted it. Let's call her Don. Anyway, Don is my sister's bff, we have a small history, a first rejection from her 4 years ago, afterwards I fell( i was always mentally bad it just happened, it's not necessarily because of her) into a low point of my life, drinking, eating, weed you know living life in autopilot I cut contact with her but still feeling for her. Fast forward 14 months ago I had a real deep revelation while stoned which suddenly made me much better, I lost 30 kgs(66 for burger metrics), ate healthy, stopped drinking, started working out a bit, basically got my shit together, what really happened tho is I fell hard for Don again, she studies in another country so we met on Christmas I was still not much talkative to her  while my sister was there, but from my sisters point of view Don got kinda jealous, she thought I got a gf, I looked happier etc. so when my sister left(she is living in another country) I had 5 days left until Don went to study again, we pretty much got very close again and I dropped the I still like you bomb. She got shocked, and on the last day she just gave me a really strong hug out of nowhere while we were out. We kept contact until summer when we met again, we were even coworkers , had a great time but she thinks she can't do a serious relationship, she's confused and those things. So last days before she left we were really close again, holding hugs for god knows how long it felt like an eternity yet so short. What should I do, she is my only friend, I don't want to lose her she doesn't wanna lose me, she wants friendship I want relationship, I've told her I can't handle seeing you with someone else she says she doesn't like anyone. She says she doesn't get crushes and she has told my sis how much of a perfect and cute smile I have, that I'm good looking, my sister has told me if she has had a crush (that's not a gal , was looong ago) it's you. What the fuck do I do, I'm always stressed how she will find someone and I have seen a previous crush if mine kissing someone else it crushed me more than I could imagine, but that was just a crush, I'm in love with this girl, I don't think I could handle seeing her with someone else. I was thinking of telling her once she is done with the exams(so I don't stress and affect her performance) that I can't be friends anytime soon, I'm open for a relationship but not a friendship. What do you people think, I really have no idea what to do.",03Dec2019,1

I just left one of these abusive relationships and came home to my mother provoking me and gaslighting me and using my reactions to make me look crazy and eliminating the support of everyone I know including my family.

I went to a domestic violence crisis center and they told me to talk to a victim advocate because it’s not intimate partner violence.

465,"Hi everyone just made this account for obvious reasons you will see.

I’m a 32 y/o trans-male who just came out to my strict Catholic parents -spoiler- it did not go so well. My Dad called me a ‘queer’ and my Mom was crying from that moment until they kicked me out.

A little backstory on me; I’ve always been a tomboy and always felt I was a guy especially after severe depression/anxiety since I was about 7 due to childhood trauma. I’ve always hated the way I looked and turned to bulimia in order to lose fat from my boobs (I have quite a large bust size). 

I couch surfed back and forth from my two only and close friends until they both got sick of “dealing with my male body fantasy” I’m now homeless (posting from my local library btw) and don’t know what to do. I had a job at Walmart but the manager who tried to have sex with me on numerous occasions made me feel sick so I left. He’s offered a place at his but I’m not sure if I should take it since I know I’ll have to ‘return the favor’

467,"So I just started a long distance relationship with a girl who is mute due to a childhood accident. Along with her being mute she has some scars on her face. Both of these things cause major insecurity for her and I don't really know what to do to accommodate her needs. I have only seen half of her face and she has seen mine and she keeps saying she wishes she was as beautiful as me and she is afraid if she shows me she will scare me off. She has been verbally abused and rejected multiple times because of her scars and her lack of a voice. But how can I make her believe that I think she is beautiful and I wouldn't be scared off? 

I am also planning on learning asl so she doesn't need to write for me or type to me. We both have vr so she can sign to me in that and I just need to learn. What else can I do to make her feel ""normal"" and that her being mute is not a problem for me? What are some gestures, or acts of love I can do to put in extra effort to make communication and her life as easy as possible?

I am not the most talkative person ever and I am usually a listener in conversations. But she gets anxious in silence and wants me to talk and use my voice a lot and she constantly makes self deprecating jokes about ""one sided conversations"" how do I make her feel included, important, and less like the burden she thinks she is?

468,"I am a 16 year old boy, and I live in England. In England, you have to be 17 to drive, and because of this I have gotten a part-time job at Tesco (the british version of Walmart). It’s great pay, and is an easy job with great hours; I couldn’t be any happier at the moment.  My job is on the checkouts, and it’s great as I am rarely ever bored. But recently, I have not felt the safest at work. Every shift I deal with hundreds of different people, varying gender and ethnicity. Some I do remember, and some I forget instantly. However, there is one man I distinctively remember. He came in on my very first shift, and it was fine. We talked, as I do with every customer, and it was normal. The next shift I had, he came in again. I remembered him as he was wearing the same dirty work clothes from last time. Once again, I served him and we talked. This time however, he was asking me questions like “Where do you go to school”, and “How old are you”. Stupidly, I answered him with the correct answers, as I did not think anything of it. I thought that maybe he was just being friendly. He left, and I carried on with my job. Not even 10 minutes later, he came through again, with no items on the conveyor belt. This is where it became weird. He asked when I was working next, and due to all of this being a bit strange, I lied and said tomorrow, even though i wasn’t working for a whole week. He said bye, and left. I knew I shouldn’t of told him my personal information, but at the same time I dismissed his questions as simply being friendly. The next week, I received my uniform, and with this case my badge which had my name on it. On the next couple of shifts I had, he came in again, and again and again. Every time he started calling me by my name, of which I thought was very strange. However yesterday, it got even stranger. It gets very busy around christmas time, and because of this i’m starting to become more stressed. The man came in once again, and talked to me as usual. I was very blunt with him, and gave him one word answers. This was until he gave me a christmas card. I was so confused, but I took the card, he left and I carried on with my job. After my shift, I opened it, to find a generic christmas card. I found out his name was michael, but I ripped it up and put it in the bin. This could just be a case of someone being over-friendly, but at this point i’m getting kind of worried. I haven’t told anyone about this, and need to advice on what to do.",03Dec2019,1

470,"I work for a school as a teacher. They pay me on time and I’m largely left alone at work, but my god it’s managed and fraught with energy sucking soul vampires. There is an ungodly amount of gossiping, ostracizing and harassment. It’s essentially bullying, and I’ve been at the receiving end by management and my coworkers. Most of my coworkers have been harassed and psychologically abused by management and their aids and it’s created mass Stockholm syndrome. Mind you we are foreigners and they’re from a foreign Asian culture. 

Anyway, as a teacher I feel terribly guilty leaving without notice, but it would mean them canceling my visa and working a month without pay. Because it would be during break, I would lose my vacation salary, but I’m at risk for losing my visa. I know it’s responsible to give notice, but after all the harassment and mind bending mistreatment, I feel it’s unethical to not be compensated for the abuse foreigners receive. I routinely see teachers break from harassment and psychological abuse, everyone is on edge and ready to burst, and the turn over rate is extremely high.

Now that I’m writing this it seems that I too have residual Stockholm syndrome, but I hate lying. However staff at the school stole a bag of my supplies and I was never compensated for it, so this alone is enough for me to reconsider my moral standards. Am I a piece of shit for not honoring the contract and telling my class ahead of time, or am I in the right to flee for my mental health and salary?",03Dec2019,1

Recently had an interview for a company I really like (IT related involved regular training sessions for users), they called me straight after saying they were impressed with me and would like me to come back for the second stage interview, this stage involves a quick sub 10 minute presentation/training session in which I have to 'train' them on how to use the fundemantals of a particular app/program or pretty much anything IT software related.

They purposefully leave it vague but the recruiter has told me they want someone who can be a bit creative/think outside the box, the problem is I only have roughly 6 hours to come up with an idea, create supporting documents and get them printed aswell as planning and creating a live demonstration/presentation (due to the printers closing and needing them to be in sync).

So I need help with thinking of an interesting app/program/idea aswell as any general suggestions/advice on running training sessions, not sure if this was the place to post but I'm getting desperate haha.",03Dec2019,1
474,"As the title says: I was raised up by just my mother who suffers from bi-polar. Her outbursts have always been terrible, I’ve even had the police called on me, alongside being physically, emotionally and mentally abused. 

She’s been getting worse recently and has resorted to taking it all out on me. I’m currently unemployed, I worked about a month ago, but the people I was working with moved abroad. I gave her half of my pay check for rent. Now that I’m unemployed, she keeps yelling at me, mentioning how I’m a burden and how I don’t do anything. 

I’ve been sleeping all day to escape. I haven’t ate in nearly 11 days and I barley leave my room unless it’s to the bathroom. I’ve been dealing with depression and self harm since I was a teenager. 

A couple days ago, she wanted help with some heavy lifting and I said “I can’t right now because I feel sick.” She then throws the item, makes a huge scene (at this point I was physically being sick) and then goes to watch tv. When I come downstairs to get a drink, she starts yelling amongst other shit and says “yeah, you just slot your wrists and stick your fingers down your throat when it’s convenient for you.”

I’ve tried my best to ignore her, but she keeps starting on me. I had a bath last night and she said “well can you just hurry tf up because you’re wasting my resources.”

I want a job, but my social anxiety has gotten worse to the point where I haven’t left the house in a whole month. She tells me she hates me and to just kill myself and honestly, at this point, I’m at a loss. 

I’m from South London, but I’ve applied for college in America to try and escape, but if I don’t qualify for a scholarship or a full loan, then that’s off the table. Idk what else I’m supposed to do, nor what I can do? Each and everyday I’m just losing more hope. 

I don’t have any friends I could stay at, heck, I only have 2 real friends who live at university. No other family members - the ones I do, fully support her. Is there anything else I can do? I have about £600 to my name, and I have a cat to worry about.

By an older man indecently exposing himself and masturbating across from me. I reported him to the police but now I am more paranoid to ride the train. This is the third time something similar happens. 

Once an older man kept staring at me. Not even breaking eye contact or looking away when I noticed him. I had to move to a different part of the train to avoid him. A second time another man decided to sit next to me in an almost empty cart and kept rubbing his leg on me and before I could say anything another girl called him out on it and he exited the train angry. 

This time was the worst I’ve had. I literally saw this mans genitals before I decided to get up shocked. Words couldn’t come out to call him out on it but he left before I could process the entire thing. I’m scared of riding public transit by myself now. I have no friends I can ride with and don’t have any form of transportation to school other than the train.

478,"i've been struggling for years with clinically diagnosed depression, anxiety with frequent panic attacks, self harm addiction, and suicidal thoughts. 

this last year of high school has proven worse than the one before it and i've done almost everything i can think of to make it easier on me. my counselor has done nothing but offer to let me take finals alone. i've already been hospitalized this year and do not want to end up there again.

i can't bring myself to go to school every day. whether it's being sick from my medicine, having so many anxiety attacks that my parents force me to stay home, or being sent home unwillingly by the school for my self harm urges. i just cannot find a way to go to school everyday and make it through the whole day. finals are soon and i worry for my health even more, as no matter my score i will be unhappy and comparing to the rest of my grade.

my mom refuses to let me go to online school. she tells me it's ""quitting"" and i will never learn social skills. i completely understand this, no kid should just give up on school but that is not what i'm doing.

if i was able to go online i already know how to find the best accredited and recognized program, ill likely dual enroll with a college to take harder classes that my public school does not offer (my gpa has been 4.0 my whole life and now sits at a 4.35) and i would like to be doing online certifications for computer science and IT so i will be even more prepared for work out of high school. 

i want to convince her to reconsider for my health. i also want to work now, as i just turned 16 and have wanted to work for years. if i was online i would be able to do both morning and afternoon shifts at the boys and girls club just down the street. i would also be able to volunteer there in my free time.

i absolutely love school. i have always loved to learn and i still remember being excited to go to school everyday. it hurts so much knowing i can't do things like that anymore.

online school would not be permanent. i would go to college publicly for sure and the whole point of going online is so i can stay caught up and better myself so i can be more prepared for a different year. my first choice would be to do online school for a semester, finishing my sophomore year, and trying my hardest to go back to public school junior year. i know this is possible from my counselor.

if trying to suffer through public school is my best option then i see myself dropping all my honors/AP classes and hating going to school even more, but at least being assured i could do everything in class easily. i hate being bored and unchallenged. i've even taken self paced courses were i completely excel and often ask for more work and spend days waiting for the rest of the class to get farther.

i just want to continue my education without having so many suicidal thoughts and wanting to give up everything. if i am forced to drop my harder classes then what is the point in me staying when i can make it even easier by taking my hard classes from home so i can do even better.

should i even try to convince my parents again? my dad didn't finish high school so i don't know his input exactly but he understands much more than my mom how much i'm struggling. even though both of them have depression, my dad just seems to get the helplessness of mental illness.

i am terrified of looking like a kid who had opportunity and gave up on it because ""it was easier."" i don't want my future employers and college to think that i gave up but the more i read i find more reason to try again to convince her. but i can't trust what i read online and i need actual, real life input.",03Dec2019,1
479,"Background: I’m [M | 19] a full time university student and just finished my 1st year. I’ve been looking for a casual job for 1 year so I can get experience for future jobs. In Australia, past job experience (doesn’t have to be in any speciality) is heavily desired by employers. I’ve never had a job before.

Issue: Since I’m over 18, and companies have to pay more for 18+ employees than &lt;18 employees, and the fact that I have 0 experience has made it nearly impossible to find a job. I’ve applied online to many different companies(McDonalds, Hungry Jacks, Coles etc) but have been rejected every time. I once went to the shopping centre and handed out my resume to a bunch of businesses but never heard back from any of them. I applied to night filling and liquorland since I thought there may be more of a chance but still nope. I’m living in a town with about 10 or so major suburbs so maybe it’s too small to have jobs available. 

Since my 1st year has just ended I have 3 free months until next year starts. And when it does start (and I had this all of this year too) I’ll have weekends and 1-2 week days off. Time is running out because I’ll probably need to have 2 or so years of experience to even be considered for jobs.

So 3 years ago when I was in high school I had my group of closets friends, there were 4 of us all in different grades but share the same hobbies and interest. By this time I was in my senior year while my other friends were on 10th, 9th and 8th grade. The moment I graduated and started to get ready for college my friend (the one who was in 9th grade, let's call them Alex). In the passing months Alex just disappeared, she stopped texting in the group chat, she blocked me and deleted her Instagram and never answered my friends or I whenever we texted. Then after a year of trying I accepted that our friendship was over and stayed closed with the other friends.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago at a festival in my old high school, I was approached by Alex's mom who told me that Alex wanted to be my friend again and if a wanted to talk to them. I did even though I didn't want to. I saw Alex, hugged and nothing, I left after just a couple of minutes. Then last night one of our common friend (the 10th grader) just surprised us by adding Alex to our group chat without asking me or our other friend if it was okay to add her. Now I'm a bit overwhelmed because I don't know how to move forward with this. My friends say that I should talk to her like she's an old acquaintance and my family says I don't have to talk to her if I don't want to. 

This has left me torn with many emotions and no idea how to move forward with this situation. Right now I just want to be left alone and ignore my others friends along with our group chat while I try to think. But if anybody here has any helpful advice I will be grateful reading them.

Lately we've been talking quite a lot and I really enjoy talking to him. He told me a week or two ago that him and his girlfriend broke up and he was feeling happy about it, he'd been telling me for a while that she is very controlling, he wasn't allowed to hang out with people, she got very jealous (especially about me), she didn't like him talking to me, she would read his messages over his shoulder, she wouldn't let him go out, ect. It was really bad. Now he's excited that he can hang out with me and my friends, he lives in a different town but we've invited him to join us for Christmas and New Years and he's accepted.
That's all great but I'm starting to like him and it's a bit scary to me, he's hinted at being attracted to me in the past but I've had a very rough year and I've been hurt multiple times by other people, so I feel cautious. Plus he still lives with his ex right now, he's waiting for her to find a new place and move out, which is a bit awkward.
I was thinking of telling him I'm attracted to him maybe on New Years, I just don't know if it's too soon after his last relationship and I don't want to make things awkward.

Tl;dr: My friend got out of a toxic controlling relationship a week or two ago, I'm thinking of confessing my attraction on New Years, I'm worried it's too soon after his break up. Also I'm obviously nervous about it.",03Dec2019,1

490,"Hi, this is a throwaway account because some people I know IRL follow my main. I’m in a weird position and I hope this is the right sub to talk about it. 

I’m in the first semester of my freshman year of college. I’m the archetypal “gifted kid turns out to have anxiety and depression, and crashes.” But somehow I got into an out of state private school. 

And to get one thing out of the way: I’m the luckiest fucking kid. Things could be *so* much worse for me. I feel so horribly guilty even writing this post. I’m terrified of coming off as an asshole. But maybe I am. 

The yearly tuition for my school comes out to about $60,000. My family applied for financial aid (not through FAFSA, or else I would’ve helped fill out the forms of course, but a different program) but I don’t know how much they’re paying. And I have no idea anymore how much money my family is making. What is understood though is that I don’t have to help pay for my tuition, as an undergrad. Which makes me so fucking lucky! Like holy shit, that’s a burden lifted off of me, right?

Before I left, my dad wrote out a contract for how much spending money I would get each month. It would be proportional to my GPA at the end of each semester. As so:

&gt;= 3.50 - $500 per month
&lt; 3.50, &gt;= 3.25 - $400 per month 
&lt; 3.25, &gt;= 3.00 - $300 per month
 &lt;3.00, &gt;= 2.50 - $200 per month 
&lt; 2.50 - $150 per month

For this first semester, they’re starting off with $400 a month. If I graduate at the end of four years with a GPA of 3.35 or higher, I won’t have to pay them back for the spending money. A school required meal plan is included in the tuition. I don’t have to pay for doctor visits or flights home (again, I’m LUCKY). 

I graduated high school with a 2.9 GPA. No AP credits, no academic awards, no nothing. I had to move schools during my senior year because things were going so horribly at my old school. Before this, I was an A-B student. I did all my work, I was a good student. I was also (on and off) suicidal, in an abusive relationship, dealing with gender dysphoria, and setting myself up to have horrible communication with my parents about these issues. What drove me to do work and be a good student was sheer anxiety. 

Having gone to two different schools in the past year, my motivation to do work has just completely dropped off. I think it’s partially because of the medication I’m on, which has drastically reduced the number of panic attacks I have and my overall anxiety. So when that general anxiety is gone, so is the motivation to do work. My mental health has been on and off, but I’m currently in crisis mode. My first setback was a few months ago when I had two ER visits in one week. Since then, and the recurring appointments with nurses and doctors, it feels like I’ve dropped off. I have *so much* I need to do, and finals are coming up, and I know I’m probably not going to get a good GPA. I’m trying my hardest to work with my professors and I’ve even met with the dean of students about it. 

(Oddly enough, I was in a similar situation last year during the spring semester. I had an injury that took months to recover from, then a mental health crisis, and my grades took a dip. As someone who was previously physically healthy, I didn’t learn how to deal with so much on my plate.)

My parents constantly say they are here for me, but I find it harder and harder to talk to them about my problems. My mom is heavily concerned with image and how we look to others. She also has anxiety, but we end up butting heads instead of relating to one another. My dad only thinks in numbers and statistics. They have told me straight to my face that my gender identity is not real. I’m often pressured to just be “normal.” Then, they blow up in my face when I don’t tell them what’s wrong in my life. It’s a cycle I can’t break out of. 

Back to the budget issue: I didn’t want to get a job this first semester so I could focus on school (I am looking to get one next semester). Not that this turned out to be a useful strategy, anyways. I burn through the $400 quickly. I need to learn to live off of the shitty school food and really, just manage it better. 

Coming up soon will be the inevitable reveal of my less than ideal GPA and therefore, less spending money. They seem to be under the impression that I can go back to great grades now that I’m in the school I want to be at. I thought I could do the same. I’ve told them that this semester has been going good and everything is fine, because sitting down for a conversation about how things really are is a ticket to a panic attack and more arguments. 

Is this contract unreasonable? Or am I overreacting? I know the root of this issue is the relationship I have with my parents, but I don’t know how to begin to fix that.",03Dec2019,1
492,i’m a 13 year old and i play basketball even i really don’t like it. growing up i played basketball and baseball. i’ve quit baseball because it got boring and i decided to start playing actual basketball. i’ve played basketball all my life and people say i’m good. tbh i’m not that good as people say i am tho. i feel like people just say it because my dad and brother are athletic. i play middle school basketball and i really don’t enjoy it. i’m decent at it but i get nervous and i feel like i’m not good enough to play sometimes. i always practice but it seems to not have helped. and it does get boring sometimes with annoying teammates who get mad at u for no reason. it just gets boring sometimes. the reason i haven’t quit is because i wouldn't have any sports to do in high school and that means my parents would probably be mad at me. my parents tell me that their okay with me not playing any sports but i know their lying. i like playing sports casually but not competitively. and they would probably think if i quit sports i’d be on electronics all day which isn’t true. i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to play a sport i dislike for the rest of my middle school and high school years. but i don’t want to upset my parents. if i stopped playing people would also think that i’m a quitter and they’d think less of me. what should i do because i’m getting really stressed over this?,03Dec2019,1

495,"I am a full-time student in Washington, DC. I was hired by a college that provides that offers programs in allied health, computer application software, and electrical trade, as an IT analyst. Part of my job is fixing computers making sure there is a smooth net connectivity, all the IT work with a minimum wage at $14/hour. Along that I help the CEO (who is also my supervisor) with small tasks such as fixing printer or vending machine in cafeteria. 

My supervisor who is CEO of this college who I work under tells me that he ordered 60 ceiling lights and if I could help him with just making a connection of wire to the flat LED. He showed me how simple it would be. He gave me 50 computer power cords and told me to cut them open with a cutter and extract a green, white and black wire out of it. and after collecting 120 of them, peel their ends to show the copper strings, open the 60 LEDs and put them inside the LEDs one by one. I worked on it putting connections, he came to check up on me and saw I did not know how to wire them properly telling me that green goes here and black goes here and white goes here. I followed and once I was done with that, he asked me to help him with placing them in the ceiling. I was hesitant and I said I won't be able to do this on my own. He showed me how to do one and insisted that ""you are a young man, of course you can do this"". It was a 6-8 story building and the college is on 2nd floor. There were some ceiling spots where the connection to light was 24/7 meaning those were emergency lights and could never be powered off. He assigned me 2 full classrooms and hallway to detach the previous lights and put on the new ones. Balancing on ladder was hard since I had no experience and I was stumbling. The lights previously installed were heavy and the new ones lighter. Each light previously connected were supported by metal wires hung and hooked to the ceiling. I had to cut the hold and carefully take them out, putting each one of them on ladder top so I could untwist the connection with my bare hands. He told me to be careful and said he did not want me to die so be careful. Without any tools to check the connection if the wire is hot or not he handed me a Philips 100w bulb and told me to check connection by touching the black and white wire to the bulb to check if connection was hot or not. He left to his office and I placed 20 lights in the ceiling by cutting previous support of light to the ceiling one by one and wiring and retwisting the cable of new LEDs and just placing them over the ceiling. Without any support or hold to the ceiling, just as I was told to. Upon connection few lights flickered because the wiring was not too strong, the cable was STRONG single copper wire but the lights I made were from computer cables with many cooper threads. 

I came to my dorm room and told my friend about this and got to know that I had to have a wiring permit for this. I searched through the web and read about the potential fire risks and how it can cause serious trouble. More than that my life was at risk without any supervision and proper tools. With ZERO experience in what I did. I messaged the CEO and told him that my father did not allow me to work on lights and if he has any IT related work that I am hired for let me know. I haven't told anyone yet. What should be done now? I am just 19 and unaware of any laws or regulations. Is this a risk for fire in building? Am I taken advantage of? Any advice would be very appreciated.

I also have an awesome fiancée who I love and want to spend time with. In addition to that, I need to look after and develop my house to make it a more comfortable and enjoyable space to be in.

I know the key to happiness is to be happy with what you have. What frustrates me is that I feel I have talents and skills outside of work that I would like to develop and no time to do it in.

For instance, music. I like singing and playing guitar and have been told many times I have a talent for both, but I know that as with anything, you need to do it a lot to become really good.

Is it simply a fact that being an adult and taking the security of a 9 to 5 means eventually giving up on your passions and having a lot of your potential wasted?

About a month ago I got a speeding ticket and had to go to court to pay it because I had the wrong address on my license. It was a whole mess, but they were able to give me more time to pay half of it. I thought that it was due today and finally had the money ($190) so I went online to pay it. That's when I found out that it was due last Tuesday instead of this week.

I tried calling on my break yesterday when I found this out to see if I could pay it over the phone as the website said that was an option, but I was put on hold too long. Today I work all the hours that the courthouse is open so I won't be able to go until tomorrow morning. The issue is I'm terrified of what will happen when I go. I feel like best case scenario, I have to pay late fees and worse case scenario I'm arrested and loose my license.

To make this situation worse, I'm literally a week away from graduation and already have far too much on my plate this week. Adding this on top is making things even crazier, and even though I think it's probably unlikely, if I get arrested for this I won't graduate this semester, and it will cost me thousands of dollars more. Also, if it takes too long tomorrow, I'm going to have to miss a test for a class that I know I won't be able to make up, which means I'll fail the class and not graduate.

I want to move out of my town for various reasons, I had depression for years, I have no friends and the only thing I had to keep on going was my girlfriend and she broke up with me in september, we had our ups and downs obviously we would made 7 years together in october, it was not perfect but I was starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel of my depression until she left me. 

I started studying again this year (I stoped school for working 2 years) but I don't feel like studying anymore. In september I had a vacations to valencia with my sister, and there I met some wonderful people and felt really good, had great times and felt that I can be friends with someone, that someone can find me interesting. And that made me think these months, maybe I don't find the right people because i'm not in the right place, 

Also my town is really tiny, 100000 population, everything reminds me to my ex, since we were together mostly all my life (from 14 to 21), and there's nothing fun to do really, there are not interesting events, no concerts, nothing really. I really hate this place to be honest.

Anyway, I was ready to drop the studies again and look a place to stay and work in Valencia, but then I told my idea to my parents, and they think I'm just running away from my problems, and that my only problem is that I have no friends, and I don't know what to do, I love them, if I am not dead yet is because of them. Here they do everything for me I live a really comfy live, but is boring and the only thing I do is study, videogames and workout.

 I look instagram and see people having fun in the weekend with their friends meanwhile I'm alone in my house looking at my monitor until I go to sleep and repeat the next day. I see my ex having fun too... And I just want to forget this place and start living for the first time in my life, meeting new people, having other things to think about like having enough money to keep eating and living, go to partys and have fun.

518,"Hey Reddit,

I was hoping someone might have some insight of this ongoing situation I have suffered through for almost 5 years.

When I was 14 someone sexually assaulted me, than blackmailed me for lewd pictures. I was 14 and I was very terrified so I complied. Once I finally have a break down from being of the edge of suicide I cut off all contact even though he continued to threaten me. 

In return from being cut off this man had made an online Facebook account filled with my full name, city of birth, college I wanted to attend, and current city. He posted the pictures in a series of events. I was bullied relentlessly and there was nothing we could do about it.. We tried to get the polices help, but that turned out to be a dead end.

So for for 5 years now I've reported this account because it violated Facebook's terms of services, but every time Facebook kicks the review back and says it's a real account. I have reported for child nudity, revenge porn, fake account, and harassment, but the website doesn't take the account down. There is not way to contact Facebook directly and plead my case to them as there is no ""add comments"" in your reporting. I have tried to directly message the Facebook verified account on a couple different platforms, but it has turned out useless.

Now as an adult with a professional career some of my co workers have found that account and I feel as if I'm 14 again getting bullied by the girls in my grade. I just really wanted to know if anyone knew a way to directly reach out, to better report, or contact the appeals team.

521,"- [ ] I’m Male 182cm tall (just under 6ft)  lanky slim body  framed and pale with a receding hairline so yea I’m fucked when it comes to looks. I’m a kissless virgin.And I  noticed over time I get stared at like iv got 3 heads and treated poorly by most and it’s because I’m ugly. I don’t leave the house and havnt for 4 years  except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. I used to enjoy it and it made me excited to go out and do something with my day for once , but other times it’s very difficult. I always get picked for the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking. Another higher up authority young guy there always stares at me a lot  and I assume it because I’m ugly and I think it is, he does it every shift and he’s nothing special either. and girls who stare me down because I’m tall and slim it happens so often too it’s made me develop an eating disorder. I don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job around a lot of people  and a girl and her dad was standing drinking and the girl looked at me with a blank glare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s what I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face and said ‘ewwwwww god no’ (I lipread her) it was ok for her as she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask covering her face tho. it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once. Also the there’s a guy who’s a higher up authority on my part  I work and he’s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I’m skinny. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I wake up with suicidal thoughts crying. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. I can’t have a life as much as I want to. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh. I have bad depression because of my looks too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re always snotty and dismissive I take it personally. Thats the most painful thing, when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s being a complete douche. 5 years I worked in a bar and had confidence and a good life good friends and a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(",03Dec2019,1

524,"I am a teenager, currently in High School. Whenever I need to present anything in front of just a few people, I begin to have a panic attack. My Pupil Support teacher has tried to help me find ways to deal with it, but it still happens anyway. Even when I’m not doing any Public Speaking, or I get stressed out because of something, I have a panic attack. The first instance of me having a panic attack which I can remember is when I was 11. We had to create and present a poster to the class about our favourite book for world book day. I, of course, was not happy about the presenting part. I made the poster, and the teacher called me out to present my poster, even though I was already beginning to have what I now know as a panic attack. The worst part for me, looking back, is probably that my teacher made me do the presentation even after I had a full-on panic attack and kept saying I couldn’t do it. Also, he made me go first.

532,"My name is Danny. This is my first ever post using reddit talking about this. So my brother Kevin is my older brother. Kevin and Donald are both twins and they have completely changed. 

Last year September 2018, is when I noticed something was wrong with Kevin. He started to make random grunt noises and my brother Donald thought he was playing around. Soon, i realized that this isn’t no laughing matter. Their was something wrong with him. Each month he started to change. 

December 2018, Kevin lost his ability to talk normally. And I started get him to talk to me. Nothing worked out and my parents just yell at him, especially my asian dad. That’s when we started looking for doctors and at first he got diagnosed with autism. I was breaking down. My brother who bring my childhood to life becomes mentally ill hits me in my heart. 
 

February 2019, Kevin started to pee randomly around the house and it was just chaos from there. And he started to become suicidal and CPS was called in my house for at LEAST 3 times. My dad started to act more lightly to Kevin since there was something wrong with him. My dad started to think if he sees a pastor in Vietnam, then it will get rid of his ghost. In my mind, that s&amp;@t wouldn’t work?!?!  ( sorry for my language) but I was right. 

Mid August 2019, Dad and my brother Kevin was about to go to airport until my dad says he LOST FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS for the airport. I don’t know how they went to Vietnam, but they still did. After that, I never really have a brotherly love with my brothers Donald and Kevin. 

October 2019, my dad and my brother comes back to the U.S. Guess what happens next, the same thing happens again. My brother Donald becomes suicidal and the school called CPS for another 2 times in the house. I was wondering if this is going to end with my brothers being suicidal and alone. And me as the little brother I tried helping them and I felt like I failed for not being there with them. 

Today, everything has calmed down. My brother Kevin is still ill as today and I think I given up on him and my other brother Donald. I don’t know what to do. Should I keep focusing on myself or help my brothers out. I have done everything and they still won’t ask for any help ( they always be silent too me ). My brother is 18 years-old and has flunked 2 times. I never seen them as a brother to me but like a stranger....

534,"Hi all, I'd love to get some advice from anyone who's struggled with having a similar mindset to mine. 

I've always been an awful procrastinator. All the way through school I was very much a doing homework on the bus, leaving essays and projects until the last minute and pulling all nighters kind of student. I also used to take a lot of fake sick days because, for whatever reason, I just didn't feel like I could face going to school. 

It has affected my life, but not totally wrecked it or anything. For example, I have a degree, but I got it after going to uni at 19, dropping out after a year, then going back at 22. The initial dropping out was due to ridiculous procrastination, I did almost no work. But when I went back I smashed it, graduating with top marks (1st class honours to my fellow UKers).

535,"So my Roomate got a cat recently (I’m not sure of breed if that matters) and it was perfectly fine for the first two weeks until I came back from our thanksgiving break. 

For whatever reason, since I’ve gotten back she only follows me around. Jumping at my feet and scratching them as I’m trying to step around her and once I open my bedroom door she sprints in and jumps around on my bed, desk, etc. and it’s really distracting to study with her there. 

I try to lure her out of my room and then quickly go back in but she just follows me and is too fast to lock out of my room in time. I even just pick her up and place her in our living room but the second I set her down she sprints back to where ever I am.

A couple times I have successfully locked her out but every time I do she just sits there and camps my door waiting for me to come out again.

To put it simply, I am not a cat person. When he asked if I was ok with getting one, I said sure because I figure this be his deal and not mine. 

This has been going on for 2 days now and I’m going insane because I wake up to go pee and then there she is camping my door at 6 am and I have to spend the next hour trying to get her out of my room/to stop following me. 

What I find strange is them at there are 4 Roomate’s including me and she only does this to me (and not even her owner??). I thought that maybe there was food or something in my room she wanted but no she just jumps around and scratches my feet. 

I have not talked to my Roomate about it yet but I plan on it if it continues

A). Get her out of my room/away from me
B). Explain to me why this may be happening(like why is she singling me out)

538,"Wall of text incoming; brace yourselves. I have an old friend (whom I will call Alex), and he has been going through a lot of difficulty; I hope that the Reddit hive mind will give me some advice about how I could help my friend.

A little backstory first. Alex and I grew up in a small town (20,000 people or so), and we were part of a group of four or five friends who hung out together. Alex was a calm, good-natured guy fond of waking, talking, and computer games. He never caused any trouble to anyone and was generally a good friend.

When I graduated from school, I entered a university in a big city and left. Alex went to a trade school and became an electrician. We lost touch. That was fifteen years ago.

About three years ago, he found me on social media, and we started talking. It turned out that after graduating from the trade school, Alex got a job at the huge factory in our home town. That factory was the best place in the town to work at; the pay cheques were pretty good, and there was quite a bit of security offered. Three years after Alex started working there, he had an argument with his line manager and quit. And he has been unemployed since.

When we just started talking three years ago, he was living with his father, who was working at that same factory — I think he was a machine operator. His father was earning decent money (as I said, the factory paid well) and was also getting a pension of some sort. The cost of living in my home town is low, so from the financial point of view, Alex's life was very bearable. He spent his days watching TV and playing games on his laptop. From his tone, I understood that he was not at all worried about his situation: he sounded carefree and optimistic — in stark contrast to his father, who had developed a drinking problem. To my question why Alex wasn't looking for a job, he said that he couldn't find a job to suit his temperament, that there was nothing suitable for him.

About a year later, Alex's father showed up for work drunk one too many times and was fired on the spot. Nearly all the income he and Alex had vanished in an instant. All they had left was Alex's father's pension, which was not absolutely abysmal but barely sufficient for two people to live on.

I suggested that Alex look for a job at the double, but he kept telling me that he didn't want to do just any job, that he wanted one that had to do with being a proper electrician. There was no persuading him to get any job ASAP. Over the months, he did go to a couple of job interviews for the position of an electrician, but he didn't get any of the jobs.

About the same time, Alex and his father decided to make some minor renovations about their three-bedroom flat, and they took out a loan for their purposes. They were paying it from Alex's father's pension, and while this was doable, they had almost no disposable income left. That's when Alex's optimism was supplanted by a nagging awareness that things were going downhill.

I tried to help Alex by giving him some simple data entry jobs that I needed done. This earned him some money. I also gave him some cash during one of my trips to my home town. I told him to use the money as an emergency fund, or to help him move to a big city and find a job there. But he didn't listen: instead, he bought home decorations and other trinkets like that. When in a few months I ran out of jobs to give, Alex was broke once again.

Somehow, a friend of his family heard that Alex was in trouble and helped him get a job — a job as an electrician, to boot. But Alex complained to me about the job. He said that he hated installing electrical equipment in dusty cellars and filthy basements; that he was too cold to be walking around town in winter; and that he didn't like his team members, who constantly talked about fishing trips — an interest that Alex did not share. He quit after a week.

After a few months, he had a plan: he decided to get some kind of disability pay — and he had a relative in the hospital who could help him game the system by simply doing the necessary paperwork. The catch was that Alex had to spend three months in hospital as per regulations for that kind of thing. He decided to do it.

When he was ""discharged"", he came back home only to be made aware that his father had not been making loan payments: he had just forgotten to do so. Another thing was that his father had got himself a credit card and had been making use of it (by withdrawing money rather than just using the card in shops, paying a commission each time).

Thus, Alex and his father found themselves in an even bigger financial hole and decided to restructure their debt — but in order not to pay as much interest, they decided to shorten the term. They borrowed money from family and friends, repaid the credit card debt, and closed the account. For some time, they have been living on next to no money, at times not even paying their electricity and utility bills. The disability pay money hasn't started to come yet; I'm not even sure if Alex wasn't duped — I even suspect that that conniving relative of his is collecting the money. Right now, Alex and his father are just trying to economise their way out of poverty — they have even stopped using electrical appliances like TV or the laptop, and cancelled their Internet service.

Alex still refuses to look for a job. He tried to get one as a shop assistant at a furniture store but never heard anything from the company. He says that he should not be looking for another one because he is waiting for a call from the furniture store. I try to explain to him that that job is gone, that he must look for others, but he just won't do it. Working as a cashier or getting a job as the person who places goods on shop shelves is a ""woman's job"", he says. He still hopes that someone will call him and offer him a job he would like to do.

But problems don't end there. Alex apparently has what is referred to as the external locus of control. He believes that he is entitled to a job. And since is not getting one, he believes that there is someone who is actively undermining the chances of his getting a job. He tells me that he thinks that his former line manager (the one from ten years ago) must have told someone in the town administration that he, Alex, was not to be hired. And he really believes that there is such a conspiracy against him. Other times, he believes that he just hasn't waited enough, that somebody is bound to call him with a job offer very soon.

What about his assets? Alex has no money or anything liquid. But year or two ago (I don't know when exactly), Alex's father officially gave the three-bedroom flat they two live in to Alex as a present. Alex became the sole owner of that nice expensive piece of real estate. Then, Alex's sister (who lives in the same town with her husband), seeing how Alex had hit a rough patch, gave him a little bit of money and coaxed him to give half of the flat as a gift to her. And because what little money she offered was more immediate than any future benefits of owning one hundred percent of the flat, Alex gave in to her demands and relinquished his ownership of half the flat in favour of his sister.

...and here we are.

I have given Alex a lot of different advice — to look for a job, to sell his half of the flat and to move to a big city, to do odd jobs and to use the money to move away... He isn't listening. He is still waiting for ""his"" job and refuses to change anything.

539,"I have had a running tradition with my now ex-roommate the last three years where we do funny Christmas cards together and send them to friends and family. They were a lot of fun, but I got married this year and moved in with the missus, so now I’m doing Christmas cards with her instead. I still want to include my friend’s face in the card though, and have thought of several ways to do it for the coming years. This year I’m thinking to photoshop his face from a previous Christmas card and make it an ornament on the Christmas card, but I have no photoshop skills and don’t have time to learn it before Christmas between work and school. I was tempted to try one of the photoshopping subreddits, but I don’t like asking for things for free, and I’d be more comfortable going through someone who makes a business out of this sort of thing.

541,"Ive been identifying as bisexual for 1.5 years now and it all started when I watched a buzzfeed video on queer high schoolers. I related to the video a lot, so I questioned: why do I relate to this video so much? And I “realized” that I was bi. 

A couple days later, I told my best friend that I was bi and she responded with “I know.” So I must’ve made it clear and I’m pretty sure I did. There were times when my friends and I would be like “who would make out with a girl” and I was always the one to say me. Also, at that point I was younger so I hadn’t watched real porn yet, but I would watch soft core stuff and it would always be girls.

So I thought the signs were clear, I was bi. 

Months later, I was thinking about my sexuality again, and I thought: could I ever see myself marrying a woman? The answer was no.  So I thought. Maybe I’m bisexual and heteroromantic. I accepted that and moved on. 

Months, later again, I realized that I would marry anyone really and I’m pretty sexually attracted to all people, so I went back to identifying as bisexual and bi romantic/pansexual and panromantic. 

Over the summer, I was in my first relationship and it was with a guy. I told him I was bi and he was very accepting. 

As the relationship became more serious, we talked about sex and sexuality. We talked about oral sex preferences and he was like yeah I like bj’s blah blah blah. And I said “oh. I mean now that I think about it, getting eaten out doesn’t really sound that appealing to me” he was like ok that’s cool, how about fingering? And I was like “eh” I think a pretty big reason why I had this response is because my family and society in general have taught me to be uncomfortable with anything that’s sexual about me. And they’ve also taught me that I should be the one pleasuring a guy, not the other way around. 

Whatever, the reason, I think he found that kind of schooling because a couple days later, he asked me “so would you have sex with a girl, I mean you’re bi” my first response was “yes! Duh, im bi” but then I realized hmm if I don’t want my bf to go down on me or finger me, then what would make me be ok with a girl doing it?

Since then, I’ve been questioning me sexuality and I’m super confused. And I realized that I haven’t really had crushes in girls. I just find them attractive. The thing is though, I find girls much more attractive than guys. So...am I straight or bi? I’m confused as fuck. 

TLDR: not sure if I’m straight or bi

I’ve been dating drake for about 3 months now, and he’s just starting to socialize with people for the first time in his life. They’re getting close really fast, I was already paranoid about them liking eachother. 

FOOTNOTE: Ella and my absolute best friend of 3 years have started dating (he dates all of my friends) and they’re really lovey dovey, but my best friend ‘Ethan’ is on a cruise, so he can’t text anyone. My friend Ella has been a mess, she’s come to completely rely on texting Ethan for her happiness. 

So last week I made a post here about him giving her a pomegranate to try because she’s never had one before. I was unsure if I should feel upset because it was just food. Other people got kinda hostile and told me to be grateful. I was, and pushed it aside. Then, yesterday he gave her an early Christmas present cat plush. I got upset until I learned it was just an early Christmas present. But today while he and I were hugging he mentioned how cute she was when she put her hair in a ponytail. That kind of shattered my heart. I have pretty intense body dysmorphia and I know I’m less attractive than her. He also mentioned that they texted until about 5 or 8 yesterday and that also really hurt. He never texts me, and when he or I do text the other, it dies in like 30 minutes. I brought up that we might have to break up because of the lack of sincerity I feel when with him. Don’t get me wrong, he smothers me in hugs and tells me he loves me every day. But I just feel like after only 3 months in a relationship, that telling each other  that you love the other should have been postponed. The hugs are nice and everything, but he throws out that he loves me whenever. I may be petty but I feel like he’s starting to like her more than me. It feels shitty, and I just want to know how I should be feeling, and whether or not to act on these feelings. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",03Dec2019,1

5 years ago a girl had a crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me on there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore",03Dec2019,1
554,So I was browsing porn and clicked a very illegal link this was a few months ago but I am still scarred I guess but I am sorta embarrassed to talk about it it's like literal ptsd from it I guess you can say it's more of cause I have younger cousins and would beat the crap out of someone who took the advantage of them.,03Dec2019,1
555,"I have a friend, he's 13 and the other day I saw him at school with a vape, straight up vaping at lunch. I questioned him about it and he says he bought it himself and he says he's addicted, like straight up is always vaping, I tried telling him it's a bad choice especially at his age but he won't listen. What I'm asking is how should I ""help"" him.

He also has a history of depression and he has done self harm (cutting his arms) and he's attempted suicide 3 times. He made me promise not to tell anyone outside our circle and I did. He also has social anxiety (me and my friends have speculated it and we think he does at least). His dad has been in multiple relationships and is mean? (Not abusive but going down that road, he grows weed in his house). 

Basically, how can I help him before he permanently ruins his life, and he definitely doesn't want adults getting involved.",03Dec2019,1
556,"I am a 16 year old boy, and I live in England. In England, you have to be 17 to drive, and because of this I have gotten a part-time job at Tesco (the british version of Walmart). It’s great pay, and is an easy job with great hours; I couldn’t be any happier at the moment.  My job is on the checkouts, and it’s great as I am rarely ever bored. But recently, I have not felt the safest at work. Every shift I deal with hundreds of different people, varying gender and ethnicity. Some I do remember, and some I forget instantly. However, there is one man I distinctively remember. He came in on my very first shift, and it was fine. We talked, as I do with every customer, and it was normal. The next shift I had, he came in again. I remembered him as he was wearing the same dirty work clothes from last time. Once again, I served him and we talked. This time however, he was asking me questions like “Where do you go to school”, and “How old are you”. Stupidly, I answered him with the correct answers, as I did not think anything of it. I thought that maybe he was just being friendly. He left, and I carried on with my job. Not even 10 minutes later, he came through again, with no items on the conveyor belt. This is where it became weird. He asked when I was working next, and due to all of this being a bit strange, I lied and said tomorrow, even though i wasn’t working for a whole week. He said bye, and left. I knew I shouldn’t of told him my personal information, but at the same time I dismissed his questions as simply being friendly. The next week, I received my uniform, and with this case my badge which had my name on it. On the next couple of shifts I had, he came in again, and again and again. Every time he started calling me by my name, of which I thought was very strange. However yesterday, it got even stranger. It gets very busy around christmas time, and because of this i’m starting to become more stressed. The man came in once again, and talked to me as usual. I was very blunt with him, and gave him one word answers. This was until he gave me a christmas card. I was so confused, but I took the card, he left and I carried on with my job. After my shift, I opened it, to find a generic christmas card. I found out his name was michael, but I ripped it up and put it in the bin. This could just be a case of someone being over-friendly, but at this point i’m getting kind of worried. I haven’t told anyone about this, and need to advice on what to do.",03Dec2019,1
557,"I am the oldest of my mom's kids and also the oldest of the grandchildren in my family. I recently had my own first child. She's awesome and I'm pretty stoked on being a parent.  My mom and grandma both legit hate my dad and say so a lot. My opinion on the shiftiness of my parents is that they are both horrible. I recently shared that with my grandma since she went on a rant about my dad's abuses and such but left out that my mom knew, let it happen, and lied to everyone and said I had made up the abuse for a long time. 

She also kicked me out at 17 and let me be homeless rather than let me stay with her because I had difficulties with a) being recently out of the abusive situations, which mom left a year before and b)bipolar type one. 

They both blame my eventual drug abuse on dad and act as though their love or support wouldn't have helped at all. They take the credit for my getting clean because mom drove me to the rehabbing found and paid for myself. 

Since then, I'm relatively sure my grandma shared that with my mom. 

Separately this last year my brother has brought to light issues with my mom's husband having posted some real shitty racist and anti-Semitic alt right stuff. Stuff you don't want kids around. 

I guess my questions are like this:
How can I stop them from the ranting about my dad. I've gotten past this stuff and it's been almost 15 years I think they should too.  

Secondly, my mom and grandma act as though they had no part in any of the things that happened and that they deserve direct contact with my child and are trying to guilt me into feeling that way too.  I am resistant and honestly do not care hut my wife wants a good relationship with our daughters closest(geographically) family. I'm not sure how to set the proper boundaries.  I don't want my child, as she begins to understand the world, to pick up a warped world view from grandma and her husband.",03Dec2019,1

561,"I am someone who always tries to be strong. I don’t like showing people I care, if I’m affected by something or when I’m weak. I always feel like people will take advantage of me or just generally being seen as weak is something I hate. I always try to be seen as someone who is independent, able to handle things on my own and take care of others in the process. Events in my life have made me become such a way. I don’t even cry in front of my parents and sometimes, it is emotionally taxing but my inherent nature is to just bottle it up and deal with it. I don’t like to talk about things that make me sad because it makes me cry and I hate it when people see me cry (only a few have). I also naturally don’t like to show emotions, when I’m sad or anxious, in love or feeling soft. 

I want to get better at this because I want to be able to be vulnerable with my SO whom I care for very much. I just don’t know where to start.",03Dec2019,1

564,"I've developed the fear of people touching me. I'm only 17 and last summer I was in Lithuania with my friend. We were casually walking on the main street of the city and a group of boys on bikes went by us, one of them slapped my butt and they laughed. It happened so fast so I didn't know how to react - I was shocked and felt so humiliated. I think anybody really saw that, although it was sunny outside and it was afternoon. All I could think of after that was that I want to get back to hotel as soon as possible and I didn't really enjoy the rest of the days there. Since then I can't walk the streets alone without getting all anxious, especially in the dark, I have got two panick attacks, so I avoid walking alone. Also some months after that incident I went to a spa with my cousin and in a bathtub one boy, who I think was actually in the age of 10-13, started touching my legs. At first thought it wasn't intentional but then I saw his blank face and he continued so I realised it was. I was so creeped out that I left that bathtub immediately but I couldn't explain my cousin why I did that. 
Back to the present - I often startle when someone touches me, especially when I can't see their face or hear them. Also I feel extremely uncomfortable sometimes when people try to hug me or just out their hands on my head or shoulders. Also in some cases I can feel pain more easily if the touch was sudden.
I don't want to be that way, any advice?

566,"I have been married for a short time. I moved away from my family to start a new life with my husband and my kid. I’ve stayed at home with my child for a while now (they are reasons why I couldn’t work in the past) but I’ve lost my mind, no social interaction at home with a young child and having no friends or family near. I was already battling with depression and anxiety. Now I just stare at walls because I’m too depressed to do anything else besides kill myself. I don’t have a penny to my name. Soon I’ll have an opportunity to work again and my kid has the opportunity to go to school. I keep hoping that will change things but I just keep waiting for it to happen and it’s killing me. My husband and I have gone through some horrible times in our relationship. The bickering turned into fights and then verbal and emotional abuse. Things seem to be okay for the time being but it seems like every time I think it’s okay things go horribly wrong again. He has been threatening divorce for a long time but it’s always been out of petty anger now he’s calm. He is telling me to go back to live near my family and saying he will pay the expenses to get me back there. Which is tempting but also hurts because I know he has given up. As much as I miss my family I don’t want to regress. They can be very hurtful and provoking. I can only deal with their passive aggressiveness and claws in my life for so long. But at least I’d have support even if it comes with the bad. At the same time as much as I’ve been wishing I had a way out I don’t know if I can do it start over again do that to my kid. We are finally getting settled here. On top of that my child would lose a parent because he’s not biological and I doubt she’d see him again. I can’t ask my family for advice because they will selfishly just want their grandchild closer without thinking of all the consequences. Plus just having the opportunity to leave makes me feel less trapped here but I also don’t want to make another wrong turn. My heads just spinning I need help. I think if I was just happy my husband would be happy but even if all this were okay I’m worried about our compatibility. We are like exact opposites. I’m ambitious, I have big plans I want to travel I love the city I like getting out experiencing things he just wants to stay at home on the couch and work an easy job.

568,"These group of guys that don’t go to high school with me anymore have a group chat amongst themselves dedicated to making fun of me. The group chat is called “jordyn-crusaders” (Jordyn is my real name..). All they do is make fun of me and my friend finds out about it and tells me. Unfortunately, that friend can’t do much about it because he doesn’t go to college with them. I’m a senior and they’re college freshmen. They don’t say anything directly to me and they bother my friend. I told my friend to block them out and then the group sends their other friends to bother him even more. One of the people from this discord group is my ex and he sent old texts that I sent to him in 2018 when i was really depressed. (I ended up getting hospitalized because i was so depressed and didn’t want to live anymore) He sent these texts to the group chat and they (I assume) made jokes about it. Another person in this group that used to be a good friend of mine sent an audio clip to the group chat and they all made fun of me (again) and I have pictures of it. The audio clip was me yelling and being upset because my ex-friend would continue to accuse me of making up excuses of not having anytime for him. I got really busy and spent more time with my boyfriend and tried to at least plan a day where i could hang out with this friend or talk to him for a little bit. I was still really busy and he basically made me out to be a bad person in his eyes. I had a conversation about it with him face to face at a mall and we cleared things up. Everything was fine and then he went and made things worse for me. This isn’t the first time they’ve made fun of me in a different group chat too. I have messages from earlier this year when i was a junior. They made fun of my weight, called me a 5 year old, and they’ve indirectly called me manipulative. They have also told someone in the past that he should go kill himself as a joke. That kind of thing is absolutely NO joke and I hate it. They don’t message me directly and they’ve blocked me but i know (and have evidence) that they’re doing these things. Its really hard for me to ignore and it’s causing me to have anxiety and stress. I mean REALLY high stress. I have a therapist and thankfully I go see them when I can but it’s still extremely hard to deal with and I just want them to stop. I don’t want this to happen to other people in the future either. I don’t even know how far this information has spread and I plan to go to their same college when I’m done with high school. That college is the best option for me right now and I feel extremely uncomfortable going to another state for college or somewhere further away. I still don’t know how to drive and my parents (and I’m also busy myself) barley have time to teach me. Please help, I don’t know if this is considered cyberbullying if this information isn’t being said to me directly. These people are 18-19 years old and are considered adults at this point and I’m 17. I really want to do something about it...",03Dec2019,1

I started the medication at 120ish lbs and now I'm down to 113.4 lbs. It's been two possibly three weeks since I started the meds. 

Honestly I've tried so much to get myself to eat. I went to the store, bought cake, donuts, my favorite food I don't get all the time.

I try eating a little at a time and often but even that is making me feel sick. My last resort is to get off the med because it's helping so much. I'm told this side effect could take up to 9 months for this to stop.

584,"Hi, so I have a problem: I burst into tears at the slightest adversity. It really hurts me and is beneficial to no one, but I seriously have no clue how to stop myself from crying over something that I know is so stupid. It really affects my ability to communicate in situations, and I'm really annoyed with myself, lol. 

An example would be last night when I was trying to ride the bus to my apartment that is a few miles away. I am a student at a university, so riding the bus is free if you have your Student ID card to swipe. Well last night, I went to swipe my card multiple times and the card reader said that it was misread. Usually if that happens the bus driver will make an exception; however, this time the bus driver told me I had to pay. I didn't think I'd need any money, so I didn't bring any with my to my evening class. I didn't have a way to pay. So he told me I couldn't board and I had to stand in the cold and rain, waiting for my boyfriend who was kind enough to leave work to come and get me. This morning I went to get my card replaced by the school and they told me there was nothing they could do (because my card works for unlocking doors, etc) and that it was the bus company's issue with the card readers. Instead of trying to make a point saying that the card reader worked for everyone else who was boarding the bus, I was on the verge of tears and left the service department and started crying. I ended up filing a complaint with the transit authority because I didn't know what else to do even though I'm pretty sure it's my card and not the bus readers.

It's so stupid that I can't control my tears. So what recommendations do you have for calming myself and avoid crying so I can communicate properly? This kind of thing is not uncommon for me to experience, and it causes me to avoid any kind of confrontation once I feel myself tearing up because the crying is embarrassing and silly. 

I don't know if anyone here has this issue, but if you know any kind of tips that would be great. This is probably a really easy thread to troll on, but I would appreciate serious answers only, haha.

587,"So I've been living in a city far away from my home town to study and because of my job. I have been away from my family and friends for 7 years.

Now I have a feeling of wanting to go back, live in the house of my father (he has a lot of flats) where all of my family lives, visit my old friends and have a new job.

I would get a new job directly and I would earn more than now ( because of rent is really low there compared to now)

But what's keeping me now is my boyfriend. We have been together for two years, with lots of ups and downs. He is kinda abusive, calling me names and saying that I cheat on him often. Also checking where I am and what I am doing, getting Jealous on my coworkers.

So I thought of telling him that I want to move. We talked about this before and he said he would not move with me, which to me is okay as he would be loosing contact to his family, having the same problems I have now.

I also kinda dont want to live with him there, as he would get more jealous and things would get worse.

So now I'm asking.

How am I supposed to tell him that I want to move back? When should I tell him? I am kinda frightend because I dont want to hurt him, but staying here would result in me living a Life I dont want.

Also, the flat my father has might get rented to someone else, so I'm kinda in a hurry as I would need to tell my father I want the flat, so he doesnt look for a new one who can rent it. Then I could take time, but there is this risk that he might rent it to someone else if I dont tell him that I want to move back, and thus telling my Boyfriend.

589,"My best friend and I are both 26 and have been very close since 7th grade. We’ll call her D. She was always the type to boss people around and for some reason, everyone kisses her ass. If I only met her a few years ago, I wouldn’t have been her friend at all. She’s never one to apologize for anything, she thinks she’s above everyone else. But aside from all the negatives, we really are (were) close and have had really good times together over the years.

A couple years ago, D got really close with a coworker of hers, R. I actually knew R briefly from highschool so the 3 of us started hanging out a lot. Over time I noticed they started doing things without me. I tried to not let it bother me at first, they’re not obligated to invite me every time they hang out. But if it’s at the bar or something, I don’t see why they wouldn’t include me. This has been going on for about a year. 

So about a month ago, I asked D if she wanted to get dinner with me for my birthday, then we could meet our friend group at the bar after. I wanted to get dinner just the two of us because we haven’t hung out just us in a long time. I guess there was a miscommunication because she invited the whole group to dinner. That didn’t bother me, I understood the miscommunication. 

Now here’s where I started questioning our friendship. The night before my birthday dinner, D texted me about an argument between her and R. But it just turned into her talking hardcore shit about the girl for literal hours. But then, they came to my dinner together and acted like nothing happened. Before this gets taken out of context, I’m not upset that the two of them are close. I would just be a complete fool to think that D doesn’t talk about me to other people the way she talks about everyone else to me. Even though it was “my” birthday, they completely ignored me the entire time. Once it was time to leave, D and R announced to the group that we were going to the one bar I don’t like to go to (they’re all well aware of this). So I just said I’m not feeling well, and I’m gonna pass.

Well, I don’t know what I did. Because that was the last time D and I talked/hung out. I see her Snapchat every weekend with her new group of friends and of course, I’m never invited.

I know her game. I know she will never be the one to reach out first. In her mind, she’s never wrong. Every time I’ve ever asked “hey did I do anything?” Or “hey are we good?” It’s always the same answer- yeah we’re fine. And it’s always me reaching out. It’s never her.

591,"[F] confessed her feelings to me [M] about a year ago. I told her honestly what I felt and that I appreciate it but I don't want to date anyone (as I had gotten out of a relationship a year before that)
Also, We live in different states and we text and even talk on the phone. (She moved away when we were young)

She's a really sweet person and shes pretty too but I dont feel attracted to her.
She says it's because there's long distance and if we were to meet, we would be good together.


She even plans on moving to my state for her Masters so we could move in if we were serious.

I find her not to be the same type of person in terms of interests, taste, philosophy etc. Shes also very extroverted and I'm not.

She says no two people are the same and people don't need to share same interests to love each other. (which makes sense but it doesn't feel right)

Is this romantic perfectionism on my side? Am I having commitment issues? Am I afraid because of my past relationships? Am I being egoistic for not wanting to date her because of something like taste/interests?

596,"Hi! I’m a 15 yr old girl currently in year 10 of hs and I’m in bit of sticky situation right now. Basically when I was in year 8-9 I dated a guy, let’s call him B. It lasted about 7 months until I broke things off, then near the end of year 9 I started dating my current bf, J. The issue here is since the breakup B constantly has made attempts to break me and J up, make me cheat on J, convince me J’s the son of Satan, etc. Whilst simultaneously telling everyone who will listen that me and him have ‘done it’ along with spreading lies that he fingered me at a park me and him would frequent. Now me and J were fine just ignoring him however something went down a few months ago and I don’t know what to do about it. There was a school trip to Barcelona that me, B and his B’s friend went to and being someone with aspergers it was hard talking to anyone else cause I didn’t know them so I stayed with B and his friend. Well B ended up getting with his ex during the trip to presumably make me jealous ( which is what he told me later on) and we were getting to the point where we were getting on the plane ride home. I sat next to B and B’s friend promptly fell asleep so I had no one watching, I fell asleep and I guess slumped onto B and this is where it happened, I woke up and B’s hand was on my upper thigh, I was in a denouncing skirt at the time and I awoke to him sliding his hand up my leg and under my skirt (he did not touch anything other than my thigh thankfully) when I got home I didn’t know what to do and I ended up telling my boyfriend J and my close friend but I’ve never told my mum or school out of fear as well as the fact the school has a bad record of doing nothing to punishment bad kids.

This person doesn’t know me at all therefore I don’t care what he feels about me personally, this is not a “my teacher doesn’t like me” post, but the fact that my questions are not being answered bothers me so much. 
It’s so bad that I would ask a question, he would jump it and 2 mins later when someone else asks it, he would answer it. And trust me it’s not about the question, he answered them each time someone else has asked them. It’s really gotten to the point that sometimes I can’t believe what’s  really happening.

604,"I’m 24, aged out of credit retrieval, and now labeled a high school dropout. 


I was in my final 3 months of senior year when my mental health and abuse at home finally broke me down and I couldn’t function at school. My guidance counselor called me and said I had all my credits so it was ok to drop out and I could still graduate. 


When I got my fake diploma at the graduation, I was so so happy and proud I pretty much made it through school. I did it. I wasn’t a failure. I had so many struggles and I was finally finished. My family was actually proud of me. 


The very next day my counselor calls to say I was missing just 2 credits. So I was not allowed to get my diploma. 


I was heartbroken and I suddenly felt like a loser again. 


I was then forced to go to a small building with online classes for credit retrieval, with a small group of similar almost adults who hated being there as much as I now did, and I began classes. I was not happy about the situation since I mentally checked out of ever doing school but whatever. 


But not long into my schooling, my mother got cancer. I couldn’t focus on school anymore because I wasn’t sure my mother was gonna make it, so I asked to leave and the school promised to keep my online information so I could resume classes when I returned. 



Once my mother was in good enough health, I returned to hear my work was magically gone and I would have to restart all my work. 



So I said fuck it and left. I had turned 21 just a month or so later so I was then “aged out” and couldn’t find any credit retrieval places elsewhere. So people shrugged and said two things. 


“Oh! just get a GED ¯\_(ツ)_/¯”


and


“Oh! Just lie to employers when they ask about your diploma. They don’t care. Don’t let this be an excuse not to get a job.”


Well I work an under the table job so I never had to fill out an application or make a resume, etc. But I may be looking for a job and it’s really hitting me that I don’t know how to explain to my future boss that i’m not as shitty as I may come across simply cuz I don’t have that damn paper. 


Yes I did in fact try 2 more times to sign up for a GED that would actually go off of my credits so I wouldn’t have to take every damn class over again, but both things ended up also having financial and technical issues and I gave up. 


So now what? 😓 I hope you can understand when depression and outside factors become too much and school just becomes an addition to the stress so sometimes it’s just too hard to go every day and focus on, lets face it, meaningless work. I’m not a degenerate. I really tried to make it. But now i’m nothing more than my high school dropout label and feel nothing but shame, regret, and self hatred for how it all ended up. I hate having to explain that entire story to people just so I can pretend it wasn’t my fault entirely and dont come across to people around me as some lazy kid. Idk. 


Am I screwed? Do I just have to get a GED and waste so much money it’s disgusting (free programs are not as free as they advertise around here) or do employers actually care that the person applying for a shitty minimum wage part time job, doesn’t have a diploma?",03Dec2019,1

610,"Hello, so situation. Me and my husband rent 2 rooms in a house. Landlord has a room in the back. Rent is not crazy expensive. Our lease is month to month even though verbally he said “one year” which I know doesn’t mean shit. Just setting the tone for this man. I was the first tenant and when he said he’d “give me a month rent free” if I find him a new roommate, I convinced my bf to move in. He said he never said anything about free rent, red flag there. Fake ass promises, or more so, it goes both ways. He hears what he wants to hear. Okay so. Problem. This guy, when we did the lease, said he’d take care of the yard work and hire a maid once in a while because the house is too big to clean. Now, a year later, he has us living here like his caretakers. Man does not buy groceries and eats from ours, does not clean often besides placing dishes in the dish washer, the yard is A MESS OF OVERGROWTH and bugs. We have two cats and we don’t like them going outside because of how dirty they come back when before it was no problem. We clean and I get really irritated when he comes to tell me I missed a spot or to make sure I get something over here or he tells me that the stove needs cleaning too or something. When I mop, he strolls in with dirty sandals leaving dirt tracks, thinks nothing of it. Something as simple as getting his damn coffee, he manages to leave a trail of spills to the damn back door, like how, and he always manages to do it right after I mop. Most recently, he tried inviting himself and some hoe he just met (1 month) to thanksgiving with us. Why couldn’t he take her to his family? Instead we had a very awkward conversation about what we’re doing for thanksgiving. I was offering that he can get leftovers and instead he said he could bring this woman he just met. I said I’d have to check with my husband. Later that week she ended up knocking at the door looking for him, first time we see her. I opened the door. Woman just walks right in, doesn’t introduce herself and goes to the back (garage) to find him. We’re Latino, she was Latina (born in Honduras), to us, that’s pretty fucken rude.  The day before thanksgiving he came to kinda exclaim why we’re not cooking, in that “it was my understanding that this was the arrangement” kinda way. We said we were getting ready for a Friendsgiving and he got upset and said if we’re going to be inviting then we should have let him know. The guy hears what he wants to hear and makes his own promises. He’s about 45, no kids or wife. We’re not his family and have never behaved like it, now we’re getting uncomfortable because he’s bringing this woman who is going through our stuff, the other day she walked into one of our rooms. Not to mention, the woman and him seem like opposites. He’s a white male (45), obese, has strong body odor. Topics he touches include trump, anti feminist remarks which I ignore and don’t get into. She’s about 32, very tan, born over there with heavy accent, (he says she came here as a baby, sorry to break it to him but she lying. She would not have that accent unless she came at 15~17 and if that’s the case, could be trying to marry into wealth or for something else since DACA might not be a thing soon.

At the beginning of the year my dream girl and I broke up it wasn't mutual but I was able to get over it eventually until she started dating my cousin which kinda started the process over again.

Im by no means in any bad academic situation, but I value my time in college and getting good grades very much. This job has taken up so much of my time, I haven’t been able to do schoolwork and I haven’t seen the people close to me in weeks. Its really stressing me out.

She said she'll either end up with him or all alone.

She's 24 and super smart. She's doing a PhD in pancreatic cancer. All of this extra burden thinking that they're getting back together is hurting her career, her family relationships and her friendships.

622,"Hi guys! It's my first time posting on this sub, so I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong! Also I'm on mobile, so sorry for any formatting issues and or spelling. A TLDR is at the bottom

Background: At 18 I started a really cool job that I didn't expect to be at for a long time. Everyone there was at least 26 years old, and had these amazing relationship/sex stories. So little innocent me decided it would be a good idea to lie to them, pretend to be someone who has a few friends with benefits kind of situation so maybe they'd like me more. At the time, I thought it was totally harmless.

Fast forward a couple of years to 21, and even though I left my cool job, I'm was still friends with the manager, who had also left. I was at her house party and one of my old co-workers who I had a huge crush on while we worked together was there. He had broken up with his girlfriend of like 3 years a couple months before. Long story short, we end up going back to his place. I really wanted to sleep with him, the only issue being, I was still a virgin, and I couldn't tell him because for 3 years he's thought I've had FWB. I just said something along the lines of, ""Be gentle, I'm not normally with guys as huge as you are"", and we had sex. I did bleed quite a lot, but we were both plastered, and just went back to the party. 

I spent the night at my old manager's house with a couple of other people, and in the morning I got the worst slut shaming of my life. This girl just kept berating me about how co-worker didn't like me, I was just an easy fuck,  I'm horrible for doing things like that with someone I'm not dating, and that I was just there and drunk, and that's the only reason he slept with me. So that made me super anxious, and I felt horrible about myself. We had hung out a couple of times just the two of us before (post break-up) and he didn't make any moves then, so she must have been right about all of it. So I ghosted him. I was really embarrassed about losing my virginity to him, and I figured I wouldn't see him again, so ghosting him was fine. 

Fast-forward to the present I'm 22 and a couple of weeks ago I actually started dating that same co-worker (he's 29). I really like him, but I feel horrible because I'm kind of lying to him. He thinks I've had all of these past lovers, but in reality after he took my virginity I only slept with one other guy. I'm just not sure if this is something important that I need to tell him, or if I'm just blowing it out of proportion. 

Any advice anyone could give me would be super helpful! I can also give more details if requested, I wanted to keep this post as short and to the point as possible so people may actually read it and help me make a decision.  Also incase it wasn't clear I'm a girl.

Thanks in advance!

626,"Hi, just looking for advice. I got a credit card when i was in college. I made dumb mistakes and put down $1000 for my car on the credit card. I eventually maxed it out ($3500k) and couldn’t afford the payments and it got sent to collections a year ago.

I am now paycheck to paycheck, usually borrowing money from apps like Brigit or MoneyLion. I can’t get a credit card because of the collection. I can’t afford groceries because spending money on anything but bills leaves me broke with no money for gas or basic living until I get paid again. 

I have no idea what to do. I’m 25. I understand why I can’t get approved for another credit card - but not being able to save any money what’s so ever during the 2 weeks is hurting me and at this rate I will never be able to pay off the collection. When an emergency happens I’m screwed.

I spent 8 years doing a miserable admin job  in the military that had me suicidal.  When I got out all I could think of was going to school and how hard I would work.  First semester, I am going to fail a simple algebra class and possibly German.  My wife knows that I will fail algebra, but I am too embarrassed to tell her I might fail German.  I have a long, long way to go and tbh I am not looking forward to it in the least.  I expect this, but what I didn't expect was for me to feel so uninterested in learning.  I've always been a worker.  Like manual labor type of work and as much as I would like to be school smart, the truth is I don't think I am.  Not saying I am not smart, but I hate studying and it's hard enough to get myself to do it.  I also despise math which makes me question why I am in my degree.  Due to the fact that I am much better suited, in my opinion, in manual labor, I was considering applying for an apprenticeship.  I am hoping there are more manual labor type jobs that still pay well that I can still feel accomplished at finishing.  What do you guys think?  I know you don't know me, but I need some outside advice because my wife is way outside of my intelligence level. She has her masters degree and loves admin work.  We are basically complete opposites and she thinks I should be in school.  I just don't know whats right and what's wrong.  It's hard these days when people associate college with intelligence and success.",03Dec2019,1
632,"I have a YouTube channel. It's not huge, just gets between 800 and a thousand views per video. I'm nowhere close to going full time or getting paid sponsorships.

Most of my stuff is really non-controversial. I tell crazy Uber driver stories and I show my viewers how I'm decorating my room this holiday season. I don't talk about controversial stuff because I don't want to alienate audience members by sharing offensive opinions. I also don't care much about stuff like religion and politics.

Like who really cares what my religious beliefs are? People watch my videos to see how I'm decorating my room.

I made a sit-down video called ""23 Things Italian American Parents Need To Stop Doing."" I feel like it's an important video, but it's precisely the thing I might offend people over. Plus, the internet is not a place that forgets this stuff, so if I say something wrong and change my mind about it later, I might not be forgiven.

The reason I want to write this article is because I was raised by hardworking Italian parents whom I love. And I knew many Italian families that I was close with. There are a lot of patterns I've seen particularly in Italian Americans parenting. Some good, some bad. Not all Italian American parents do these things, but I've noticed that many do.

Other cultures might have some of the same issues, but I don't know. There are only a handful of non-Italian families that I'm super close to, and I haven't really observed the same patterns in them.

For example, Italian American parents tend to give really blunt criticism about sensitive topics. I've seen a lot of them say things like ""stop eating so much fast food. You've gotten so fat."" I'm all for constructive discussions about health/diet/exercise, but bluntly telling kids they're ""fat"" isn't the way to go in my opinion. Other cultures might do the same thing but I know a lot of Italian parents are like that, which is why I made this video.

Maybe I can write an article on it instead and have the article published anonymously somewhere. But then fewer people will see it. Like if I post it on Reddit, it might reach 4 or 5 people at most. And Reddit's not a place where constructive conversations flourish.",03Dec2019,1

635,"Not sure how to begin, but here I go. I went to a larger school in Kentucky after I got out of basic training for the national guard. I stayed there for three semesters, but basically fucked myself over big time by failing literally all 4 of my classes last spring. My fafsa and state tuition waiver from the guard didn't make it in time to pay for the previous fall semester, but they allowed me to stay there anyway and continue with the next spring semester. Well long story short, I was selected for fafsa verification that year, which is a long process in itself. After I had been working with a financial aid advisor to complete all of the steps, it was too late to get the financial aid. So now I owe the school almost 17,000 with no degree to show for it. I emailed the financial aid department recently to ask if there was a way to begin a monthly payment so that I could return to school (you cannot go to a college while owing another college money), and they told me that my debt would soon be sent to a collection agency. If that happens, I will owe another 4400 on top of what I already owe. And since I owe the school directly and not as a loan, the national guard cannot pay for it. I applied with a loan through Sallie Mae, but my application will not be considered without a cosigner. I don't really have a high paying job, so I don't think I'd ever get this amount paid off.

I realize I caused most of this myself, and I'm really not interested in hearing someone gripe about what I did wrong. I just need to know if anyone has any knowledge on the subject that I don't, or just any ideas in general.

636,"So I've been on Klonopin for anxiety about a year and a half now. A few months ago I signed up for a martial arts gym that makes you pay for a guaranteed 3 months. I've tried going without taking klonopin before hand and its just miserable.

I think I've found a valid substitute with beta blockers! I've tried going to this gym without Klonopin for a few days and holy shit the withdrawals are bad (severe anxiety, tremors, headache, etc.). The thing is though is that you can't do high intensity workouts while on beta blockers. So, I'm wondering if I should just stop taking Klonopin and stop going to the gym until my withdrawals are over and at that point I think I will be fine to start going again.  

Honestly, I just want off this fucked up drug known as Klonopin and I don't think its possible if I keep going to this martial arts gym while I'm withdrawing.

My problem is that I feel like I've got myself stuck in an extremely impossible space and I don't know what to do to get myself into a more comfortable situation.

The past year, starting around Dec2018, I've been trying to set out on my own. Got a part time job that pays well but the hours are shite. Meant for it to be a few months thing while I applied for more jobs, but a few months turned into a year with no response from other applications.

At the same time I found a wonderful deal of a rental situation. Cheap but quaint, safe, close to work. A few months ago, around September, my landlord told me they were planning on selling the location and I would need to be out by the end of December 2019. I didn't think this was a problem at the time as I was still holding out hope for a better job.

October and November come around and the balancing act starts to come apart. Emergency happens and I get behind a week and a half. I get paid weekly, so that puts a dent in my rent. The end of October comes and I don't have enough for rent. Write my check anyway because I get paid at the end of the week and i should be able to recover. Joke is on me, bank is now steam rolling my account and I've spent all of November trying to get out of the red. It feels impossible. Every time I throw a check in the bank there is still red left, and they charge another fee and put me more in the red. It's a vicious cycle that's left me feeling beaten down, miserable, and hopeless. I cannot get more hours at work. I continue to apply for new jobs, but am limited by travel  I cannot get a job too far from where I live because I bike due to the lack of solid public transportation, on top of the lack of response in general.

It is now December. I don't have a place lined up because I cannot find one that is within my price range. I cannot pay rent for the month because the bank dropped another fee on me while i tried paying off more debt yesterday. It feels like every time i try to do anything life knocks me back down and I'm so paralyzed by fear that I don't know the first thing to do to try and fix my situation. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice about what to do or where to even begin to untangle this mess I've been letting accumulate over the last few months. It feels like every time i try to take care of a problem, 50 more just spring up and make it worse. 

TL;DR: In my attempt to be ""Independent"" and ""Live My Own Life"" and ""Not Be a Burden On the Family"" I shot myself in the foot and now I'm not sure where to begin.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey guys. So, for context: I am a 14 y/o dude from India. I have a typical Indian dad, so that means conservative and not so open-minded, and we aren't close either. We haven't really talked about anything else other than studies and me being a failure in the past... 3 years or so. I have been depressed and suicidal for about 2 years now and have been cutting for about a year. I think I might have anxiety, but not really sure about that. So, with that in mind, here's what's I need help with:

About a month ago, I tried talking to my dad about my cuts. I went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didn't ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube (As it had ""rotten my brain""). He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades (Like, above 95%) but since I haven't gotten good grades (I have like a 75-80% overall), he doesn't give a fuck. I couldn't even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I don't know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and it's all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldn't give a shit (This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesn't get dirty)

After like 1.5-2 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldn't understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I don't know if I should believe him or not. Anyways, this was just the backstory and here is what's going on now:

I want to see a therapist to talk about my problems but there is no therapist where I live. The closest one is like 3 hours away. One of my closest friends lives in Chandigarh (It's a big city) and I asked him if he could find out about any therapists there. His mom used to be a dentist so she knew some people and one of her close friends is a reputable psychologist in Fortis hospital. He told me about her and I was like ""Well, so can I call her and talk to her about wtf is going on with me"" but turns out she needs to talk to my dad first because since I'm a minor I can't be diagnosed without parental consent. So this means that I will have to tell my dad that I need to see a therapist. He will ask me why and I will have to tell him about my depression, suicidal thoughts, etc. 

Keeping in mind how our last convo about my mental health went and our not-so-good relationship, can you guys give me some advice about how to talk to him?

&amp;#x200B;

(PS: He gets irritated very easily and he rarely listens to me, and even if he does he will say I'm wrong since I am younger and that I never listen to him.)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I am a 14 y/o Indian dude with a typical Indian dad. Our last convo about my mental health went not so wonderful and he told me to kill myself and how to do it, and that he doesn't give a fuck about it. I want to see a therapist for depression, suicidal thoughts, self-harming, etc. but the closest one is 3 hours away. I need parental consent for even basic diagnoses, and I have no idea how to approach my dad about this. We have a poor relationship and haven't talked about anything else than studies in the past 3 years or so.

666,"Hey,

So I haven't spoken to my mum in over three years. Growing up I had a pretty hard relationship with both my parents, this situation only eased when I hit 18 and moved out of the family home. My parents used to fight all the time, it was a horrible space to grow up in. Pretty much once a week for as long as I can remember the kids used to go to bed only to be woken later in the night by mum my screaming at my Dad. They would do this for a couple of hours and then my Dad would storm out of the house and my mum would sit around crying. Sometimes it would get physical, usually mum hitting Dad, or one of the kids would go down to intervene and eventually they would stop. 

This went on right up until my Dad died. After a fight in the middle of the city which resulted in Police involvement my Mum left and refused to speak to my Dad. He tried everything to get back in touch with her and she ignored it all. She told some pretty horrific lies about him to the rest of the family too. Through out the situation Dad relied on us kids and mum relied on everyone else. Unfortunately it all became too much for Dad and he ended up taking his own life. 

In the years since, I've graduated from uni, bought my own flat, started a job i love. Besides being a bit lonely because a lack of family, im quite content (I wouldn't go as far as happy) in the life I have. All I can think is that its so much more peaceful than the life I used to have. I don't want to go back to having a relationship with my mum. Besides the fact that I hold her heavily responsible for the death of my Dad, she's manipulative, she drinks far too much, she puts herself before everyone, and shes completely incapable of living without relying on someone else. I just dont want anything to do with her. I dont know how to articulate this to her in a message without her taking it out on my brothers or sisters, or whatever I say spreading to my cousins and influencing out relationship. All I can remember when I think of her is abuse and anger and I want no part in it. She's very good at playing the victim to others, all the while she will happily throw you out the house at 2am in the middle of winter because you took your Dads side in the argument. There are very few happy memories of my childhood.

My partner didn't grow up religious, he's only half Jewish, and doesn't know how to ""do"" much of it, but we talk about religion often and I see the same love of tradition and community in his eyes. For me, that's definitely enough and makes for exactly the kind of life I want with a partner. For my parents, however, that's not going to be good enough. It hasn't been with past partners and it won't be with him. 

What's the best way to get across to my parents that 1. I love this man, he's my absolute favorite person and I want to settle down with him, no matter how they feel about it and that 2. Even if for whatever reason he isn't ""the one"", I will never want to be with someone who's as religious as them?

669,"I started a new job, seems okay, I'm picking up the pace of the work there. My boss is nice and gives me tips to be more efficient, but wants these tips to be implemented immediately and quickly. They're trying to impart years of muscle memory and efficiency but I need some time to do things... inefficiently in a sense.

I have a good work ethic, I don't waste time purposely and if something is a major problem or needs to be done a specific way, I totally understand having to learn the proper way to do something. The thing is, they have all these tiny muscle memory things that they correct me on constantly, it feels like I can't take a step without being corrected because their way will save 0.2 seconds. Sure, they're not wrong about these tips but I can't memorize them all and need some breathing room. I've started instinctively avoiding doing things around them, because I know it'll come with a criticism.

Luckily this hasn't been going on way too long, so I'd like to address it. The thing is I could use some help with how to say this...

673,"On mobile, so ya know. 

So, earlier in the summer my AC unit went out and I called my property office for them to come fix it, and they gave me the standard “yeah we’re sending someone ASAP”. Maintenance comes after a few days of dealing with a 90+ degree apartment. The maintenance dude is around for literally not even 5 minutes, fiddling with my outside unit when he comes in claiming he “fixed it.”  When my girlfriend asked exactly what he did, that’s exactly how he replied, “I fixed your AC.”

Flash forward to last month when we had a leak from our ceiling, because it turns out that ice was thawing from the furnace and dripping through a light fixture onto my kitchen counter. The plumbing guy realizes it’s an AC issue and does the best he can (lets it thaw and flushes the pipes) and it worked for about a week. 

A few weeks ago, the furnace wasn’t working (and by that I mean blowing cold air nonstop, even though the fan was set to automatic) so we called the property office again and they sent out a (different, thank god) HVAC company. The HVAC company determined that our outside unit and furnace were completely frozen solid (furnace was frozen all the way up from the inside). He flipped the emergency heat to let it thaw out because it was in the 10 degree range outside that night. 

He comes back two days later and fixes a wire that was misplaced (from the HVAC company that came out in the summer) which was causing the AC unit to run continuously, even when we had our thermostat flipped to heat. The two mixed and the AC froze the furnace, resulting in the issues I had been having. 

We just got our current electric bill and it is $564. It has NEVER been that high and we’ve lived in the apartment for a year and a half. Electric is all we pay, and it tripled plus some between October and last month (Normal electric bill is between $120-$150). 

Is there any action that we can take, with either the electric company (goes through city) or the property office, so that we don’t have to pay the full bill?

674,"Hey y'all trigger warning for pet owners

So I just moved into a townhouse recently and my neighbours are Slavic immigrants like me, we got along. 

*BACKSTORY*

I've helped watch their border collie shepherd mix a few times, we're close enough that I was able to help when they were away. For a few months we had a puppy of our own, Australian Shepherd, most beautiful boy ever. But I'm currently grieving, giving him up to my uncle. I was too sick to take care of him and husband works long hours. Our pupper needed a life we couldn't give him so uncle took him to live on his farm. He now has a purpose and tons of locally raised chicken for dinner. We never liked the idea of kibble but pet owners will know, raw/homemade diet is expensive. 

Neighbour's doggo was clearly in love with him, they were the best of friends. Neighb moved his fence line over to the edge of ours (we have no real fences and use adjustable ones for doggo purposes only) so they had extra space to run around and wrestle.

Once ours was gone, neighb's *dog* yelled at me for two days straight. Everytime I'd come out for a smoke she'd be there barking at me. I cried a lot lol and apologized to her profusely for taking away her best friend.

Long ass back-story later. Neighb's dog is definitely neglected and possibly abused. The husband admitted he never wanted her and I can tell she doesn't like males as much. Before they'd ask me to watch her but since our puppy is gone they haven't. Instead they have resorted to just leaving her outside to play.....from 11am to 5pm.

We live in Canada and it's fucking cold as shit outside. It's -5c to 1c (23F) today and she's been out since 930. When this situation occurs, I've just been bringing her inside to warm up and feeding my old doggy's food and giving her water. Playing w her in my basement. It's happened about 3 times since it's been winter weather. 

*REQUEST* Thing is, I can't get her to chill tf out. I need to get some work done and I just need to type to death on my PC for a few hours before I get my baby from school. She just won't chill out is this a border collie personality or is she simply uncomfortable in a stranger's home? She is crate trained as hell, if I open the door to their home she goes in her crate immediately not even stopping for a drink. 

Yes she flinches, I tested one arm raise, she blinks and puts her ears down which are normally very much up. She is very much abused :( and I hate it but please please dont recommend I call any authorities. Niether me nor my husband will involve authorities, we'd rather talk to them / take care of doggy if they're away. 

I really beg, pls don't report me or my neighbor, pls don't dox me. I just need advice on how to take care of a border collie who's super crate trained but I don't own a crate anymore. 

Ugh what a shitshow of a post, not seeking validation I just want her to be warm and get my damn work done without ""awoo"" every second I don't throw the toy god she's so cute. No puppy tax pls 😭 she's not fully mine",03Dec2019,1
675,"First, my main question is there something wrong with me? 

If not, how do I deal with my emotions as a twenty-two year old male?

And just a warning, this is about to get really personal. There is some stuff I'm going to talk about that makes me feel shameful and stuff that I've put in the back of my head for a years. 

My whole life I've thought there is something wrong me, and it mostly relates to my emotions. 

In middleschool, if I saw a friend of mine having fun with someone else, it would devastate me. I would think that my friend didn't like me, or liked this person more than me. I would start thinking about how they could have fun and crack jokes, which lead to me being inside my head. Am I being funny enough when I am around then?  Am I being boring? What do I say to make them like me? What do I say to seem interesting? Why don't I have as much to say around them as other people? 

Again, during early middle school, I remember having a really good friend that I would sit next to on the bus. The only issue is that I always felt like I never had anything to discuss with my friend. He would chat with people around the bus, while I sat their quietly. I would try to talk and have fun, but I never felt like I had anything to talk about like the other kids. They could just talk and have fun.

And during this time, with the same friend, I experimented. I was hanging out with him at his house on a really cold winter day. We were probably 12 or 13 around this time, and he said that we should take a bath together. We were young and bestfriends, so it really didn't seem awkward to me. We take a bath, and he says he wonders what a blowjob feels like. I was hesitant, but before you know it, he's doing the deed on me. And of course I have to reciprocate, even though I didn't want to. 

I remember feeling so shameful after this. I felt like I had murdered someone. It would keep me up at night, thinking to myself ""what is wrong with me?"". I remember that I would I message him on facebook talking about what we did and asking him what's wrong with us. 

My point in mentioning this, is that I've always felt like something was wrong with me my whole life. I've always felt shameful about who I am or things I've done. I've felt emotions to the extreme, whether it's about not fitting in, or doing things I don't think I should have done.

I've been stuck in my head my whole life, and any little action can trigger my emotions. Having friends was hard, because if they had more friends than me, I would feel like a loser. If they would talk more than me, I would feel like a loser or that something is wrong with me. Why don't you have that many friends? Why is it harder for you to make friends? Why can't you talk as much and hold a conversation? Why can't you stop worrying about these things? 

I struggle with these issues to this day. I have a wonderful girlfriend, but when we hangout with her friends, she can let loose. I can't. I just can't. And it doesn't help that I really don't have any friends of my own.

What's wrong with me? Is there something wrong with me?

682,"Okay. TLDR: a doctor that I work with only wants women to work with him because he’s afraid of being sued post Weinstein and it’s hurting my job performance with my high level part of my job. 


Some context. I work in interventional radiology. It’s a high level branch of radiology in which we perform minimally invasive procedure in a sterile environment.
One of our doctors has been around for like twenty years and for the last year and a half has been our only physician (the other retired). He has gravitated towards less complicated procedures, including pain injections of which he holds a clinic two days a week. Myself and another gal are the main techs who assist him but it’s basically an entry level like job: cleaning the room, holding medications for him to drawn from...basic stuff. Really boring and below my pay grade. 
Fast forward, I had a baby and was on maternity leave for twelve weeks. Meanwhile, we hired a new younger doctor who wants to do all the complicated stuff. Things I’ve never done/seen or haven’t done in years. So I come back from leave and am learning how to do new things but the older doctor (we’ll call him OD) wants to do more pain clinic days. Of which my boss puts me on. One of the only reasons that I and my coworker work up there is because since the Harvey Weinstein thing came out, he is paranoid of getting sued or have a claim on him (however I thought we were all professionals). 
There are three other technologists who I work with then who are exempt from doing it simply because they are male. Meanwhile, they are getting the experience I so desperately need because I’ve been gone and I’m trapped in a mind numbingly dull clinic. 
The reason this is important is because we are an on call department and I would be the only one in and if I don’t have experience...well I’m screwed basically. 

So I guess what I’m asking is how do I approach my boss about getting the other techs to do “their fair share” of part of our jobs? What points should I make? Is this sexism?

687,"She would repeatedly turn back to stare at me and smile while holding eye contact for basically as long as I kept it. That would sometimes go on for a very long time. She'd even turn 180 to face me while sitting in class to stare and smile at me until I noticed it. She'd stare as I left class with a disappointed look and also when we first saw each other after the semester (college) and I was in the far back corner.  She'd also get angry and stare with that face if I was with 2 other girls and next day she'd also poker face stare at them. Why do this if not interested?

&amp;#x200B;

First year of college she was much more shy, she was ignoring another (good looking friendly) guy trying to talk to her and her entire face lit up with really wide eyes when I turned around to say something to them. Sometimes she'd stand very close to me outside class, for basically no reason while also often choosing to sit behind or in front of me. She did this a lot. She also said she was going to meet a friend but had a lot of free time until then and paused for some moments before leaving, I was too slow to act on that.

Yesterday it was very obvious. Her friend group of 4-5 would normally sit somewhere else with lots of space but she sat directly in front of me, which was a single seat, seat for just one person. I asked her out after the class was over. She said sure while smiling the whole time. I said tomorrow is okay for me because I suck and that was my fail way of giving a date. Forgot to add the time. Then she added I'll let you know on top of her sure. Obviously not too great, I wasn't %100 confident. I knew it %95 wasn't gonna happen. Obviously nothing came from her.

688,"Hi so a little bit of backstory, my mom and dad had me young (19/20) and divorced when I was only 1. So I grew up spending holidays with both families. I would have dinner with my mom's family around 2/3pm and with my dad's family 5/6pm. It worked because everyone lived within 10 minutes of each other. My dad died when I was 13 and at that point I spent a lot of time with my dad's family because I wanted to feel closer to my dad. At Christmas they would have EVERYONE. Around 40 people including my second cousins, great aunts&amp;uncles, and people so extended I don't even know how I was related to them. I would bring my half sister (who is now 15) and we would sleep over, it all worked out well.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, recently my sister and I have distanced ourselves from that side of the family. There are a lot of toxic things the family that we cannot handle. We both have anxiety and dealing with that is very difficult when family is being toxic. I also personally felt that once I got older, I was ignored more and more by extended and close family. I would sit at Christmas and nobody would talk to me. My sister has completely stopped interacting with them and has the whole family blocked. I stopped going to Christmas all together when my grandparents (who host) moved an hour away. My grandma cannot handle this. I tried to let her down gently and just say ""I don't feel safe driving at night on Christmas by myself"" but she keeps pressing. I've tried being more direct and just saying ""no i'm not coming"" but now she has a whole other tactic. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was texting her today about going out to her house only a few days before Christmas for dinner. I've been dating my boyfriend for 3 years and they haven't met him so I offered to bring him along. My sister even agreed to come. All my close family would be able to come. I'm trying my hardest to please my dad's side of the family but i've already said I won't come to Christmas. My grandma asked again, and I said no AGAIN. So this time she tries to guilt trip me by saying my extended family has not seen me in two years and will be very disappointed. The thing is they never talked to me when I used to go. It was very clear my sister and I were a pity object as our father is dead. My grandma would then get sympathy whenever he is brought up as she is SUCH a great grandma. The issue is even before my dad died she was trying to kick him out of the house despite the fact he had terminal cancer. He lost his job because he couldn't work so he had to move home. I try to not cause fights with my dad's side of the family but I don't know what to do anymore. It seems like my only options are to cause a fight, cut that side of the family off, or continue to be guilted for not attending Christmas. She even asked if I could promise to come next year. I'm graduating college in May so I don't even know where I will be or if that is possible. Plus I just straight up don't want to.

Basically we have been drifting apart for a while now, but since my family absolutely loves her (probably more than me, no joke) I don't want to hurt her or disappoint them for doing what I believe might need to be done. 

The real deal breaker for me, despite her being both lovely and pretty, is that she is indoorsy, doesn't have any hobbies, and doesn't want to take on any of the activities or hobbies that I absolutely love (like skiing or hiking). She has no interest in moving to the place I love most (the mountains) and wants us to start having kids soon, even though I am not financially stable (just did my MBA and am starting a business). To cap all that off, she wants to move back to England, her home country, and I have absolutely zero interest in doing so (we lived there for a couple of years and it nearly ended us). 

I feel a strange kind of relief when I imagine it might be over. I could move back to the mountains, and maybe find someone I am more compatible with. I know I'll miss her - I do love and care about her - but not sure how to handle this. I think she knows there is a decent chance we could break up but she's waiting on me to kill it.

Also, she has an incredible network of people who have all adopted me in because of how much they love her, so I feel like I will be very lonely if we split. Not sure if that's what's holding me back, or just the general disappointment from my parents that will be 100% inevitable.

696,"Every so often I start having these vivid thoughts about doing things I wouldnt normally do. Maybe I'm getting into a physical altercation or a romantic situation. It's all very emotion driven and powerful. I will begin to act out the situation without thinking. I will speak, and promote myself in a fashion relatable to the thought going through my head. I sometimes think of death or lying in my death bed. My breath will become short or raspy as if it has become difficult for me. Other times Im outspoken and prepared to defend others and myself. I get physical and raise my voice. My body will react to punches thrown or received though nothing has happened. In sexual encounters I feel their caress. Their warmth. Their love. I no longer see the world around me; Only this fantasy I have brought myself into. I catch myself acting this way and stop it as soon as I can but I wonder what if I let it take me away. What if I let it take hold? I already have insanely vivid dreams, and an overactive imagination. I just wonder what if there is more. What if I can harness this energy in some way? I hope to figure it out. What are your thoughts?",03Dec2019,1
697,"So I recently had a close friend show me [this video](https://youtu.be/D4Hapmm9YiY) after asking me if I had Asperger’s. So many of this girl’s hand gestures and how she speaks with with these spaces between words and how she describes interacting with people, it’s the exact same things I relate to. There were times where the video would buffer and Id know exactly what she was gonna say next because that is my life. I’ve been diagnosed with adhd and that and the medication have always been to blame for my awkwardness in social situations and sensitivity to foods and noises and smells.

As I said, I was diagnosed with adhd when I was in Kindergarten, so I technically have been tested, but In the 8th grade I was also diagnosed with antisocial tendencies, severe anxiety, depression, and also was suspected to be a highly sensitive person, but since the depression diagnosis, they didn’t want to add that to the list just in case it was a result of the other diagnosis which were much clearer, which doesn’t really mix well with the antisocial tendencies diagnosis. That combined with the fact I had delays in speech development, like I couldn’t pronounce my Rs and Ls completely until I was in the third grade, most people thought I was just trying to be cute, but that’s not the case. Only in high school did my stutter become manageable.

Those are just the “official” things that make me think that it’s likely that I may have Asperger’s. I could go point by point with my whole every day life and point out a million more things, but that would take too long.

So now I want to get re-diagnosed. I just want to know if this is enough speculation in order to basically “be valid” enough to seek out someone to test me? How would I go about this? I’m 21 female and a full time student.",03Dec2019,1
698,"This is hard for me to work through and sorry for the really long post, but I’d really really appreciate help. I want to know if there’s anything to do that I’m not thinking of. 

My husband and I got a puppy 6 months ago (dog is almost 1 now). And it’s just breaking me. This was so unexpected because I’ve always been a huge animal lover with such a bleeding heart. I have to cats and love them so much. I didn’t really want a dog but was okay with it because my husband had wanted one for his whole life and we waiting until we had a house with a fenced in yard to get one. 

We took her to obedient school and he works on training her almost every day. He also takes her on runs and she goes up to the mountains with him and my dad and has lots of fun exploring. We take her to dog parks and dog play dates to socialize her and get her energy out. My husband bathes her every week. So she isn’t neglected in the slightest. And we’ve worked really hard to train her. But I still feel like I can’t do this. My husband works over 40 hours a week and I’m home. I knew going into it a lot of the day to day care would land on me... I just didn’t know it would feel so pointless and unrewarding. 

She is so so so hyper. All the time. She needs to be constantly entertained. She can never just chill. She jumps all over me none stop to play fetch or tug of war or just craziness. It’s impossible to get work done. I can’t keep my eye off her or she will get into someone new. She is crate trained so I will put her in the crate and get some work done but god forbid I make any noise that wakes her or lets her know someone’s home or she will lose her mind scratching and whining to get out. It makes me feel like a prisoner  in my own home and I have to plan my entire day around when I can get 5-6 hours of peace (as long as I am absolutely silent). 

She still smell so bad (like a dog) and I feel like she makes our whole house smell like dog. She digs up our yard all the time, no matter how much we try and disciple it. (It’s hard to fix that problem seeing as I either have to sit and watch her outside or she does it when no ones looking) She’s expensive. (I know everyone warned us of that but I thought I had a good grasp off how expensive it would be going into it, there’s just always more and more unexpected costs). 

We’ve read dog training books, the Monks ones etc. I wouldn’t mind putting in the work for her at all in general, except it feel so unrewarding. I’ve never bonded with her and although I definitely don’t wish any harm on her at all and will definitely take her of all her needs, I don’t feel any affection to her. I feel awful about it because I know my husband loves her so much. And I would never look to rehome because of that. I would be crushed to part with my cats and would never dream of inflicting that on him. But I’m still her primary caregiver and frankly feel like she breaking me. 

I feel very alone in taking care of this very high maintenance animal that I have no connection with. Just exhaustion and frustration.  But I want to be able to do it for my husband who is amazing and I love. I’m just so worn out. Please help me! 


TL:DR My husband’s (who I love her much) dog (who he loves very much) is wearing me out. And my lack of connection with the dog is making it feel impossible to spend so much of my day and time and money taking care of her.",03Dec2019,1

700,"I've had kind of a weird ride with my life. In junior high I was weird, shy, and mostly friendless. High school came around and I had more friends than I could count, I was present in every moment, and I was incredibly relaxed with saying and doing what I wanted, when I wanted to. College came along and somehow I went back into my shell and am still having trouble coming back out.

I'm usually embarrassed to talk to people, even my friends, because I don't feel like I have much to bring to the table. I still get along well with my more social friends, because they force me out of my shell, but I am incredibly awkward with other friends. One guy I know reminds me a lot of myself, we like a lot of the same things, play the same video games, read the same books, listen to the same music, etc. I can't keep a conversation going with him for the life of me. It gets awkward fast then we basically stop making eye contact.

I've been running into this more and more with people. I'll ask about what they've been up to, I'll tell them about the few things I've done since I last saw them, talk a little about work, about sports, then suddenly I'm just out of stuff to talk about. Even at home with my fiancée, I only have so much to say. I used to be weird and say stupid things, make dumb jokes, mess with my friends, I just don't feel like it any more. It just feels like I'm floating along and I'm physically present with my friends, family, or fiancée, but that my mind is off in space and doesn't want to come down, it all just feels dream like.  I used to get so excited about seeing my friends or to take my fiancée on a date, but now both of those just feel like a thing I'm supposed to do so I do it and act my best. I want to get back into the flow of life, connection, and conversation. This has been affecting my work life recently as well, I've taken on a position centered around sales, and I find it incredibly forced and awkward to start up conversations with customers/leads.

701,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years, next month will mark 4 years. We just recently got our first place together and over the last few months, it really opened my eyes about how stuck he is in his childish ways and I just don’t have the same feelings towards him as I once did. 

Just to give some context, it’s not like I haven’t tried to save the relationship. I’ve tried to communicate with him so many times about what I need to change and he either flips it back around on me, or changes for maybe a week and then goes back to the same toxic behavior. 

He doesn’t clean or contribute anything to the house besides his part of the bills. He TRASHES the house. He treats me coldly if I’m not in the mood to have sex (even went as far as accusing me of cheating on him because of it). I enjoy sex but between working full time, being in nursing school, and basically being his personal maid—it’s exhausting and honestly, a turn off. He’s gotten to the point where he’s only nice/affectionate towards me if I give him his way, which ends up making me feel very violated. (I do consent, but I feel as though I shouldn’t have to sleep with someone just to avoid an argument or for them to be nice to me.) 

I want to end the relationship but I’m scared he’ll either hurt himself or attempt suicide. I know he’s struggled with depression &amp; suicidal thoughts in the past and I just don’t want to be the reason he gets pushed over the edge. He’s all the time making comments like “I would die without you” or things like “Without you I don’t have any reason to live.” I know I probably sound cruel for not wanting to stay with him, but it’s clear that I can’t fix him, and he’s not willing to change or even meet in the middle. I’m just not happy with him anymore but I do love him and care about his well being. How should I handle the situation?",03Dec2019,1

703,"  I have a younger sister who is almost 16 years old now. We are pretty close and she tells me everything. 
  Lately, she has been talking on the phone a lot and hiding it from me. I caught her saying ""I love you"" to someone that sounded like a guy and ask her why she is hiding a boyfriend from me (she usually tells me about all her crushes). 
  She goes on to tell me about a guy she's seeing. He's a college student and knows one of her friends. He's in his second year and 19 years old.
   Apparently, within a month of knowing each other, he claimed to love her so she starting sexting him (she initiated it). They have kissed already and he keeps asking her to have sex with him (she says it was mutual and that she bought it up). 
  I asked her to be careful but she started yelling at me and saying I don't understand them. She's usually a pretty intelligent girl but her judgement seems to be clouded here. 
  So I ask her to introduce him to me and she does. He seemed to be a down to earth guy and was very quite but the things that she tells me he said were disturbing (he ""arranged"" a place at his friend's for them to do the deed after she told him she would and made her promise not to back out. He also told her to ""cover up"" when she was wearing a spaghetti strap but he claims to have said that for her own good)
  I don't agree with this relationship. The guy doesn't sit right with me. Is it fair for me to interfere? (I am only 21 so don't know what to do.) Telling my parents would break her trust in me.

Don't move into an apartment near the gym, right? We didn't! We're 2 floors up and an entire row of apartments over from the gym (which only closes from 12-5am, ugh).

The noise is from the free weights and kettle bells being thrown around at all hours in spite of ""Respect your neighbors and don't drop weights"" signs. The thumping rattles our floor and we can even see the water in our glasses vibrating.

707,"tw: mention of sexual assault?

i think i realized this when i first made out with my (ex) boyfriend. i just couldn't keep my eyes closed and i kept feeling like i wanted to escape my body, and i can even hear myself screaming inside. i think that's why i broke up with him—any time we got intimate, i would always freeze and i ended up being cold with him during the tailend of our relationship. we never had sex. worst part is this ex is a really sweet, kind guy, and i hate that i closed myself off like that, but i just really wanted to get out.

it's been a few months, i've moved to a different city, so it's a bit lonely. i've reconnected with an acquaintance who is romantically interested in me (we don't live in the same area though). again, a very sweet guy, and i was looking forward to meeting up irl. however, he's been overly flirty lately and i found myself almost ignoring him like i did with my ex. im trying to convince myself to give it a shot (maybe finally lose my virginity this time), but i just feel the urge to run away from him and never look back.

it bothers me so much. im scared of how scared i am.

surprisingly, i never felt this way with this close friend who i ""experimented"" with. i could say i was in love with this friend, and even he didn't return the feeling, we were okay kissing and cuddling with each other (he's also my first kiss actually). i have to admit i felt bad every time because it didn't feel real and we never talked about it with other people until now. this little arrangement stopped earlier this year, and my feelings for him disappeared and we are still friends.

i've played around with the idea of me being asexual or demisexual. maybe i just didn't love them enough? or is it because i was molested as a child? i really want to explore my sexuality but i can't keep shutting myself out like this.",03Dec2019,1

710,"Throwaway.

I am nearly 30 years old. I work two part time jobs. One I enjoy (as much as one can enjoy a job, anyway), the other... not so much. I do the same thing every day in the latter, and it just feels like I'm running in place. I've been feeling very depressed for the last few months, and I strongly feel that this second pointless job is a big part of it. Even though it's only 15-20 hours a week, I'm exhausted by the time I get home, and don't have the energy or time to pursue my passions/interests outside of work. I haven't been taking very good care of myself in terms of diet or exercise lately too, and it's usually because I'm too wiped out to hit the gym or fix a healthy meal.

I want to quit. Problem is, my other job is seasonal, whereas the problem job is year round, M-F. So while I don't necessarily NEED this job, it's a good idea to have it when work is slow in the job I enjoy (unless I budget like crazy and follow the Ramen noodle diet for the majority of the summer). Financial stability is important to me.

I've been doing some reflecting, and I have come to realize that I'm not lazy and I don't hate work. But I don't like working around people, and I don't like being obligated to be anywhere. The job I have that I enjoy is remote and flexible, whereas the job I'm sick of is in an office and I have set hours. I am a highly motivated individual, and when it's up to me to work as many hours as I want, I'll get up at five and work for 12 hours straight. Or when I work on something creative that I know I'll be proud of, I'll work so much I forget to eat, and I'll STILL feel energized because I love what I'm doing. But when I HAVE to be somewhere for a certain amount of hours, it destroys my motivation.

I want to pursue something different, but I don't know where to start. I know my dream career would involve me being my own boss and doing something creative, where I am in control of how much I work and the environment I do it in. I want to make a big change, but this second job has just zapped all of my energy and motivation to even try.

The past year and a half of our relationship, my parents have hated her, now they never really got along with her parents and there was a whole thing about that but they started specifically hating her, to the point that any time me and her get into a fight they try and manipulate me into thinking I need to breakup with her, talking about things that she's doing is manipulating me and that I can't trust her and I have to have blind trust in them purely because they are my parents. It's gotten to the point that they refuse to invite her to anything and when I ask and get her invited myself they try and change the plans last second as much as possible to try and make it so she can't come or gets frustrated and gives up. It's ridiculous, there was some like corn field thing we were all going too and my parents kept changing the time we were going, and my girlfriend (a very schedule oriented individual and I love her for it) started to get frustrated because she cooks and cleans for her parents and grandparents and she couldn't plan when she could do the cooking if she didn't know what time to meet us.

My first referee is my last boss: but I can't use them as they left the company. They are a personal instead of professional reference but this will leave 6 months unaccounted for if they can't mention my work. 

My second referee is the replacement for the first reference as they were my boss before I got promoted, we were very close friends but then it broke down and now I'm worried they won't remain professional. They are already complaining that the form is long but I had nobody else to go to.

My third is a manager from another job. He hasn't responded to my texts but the company have sent the reference forms out now. He said I could use him as a reference whenever so I did.

The other thing is the form is based heavily on something I have no experience in. The company know this and still offered me the job but I worry that the references will be unsatisfactory if half of it is blank.

My laundry place told me an hour so I decided to get a massage. I’ve only ever had good experiences at massage parlors with my girlfriend so I thought this would be the same. What followed was the most uncomfortable experience of my life. 
At the front door they offered me half price oil massage and I’d never had one of those so I took the offer. To start off I thought it was just a back massage so when they told me to take the rest of my clothes off I was puzzled and a tad bit uncomfortable but I went with it. But it only got worse. What I got seemed to more so flirting or attempts to turn me on by talking, and occasional “accidental” bumps to my balls or something. As if getting my ass rubbed wasn’t uncomfortable enough. At that point I was laying there eyes wide open staring at the wall, counting the seconds until it was over. Probably 40 min in she flips me over, takes off my towel and starts stroking me asking me some inaudible question, to which the only appropriate response I could muster was a hard NO. Probably the only good thing I got out of that was that she seemingly lost interest in me as a customer after that and the massage ended 20 minutes early. 
However, when I got to the hotel room I was going to tell my girlfriend and began to but immediately realized I wasn’t quite comfortable sharing it all, so I changed the story to them telling me to get naked and I left feeling uncomfortable. She didn’t believe me and thought I got a happy ending and was mad but then suddenly was over it and it seems fine now. I feel bad so I am wanting to tell her but I don’t know if I want to change my story, especially since she is seemingly over it now anyways.",03Dec2019,1

726,"So I do construction and I go to the same hardware store a lot. I wave and talk to the people who work there every time I come in, I basically live there now lol. There is this one girl who always smiles and talks to me, even asked my name. So her and I talk when we can mostly coming and going from the store. It seems like she is into me just by how she talks to me. I think this on the fact that out of everyone there, whom I talk to more and see more, this girl i barely see asks for my  name. I recently took a vacation for the holiday for a week. Came back today to the store and she lights up and explains my  name and tells me about her holiday. Now I cant tell if shes into me. It's her job to be smiley and nice because she is in the service industry. She also likes to state how many times I've been there that day and asks if I'm coming back in, as a joke obviously.

728,"Okay so my friend recently got into a car accident. Nothing serious. A little bit of her car was damaged, but it was still able to drive afterward. The person hit her because his light was out and ended up turning at the wrong time. His back half of his car is ripped off. After her accident, however, she said she was fine and nothing was wrong. Then, a couple of days later she started saying that her foot kind of hurt and that she is going to exaggerate it more than it actually does. (Because she hurt it herself a couple of months ago, but she was going to blame it on the accident). So, she went to the emergency room and said that her foot was fractured and that they put her in a neck cast, foot cast, and gave her crutches. I'm just really confused because she said that nothing was wrong to me! Anyways, she later says that she is going to say that her car is totaled (even though it was not at all) and so she took it to get fixed and told them that certain pieces were custom made, and they ended up taking her car apart and just going along with what she said and wrote down that it was undrivable because they took it apart. Long story short, she claimed that her car was totaled, claimed that her foot was injured, claimed she had severe back pain (which was not true, but she received 4 weeks of free chiropractic treatments). In the end, she received $25,000 from ""pain and suffering"" and she is receiving money for her ""totaled"" car and she got a handicap sticker to use???

729,"thanksgiving night, my girlfriend (25f) and i (28m) were pretty drunk. we were having sex, which started out fairly kinky but escalated to some pretty nasty shit. i'm going to be a little bit graphic here, because something happened towards the end that has caused a lot of problems between us, and i just need some guidance on what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

first, let me just clarify that we've talked about ass play many times, and she doesn't ever want to be fully fucked in her asshole, but sometimes i'll rub it a little or lick it if my face is already down there, just minimal stuff. and not even every time we fuck. i can probably recount like all four times (including thanksgiving) that i've made any type of contact with her asshole. 

so yeah, i was rubbing it a little while i was inside her, and i slipped my index finger inside, briefly, not even my full fingernail. but penetration nonetheless. she didn't try to stop me, she was definitely into it. (also, we've been together for like two years and we're very open with each other, especially sexually, so i know like when she's into something and when she's not. and there have been times where she's let me try things that weren't necessarily her favorite, and vise versa. we both make efforts to please the other one, even if we talk about it after and say like ""i don't want to try that thing again"" but this wasn't her just letting me try something is the point that i'm making, she liked it.)

&amp;#x200B;

so whatever, anyways.. i was talking to her all kinds of nasty, calling her names and just being extremely vulgar, but again we do that often and she's super into it, none of this is the problem yet. 

so, i was talking my shit, being nasty, and i kinda of sat up and switched positions while still inside of her (pussy) and i just started fucking her really hard. and she kinda tried to stop me. and this where i did a bad thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

i pulled out, and i sat up all the way and i put my dick on her face, sort of thrusting myself on her mouth. and she really tried to stop me, so i got all the way on top of her and pinned her arms down and just kept trying to get my dick into her mouth. 

from her saying stop fucking me so hard until me pinning her arms down was maybe like 90 seconds. it was short lived, i was drunk for sure but i'd kind of come to while she was like crying and begging me to stop and i immediately got off of her and just sat on the bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

i was disgusted with myself for sure. she punched me in the face and nearly broke my nose, it bled for like an hour. but again, not the point. i fucked up for sure. she lets me be nasty with her in the ways that i'm into, and in ways that she's into, but instead of respectful consensual sex between two people who love each other, i crossed so many lines. 

and being drunk is no excuse either. we've had nasty ass drunk ass sex so many times and i've never done anything like that to her.  i know it's mad cheesy but like i really do love that woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

anyways, i'm finally coming up to my two questions -- 

&amp;#x200B;

she says i raped her. but she doesn't want to talk about it. at all. she doesn't want to revisit ever again she said. and like i definitely sexually assaulted her, i was mad aggressive and literally pinned her down and put my dick in her face. and i'm not trying to get off an a technicality here, but did i *rape* her??

&amp;#x200B;

not that that even really matters. my real problem is how things are now. i've ruined this relationship. i've talked about marriage with this woman, we live together and we've looked at rings. really we're just waiting to pay off our school loans and be a little more financially stable and then we're literally going to get married. 

but i've fucked it all up. we haven't kissed, we don't touch, she won't lay in **our bed** anymore. everything is different. she said she can't even respect herself anymore because she didn't leave me that night. she says she still loves me and still wants to be with me, but that things are so wrong now. she used to feel safe with me, she has really bad anxiety and she gets these debilitating panic attacks, and i would hold her and comfort her. but now she just sits in another room alone when she's upset because i make it worse. she literally doesn't feel safe with me anymore, she told me that. she cried and said that her favorite thing about being with me was ruined forever now. and i just sat there and cried too, i can't believe how deeply i've hurt her. i hate myself. i could've just enjoyed her and the sexy ass shit she would do for me and with me and to me and lived happily ever after with her. but instead, i did something awful to my favorite human and now everything is so bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

i just want to make things right. i've been giving her her space, as much as i can with us still living together. the other day she was naked after a shower and i looked at her, like i always do, and she grabbed a towel and told me not to do that anymore. actually she told me to never do that again because i lost that right. she's not mine to look at anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

i just hate that i hurt her. especially in this way. i guess i wrote all of this in hopes that someone reads it and can help me fix this. i fully believe that i've damaged her beyond repair. i destroyed our relationship. and i just wanna know if there's still any hope. will things ever be okay with us again?? what can i do to make things right????",03Dec2019,1
731,"I have been working with this company for 1y6mo.

Somehow, ever since I got here I have been under the impression they never wanted me here, even though they gave me all I asked for to come here. 

They promissed mi a path to a higher position than where I'm at, but I have not been given that, it was given to a younger employee that has been here for 2 years. Said employee was supposed to join my team but did not because of experience, but they did not hesitate to offer this employee the higher position.

Now my previous boss loved me, praised me and used me to fix problems others in my team created, though now was moved to another position, so I have a new boss. The new boss first move was to pull me out of a project I was working on and gave it to a younger member of my team.

I haven't spoken to my new boss about the desicion, nor have I seen my new boss around to simply talk about what the plan is. I am affraid I will be asked to quit or they will eventually get rid of me. I have been applying with no luck at all.

732,"Ever since I hit puberty, my mom made it her mission to make me appealing to boys. Not in a pimp-me-out way, more in a prepare-me-to-be-a-""good wife"" way. She loved me and was trying to make me happy in her way, but I was dressed up and made up at all times, encouraged to look cute and go to classmates parties and of she went over to a friend's house who had a son, she dolled me up and paraded me over there. So I internalized this idea that I have no value except through boys (who never paid attention to me, by the way). The few boyfriends I had in college made me feel awful about myself as well (probably because I was desperately seeking their approval). Anyway, now, at 31, I've been single for about 6 or 7 years but still haven't found a way to feel like I have value by myself and ""love me"". 

I saw a therapist for a while, but I stopped having insurance that covered it and I can't afford it.

736,"This is a very long and complicated story but please stick with it :))  
OK so a bit of background that I feel is important shall follow. This year, I got close to two of my friends V and M. We were extremely close and they were the most important people in my life. Starting from about February, I had been having trouble with my roommate, which would stress me to the point I would get upset quite often. I would always vent to V and M, and would offer support, which honestly did help a significant amount in reducing how upset I was. Another  character is J, who is V's ex.

One weekend, M tells me that V is mad at me bc I hung out with J without telling V (in a group of 7 might I add, after she had stated that it was fine for us to hang out). I needed time to figure out what I was going to say, as confrontation isn't really my forte. In the times I saw her before I apologized, she completely ignored my existence. I met up with her and apologized. She made it out to be that everything was fine when I left to go home. 

Everything is OK. The next day, I'm at the library with my roommate and M, when M all of a sudden gets upset and goes home. The next day, she ignores my messages and I notice at uni she's avoiding me. At this point, I'm really confused as to why. Whilst V had a history of being a bit of a shitty friend, M was someone who I thought would always be fair and kind, so it was really upsetting when she began to ignore me, especially when she knew I was having a rough time due to losing V as a close friend. This period of being ignored went on for four days.

After about a week of being ignored by M, it slowly kinda goes back to normal with her. I was really hurt as I never expected her to do something like this, but I didn't ask why she did it as I felt it wouldn't help, and I knew that being patient would work out. I knew she would have her reasons why and I trusted it would be resolved and I would receive answers as to why things happened.

So fast forward, to last week (about six weeks since the whole situation started). M askes if we can chat and I agree. She starts off by apologizing that this conversation took so long to happen, but she's glad she didn't do it sooner as she had only recently realized her reasoning \[as to why she had been ignoring me\] had been wrong, and if it had happened earlier it would have come from anger. She then goes on to explain that she tried to distance herself from me after what happened between V and I, as she was fed up and annoyed by the situation. This, I already had guessed, but I was relieved she apologized nevertheless. She then went on to say that V's issue with J had been a cover to blow things up. Both of them were angry at me because they would and try and help me be happier throughout the year, but it only temporarily helped, and I would be back to being upset days later. M stated she realized they ""didn't help in the right way"", as their way of helping was taking me out for food or out to do things. I told her that it did help, but there was no way they could have every ""fixed my issue"", as that was something I had to work out with myself.

I would say I was upset about 1/5 of the time, and this was apparently draining to the both of them, and V had come to the decision she didn't really want to be friends with me because of this. She had admitted to M that the situation with J was just a reason to blow things up to the point where I would hate her, and it would be my choice to not talk to her.

This is a very brief summary of the story but yeah... it would have been too long. At this point, I'm not upset by V, merely bc she's not the most morally correct person. I am, however, deeply hurt by M. What she did is so unlike her, and I'm so confused bc never did I ever think she could do something like this. I went six weeks without an explanation of why they had both suddenly decided to distance themselves from me, and when I had tried to bring it up, I was hit with an ""It sucks, but you just have to get over it"" from M. Another thing that confuses me at this point, is that since late August I had been the happiest I had been in literally, my whole life. I had resolved all my issues with my roommate and had figured out how to cope with the things out of my control. I met some great people and became comfortable around them quickly (something I have struggled with in the past). I was at my happiest, hadn't cried to V and M for weeks and this apparently was the time to drop a bomb on me? Also, looking back, V was the type of person who never could be happy for the good things that happened to me only. Wanting to go on exchange, going on a trip to Korea, getting a scholarship, making new friends, having a boy be interested in me, were all things that either made me happy or the prospect of made me excited. Every time these things happened, she found a way to make me upset about it. 

There are bits to the story that happened before, and in between, but I didn't think they were so important. What are your guy's thoughts? Am I being overdramatic in how upset and hurt I was by what happened? Also please share how you think I can kinda move on from this? Thank you all in advance :)",03Dec2019,1

739,"So obviously I have some time to think about this because I’m 25, and don’t want kids for another 4-5 years. But my boyfriend and I have been together a couple years now. We plan on marriage and having kids. But I’ve expressed to him my inner turmoil over whether to have biological kids or adopt, and he agrees with me that it’s a tough call.

If I’m purely going on ethics, adoption seems like a no brainer. Honestly this may sound pretty pessimistic but I’d feel pretty guilty forcing a person into existence. Sure, they’ll probably enjoy their childhood, but after that, while there are still of course many joys to be had, their health will only decline, ultimately ending in death, likely with plenty of physical and mental pain on the way. And why force a new person to exist when there are already so many kids in foster care who need parents? 

So it’s an easy choice, right? No. Because I really cannot just decide not to be human and have a STRONG biological drive to have children. I really do feel the drive and desire very strongly. I envision a child who is a combination of myself and my partner, which is such an awesome idea to me. Like, he/she would literally get half their genes from me and the other half from the person I’m in love with. A little ‘love cocktail’ (sorry I know it sounds weird). They will look like us and share some of our personality and mental tendencies. And we will be in control of the pregnancy (no drinking, etc), and we will get to name them, and I actually think I’d enjoy the experience of being pregnant. I fear I wouldn’t love an adopted child as much. I fear we wouldn’t bond enough. I fear they would have some horrible problem and I’d resent them. And so forth. Also, genetically, in a physical sense, my family gets an A+. Longevity in our family with almost everyone living to 90+, and no cancer to speak of. Most just die of old age peacefully (although mental illness does run in the family big time). Plus, this really shouldn’t be influencing me, but I know no one in my family has experience with adoption and honestly, my mom really wouldn’t support me adopting. She would want a grandkid who was blood related. 

Ugh, I really don’t know what I want, and while maybe I shouldn’t be obsessing over this so much, I really feel uncomfortable with the uncertainty. Does anyone have any advice?",03Dec2019,1

* I broke up with him due to him not putting effort into the relationship
* We constantly had periods of going from enemies to friends
* He and his friend exchanged who they have crushes on and he told me who his friend had a crush on
* I said (in the most joking manner possible) that his friend has very bad tastes in boys
* He got offended, and was offended even after clarifying that it was a joke
* He threatens to batter me to big himself up and recover the 'special snowflake' persona he adopted moments ago
* The next day I addressed what he said and said that I was not okay with it
* He said that **I'm** making it hard for us to remain friends
* I refused his bullshit, and said that **he** is the one doing that, and that friends do not threaten one another not **me**.
* I told him that if he wanted to batter me so badly, he should have asked a few years ago when I was a 'doormat'
* He says that he still could batter me if he wanted to
* I yell at him
* Teacher takes me and him into one room to talk things out
* He lies and says that he didn't mean it threateningly
* I decide not to argue
* He has been decreasing in maturity as the days go by, finding more things to be offended by, acting more egotistical, as well as acting like a baby in general
* He feels entitled to be a dick to everybody, such as purposely blanking people when they are telling him to stop being a dick, boasting about his intellect, not respecting boundaries, as well as the added bonus of seeking attention.
* He hasn't always been like this but has become increasingly more difficult to deal with

751,"I live with a family member, currently don't work, and have no funds saved up. I'm at the point where I'd like to move out.

I called the utility companies for some very rough estimates, and also tossed some other estimates in. This isn't an extremely accurate run-down of costs or income, but this is the general idea I came up with so far:

* Get a job anywhere (there's seemingly a dozen places near me always hiring)
* Minimal wage (US) at 5 days a week with 8 hours has total income around $1200/month (not counting overtime or days past 5)
* Work for a month or two and stay in the house I'm at
* Apartments in my area are generally around $400-800, but average around $600 seemingly

So largely assuming that works out how I'm thinking, that'd be about half my money in rent.

* The landlord will probably want a security deposit and first or last months rent up-front initially?
* Electricity usage average was estimated to be at the worst $100/month
* Water usage average will likely be $150/month worst-case
* Food-wise, I can generally get by nicely on $60-70/month
* No car currently and no payments related to one currently; I'd be walking to/from work assuming I get work in-town
* Cell phone is $23/month
* Might get a game subscription for $11/month

With the initial utility turn-ons and rent payment out of the way, I seem to be looking at $800-950 a month, which would at least leave me with about $200/month to do whatever with. Outside of the game sub, I don't really plan on spending much else in my free time, for the foreseeable future anyway.

Assuming that's all right and nothing unexpected happens, I can save most of that up for some months or a few years, and go from there (getting certification, a car, possibly moving, etc).

I've had issues in the past with regards to paying me back/offering to get food occasionally (instead of always me paying) so I wasn't expecting much from them. they're both artistic people so I would have been happy with a handmade card and nothing else.

the day comes and goes and i don't get anything. no card, no singing Happy birthday even. I even ended up paying for food I didn't really want or even ask to go get. it's not like they can't spend anything, same day they spent $100+ on weed.

I'm honestly really hurt and nearly canceled plans the following day. they could tell I was upset but didn't know why.

though it's been a couple days I'm still hung up over it. my concern is bringing it up to be met with excuses or that they have other things happening that's more vital so they didn't think about it. I've been with them in the past when they were getting gifts for their friends birthdays and considering the amount of money I've spent on gifts, food, and activities for us I'm hurt they didn't even get me a card. 

so, would it be worth it to bring it up to them? or should I just let it go and maybe go make some new friends...",03Dec2019,1
758,"Hey guys,

So my SO and I have decided to give gifts, but never decided on a limit. Since it was Cyber Monday yesterday, I cashed out but didn’t realize how much I spent (&lt;~160$). I feel that I spent too much and I’m not sure how to tell her. If I set the limit at 50-100, it’ll make her gift not seem as “valued” as mine. I understand that it’s the thought that counts but I want to have our gifts at equal value to not discourage the other.

Should I tell her to set the limit at $150( which is ALOT), I’m not too sure what to do.

TLDR: spent too much on gift before setting price limit, not sure what to do.

For some context, I'm a US undergraduate studying pure math, now in my fifth semester. I go to a large public univesrity.

I enjoy my math courses so far. They involve [interesting problems](https://xkcd.com/356/) that require a rather analytical approach. It's a logically rigorous discipline on an argumentative level. I am a bit ahead thanks to taking more math courses than recommended and doing well enough in them. On paper, I am set up to pursue graduate school in pure math.

But also, I've always savored my undergrad literature courses. They sought to apply an analytical (as well as nonanalytical) mindset to the specific affairs of fascinating cultures across the world and throughout time. I actually look forward to these classes, partly because underlings like myself can have productive conversations about the content, rather than merely working through exercises for my math classes, like arthritic feet crossing a quagmire. But I know that pursuing a graduate degree in, say, English, will not make me as marketable as one who pursues mathematics likewise, as general statistics online tell me. Nor would my parents approve of this newer pursuit, if I were to do so. 

I'd like a job where I can be creative and generally academic, while not always in extroverted positions. For this reason I have seen and still see myself mostly as an academic in the future. If not, I'd be a librarian or nonfiction writer. 

I don't know anyone else personally in my position. **So I guess I'm seeking advice on here on possible career paths (read: how to get there) given my interests... I feel sort of lost.** (Can't I just do [this](https://xkcd.com/1355/) for a living?)",03Dec2019,1
761,"My whole life i suck badly at waking up in the morning. I can pretty consistently wake up at 6:30 but i really need to push that back to more like 5:30 because when i sleep til 6:30 i dont eat breakfast, do my makeup, etc. plus my 3 year old has to rush as well which she sucks at like most 3 year olds. 

As of now my alarm goes off at 5:30 and I usually start actually gaining coherence and remembering pressing snooze at about 5:50-6ish. According to my boyfriend I snooze all the alarms starting at 5:30 but i literally never remember doing it. If he werent there id assume my phone was malfunctioning and not going off til 5:50. And even then im not really thinking clearly. I dont remember “deciding” to snooze the alarm i just vaguely remember it going off and seeing my phone says 6:05 and i turn it off and immediately fall back to sleep. 

Others have told me to put the alarm somewhere i have to get up to turn it off. The issue with that is i am very dizzy when i first wake up. I have to lay awake for a while and get up slowly and hang on to something til my blood pressure or whatever realizes that were awake now and its time to get with it. I also feel pretty confused until that point where my BP “gets with it” so i wind up jumping up, falling down, and feeling so frazzled by the time i reach the alarm i just turn it off and go lay back down. 

I want to just snooze my alarm like maybe once and get up! But it seems i just physically cant!! I try setting the alarm earlier and earlier and it doesnt work my body still just refuses to wake up until 6:30. I can set my alarm for 4:30 and i still wont start gaining coherence or remember pressing snooze until like 6 and feel ready to get up til 6:30. 
Going to bed earlier than i already do is not going to happen often. 

I have a bachelors in Human Factors so i actually have pretty good knowledge base of sleep cycles and circadian rhythms - i get whats happening here and am not seeking understanding on things like that. I also have known hormonal imbalances and thyroid issues that im sure factor in here, but my doctors have no quick solutions to any of that.

762,"I'll do my best to explain this briefly.

I'm possibly going to get abandoned by my toxic parents , I went through self harm and anorexia , I was an object to physical and verbal bullying , and am now trying to get away from my toxic friends. Yet, I love this school. School is my escape. Specifically, I love learning and teachers. 

They...along with studying and my dream university, are the reasons why I haven't ever attempted committing suicide. I try to preserve a rational mindset on my behalf, paradoxically enough.

Anyways, there's this teacher that's my biggest inspiration.He taught me last year, and I wrote him a thank you letter along with a drawing , also drew him a little card for his birthday this year.
He's always very flattered and somewhat nervous yet surprised whenever he sees me. This one time, he also mentioned me while teaching a class of his.

I trust him a lot. And I appreciate and admire him more than anybody.He's a truly extraordinary person, and I always feel like reaching out to him. Though ,now that he doesn't teach me anymore, I'm scared that if I ever confide in him I'll make him feel awkward and/or make him distance himself from me, and I don't want that.I can't just walk to him randomly and confide like that, can I? Under what consequences does that even go well?

I'm just scared that one day he'll see me quietly burst into tears ,saying something like 'If I ever don't show up anymore, have my goodbye in advance'. I can feel that that will happen. My mom will leave the household, I can't sustain myself properly. I know that I will mindlessly slip something like this if he ever sees me cry and asks me what happened. Quite frankly enough , I want to tell him this. But that ..will be weird of me , wouldn't it?

771,"Thank you in advance if you take the time to offer advice! 

My old boss and I were a successful duo at a startup and I got a great beginning to my career because of her trust and our compatibility. She helped me get promotions, raises, etc. We worked together for 3 years, and she freaked out when I resigned.

Things went sour when she stopped pulling any weight. She barely directed anything I was doing and would collect work from me at the end of each day and present it without me. She spent more time kissing up to new hires that she was threatened by, and I no longer wanted to work with her after about 6 months of that. There were other unrelated reasons that led to me quitting, but her change in attitude was the nail in the coffin.

We haven’t spoken in almost 2 years. I now work at a very corporate company in the same field and I love my work/life balance and all my teammates. However, I dislike the product and the fact that I’m a small fish in a big pond. There is no room for promotions, and I don’t even feel motivated for one if it were a possibility. I basically go through the motions but have a great personal life because its a sweet 9-6 job. The lack of motivation does eat away at me some days.

She reached out to me last week to get together and talk about an opportunity at an established company, where she is able to bring on an associate. I get why she thought of me, and the idea is attractive.

Basically...I have no idea what I should say or do when I see her. I still resent her a little bit for what happened at the end of our working together, but I know I can’t stay at this current company long-term if I want to feel any passion about my career. I know she would REALLY want to work with me, so maybe I’d have room to negotiate more money, more PTO, to maintain the work/life balance I love so much?

And I'm not going to claim my father is actually Hitler running a boot camp, but he's pretty strict. I'm being serious when I say I cannot recall a *single* conversation with him that didn't somehow end up with him tying everything back to my education. ""Focus on school"" ""Graduate university"" ""Get good grades"" Comparing me to my cousin who is six years older and already graduated. Like he has never asked about my day, never talked to me in the car, never talked about how food tastes, just my education or to get his keys. My entire text history with him is just him asking him about my schoolwork, which is one of the biggest problems comes to play, and the whole reason I'm here. My father works at the University I go to. He's head of the IT department, and it's definitely not ideal to go to school and have your dad lurking. But what's worse is when you know your dad isn't letting you mind your own business. My dad uses his personal power of knowing everyone by working there for 30 years to get my financial information and harrasing my teachers constantly asking them how I'm doing in class like I'm still in high school or elementary TO THE DEGREE that one of my teachers actually filled in answers for me not once but twice and the second time he was straight up giving answers when I was the last person in class during a test saying my dad was harrassing him about my grades so if he want reporting back, he better report back good grades. This may sound cool, but he's not sticking his neck out for me, and he's snitched on me ditching his classes. Oh yeah, I'm also in a horrible habit of ditching classes, and, as you can probably guess, he is aware because of just knowing my teachers and being in contact with them. He constantly asks for my schedule and my financial aid info. He even set up a Life360 on my phone! I know it's not relevant to the other things, but just showing how strict he is. 


So, the advice part. My family, and I mean extended family as well, is very education centered. All of my cousins went to top notch universities and graduated with prestigious degrees. I'm going to not as good of a university (yes still the one my dad works at), am on academic probation for failing 3 classes, and I'm pretty sure I've failed two or more classes, putting me on continued academic probation, or perhaps dismissed from the University entirely. I am a complete pussy and would sooner run away or jump off a bridge that tell my dad that news, (just conditioned to believe education is the most important thing in your life while receiving no emotional or really any kind of support from your parents things) I don't want to be in some Holden Caulfield situation trying to make the best on winter break before my parents find out I was expelled, so what should I do?

781,"I don't really know what to do. Sorry for the longish post. 

Last month (Nov), we've only hung out for 2 days, and he hasn't been texting me or calling me starting about mid October. And I mean like, never. I'm always trying to get a hold of him, whether to plan a date or just see how he's doing, and 90% of the time he doesn't answer my calls or texts. I can't even remember the last time he texted me or what it was for. And he never seems to want to hang out with me- I always am the one to ask to hang out with him. The last time he asked to be with me was our first date. Which was mid August.

Whenever I do get a hold of him, he blames it on being busy with work or just being too tired. And I understand how busy he can be working full-time, but... I know he DEFINITELY has time to at least send me a text or call me. I don't even mind if we can't hang out as much as I want to because he's busy, but it hurts so much just not getting any form of attention from him.

The only things that I could think have affected our relationship are- 

1) Near the end of November I was hospitalized at a psychiatric unit for about four days. Self admitted, I let him know that I was going. Maybe he's distant because he's anxious about my mental state? 

2) He's dealing with his own demons, maybe his depression is getting worse and he is isolating himself. 

3) Maybe he's losing feelings for me and I trying to cut himself loose. 

I feel absolutely horrible. When we do hang out, which is rarely nowadays, he doesn't even hold my hand anymore, or cuddle me or anything. I quite literally have to ask him to come cuddle me or hold my hand. I feel like I did something wrong, but I don't know what. I don't think I've been mean or overbearing or anything like that- perhaps a bit clingy but I try to give him his space and personal time. 

Am I being irrational about this? I've been thinking about breaking up with him because he isn't communicating with me at all. I want to try and fix this or give him a chance to fix this but i simply can't get a consistent hold of him. What should I do?",03Dec2019,1

785,"Story: I, a 22/M high functioning on the autism spectrum, met Jessica (36/F) when she was working at a laundromat near my college campus last year. We had a quick romantic relationship that ended in September 2018. Jessica was a former manager at a 7-11, but is a former drug addict and that caused her to lose her job and custody of her two kids. She had asked me to loan her some money during our relationship and I balked. 

After my relationship with Jessica ended, I started to develop a huge fear of getting someone pregnant during subsequent relationships. Even though I never actually had PIV sex or even ejaculated on/near Jessica, I started to get worried I had gotten her pregnant. I (stupidly) got back in contact with her and in August 2019 she got an ultrasound at my request (with me present) to verify she wasn’t pregnant by me. She was struggling financially and in exchange for getting the ultrasound I gave her $300. She was kind to me and understanding of my worries.

A few days after the ultrasound, she messaged me asking for $500 loan and said she’d pay me back and was willing to sign a promissory note. Of course, being the naive person I am, I actually believed her and she came over to my apartment for us to execute the Western Union transaction. At my apartment, we also had a brief sexual encounter which resulted in her giving me a handjob, and I ejaculated on her breasts. At no point during the encounter did my penis ever enter her vagina or even come close. She was even wearing a large panty over her vagina during the encounter if I remember correctly. She went to the bathroom to clean up afterwards. I couldn’t see properly with my glasses off but I believe I remember hearing the sink running. She specifically told me after this encounter “I want to make sure you don’t worry like you have in the past, you’re too young to be worried about pregnancy”. I asked her what she did to wipe the semen off her breasts and she said “I wiped it off with a tissue and washed the rest off with soap and water”.

We got into a subsequent dispute weeks later about her not paying back the loan, and during said dispute I threatened small claims court on her. Obviously I then worried about her falsely accusing me of a heinous sex crime to retaliate so I messaged her “You can keep the $500, just don’t do anything to hurt me”.

She then messaged me a few days later (and 4 weeks since our sexual encounter) saying she was pregnant and needed money for an abortion. She gave me the name of the clinic and said it cost $300 and said that there was a two month wait for an abortion if she didn’t go that day (both of which were false as I did research on the clinic’s website). I responded saying I didn’t believe her and she said she’d send me a picture of the paperwork and also come over later that day to give me the paperwork in person. So I sent her the money. She supposedly texted me from the clinic (I am filling out paperwork, talking to doctor etc, can I have your address again so I can give you the paperwork) but then never followed up. Of course, I knew the whole time that getting pregnant from having semen ejaculated on breasts/upper chest is almost impossible. I then  sent her a very angry message saying I was retaining an attorney etc simply out of anger as I believed I’d been scammed by her. 

I asked her a couple of weeks ago if she’d give me the abortion paperwork for my peace of mind, she said she didn’t have it anymore and was in a bad living situation, but said she could go to the clinic and get her record if she wanted. 

While I am trying to move on mentally from this whole fiasco, I still have worries that 1) She manually took the semen off her chest and inserted it in her vagina in order to purposefully get pregnant (despite her insisting to me over and over again before she got the ultrasound that her tubes were cut, burnt, and tied back in 2010) or 2) The semen somehow snuck all the way down into vagina from her breasts and she is lying about getting an abortion (she previously said she was pro choice but wouldn’t get an abortion herself when we met a year ago). 

How do you all think I should handle this? I am obviously upset at myself for putting myself in such a precarious position and putting trust in her, but also don’t morally believe that I consented to fatherhood by ejaculating on her breasts. I am scared of potentially having to face such a moral dilemma of either walking away and paying child support or changing my life completely to accommodate a kid conceived by deception on her part. I don’t believe I could ever love a kid forced upon me even if my DNA was in it. While I know she may have been lying about pregnancy as a whole, it is hard to get it out of my mind. I am employed with a good job and good company and also grew up well-off so child support would maybe be manageable (but not ideal) but again this whole situation scares me. Does ejaculating on someone’s breasts really create a pregnancy risk????",03Dec2019,1

I'm too old to play with toys. My only hobbies are doing homework and sleeping. I keep trying to tell them that I don't want anything really this Christmas but it makes them sad because they think I'm breaking tradition. Does anyone have any ideas as to what I can ask for? I'm on a budget of about $150.

790,"My best friend has been in an abusive relationship. We live in the apartment complexes next to each other. Her boyfriend just got out of western state, threatened to kill her, etc. she’s staying at my apartment and he stole all her stuff and serves her an EPO so she couldn’t contact him about her stuff being stolen. Last night he came to my apartment and popped her tires but he got the title switched to his name so there’s nothing she can do about her stolen stuff or car. He’s gonna keep doing this stuff and the police have been less than useless. They said she needs to file an EPO, but what good is that gonna do when he already has one? How can the cops tell who’s in violation? I don’t know how to help her get him to stop, it seems there’s nothing we can do. Does anyone have any advice?",03Dec2019,1

As someone who actually enjoys silence and hearing my own thoughts, I find that their music is perpetually encroaching on my personal space and disturbing my carefully-constructed wall of inner peace. Asking them to stop playing it is out of the question, so I am looking for ways to adapt. How do you cope with other people's inane noise? Do you make the effort to block it out using earplugs or headphones, or is there a way you can train yourself to ignore it or tune it out, i.e. stop hearing it?

805,"I've been thinking alot about my passions, my goals, and my current path in life. And I think i'm living the life someone else wants me to live? Some context:

I(19m) am a community college student working towards transferring to a state university by next fall semester. I am majoring in computer science, though i'm not sure what type of field I want to go into (in regards to web development, game dev, software engineering, etc.). Really, my family is the driving force behind my time in college. None of them ever really attended college besides my mom; who flunked out her first semester. I'm in my third, and i'm doing fine. I will certainly be able to transfer when I get my associates. Yet... I feel like i'm wasting my time AND my money. I've taken ONE class related to CS at this point, and there's only a few more to take before I transfer.  Basically, I feel like if I wasn't busy with school, I could teach myself how to code, and get the practice I need under my belt! I have a coding mentor who is essentially self taught, but did attend college. He didn't finish though because he already had job offers coming to him. He's offered to really help me learn what I need to be successful in the field, and he has practical experience. He's not my crutch though, I understand most if not ALL the heavy lifting will be me, and I am perfectly okay with that. 

I'm worried, but I can't tell why. I'm conflicted about whether i'm worried my family will berate me and shun me for ""quitting college"" or if i'm worried that I won't succeed. 

So the advice: With a good work ethic, and with determination, can I be successful out of college? Is there any advice you have on how to communicate my plan with my family without them giving up on me? Should I just stick with it?   
And for clarification: If things don't work out being out of college, I do plan on returning and continuing.

Whenever me and my wife go to visit or go on a family vacation with her family they get possessive of my child (6).  They’re constantly trying to get his attention saying “hey come let me carry you”, “hey I want to show you something”, “hey come sit over here with me” etc. I’ve caught my SIL standing behind me while I was holding him waving to him to get him to come to her instead. We went to a water park recently and SIL and her husband would walk off with him frequently. SIL asked him several times who he loved until he said her and her husbands name. They carry him every where he goes, sit by him everywhere we go, and just try to be in contact with him at all times in general. It reached a point on our most recent visit where me and my wife felt like we didn’t spend any time with our child and actually got into an argument with SIL’s husband about it. I know they have no ill-will towards the situation but their obvious need to be so close to him has made me and my wife uncomfortable.  I’m not sure if there’s a way to tell them to back off without basically removing them completely.

814,"Hi, 

Throughout my childhood, I was fed an unhealthy diet of alternative medicine/scientific beliefs and all round quackery- this ranged from anti-vax to flouride poisoning. And much more- any and every conspiracy under the sun pretty much. You know, how the world's ruling elite is actually made of reptilians and aliens. That is common knowledge righ... 

Over the past few years, I have come to distance myself completely from most of this stuff and have embraced factually correct information. This has led to 2 consequences:

1. Embarrassment. I feel really stupid about ever believing these things and trying to convince others about their validity. Clearly not big brain time here.

2. Friction with my parents. Far bigger consequence than the previous one. The thing is, I love my parents. I get on very well with them and trust them with most things; they have been great parents and the most important people to me. However, they are very stuck up in their beliefs and refuse to entertain other any stray beliefs. I've found that they cannot back up any of their beliefs with science and resort to threats instead. They've believed these things for so long that they are now truths to them. Of course, they think that  I've been brainwashed by some propaganda. Lately, these contrasting beliefs have led to a lot of friction and unpleasantness. I try to keep my beliefs to myself and instead talk to my parents about other things, however being 17 (teenage rebellion and all that) I find it hard to keep completely silent when they about climate change being a hoax and all the rest of it. 


What can I do now? I don't want this hostility. No one really is as important to me as my parents.

815,"I'm sorry if the title is confusing, but I'll explain everything to the best of my ability and with complete honestly.



My mother and father got separated a month ago, and we moved back to our hometown. My mother can't work properly, she has fibromyalgia and epilepsy, and the closest thing to work she can do, is something to do at home. It's my mother, me, and my 3 other siblings.

Total rent is around $1400 per month, and I have agreed with her to pay the expenses such as the water bill, electricity, and wifi (which all together is around $400) and my mother has agreed to pay the main house rent (which is 1000). 

Here's where my issue comes in.

It's been very hard for me (18m, almost 19) to accept my parents speration and soon to be divorce. I understand that my mother cannot pay for all the bills here. On top of that, everyone needs a mouth to feed and in reality I'm 99% positive that financially they wouldn't be too successful without me contributing to the rent and some groceries.

However despite that, my mother isn't allowing me to live my life. I work 8 hour shifts 4 days a week, and really value my off days. When I want to go to bed when I want, I want to go to bed when I want. If I wanna sleep in until 3pm, I should be able to do that. If I want to go out with friends, or go to a party, I should be able to do that.

I'm pretty sure that paying nearly 500 in expenses is more than enough for me to do what I'd like. I find it unfair that I've been basically forced into this. I don't want to move out because I cannot support myself, but I also do not want to have the rest of my family go without.

I'm very conflicted at this moment. 

Simple things such as going out for a drive or something, I still have a cerfew and I still have rules and shit. Basic things such as a friend picking me up, I cannot do because mom doesn't like them, or I have to babysit.

I'm starting college soon as well, so I wonder how that will go.

That's basically the main issue right now. I don't know what to do. If I sat on my ass all day and had no job or payed no bills, I could understand my mom's reasoning. But this is ridiculous. I'm supposed to be living my life and figuring my own shit out, and I'm simply not. If anyone could point me in the right direction, I'd greatly appreciate that.",03Dec2019,1
816,"Okay, really long story but I promise it is all necessary, and will probably give you your weekly dose of drama. 

Let me start of saying that I have always struggled with depression and anxiety stemming from OCD. I have been through therapy though, I was able to break almost all of my detrimental compulsions, and I actually kind of like the few that I have left. The tactics my therapist taught me paired with my left over compulsions makes me the kind of person who deals with issues head on and swiftly, and I own my mistakes. 

I recently relocated to a very small town for a job. I had just gotten out of a serious but harmful relationship and this seemed like a great opportunity to get a way and get experience in my field. I don’t know anyone here. My nearest friend is about 4 hours away. Let me start of saying that I have loved my job so far. I know that I cannot stay here forever because I need more society around me, but after starting here I decided that I would at least try to give it a few years. It is a small town and everyone here is very connected. I am definitely the odd man (woman) out. When I moved here I made 2 friends. One moved away because she couldn’t stand the lifestyle and the other is a coworker who has now blocked me. 

I made the bad decision of having a romantic relationship with my coworker (D.) D seemed like a really genuine guy, steady, good head on his shoulders. Basically the exact opposite of my ex. We were never officially dating but we were spending A LOT of time together, we were spending multiple nights a week at each other’s places, talking on the phone on nights we weren’t spending together, etc. this went on for about 2 months. We did have a few hiccups, but it was mostly comfortable and easy being with him. Then one day we had a really nice day together, it definitely felt more serious than it had been up to that point, he stayed the night at my place, and that is pretty much the last time we saw each other outside of work. (Also, 95% of our communications were over text after this, so I was able to check that I am not misremembering things.)

The next day I got a text from my ex admitting to a lot of the crap that he pulled and apologizing. 

*back story on my ex: When we got together he was fresh out of a 7 year long relationship with a woman who is definitely manipulative and emotionally abusive. She spent a lot of time harassing me during the relationship which caused tension with my ex and I. Our relationship ended when I found out that he had been lying to me about seeing and talking to her.*

So I get that message out of the blue and I respond saying that I appreciate the apology and asking if things are okay. I almost immediately started getting fb messages from her saying nasty stuff to me and I could tell from what she was saying that she saw my message so she must have been with him. She had done this a lot and I almost never responded in the past but this time I figured that I didn’t owe it to him anymore to put up with her bs. So I responded with a nasty message of my own basically offloading everything and telling her that she is a mother and a professional and she needs to start acting like it and not like a high school mean girl. (This woman is in her mid 40s, I am 26, my ex is 33.) I sent that message and blocked her figuring my ex deserved to deal with the fall out. She then started texting me from his phone. Apparently all of this was happening while he was in the bathroom, he stopped her when he got back. I told him to never pull me into her drama again and that if he couldn’t manage that then I would have to cut him out completely again. 

The whole thing had me really shaken and she had said some things that really hurt me. I was in a really upset state and asked D to call me, looking for sympathy. He had always encouraged me to talk to him about shit with my ex, so I didn’t really think anything of it. He called me almost as soon as I sent the message but sounded really stand offish after I explained it to him and basically said that it sounded like something that I needed to sort out with my ex. 

The next day he barely responded to my messages, and then the day after that he stopped responding completely. Then when he did message me it was a really long text about how things were feeling serious and he didn’t have time for that (fair.) How I wasn’t over my ex (partially fair.) and how I was getting certain feelings and he thought that it was too soon for me (totally not fair, all assumptions that we had never discussed.) Basically he was saying that we should step back and stop seeing each other “for a while.” 

I got pretty pissed, I figured that we had gotten to the point where I deserved a face to face. And we are co workers so it’s not like we can just never see each other again. I was a bit snarky and almost completely ignored him for a couple days. He sent me a message basically saying that he had thought that we had at least been friends and that it kinda sucked of me to not want to hang out with him anymore, and a bunch of other guilting things that were actually valid. I told him that I was open to being his friend and even still having sex, but that I was confused because that’s basically what we were already doing, and that my feelings were hurt. He suggested that we should talk, and I resisted at first but he convinced me. I was also beginning to feel depression creeping in on me and thought that I really couldn’t afford to lose my one friend in the area, which I told him about. 

Shortly after this I started feeling anxiety at work whenever he was there (he only works in my building for the second half of the day.) The anxiety was getting in the way of my productivity and also just isn’t pleasant. Anxiety with OCD is all about exaggerated worst case scenarios and being unable to think of anything else. 

This is where my coping tactics come into play. If you remove the possibility for the worst case, the anxiety goes with it. This can be difficult when there are other people involved though, because people are not totally predictable. Whenever I have issues like this with people I am supposed to meet with them in person to resolve things (unless it would be better to just cut them out, if D wasn’t my coworker I would have just lost his number and moved on.) The reason for this is it is easier to read people in person leaving no room for doubt after the fact and most of the time after the conversation I find out that my anxiety is unfounded. I have had to do this with coworkers before, it is usually not a big deal and can actually really improve your relationship with someone that you don’t like working with. I have never had someone deny my request to do this, and I have never had a negative outcome from these types of meetings. 

Good news was, D had already suggested we talk, so we just had to do it. I told him that I thought that we needed to meet soon, if he wanted to be friends then we needed to figure out what that actually looked like, if he wanted to keep having sex we needed to establish boundaries, and we needed boundaries at work too. My anxiety was getting worse and worse each day and I was really beginning to feel the pressure, he would do things at work that upset me or made me uncomfortable and it only reinforced me belief that we needed to have a discussion. When I would express my feelings to friends, they all also said that I needed to sit down with him. 

Problem was D was really busy and kept pushing back us meeting. I was texting him about some of the stuff I was feeling and his responses sometimes temporarily alleviated the anxiety but other times made it worse. This is part of the OCD circle, the anxiety constantly comes back stronger the longer you avoid dealing with it. I knew that my reactions weren’t always totally in line, but D also eventually managed to convince me that my feelings were unfounded and that I was being crazy. Because of my issues with depression and anxiety I was inclined to believe him. Looking back on those messages now I can see that I was valid in my feelings. He was constantly changing his mind, saying one thing then acting another way, I wasn’t wrong to be confused and disoriented, and he treated my confusion as me being in the wrong or misunderstanding obvious things. After weeks of that treatment I did go a bit crazy, but blamed myself and not him. 

I stopped talking to my friends out of embarrassment and spent weeks totally alone. I was falling into a deep depression. Work should have been a reprieve from the loneliness, but I was so anxious at work. Eventually the anxiety started to mess with my sleeping and I started having panic attacks regularly waking me up. I haven’t had a full night’s sleep in weeks except for the occasions when my body totally crashes. I kept telling myself to hold out for D to finish the course he was taking, then we could talk and everything would be better. 

Then he finished his course, he actually finished early because his instructor excused him from the final. He came to me after work on a Friday and told me this. We talked about him coming over that night, it seemed like he was going to but he didn’t he went to his best friend’s (T) house for a bit then went home, he said maybe the next day. 

So I texted him Saturday asking what was up. He had plans to go to another friend’s house to watch a fight. I told him that I like fights (I really do) but he implied that it was just a couple of guys. I reminded him that I know no one and that he had promised multiple times to invite me to stuff to meet people. He said that he got it and he agreed that I really need other friends and this community is impossible to break into without an in. He also reiterated to me that we were not in a relationship (he did this A LOT) and I kinda snapped on him and told him that he seemed far more concerned with that than I was and that he needed to stop making assumptions about me and my wants without asking (something else he did a lot.)

He stopped texting me early in the afternoon so I was in for a long day of absolutely no contact with anyone. I didn’t send him a bunch of text messages during that time. I sent him one asking how things were going, which he never responded to, and then another one hours later joking that I would f*ck off then (what it really meant was I was going to bed.)

I was woken up by a bunch of texts from D. He was obviously drunk, and it was obvious that he had been at a party. He was pissed because he had misread my last message and thought that I was telling him to fuck off. He told me to not worry because he hadn’t hit on any of the numerous women there, but he also told me that it was because they all had boyfriends and husbands, so idk what he was getting at there. I responded to him telling him that A) it was really none of my business who he hit on since we are just friends, and B) thanked him for making me feel like shit for spending my Saturday night alone while there was a party going on with people I sorta know that my one friend didn’t invite me to. 

The next morning he sent me an apology message but it wasn’t a real apology. It was basically a lot of “I am sorry that YOU feel that way” without taking any actual responsibility. He then told me that he had thought to invite me when he found out women were going, but decided (read:assumed) that it wasn’t my scene. I also found out that T had gone with his wife. I have hung out with the two of them a few times. I like them a lot. They both work with us, though T’s wife works in another building. I have told D that I really like her and would like to be friends with her. 

This whole thing really got to me. The depression totally crushed me. I lost it. I was able to get a grip on myself during the day but as soon as night fell I had a total break down. I tried to see D, I reached out to him for help, tried to explain what was happening but I could tell that he wasn’t getting it. He and I always misread each other’s messages and I could tell that he wasn’t taking me seriously. 

I felt like I was being crushed. Totally hopeless. I ended up punching my counter top and I thought that I broke my hand. I sent him a message saying that, and he blocked me. Luckily I didn’t see that because I didn’t text him again. The pain actually distracted me and helped me get my head on. I texted my boss telling him I needed a sick day (I still wasn’t sure if my hand was broken.) I fell asleep and woke up a few hours later calmer. I sent D a text apologizing, and doing a better job explaining the depression. It was then that I realized that I was blocked. 

The next morning (Monday) I texted T, he had been really helpful to me previously with issues at work and I knew that he had some of his own issues with anxiety so I thought that he could help. I explained why I wasn’t at work and he was honestly really helpful. He made me feel far less embarrassed (I still was some, but less.) He leveled with me about his own struggles with his mental health and really made me feel like he got it. He basically told me that he was there to talk, and he would help me with the paperwork if I decided to get services through our work. 

Then D called me. He basically apologized in his half assed way and said that he didn’t know what to do so he had blocked me. I told him that I got but basically pointed out that I was obviously having a huge crisis and that it’s troubling that his response to “being afraid for my safety” was to block me. (Note: I do know that it isn’t his job to help me with that stuff, but he does present himself as an advocate and an ally, so I wasn’t totally coming out of no where with that.) He offered to come talk to me during a break at work, at first I said no but later agreed. He also unblocked me. 

When he came over I told him that I wasn’t in a place to have THE talk, but I wanted to explain to him what happened. Which I did, his response was to say that I needed to ask for help at times like that. I pointed out that I had, and he admitted that the had misread things. He encouraged me to keep talking to T about things because T is a great source for advice and he has been through the same stuff as me. I told D that I would, but there was still stuff that just needed to be resolved between the two of us. He agreed but said that he was getting into another busy period, and I pointed out that I had known that and had tried that past weekend. He apologized to me for the weekend, and since it was in person and we couldn’t misread each other, those feelings actually were resolved. This reinforced my belief that D and I needed to have that conversation. He said that we would that week. I told him not to start brushing me off again and he promised he wouldn’t. 

Through out the whole conversation he had his hands all over me. Eventually he had his hands under my shorts and shirt. He also kept moving his face very close to mine, and he kept rubbing himself against me. I hadn’t intended to do anything with him, but after weeks of literally not talking to a single person outside of work it felt nice to have a person there and I was honestly a bit touch starved. So I did kiss him. We made out for a bit, and it was really intense. But he said something about “we shouldn’t do this.” and I have boundaries even if he doesn’t. So I stopped and I separated from him. He seemed a bit surprised but didn’t try to start up again. I pointed out that he should get back to work and he left. But first he mentioned that we were friends only, there would be no relationship. So I grabbed his face and I said “I am going to say this very plainly, and I want you to actually hear me. D, I. Do. Not. Want. A. Relationship. With. You. Please, stop making assumptions about me. That is what keeps getting us into messes.” He said that he got it and then left. 

When I got back to work, things were ok. I tried to schedule our talk but he totally deflected me and suggested that I talk to T. I told him that I would but we still need to talk. He canceled one of our work meetings so that we could have the talk saying that the talk was more important. Awesome. For the first time in weeks I was feeling stress free. I had a very productive day. Then it came time for us to meet and he blew me off last minute saying that he was super worn out from this other thing. I told him that I got it but he needed to make it work soon, I wouldn’t put up with him doing this whole blowing me off thing all over again. This was Wednesday. 

That weekend I actually had plans to go visit a friend hours away who had broken his ribs. D knew about this. He came by at the end of the work day Friday to ask about my weekend plans. I was hoping that he was going to say that he had time for our talk but no such luck. He instead made a joke about if I was going to have sex with the friend I was visiting. I said no, and pointed out that even though it wasn’t his business the friend has broken ribs. Then D made a comment that I could probably find a way to make it work and that I probably should sleep with this guy. I told him that he wasn’t allowed to make those kinds of jokes to me. He said that he was going to leave because he had made things awkward, then on his way out the door he mentioned that he hadn’t been with anyone else either?!?! So I told him that I really didn’t care and he said that he didn’t even know why he brought it up.

After he left I thought about it and decided F it. We need to establish boundaries now. At this point I didn’t care about having any sort of non work relationship with him but decided that I was done feeling uncomfortable at work because of him. I texted him saying this, and basically saying that if I was any plain coworker saying that I wanted a meeting because of work issues he would have made time for it but just because we used to have sex he can’t decide to blow me off. 

He said that there would be no talk and he was done. That was that. I raged at him a bit. He told me to have a nice weekend. I responded saying that if he wouldn’t meet with me I was going to text T because I can’t keep having so much anxiety around him and work. It was killing me. When I sent that message I saw that he blocked me. 

I hadn’t talked to T about my anxiety at this point, even though T had offered to help and D had been pushing me to talk to him. I thought that it would be weird since D is T’s best friend. I also didn’t see the point as I have had these issues before and always been able to resolve them before. But no one had ever just straight up refused like D did (and it had been his idea in the first place!!!) So I texted T. I basically told him that I was having issues at work because of D. I had tried to resolve them with him but he refused so I needed advice. And, that I would totally get it if T didn’t want to get involved. T blocked me too. I double checked my messages, both T and D had said that I should go to T for advice multiple times. So I don’t think that I was out of line. My message may have come off as b*tchy though I was going for direct and to the point. 

So now I am blocked by 2 coworkers. I am not really sure how to deal with things. And now I have anxiety all day long because both T and D are there. Not to mention that I am terribly lonely, so I was also blocked by my only friends here. Too be fair I was blowing up D’s phone with messages both times he blocked me. But I feel like that might be justified? I am still blocked by both of them and have been for over a week. I don’t know what to do to resolve the fact that I have obviously made 2 people at work uncomfortable, I myself am suffering at work, and I am scared of being the talk of a small town.",03Dec2019,1
817,"Hi everyone

Apologies in advance if this ends up as a weird ass ramble. I feel like I'm wasting people's time but hopefully i might get some help.

Long story short, Im 16 and i dont have a clue what i want to do with my life. I know i shouldnt have to make any decisions now, but i don't want to waste time on the wrong courses and unfortunately am somewhat limited by the academic year etc. I'm in year 12 and taking maths, chemistry and biology.

The past couple of months I've begun to struggle quite badly with anxiety and depression. My self esteem is at an all time low, I'm not motivated at all to study my subjects as i just do not care about them. However, I can't work out whether depression has made me lose interest, or whether  the situation I'm in has led to me feeling depressed. I've gone from having short days doing a range of subjects with close friends around me all the time, to long days away from home, doing a very limited curriculum, and being away from my friends, but surrounded by giddy, loud people that annoy the hell out of me and make me feel jealous and even lonely as i'm so unhappy.  I also think the fact that its dark so early is contributing to possible SAD.

I'm academically very strong, and non-depressed me enjoys a lot of different subjects. I really enjoy maths and would enjoy taking further maths, but i am also struggling with not having any creative subjects. In my free time i used to do a lot of art, sewing and piano, but now i dont have the energy or will to do anything that balances out the STEM studying.

I just feel like im failing and wasting time, as well as worrying about uni applications and future employability - my social skills have already led me to lose out on opportunities before.

I know something isnt right, but im scared to change anything incase i make the wrong choice and regret it. My brain is telling me im overthinking, but I've ended up resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms so something needs to change

My mum is reassuring me that she'll help me get to where i need to be, i just don't know what i want in the first place.",03Dec2019,1
818,"The other night, me and my gf were hanging out. We were laying in her bed, and my penis was in a very uncomfortable position. I moved it and can’t remember if it was my right or left hand. We were spooning, so I don’t know if there was any precum on it. Around 30 mins later, I began to finger her, making sure I wiped my fingertips off on her stomach first. It wasn’t until later that the thought occurred to me of getting precum on my finger from adjusting my penis, and putting it in her vagina. She ovulates in 2 days, so three days from the incident. How likely is it that she got pregnant from this? 

I understand if this sounds very dumb, but I suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder and it’s a little bit of a struggle for me. Any advice would be much appreciated",03Dec2019,1

821,"Hi everyone, first time posting on here and I’m hoping someone might have some helpful tips.
Me and my boyfriend have been together for just over two years now, everything’s still going really well and I have no doubts for our relationship, marriage has been discussed as a definite in our future - but recently my partner has been getting super broody.

He keeps pushing for us to try and have a baby, and no matter what I say in response I can’t convince him it isn’t a good idea for us yet, but definitely in the future. This isn’t a good enough answer for him and he isn’t happy I’m not open to it.
Some background, I’m 22 and he’s 26, we both still live at home with our families, and whilst I’ve nearly saved up for a deposit to buy a house, he hasn’t saved anything up yet.
I’ve always said if we want to have a baby we need to have our names on a mortgage and be financially prepared, but recently his mind has changed to baby now, house later - not even renting, but living with mine or his parents.

Our parents are great, but they have finished with that part of their lives and I’m not prepared to live with them and force a baby on them even if I wanted one at the minute.

I’ve tried to explain as soon as the house is sorted we will have one, but he isn’t willing to stop us travelling or living how we do to save money. 

Just an extra, we both work 12 hour shifts, I want to train to be an EMT before I even think about having a baby, and having one now would pretty much rule that career out. In my current position this would take around 3-5 years.

How can I explain properly to him that it’s not the right time - I don’t feel like I’m being selfish wanting to get my life on track before derailing it with an infant. Is there a better way to explain rather than continuously shooting him down?

TL;DR
26yo Boyfriend wants a baby with me (22yo gf), I’m not ready due to age/finance/living with parents. How do I explain that it isn’t the right time with him being stubborn that it is?",03Dec2019,1
822,"I was 19, and I was drunk. We were going to pride, but I asked to be taken home. Everyone else stayed at pride while my cousins boyfriend took me back. He took me to their apartment. And raped me. He left back to pride. And when they got home afterwards my cousin asked him to take me home. And I was afraid to say anything for this long. I told my roommate, sister &amp; mother about it that night when I got home and was more sober. I guess no one called about it because I was under the influence at 19 years old, and I was afraid of the repercussions from that as well. I see him at family events all year, every year. 
I told my cousin about this recently, and she didn’t believe me because I waited too long to tell her.
I’m going to my birthday dinner in a few hours, and they will be there. 
What can possibly be done about this?
I feel like I’ve waited too long to gain the courage to say anything.

823,"I don't know where to start. I don't know how to ask for advice on this. I want to give so many details and so few details at the same time.

I just came out of a breakup a couple months prior to meeting her. We discovered we had common interests and talked for a good amount of time the first time we met. Needless to say, I was smitten by her. Please note that this was when I was still immature and distraught from the breakup. I also want to add that *I came from a conservative community and am now studying in a liberal-minded community where the things I considered taboo were almost normal and commonplace.*

Soon, she told me a bit about her recent abusive past. That's when I decided that I want to help her.

During the first few weeks of college, I took the opportunity to socialize and build a social circle, and included her in it.

**This was my first mistake: I hobbled together a social circle for her - this was a mistake because I accomplished this intentionally and hurriedly.**

The social circle was fluorishing, and my friend and I got close. We opened up to each other a bit more, and I learnt that her past was darker than I've thought. The darkness of her past made me want to be a better friend to her, and made me like her even more.

The social circle we had made me feel secure. The friends I've made helped me reframe my mind; my friend in particular offered her own philosophies which I found fascinating, and gave advice about a lot of stuff. Overtime I realized that I am not yet ready for a relationship, and I realized that she and I can't be together because both of us were unstable. I've accepted the fact that we can, at best, be close friends, but that didn't dull my feelings towards her.

**I made another mistake during this period: I openly admitted my feelings to her.** She seemed pretty fine with it though.

I've just realized this recently; I feel that I share a bond with people I open up to, and especially with those who open up to me. I guess that's the root behind my attachment issues.

Anyway, things were pretty normal until I had a falling out with one of my close friends (a girl) in the circle due to me making her feel insignificant and uncomfortable - I wasn't being a good friend towards her.

Because of this, I was afraid that the same thing will turn out between me and the friend in question. I did my best to make her feel that I cared, that I was thinking about her. I wanted to make her feel belonged, significant. By then, even though I still had feelings for her (then fading), I've already resolved with being a good friend to her. Besides, she told me I wasn't her type, and I respected that - I'm perfectly alright with being a friend to her - a good one. I feel empathy (or was it merely sympathy all this time...?) towards her past, and I didn't want her to experience anything just as bad as it was. **This was, I suppose, the fatal mistake that I've made: I tried too hard with being friends with her without even considering her past.**

*I want to clarify that these were my intentions: To be a good friend to her, to prevent another falling out from happening, and to be a support system for her.*

Soon after, she began avoiding me. She now questions my intentions and",03Dec2019,1

826,"My sister was diagnosed with cancer nearly 5 years ago. She has had so many back and forth a in her treatment. I hate what it’s doing to her but she also doesn’t take care of herself the way she ought to. (For example, her cervical cancer went away but reappeared in her lungs about two years ago. She had actively been vaping since the initial diagnosis, and her husband smokes in the house) 

I know it’s wrong to feel this way but for 5 years I haven’t felt free to live my life the way I want. I feel guilty over good things in my life because she can’t have the same experiences. It also seems that right before/after I have any major positive life event, she has some kind of crisis. I know she can’t help it; but I’m starting to be resentful.

827,"Okay so I'm a 21-year-old with severe abandonement issues. Have a dead-beat dad who left us when I was like 6-7 who I hated my entire life. 

Some 9 months ago my closest family (aunts and uncle) semi-kicked me out of their flat I lived in because of college (live in student housing rn). I apologized and acknowledged on several occasions what I did wrong and asked for forgiveness but basically they said ""We """"""forgive"""""" you but you're an adult now. You need to survive on your own. We can't help you anymore."". And then never spoke to me again. There would be family get-togethers with all my cousins and my sister literally 10 kms away from where I live and I would be excluded and uninvited. My uncle lied to acquaintances that he lost my number so that's why he hadnt spoken to me for a while. All this got me to a dark place and really depressed for a while. And it still does, but for a while I found some distraction with friends. 

However now my best friend turned cold to me too and I just don't know how to cope with that too. I've been going to work on like automatic pilot mode and been sleeping any remaining hour there is. It's really unhealthy but I just don't know what to do anymore. 

I'm just not the kind of guy who likes puts up a story saying ""sad ☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️"" or something seeking for attention so I usually just internalize my feelings. But at this point I'm just kinda at my wit's end.

828,"Wife of 3 months (together 6 years, we have a 2 year old) and I had a huge blowout fight. Our blowouts involve saying the meanest shit we can thing of to hurt the other person. One thing I would never say is that a cheated due to her trust issues stemming from her mom cheating on her dad which destroyed her dad. So, like a moron, I told her I cheated (I didn’t). We were both wasted. She had an instant breakdown, to the point of throwing up. We finally passed out. Woke up and I apologized and explained I made it up to hurt her. She was clearly still very angry but we were making up. 

This is part two:
So we have that history of blowout fights. During these times she usually takes off and I’m at home with our child. After I put my child to bed I start drinking. Too much. And I enter a bad mental state where I assume she’s out cheating on me. So I do things to “even the score”. Petty shit. Liking a hot girls photo on Instagram. One time I messaged an ex on Facebook. And she always found out because she would look through my stuff. And we got through it. Then at some point I downloaded two dating apps. But i never made a profile. I totally forgot about them. So, after making up from me telling I cheated (I didn’t) she wanted to see my phone to see if I was up to no good. I gave it to her because I had nothing to hide. Then she found those dating apps I completely forgot about. Thing was, they weren’t opened to active profiles because I never made any. So she knows I wasn’t actively on these apps trying to cheat. But it’s still fucked up. And I feel like shit. I’ve never cheated on her. We’re just complicated. She’s obviously pissed. Very hurt. Wants to live out. Going through periods where she seems a little
More receptive to working it out and times where she is adamant we’re done and she’s moving. And it’s Christmas and my child just deserves a normal holiday. I feel horrible. I can’t eat.

Now I’m almost 18 and it’s been a good while since I last smoked about maybe a year and a half, I don’t plan on going back to it. I have an addictive personality so it didn’t take long for me to develop a mental dependence/addiction. It was so bad that if I went a day without smoking I’d get like mental withdrawal symptoms like anxiety, irritability and paranoia. The thing is I know they’re probably gonna find out because when I was quitting I made the mistake of asking my mom to help. She decided to “help” me by signing me onto an addiction center. Wasn’t rehab but I had to go to a substance abuse counselor, kind of like therapy almost exploring why I used in the first place. Was actually pretty great for me cause it did help me a good bit while I was process of quitting. Now the reason why this might be an issue is because it’s on my medical record which makes there’s a pretty good chance that the doctor at MEPs will find out. I’ve done research and from what I can tell it’s not very hard to get a waiver for this kind of thing, I don’t have a criminal record or anything, but the thing is I smoked A LOT so I’m not sure if that’ll affect it.

833,"Hey all,

So my problem is basically I think I’m an alcoholic. What I mean by ‘I think’ is that I legitimately do not know wether I am or not. 

I drink every weekend by myself as I’m a big fan of combat sports which are on in some form every weekend. 

I like to have a few drinks when I watch them but nothing too excessive. Just a 4 pack of beers or a few whiskeys.

The reason I am posting here is because recently I have been off work with the flu &amp; a chest infection (roughly about 13 days so far) and I have only drank once since being absent. But recently my mum &amp; sister have confronted me &amp; said they are worried about me because of my alcohol consumption even though I know I clearly know I don’t consume as much as they think.

My mum has admitted to me that she is worried because my dad (which I haven’t been in contact with for about 7 years now) was an alcoholic himself and she’s scared that’s it’s hereditary (which understandably it is...) but I really don’t drink excessively and never had.

What should I do? Tell her that I like a drink every now and again when the fights are on or just keep it quiet?

Some background information, I have never known what I've wanted to do. That seems normal for most of us now days. I have had many dreams the past few years, and many new dreams have appeared. Learning Guitar, Bass, Piano, Dancing, Singing, Creating Music, Makeup Artisty, Drawing, Painting, Learning Japanese, Learning Korean, Writing. I have attempted all of these things in the past two years. I keep trying to make plans for learning. The only thing that comes easy for me is sitting down and planning, but the plans never work. Of course.   


I wonder what makes me freeze. I see my future self doing these things, and these are things I want for myself, so why am I so frozen as to begin / continue them? I wonder if I am too comfortable to make a move? Too comfortable to change? How can I become uncomfortable, how can I better push myself?  


Dreaming, thinking I want something so badly, but nothing ever happens. Stuck in a cycle of starting and stopping. Planning but not executing.  


For those of you who have been here / are here. What pushes you though? What kicks you off your butt to change, to do?  


Thank you.",03Dec2019,1
847,"I have OCD and I really like to stay clean.  That's not necessarily my main or only obsession, but I seem to track germs like with my mind, ya know?  I always wash my hands, basically every time I walk in the door.  Whether I just had a cigarette, or I was just picking up leaves, or cleaning cat litter in the garage.  If I went anywhere public, especially stores and touched doors where I know hundreds of people have touched.  The gym is a massive germ fest for me, I go daily and I refuse to sit or touch anything inside the house with the clothes I wore.  I shower immediately, I enjoy staying clean.  I think it mainly stems from a fear of getting sick, I got a bad stomach bug when I was a child where I literally couldn't catch my breath from vomiting and I actually thought I was going to die.  Talking like 30 minutes of non stop vomit, was terrifying.  I was already a germaphobe before then, like scrub every pen and pencil, notebook spiral with vinegar after every day of school.  But that stomach bug added an additional fear of pain.

So Im 19 now, been spending majority of 2019 12 hours away from my home, where I grew up.  My GPA passed, and Im trying to help my GMA out.  Her health unfortunately seems to be in decline.  :(. So Im just here trying to help out

I am really bothered though, by her lack of hygiene.  I don't know if its just my incredibly high standards, or if your average non-mentally ill Joe would find it kind of gross too.   Basically I just want some insight, am I being unrealistic?  Also keep in mind I am mentally ill, I genuinely have stress because of these things.

She goes to dialysis three times a week, in fact she just got home about an hour ago.  I notice she never washes her hands when she comes back from the store, dialysis, or anywhere.  I can't help but think about everything she's touched, and what she's bringing back home.  She spends hours at the store.  I find myself disinfecting light switches, TV remotes, door handles, etc quite often.  Just out of fear of what she's not cleaning off her skin.  I know she just sat at a doctors office, next to many other elderly and possibly sick people.  For hours she sits there, coughing a smokers phlegmy cough into her hands.  (That's another huge pet peeve of mine, she doesn't cover her mouth when she coughs or sneezes, she just lets that shit free fall into the air.  She only covers her mouth when theres somebody in the room, who isn't me... and even then, when she covers her mouth, she uses the palm of her hand... then doesn't wash her hands for like 12 hours.. drives me fucking nuts!)

She's a fan of cooking, she's off the boat from Sicily and we're all Italians and we love to eat.  She makes delicious home cooked food.  BUT bruh, she don't wash her hands!! Ever!  She'll go from laying on the couch for 10 hours, touching the remote, coughing into her hand, etc, straight to man handling raw meat, vegetables, lettuce, chicken, everything.  Everything I eat, is likely covered in her germs.  Guys, this is truly a stressful thing for me.  She's an incredible cook, and I love to eat, it would break her heart if I didn't eat anything she made.  Since my GPA died, she never smiles or laughs.  When she's not taking out her anger on me for nothing, I try and make her feel even the tiniest bit of joy.  One of the only things there is to do, is compliment her food.  It's a genuine compliment, don't get me wrong.  ITs amazing food, but I can't help but think about all the germs. 

This is especially on my mind today, because I woke up with a sore throat.  I never get sick, I take really good care of myself.  Eat properly, exercise, and take vitamins.  Aside from my smoking (which I've cut down to just a few a day) which Im not proud of and please don't roast me for it.  It's just one vice.  She really can't be getting sick either, she's not in the greatest of shape and she needs to stay healthy.  I don't even like to sit on the couch that she lays on, I know it's fucking littered with germs.  She hasn't washed the blanket she uses in at least a year, and she's laying there right now in her doctor's office clothes.  

The worst part is that we just put a down payment on a house that will fit me, my mother, and my GMA.  So as of some time next year, she'll be living with us full time.  It's going to be a terribly hard adjustment, I love her whole heartedly I truly do, but Im a queer, OCD, germaphobe.  She's a MAGA, wishes it were the 40s again, never washes her hands type of person.  I really enjoy my home, because it's the only place I really feel comfortable.  It's the only place I feel like I can be myself, I really miss my home.  I haven't been there since a few months now, and just the thought that Im going to have to live in this situation full time really makes me uncomfortable.  Maybe Im an asshole, I love her so much and I don't put up a fight, I never say cover your mouth or wash your hands.  She hates me enough for being a queer who doesn't like Trump.  Not sure what To do, just want to be alone, but I gave all my savings to Moms for the house and now I can't afford to live on my own.  Just sad I guess. sorry for rant",03Dec2019,1

849,"Okay backstory. I apologize it's kinda long. I grew up in New Jersey and decided to move to South Carolina with my fiance to be closer to his family. We moved here about a year ago and we moved in with his brother so rent would be split and it would be easier for me since I'm a teacher and don't make that much. 

My fiance's brother's job involves traveling from time to time and for the first half of the year he was hardly ever home. That was fine for me because I never saw him enough to develop any issues and my apartment was never disgusting. The occasional mess yeah but not anything that requires more then 10 minutes of straightening. 

Well  guess what...fork me sideways with a chainsaw because fiance's brother  hasn't been deployed for his job since early September. He has been home for damn near four months and I hate it. Like I work all day with kids and my fiance works all day as an engineer. Every day we come home and his brother is just sitting on the couch playing video games and being lazy. 

He boasts all the time about how ""all I did today was sit on this couch"" and at first I was like yeah that's cool he's living the dream. But holy forking shirt balls I am losing my mind. 

I spent last weekend cleaning OUR (you know collective) apartment top to bottom and it's only Tuesday and my apartment is a forking wreck. I'm so mad. I spent hours scrubbing. Dusting. Vacuuming. Laundry. Dishes. Cleaning out/scrubbing the fridge. (All with my fiance mind you 0 help from brother) and if you walked into my apartment right now you'd laugh in my face and not believe me. His brother is an outright lazy slob and I'm sick of it. 

I've tried to talk to my fiance about it but he hates that I'm ""putting him in the middle"" and ""creating tension."" The worst part about it is that his brother brings out the messier/lazier side of my fiance sometimes and my fiance doesn't even realize it even after I've told him about it! I don't want to be mean and cause a problem and be that girl but like I'm  losing my damn mind. I come home to an apartment that looks disgusting every day after having worked at a stressful job all day. 

The worst part about it is. Sometimes when I come home I make a show about cleaning the kitchen while his brother is lazily on the couch playing video games to see if he'll even offer to help. Guess what he forking does. GETS UP GOES IN HIS ROOM AND PLAYS MORE VIDEO GAMES. It feels like I'm living with two grown man babies sometimes and I'm losing my darn mind over it. I have half a mind to just move out but as a teacher...I can hardly afford to live with three people as it is. 

Any advice on how to handle this???",03Dec2019,1
850,"I’ll try to make this concise.

My best friend read my diary, I’m very sure of it. When I confronted her about it, she told me that she hadn’t looked. I believed her, up until she said that she “didn’t know I had one”, which I guess she said to back her statement up, but it’s a complete lie: I’ve talked to her about this diary before and she very well knows I have one. That’s what led me to believe that she was definitely lying and then she had looked. I still went along with it though at the time because I didn’t know what else to do. This was over text so I don’t have any observation of body language.

This is my closest friend. After this incident it’s been the only thing on my mind for the past week and it’s so stressful, I’m with her all the time and I just feel so hurt and betrayed. If she just told the truth and said that she had read my diary I’d be fine with it after a couple days, but the fact the she blatantly lied and (very ironically) emphasized how important our trust is, is what really gets me.

She is a great person otherwise, but I think she just avoids confrontation at any cost. 

Do I confront her, or just try to get over it? I don’t think anything productive will come from the former: from knowing her, I predict that she’ll deny further accusations (I would be much more direct this time; it was a more casual question last time) and become more distant. However, I’ve been trying to just get over it all but it’s been the only thing on my mind and I feel so tense all the time.

851,"So, I work for a grocery store and when I started and was relatively new to it, I had to go to different places and help out. It was summer so, yeah, everyone was on vacation except me.

Well, I only work 20 hours a week, with a few hours overtime and today, my boss asked me to go to another store and help out there, because others are sick.

Problem is: I do not want to. He asked me to help tomorrow from 12 to 19:30 (closing). I told him, that I had plans in the afternoon (lie), but could do the morning. He accepted.

But at the end of the call, he suddenly said: ""And talk about the other days with the (boss of other location) tomorrow."" That sort of took me off guard, because I only agreed to tomorrow.

Now, although I only work 20 hours a week usually, I do overtime regularly and my shifts usually do not allow me to take time for my hobbies and on the weekends, I feel kinda forced to spend time with my boyfriend, so I appreciate getting a day or two off during the week.

And I was originally scheduled off work from Wednesday to Friday and would like to at least keep Thursday and Friday off.

I already came up with a lie to not work. ""I wanted to visit my mother, because it is the last chance to meet her until next year (she is a waitress and lives a two hour drive from me). My brothers and I make an early christmas party with her.""

But I feel kind of like an asshole, if I really do that.

Maybe I am just lazy and do not want to walk an hour to that location (have no car and walking is quicker than public transport in this case). But at the same time, there are so many other stores in the area, most of them closer, so I think, that someone else could easily jump in as well.",03Dec2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess when I was about 10 I was a socially anxious, introverted and troubled child. I guess some people saw me as an easy target because of this and bullied me. So basically i'd find going to school hard and only just get through. And around the same time I guess I started getting feelings for girls and getting random crushes on them, and I suppose there was a particular girl who I liked for a long time but I didn't quite understand it so I didn't say anything. It wasn't just to do with looks, she was just a nice person to talk to (which is something I barely did) and she even stood up for me a few times with the bullies. So I guess this is the reason that happened.

&amp;#x200B;

The problems eventually got so bad my mum just pulled me out of school and moved me to a different one, and things I guess went pretty well, and I didn't see the girl once ever since and haven't done for the past 5 years (that's when I moved school).

&amp;#x200B;

So fast forward to a couple of months back, i'm 15 and life is seemingly normal. But I had one of those deep morning thoughts you can suddenly get and I guess I just thought to myself 'Oh, remember that girl I had a crush on back in year 5' and I guess I got some kind of melancholic and lovey feeling from it, and then lone behold her facebook profile pops up. So I see the 15 year old version of her, and let's just say something went MAD. I suddenly started to feel what I did when I was 10, but 100x stronger and I have much more understanding of what it is.

&amp;#x200B;

So I send her a friend request, she accepts. I say hi, ask how things have been, asks if she remembers me and all of that, and I guess she said things have been kind of hectic but good and that she does remember me, so I guess we got into a 2 hour long conversation about how things have been since we last saw each other and eventually she says she has to go and goes to bed. So I guess after that I have stayed in contact but the thing is, how do I basically confess this? These are the worries I have about it.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;She will get creeped out and block me

\&gt;She will think i'm desperate

\&gt;I'll put stress on to her

&amp;#x200B;

Also it's not as if we live far away either at the speed I walk it would literally take 10 minutes. So I guess even asking if one day we could meet has crossed my mind but i'm frightened i'll come across as strange or a nuisance.

863,"Okay, so context. 

My parents and I have pretty much always had a weird relationship, where I've always felt overpowered and manipulated by them. Possibly because of my culture, or maybe their own upbringing, boundaries as a concept has never existed, and the less favourable to them I acted, the worse they got. 

This issue worsened as I grew up, and has been terrible these last three years. I'm now 17, and (not to sound like every other teenager out there)  I'm being treated like a child. Literally. I'm not really allowed to make my own decisions, nor am I given any independence or freedom. They've done it all- right from snooping through my texts to talking to my friends behind my back. They're extremely manipulative, and exploit the fact that I have Borderline Personality Disorder (which tends to make me a little volatile at times) and keep asserting that my feelings aren't valid because of my BPD, and that they're doing everything for ""my own good"". I feel unsafe living here, because I'm not allowed to have an identity, and my mental wellbeing is severely affected by the sheer amount of stress I go through when they're around. 

I'll be graduating this year and going off to college, and my parents fully intend to move next to my uni with me so that they can ""Keep an eye on me"". Honestly, I don't know if I can handle the constant pressure of feeling scrutinized and shadowed. I don't trust them at all, and while I still (unfortunately) love them very much, I don't think they would be very helpful to my emotional and mental growth. And unfortunately, I don't have the option of just ""waiting this out"" because as long as we're on decent terms, they're always going to be around.

868,"# context: teenager in school, me being straight, her being lesbian with some beef about supposed homophobia and she shows off her body a lot seemingly aimed at me

Okay so basically someone who used to be my best friend, and a girl (im a **hetro boy**) had some friendship troubles with me (she basically stopped treating me like a friend, not talking ect, after I said I had a crush on her and **she is also lesbian**, coming out a few months after I told her my feelings about her) and when things started falling apart I started to look at her in a more sexual way (before, I stopped myself looking at her, perving, becuase i genuinly liked her as a person) i looked at her ass and masterbaited now to her as our connection fell apart, I realised she was quite a sexy person, even without dressing to look as such, and i felt guilty, but it felt so hard to stop, i think genetically she is probably just a really good match or something with general looks that feel special yet innately attractive to me.

**(hopefully this doesnt sound too creepy so far, its natural to look at attractive people, i never did more than that, though it was a bit obsessive)** 

Anyway we had an argument after a long time on text, *about how I wasn't a homophobe.... pretty much, and apparently I had said something homophobic that I dont remember saying but realise i can see myself having said it but it being misinterpreted.*

So anyway now we're obviously like strangers to each other (treating each other as such for the most part) yet there is a problem now, I have managed to get a life and not be obsessed with her body, but she, a very non-shameful person (i think she had a good relationship with her mother so she's able to do stuff someone else wouldn't that would be like generally embarrassing but also make her look mature.) does not care if she has to bend over in an attractive way to grab something whilst she wears tights or trousers, and she does it for her best comfort, meaning going as slow as she can despite the fact of how it looks, whilst most would do something like that quickly. She also does other things that I can't take my eye off sometimes like moving about in her seat (sitting directly infront of me in class) but seemingly tensing her glutes at the same time which i think i see since she does this as she moves to the end of her chair, like she wants it more exposed, and i've even seen her move to the end of her chair with her undies peeking out her trousers when she would try to speak with people infront of her and she also has worn quite a sexy jumper, a bit too small so when she got up to get some paper unlike everyone else wearing jumpers that would go round to there hips, i could see her skin when she got up (bending a bit foward also, though not too much like she was actually trying to show off) and she has exposed her butt to me generally though she caught me on several occasions when i first started perving on her originally (after telling her i liked her) with a not-so approving expression, so surely she would be less at ease with her obviously being exposed to me, and i mean i dont think anyone would not look, so it's like she doesnt mind boys looking, and she generally seems she might have a somewhat encouraging attitude to it, I mean i dont know, maybe i'm just over looking things but surely she would be less intentional at exposing herself when i can see since i've looked before, and our beef, so this gets me confused and i've been doing r/nofap which has made girls look at me and all, so i wonder if this has an effect, if so, what does it actually mean?

878,"The title is weird, I know, but allow me to explain. Today, I've received four separate identical scam calls. I didn't answer any, I just let them ring until voicemail.
Here's the thing. When I received the first one, I was in the living room, and noticed a faint vibrating noise. I checked to see if maybe I was connected to something through Bluetooth, but my Bluetooth was off. I thought, maybe it was my Google home, so I checked it, but it was silent, and the noise was coming from a different direction.
The second time I received a spam call, I was in the kitchen. This time, I could hear it much more clearly. I followed the noise, and it was coming from either within or behind a wall by the sink. There is a room on the other side of the wall, but the call ended before I could follow the sound. I looked around, but found nothing that could make the noise.
At this point, I was really weirded out. So I got the landline, and tried to call my phone, thinking that might make it happen again. But nothing. No weird vibration. No noise. I then had two other people call my phone. Again, no vibration.
Then I got a third spam call, and I heard the vibration again. I rushed to the room behind the kitchen, and followed the sound. It was coming from inside the wall.
I have absolutely no idea what could possibly be making this noise, or why only the spam calls make it go off. At first I thought maybe the spam callers are calling multiple phones in our house at the same time, but when I traced the noise to the wall, that no longer made sense. That wall has never been worked on before, never been opened, not since construction. I know this sounds like the beginning of some r/nosleep story, but I honestly have no idea what to do about this. It seems like something I should be concerned about, but perhaps there's also some simple explanation that I'm not considering?",03Dec2019,1

Art is my passion, drawing has always been the thing I’m good at and I’ve wanted to be an artist for as long as I can remember. I absolutely love going to school for art and it’s amazing getting to learn new things and build my skills. I’m sad that the semester is nearly over because that means I’ll have a little over 6 weeks to kill before next semester starts. 

I am a movie theater employee and like all minimum wage jobs, it sucks. I’ve only been working about 25 hours a week while going to school and now my managers are urging (begging) me to up my availability to work full time during break. 

The money would be nice if I were to work full time for the next 6 weeks, but I really want to focus on my art and work on developing my portfolio. 

Like my managers, my parents are also urging me to work full time during the break. 

So what should I do, should I listen to my managers and parents and work more during the break, or listen to myself and take the time to work on my art and building a portfolio?

I said that he might have other plans and nothing after. Then at her place during thanksgiving she asked about him not coming like 3 or 4 times.

883,"Hey, this is my first post to reddit so sorry if I have awful formatting or writing here.

So a little background first, I have been dating my girlfriend for about 3 and a half months at this point and for the most part we’re fine as a relationship. We haven’t had any major fights or problems just the small ups and downs.

Anyways, her best friend (for the sake of the story I’ll call her T) is a lovely person and I’ve known her for around 2-3 years and she’s the reason me and my current gf met. 

However through the course of me dating my girlfriend I have noticed that they’re VERY touchy and close. I don’t really have that much of a problem with people I date being close with their friends but she goes out of her way to avoid me just to hug her or be near her.

I may need to point out here that I am a girl and I’m gay hence why I have a girlfriend. T is also bisexual for clarification and I don’t have a problem with it obviously just seemed relevant to point out.

Here’s where things get a little messy,
We all as a massive group of my friends went out to a concert to support our friend playing.
The whole night T and my gf where hugging laughing touching all sorts throughout the night, I tried bringing it up but I got shut down as being jealous or overreacting and “that girls are just being girls” and all that bs.

At one point I even left to go to the bathroom in near tears because I was just heartbroken that she didn’t even want to speak to me and just hang about with her “wife” ( they call each other that). People even come up and ask me if we’re even dating anymore because it’s gotten to a point where they’re as confused as i am.

I’m just really hurt because I spent a lot of time with her and trying to be with her and I know they don’t realise what they are doing but I’m really stuck on what to do. I don’t want to break up with her because that will destroy her and she suffers from a lot of mental issues.

Adding to the fact all my friends would pretty much get pissed at me if I did break up with her (which I’m heavily considering) because she’s considered the “innocent” and “well liked” person of my group. 

I don’t consider myself a very jealous person but I don’t know how to tell her how much this is bothering me and when I do try I just get shut down as being a jealous piece of sh*t and that my feelings and worries don’t count to anything.

I don’t really know what to do because I do really like her but if she does like her best friend (which many people think she does) I wish she would just tell me because this uncertain feeling is getting the better of me.

Thank you for reading if you got to this point any advice would really help.",03Dec2019,1

885,"i work in childcare and yesterday i witnessed something that i feel wasn’t okay. i was in the shared bathroom for the children changing a child’s diaper and at the same time the teacher from the room next door brought in a child and told him to quickly sit on the toilet.

i think this child was about 3 and was crying. he didn’t seem to take in the teacher’s advice and he wet himself on the spot. the teacher got mad at him because it was apparently his 3rd accident today and just kind of left him there with me. 

i finished changing the other child and looked at the boy, crying and soaked in his own urine and realised the other teacher wasn’t coming back to sort it out. most of the time with the shared bathrooms we’re recommended to supervise and help all children in there, even if they’re not ones from our room. i don’t know if she assumed i would take care of it or if she literally just left him there. she didn’t have another teacher to help out in her room today and there were a lot of other kids in there so i understand if she wanted me to help him, but i just found it weird that she didn’t even ask me, just left him there. 

i got him changed and cleaned up and everything while she still stayed in the other room. he was still very upset so i wanted to take him aside before he went back into the room with her and just tell him it’s okay and accidents happen and to give him a hug. but before i could do that his teacher came in and took him back. 

we are told in a lot of our policies and also the courses we’re required to take in order to do this job that it’s not okay to be mad at a child if they have accidents. it also made me remember that frequent accidents can sometimes be an indicator of something going on, like abuse or something happening in their personal lives or even developmental issues like autism. 

i keep wondering what would’ve happened if i wasn’t there? would she have just left him or have tended to him eventually? i get that she was busy but children’s health and safety is supposed to be a priority. i really don’t think the way she spoke to him about it was okay either. i don’t know whether to say something to management or if i’m making an issue over nothing and jumping to conclusions.",03Dec2019,1

Okay I have an extreme battle with anxiety which lead to depression, and doing a sport will ease it off. 

I’ve always been interested in cheerleading but never have done it because I’m scared of strangers. But my friends who once have done cheer will go there too, so I figured this is the perfect opportunity. 

I’m 126 and 5.5, I’m 13 years old, I also have seen cheerleaders be quite thin, but I’m not thin. I’ve only seen one be average. 

And last year they choose mostly the former cheerleaders ones who had experience, unlike me. 


Do I have to do back flips?
What is there to really try out for, I mean do they show you a dance and you have to copy it?

I’m a lab technician at the water plant right now.

I’m not going to lie it hurt like hell and I had to leave the house for the night.

When I left I called my aunt whom is in another state. I tried to not break down but I couldn’t help but shatter on the phone and explain what happened. She says she will help me if I make that choice to move in with her. Not going to lie it sounds nice being with someone who supports me and won’t give me backlash for my decisions.

Around mid 11th grade, I began to lose all motivation in school. I didn't care about deadlines like I used to, and the quality of my work wasn't as stellar.

We had to do peer reviews and she came to my table sat next to me at my table. She sat between me and a woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued. She was making forced eye contact and scratching her head while resting her head on her hand. One day I sat down waiting for class and sat with a woman I give a lot of attention to in class and she came in for class walked over and started waiting very close to me, hovering over standing in my personal space, she walked right in front of me and started getting close to me and I could smell her but she had her back to me. This was the closest she's been to me. There was a whole room not a lot of other people. When I talked about another girl that likes me that I don't like and asking for advice from a woman I talk to in college to not lead her on. She joined the conversation said that the other girl will continue pushing and I have to ignore all together and tell her I'm not interested. This was the biggest response I got from her and longest convrsation. She started this stuff after I asked for advice, . I told her someone said my hair looks like the clown from it and she said that's not nice. I saw her in the hall one day we stopped seeing each other in class. She saw me and stopped and asked me how my classes were this semester and she had the biggest smile on her face. I ask her stuff and it's like she has a hard time with conversation but has the biggest smile on her face talking to me. I said my advisor would kick me out bc he knows I smoke pot and she says ""awww"" I do get an awkward forced vibe from her. I asked her how her classes were and it went over her head. I crossed paths walking on a small walkway and she didn't look me in the eye was looking down and said hey very softly, unassertively. Most recently we had to go to a lecture in the biggest lecture hall on my campus. I was sitting in a spot in the front and in the middle and she came in saw me and she came in and sat 2 empty seats away from me. 

Today I approached her asked for her number she said yeah sure and instantly but she didn't look me in the eyes at all and she didn't look at me.",03Dec2019,1
912,"Throwaway account because I'm afraid of backlash.

This year for the holidays, (m)y partner wants to take (m)e to his home state and to be with him and his family, but my problem is that I don't celebrate Shitmas. This is the most difficult month of the year for my mental health, as there's too much trauma associated with this holiday. I've also been told that I'm selfish and that I need to ""get over it"", all while having this bs holiday shoved down my throat when I've asked to be left alone.

My options:

&gt; a) Go with my partner who supports me, but whose NMom is *obsessed* with Shitmas, and will become irrationally angry if we don't hang out with her and participate in her traditions.

&gt; b) Stay at my partner's house, here, alone for two weeks, despite being disabled with the need for someone to help me care for myself.

&gt; c) Go back to my house where I can be with my family (and maybe friends), but risk being abused by them.

I'm incredibly stressed out and panicked from trying to sort this all out. My best friend couldn't help, and my partner has until tomorrow morning to alter the flight info. I'm afraid of my family, I'm afraid of being alone, and I'm afraid that my partner's family won't respect my beliefs.

914,"So me and my boyfriend have been trying to look for a place to rent for us and our 3 year old daughter. We’ve finally found a perfect place. Yesterday we had to pay for 3 application fees which came out to be $120. We had to get a co-signer because we didn’t make 3 times the rent by only a little bit. They called us yesterday and told us that we have to pay my boyfriends past due power bill (from 6 years ago) and that we have to set up a payment plan for an eviction we had 3 years ago (didn’t get evicted we left due to electrical issues and someone trying to break in twice) So we paid his $100 power bill and we paid $50 to set up a payment plan. The problem is the realtor company wants an email verifying that we set up a payment plan. The collections agency said they would send an email within 24 hours. Well it’s past 24 hours and still no email. The realtor company won’t even take bank statements showing that we paid the $50 to start the payment plan. We’ve tried to explain to them that we’ve called the agency 3 times pleading for them to expedite the email but they said if they don’t have it by tomorrow then they have no choice but to give it to someone else. I am just so frustrated that we’ve spent $270 already to try and get this place. We’ve gone through all these steps, it’s just so frustrating. Any advice?",03Dec2019,1

918,"Some background:
I moved across the country last year to take care of my uncle with cancer. He’s practically my father, and a truly wonderful man. Imagine a John Candy/Bill Murray mashup with an insatiable love for chili dogs and Tommy Bahama shirts. Anyway, I’m a copywriter, so during that time I mostly freelanced but took a full-time job when things for my uncle started to look up.

The last position I had was at a local PR firm for restaurant and hospitality clients. It seemed fun, but a couple months after starting it was clear that the owner was having trouble maintaining the business. Paychecks were missing or late, the clients were ending contracts, and employee turnover was exceptionally frequent. At the same time, my uncle’s health took a turn and I eventually decided that I needed to be with him full-time. I gave the requisite 2-weeks notice and helped make a plan for the transition. 

My uncle passed on September 12. Since then, I’ve been doing what I can to regain a sense of normalcy, including resuming my career. I worked with a fantastic recruiter who helped me find a new position with incredible pay and a huge jump in title. Suffice to say I’m thrilled, and it *almost* makes up for all the shitty parts of last year.

Fast forward to today, when I found out that there’s been some problems with my background check. My former employer is now claiming that I left without notice, and had received multiple written warnings during my two months there. I explained to HR that this was absolutely false, that I had given notice and left to be my uncle’s primary caretaker. I even forwarded her an email from my ex-boss on my last day saying:

“We have very much enjoyed working with you, and wish you truly nothing but the best in your future endeavors.

Don’t ever hesitate to reach out if you ever want to do some freelance copywriting 😊 We would love to keep that in mind.”

So what now? I haven’t heard back from HR and I’m terrified they’ll rescind the offer.",03Dec2019,1

•i am working w part time internship in a different town 40 miles away making $12/hr (hoping to get a permanent position once i graduate in May)
•both of my parents have said that they want me to continue working my internship despite it being far from school because it’s a great opportunity for my future career
•my commute is about an hour each way, give or take
•i have a dog and a cat who are my ESA’s because i have very bad depression and anxiety
•my total monthly income is about $800/month
•rent is $570, plus about $200 in gas each month and $100 in groceries leaves me in the red every month and what little savings i had is now dwindling rapidly
•my mom lives 60 miles away from my school, but only 20 miles away from my job (quite literally the 3 are a straight line along the interstate: school————work——mom)
•i would not be able to take my pets with me to my mom’s because her dogs are very protective, but my pets are my babies and i adore them more than life itself; they have saved my life more times than i can count
•i would be saving money on rent, but still spending just as much, if not more, on gas
•the commute to school would be longer than i currently commute to work everyday
•next semester my schedule will be working mornings and then going to class in the afternoons, so being closer to work for my morning commute would be nice

926,"I gotta explain the whole situation lol
So I've seen this girl around before. We would always stare at each other at the bar but then one night she randomly buys me a drink. We chat for a little then we eventually hook up that night. We start to chat everyday on Instagram meet up at the bar and sometimes hook up. For Halloween we actually had a lil date and we carved pumpkins together. We really started to get to know each other after that and I think we really were falling for each other it was  Pretty much the beginning of a new relationship. But I forgot to mention that she also just recently got out of a relationship. And I'm kinda friends with the guy. We're not like close but we know each well and have a lot of mutal friends. People actually say we look a like and it's weird now that she's talking to me lol. Like am I a rebound? I went away for Thanksgiving and we literally chatted every second and we started saying cute couple stuff like ""wish you here"" ""can't wait to see ya"". And this is where I get confused. One time we were laying in bed and she got a text from her ex. I don't know what it was about but it was a long thread from and they were all recent text so are still talking!! He also likes all the pictures she post (if that matters) Her ex also talks to other girls at the bars. But anyways last weekend I pop out to the bars very casually. Didn't tell her I was going out. I'm actually having drinks with some friends and her ex. Like I said we're actually really cool with each other. I'm just chilling and I see her walk in the bar. I played it off like I don't see her I'm not sure if she saw me but she walked by me while my back was turned it was kind of crowded. Well anyway I go off to the bathroom a few mins later and he's right behind her ex like by his side while he talks to someone else. I again act like I don't see her again and I know for a fact she saw me this time. She then kinda strays away from him talks to one her friends. I'm like wow in head and kinda get a little mad idk. Am I even allowed to get mad at this? So I go back to the bar by myself and she comes up to me and we chat. We eventually separate and she goes off with her friends and so do I. I texted her it was nice to see her and left. I kinda got in my feels lol. I had already ready had this planned but I deleted all my social media. Just needed a cleanse from it. But remember we only talk on insta. So for 3  days we didn't talk and all thought about was her and how she must wondering if just straight ghosted her. Last night I logged back and she literally texted me everyday saying I wanna see you and stuff. I replied back that I just needed a break from social media. She replied back that she got a little worried. I still haven't replied back and sent 2 more messages that I have yet to read. This when I make this post. Does anyone have any tips on what I should do goiby forward giving the situation? 

A little about me I never really been in a relationship before. I'm 23 and I'm very motivated to make something outta myself. Sometimes I feel like women in general slow me down. Maybe I'm not ready for a relationship but have devoloped feelings for her. It's crazy cause she it's very beautiful in my head I feel like I could do better but maybe a girl with the all features like body, face, social status is worthless when ya heart is telling you otherwise.

This is a party for everyone, so there will be no subject for the surprise, but rather a night of unexpected nuances like innocent april fools jokes. Here's what I have so far:

&amp;#x200B;

food: ""deviled eggs"" made with jello/pudding, kitty litter ""cake,"" rice Krispy treat ""fried chicken,"" candy ""rocks,"" ice cream ""spaghetti,"" caramel apples made with onions, mismatched drinks/chips (I.e. tea in a coke bottle), vegetables sealed in candy wrappers

&amp;#x200B;

fun: everyone brings a gift...no limits, no price, just a single gift for a grab bag, disguises (like the glasses with a nose/mustache),  whoopie cushion, green screen with a surprise result, taste test except every sample is exactly the same

&amp;#x200B;

decoration: heavy balloons, light bricks (not sure how to materialize this idea quite yet), fake bugs/rodents

I've had what seems to be a small hemorrhoid, one that like a small skin tag (probably 5-7mm) for a year or so. I've been following home treatment advice I've found, and been eating tons of fiber and exercise as often as I can for months, which has been kind of hard as a premed stem kid so admittedly not perfect, but it isn't really going away. If it wasn't causing huge self esteem issues to a really absurd point, I honestly wouldn't worry about it, but it's just so embarrassing to me and really lowers my body image. I've also been in a sexual relationship for 6 months or so and due to the sex being pretty vanilla and in the dark, my boyfriend has no idea it's there, but I hate that it makes me constantly worried during sex and distracts me from enjoying it since I just try to avoid being in a position that might make it discoverable. Has any other young adult experienced this and have any advice? Does anyone know if a small skin-tag like hemorrhoid can be removed simply/quickly/non-disruptively by just a regular pcp, and if they're willing to do it not due to medical necessity but just knowing it's psychologically affecting the person pretty bad?

And even to a point where one time during foreplay she asked to stop (we had alot of intimate sex every time we met) and haven't done anything since.

Today on my way to dropping her off home I brought up a boy she called 'cute boy' as a joke at her workplace. Well I grabbed her phone and purse when she was getting ready and a whatsapp notification popped up. I didn't read it but just saw 'bin boy' (she only uses whatsapp for her work group chat, and she works as dominos so yeah bin boy). I asked who it was and she said no one so I was like okay and just got on with driving. Later she said it was one of the managers when I asked. But going back to when I mentioned cute boy to her and someone saying it could mean she's attracted to him she got ultra pissy. I said sorry via text when I got home. She came back saying ""It’s hard for me to like think about because I’ll be honest yeah I think Murray is cute and yeah had he asked me out before you were in the picture I would’ve said yes.. those feelings don’t go away so quickly.. and it’s hard when you say shit like that because it makes me overthink everything"".

Now she's saying ""But like I said, those feelings won’t go away if I don’t know what to do with them... like how do I know if we would work (Murray and I) like I don’t wanna say this to be a bitch - but I think I need o see if anything could happen with Murray and I... because I know we work and we’re really good together, but I don’t know that about Murray. And for me, not knowing isn’t gonna help the situation, it will make it worse"".

So me and my mum stay over night in the hospital accommodation then at 11am the next day we go to the ward. We wait there for hours and hours (which we suspected would happen as I was the last operation of the day). They do the usual stuff like asking questions then putting this cream on my hands.

As the time went on I was getting more nervous as my operation was scheduled for 2:50pm and it was like 3:30pm at this point. The doctor comes in and says oh don’t worry will just be like another 30 mins to an hour. Then comes 4:30pm.

After sitting in this stupid ward room all day these nurses come in and the first thing they say is that they’ve got some ‘bad news’ for me so I’m immediately like ffs are you joking. They cancelled the operation just like that. I was devastated as I’ve had many bad experiences with hospitals so this was really hard.

942,"So, I'll try to be as short as possible. 

My mom has always played the victim in every situation she has been in. And she hasnt been the greatest mother growing up.  

Recently, my sister moved away leaving her husband.  They are not divorced but more than likely she will stay there and they will divorce. She hasnt decided yet.  They separated because they are on such opposite ends of life.  He wants children, she doesn't.  He is a christian, she opposes religion. Etc... it hasn't always been like that but they have been married for over 10 years and have both made life changing decisions.

Well our mom in constantly messaging her everyday asking her to come home or if she plans on divorcing her husband. We have asked mom over and over to leave her alone but she just won't.  Anytime I confront her about it she just starts to play the victim.

She had made statements to my sister like, ""You should move back home. It'll help with my depression"" or ""You should give your husband another try. Try to work it out."" Or ""Come home. I'm worried about you.""

Anytime I tried to ask mom to leave my sister alone she just talks about how she is feeling.  It's like my mom can't mentally process anything but her own feelings.  She constantly plays the victim in every situation and I've never seen her try to look at it from another point of view.  She has never said, ""Your're right. I didnt think about it that way.""

How do we get through to her? In this instance we just want her to leave my sister alone and give her some space.  It's ok that she is worried about her daughter but she needs to give her space and quit questioning her.  

TL;DR: Mom seems mentally incapable of considering our feelings. She won't quit asking my sister questions that make her uncomfortable. How do we get her to stop?

Below is an example of a convo between my mom and sister and then my mom and me.

943,"I live with my husband. My husband’s niece is the most annoying creature in the world. Not only she has no manners but she’s impolite, rude and mean. I don’t care if her family is letting her play videogames or movies for adults, if their family lets her be rude and after 5 minutes buys her whatever she wants. But she’s always rude to us. Dumb stuff like saying our car is lame or our dog is ugly, but horrible stuff like “i bet you cut yourself when you were in high school” (and all these attacks are towards my husband, usually when I’m not around or before she was even 12 years old so I never said anything because she was just a child). But now she’s a teen and I’m not willing to let this happen anymore so I’ve been pretty cool turning her mean comments into a compliment (she’s got really sarcastic recently).

We don’t hang out with her mom (my husband’s sister), he despises her (she’s hateful), so we rarely see each other. But his niece has been living with her grandparents, (we don’t know when or how long, it’s just sometimes but pretty often since she’s homeschooled).
We enjoy my husband’s parents coming over and everything, even when they come when I’m not home. But last time his mom came visit, she came with the little brat (and I had the feeling she was going to come so I told my husband that he needs to stood up and say something if she’s rude, he agreed but he never does because he doesn’t want to piss off his mom, they love that girl and recently they’ve been trying to say nice things about her to my husband and how she made a gift for us even though it’s bullshit).

Well, I came home and found out that she was rude but I had the feeling he didn’t want to talk about it or he didn’t remember but he said he totally stood up and said to her “don’t be a butt”. In my opinion that’s not enough. I think he has to be clear and say that this is our house and she cannot say those things to us. The part that bugs me the most is that he doesn’t even want to talk about what happened exactly and starts yelling and then I start yelling and then he gets mad at me because I yelled. 

His parents help us a lot, with issues with the house and the car and rarely with transportation. So he’s afraid if we say something, they might not talk to us anymore. But I’d rather have no help and go crazy with my issues, than be a bitch and take all that crap from that little brat. 

I told him that I want to tell his mom that she and his husband are welcome, but don’t bring his niece to our house unless she learns some manners (or maybe I can phrase it different). But I really don’t want her in my house (especially when I’m not home). And he said that definitely I can’t say that. Well, I’d like to have some rules in my house! And apparently I can’t. 

What should I do? Should I not send any message? Should I just forget about it? Is it okay if next time my in laws want to visit us, we ask if they’re coming alone?

TL;dr
My husband has a 13yo niece who is homeschooled and lives with her grandparents most of the time. She’s rude, impolite and mean, nothing she says is nice, ever. Can I tell my in laws they can come whenever they want but cannot bring the little brat? What else can I do?",03Dec2019,1

945,I’m female &amp; in a great relationship with a future ahead of us. But I’m not as attracted to him as I used to be. I was head over heels in love with him. I’ve had a lot of personal stuff &amp; family stuff going on in the past few years. But recently I’ve started finding attraction towards women :/. I just don’t know how to break it to him or how to even start that kind of conversation. I can’t be with girls (because of my family etc) and I don’t even know if I am bisexual or just bicurious.

946,Hello 👋 and bless y’all if you see my post. I’ve been thinking about this a-lot and it’s a big problem to me.I can’t seem to find something that makes me happy like something I can do myself and enjoy. I just bump into a wall all over again and it’s like a loop because I just can’t seem to find something that I enjoy that makes me genuinely happy when I think I found it I am like nope I was wrong .I’m kind of young so I feel like part of the reason is that I just am going through phases and I don’t find anything interesting. Music is okay but I don’t truly enjoy.Hanging with friends kind of just makes me feel like shit because I feel weird and I think it’s because I’m a very antisocial person prefer my alone time also they tend to want to ALWAYS talk to me about their problems and it’s annoying like can you take some time and work on yourself because it seems like you have a lot to figure about about yourself. A lot of people say im a bad friend because I don’t really pay attention to my friends or try to hang with them. I think the only time I enjoy is with my boyfriend but sometimes you know life happens and we can’t always be happy 100% happy.Were both young and dealing with your own problems but we got our back. So yea idk what to do with myself other then working and school which I don’t enjoy Im not really a school person but I want to secure my path for a better future. So idk what to do with myself to enjoy my life more.,03Dec2019,1
947,"I’m not quite sure how emotional abuse works, what the signs are, if it’s intentional or not— but after some research I think it happened to me. 

My first relationship ended about three months ago, mutually. I (16M at the beginning, 17 by the end) dated a girl (15F) for six months. The first three months were everything I could’ve hoped for. We fell in love, even though we didn’t really know what it was. 

And then, suddenly, I was completely and utterly shut out by her. She said it was her depression— this girl has been through a lot, which I won’t detail, but her mental health wasn’t in a good state. We didn’t stop dating, but when I would check up on her through texting, I got minimal responses. I respected her doing this as I’m young and have no idea how depression works, so I just dealt with it. I didn’t see her for almost an entire month. In this time, she had told me in a very long text message about how I had asked her mother how she was doing. She said I shouldn’t ask her mother anything and that she was in a very dark place and apologized for her ignoring me. I said it’s alright, you can’t control depression, and barely heard from her for the next couple weeks. For the rest of the summer I was incredibly upset and everyone around me said I acted differently.

After this, she had asked me to go to the mall with her, and I was shocked but super happy. Of course I said yes— and then when I saw her, she completely ignored me the entire time. She talked to her friends on the phone, had one earbud in the entire time, barely talked to me unless I was the one who started up the conversation... I could definitely sense something was wrong. I asked her if she was stressed or something, got a very sarcastic answer, and was promptly crushed. Waited in silence for her mom to pick us up.

I texted her the next day, and asked if everything was alright between us. She very rudely and curtly said no, nothing’s wrong, and that she had absolutely no idea why I was even asking. I was again crushed by the way I was being treated but didnt day anything. 

Finally, the next month, I’d started discussing with her  over text what was going on between us, how I felt mistreated, and why I was so hurt. She told me how she was the kind of person who would tell someone when they were out of line and I would let it slide, and I said I only let her treatment of me slide because I thought it wasn’t her fault, it was her mental health. In the middle of this conversation, she had ignored my text and posted something about a tv show... I’d finally had it. I went off on her for this, told her how I wasn’t letting this slide and about how hurt I was. 
I was seriously heartbroken by this. It felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest and I told her that. 

She immediately apologized profusely, begged for me to stay, lied and said my text hadn’t gone through (it had. it told me the message was delivered). I told her if you want me to stay so badly then why treat me like garbage, and I was met with more apologies. I told her to stop talking to me. 

Needless to say the relationship ended soon after. After talking things out in person, we’d agreed to be friends and to put it behind us. After this, I was yet again belittled. She told me that I was dumb for picking track as my sport in school. Later, A mutual teacher told us his brother had cancer, I got the class together to make a gift, and she told me how stupid of an idea it was and that I was dumb for thinking of it. I tried to take the high road and tell her it to speak to me like that and that if she needs to take her anger out that I’d help her but yelling at me wasn’t the way. I didn’t get a response.

It was about two weeks ago when some family issues came up that I realized I couldn’t handle another emotional burden like this. I figured it was so bad that I’d been emotionally abused in some way.

Was I?",03Dec2019,1

949,"I suffer from ADHD, so I act overly hyperactive far more often than I'd like to. I'm medicated; but it cant fix everything, even if I'd like it to. Because of my ADHD, I seem to have a ""mental switch""-- Either hyper-focused or hyper-active; No in between. Problem is, this switch flips whenever it feels like it, and I can't flip it myself. 

Specifically, this results in me becoming hyper after socializing. Once I'm in this hyperactive state, I can't get into hyperfocus, so I can't do schoolwork (at least not efficiently). Almost every day, I get into this hyperactive state during lunch, and only get back into hyperfocus for short bursts-- usually when there's someone (IE a teacher) yelling at me, or its a teacher I respect. 

Once I get home, and try to do my damn homework, I just cant, and have a mental argument with myself. I yell at myself mentally ""Just fucking focus you tard"", ""come on, you useless sack of shit"", ""just do the work for fucks sake"", and the like. I hate doing this, and it doesn't get me anywhere.

I really need to overcome this both for my own mental health, and for my academics--

Any advice is much appreciated.

Addendum: I know some of this sounds edgy which may make some people jump to depression and needing to see someone but I really don't. I'm on a light dose (10mg) of an SRI for general mood enhancement, and don't want to attach any diagnosis to it. Mostly because the generation I'm regrettably part of has absurdly high self diagnosis rates and ""depression""-- I don't want to associate with that.",03Dec2019,1
950,"I started a new job yesterday. The position is a Theft Prevention role at one of the larger retailers in the US. I was offered this position at $16.40 an hour two weeks before I was to actually start.

After that, I did some computer based training in their HR office. About an hour in I was told that for my in person training/shadowing of another person I’d be having to drive to a different store about an hour away from where I live for my shifts during the training period.

Two family members killed themselves this year within a week of each other and I dropped my classes to try to recuperate from the stress.

He's a 53 year old male and in very good shape with a good head on his shoulders.

This is very unusual behavior for him.  He's actually my coach and I text him many times per week for workouts and such.  I've paid him through the end of the year and he isn't one to not do work that he is being paid for.

He moves between where I live and across the country in NJ.  But I don't actually know where he was staying in the last week.  I think he was with family here for the holidays, but I don't know any of his family or where he was staying.  He doesn't usually update me on when he is in town or when he is going back and forth.  He could possibly be driving back to NJ.

So 
I (F19) slept with brother #1 (M20?) about a year ago like 3 times. We cuddled too. Not much more, didnt have really any emotional connections. He has a girlfriend right now.
A year later now I have just slept with brother #2.. (M25) he knew I slept with his brother before but it didn’t really bother him at all because I supose we both just thought it was a hookup for us.. well I think we both unexpectedly fell for eachother, like we are so into eachother and I don’t think either of us thought that would happen.. I really do like him and I can tell he really likes me, and things are starting to move quickly .. obviously when you are “falling in love” you don’t think much. Well I’m scared when things start settling in we start dating for a while whatever, that the fact of my history will ruin our relationship.

Should I quit when I start community college or do community college and work at the same time? I don’t fell like the money is worth the depression.

I (18M) am having a bit of trouble. I work as a grocery clerk and work 5 hours a day (5pm-10pm). The problem I am having is that I feel like I can’t work on myself or figure things out because I am always thinking of work. I stopped going to the gym (which is what makes me feel better) because then I get to work and am too tired to take heavy boxes off of shelves. I also just hang out and look at the clock until work starts. Meanwhile all of my friends from high school are enjoying their college lives a country away while I don’t have a clue on what I want to do with my life career wise. 

I come home and feel like I need to de-stress until 3am, causing me to wake up an 12pm giving me only 4.5 hours to do things. Also work has been getting strict. I went from having 2 half an hour breaks to now 1 fifteen minute break, I can no longer listen to music and management goes hard on me whenever I do something wrong, even the littlest of things. I make under $200 a week, and the grocery store I work at before 5:00 pm is an absolute and stressful nightmare. 

I feel like I’m a lazy piece of shit because it’s only 5 hours and there are some people there that work 8-10 hours. I’m thinking about doing community college when the next semester hits and quitting work and hopefully coming back during the summer. I not sure though, I would like to talk about it with my parents but there never seems to be a good time to talk about it.

I'm 15, I always get told that no one knows what they are going to do with their life. But by the looks of it everyone has a plan already besides me.

My parents bicker and argue every day, and honestly I've had enough of it. I'm tired of having to come home and instead of them having interesting or fun conversations they both immediately talk about how shitty their lives are.

I'm so alone at home, I do have friends but we don't hang out all too much. When we do get the opportunity though somehow something gets in the way

I often look to my friends guardians and see how peaceful and loving they are, how they actually love each other. My parents have only stayed together because of mutual benefit. I don't often see them actually having fun together or enjoy being in one another's presence.

I just want a place where I can go to where I don't have to experience this shit anymore. But once I leave home I don't know what I'm going to do with my life. 

I crave hugs and cuddles, personally I yearn for them but no one really is willing to. I just want to be loved and feel like I am loved.

974,"Hi, so to give a bit of background here. I used to live in Utah, I was living with family, had three kids of my own and happily married. Well we found out that the family members we shared a home with were using and selling meth behind our backs and in our home for at least two years. We tried an intervention of sorts and it got violent quick, I was pregnant with my fourth child and was attached by the addict. I was so angry, emotionally and physically hurt that it felt like my world was crashing around me. I desperately wanted to protect my children and it so happened that a family member I hadn't seen in about six years was in town to visit us. At the time it was like a blessing, they helped us pack up a truck with all we could carry, rented us hotel rooms and get us half way across the country in three days to live in their home, we had actually planned to move out here to be close to them in May of 2020 and they were going to help us by buying us a home and we pay them for it instead of a bank but because of the sudden change in plans we were going to have to stay at their house for a while. This person in particular isn't home often, they are a long haul truck driver but there is another family member also living within the house and pretty much runs the place. My husband had to give up a pretty good job that he actually enjoyed and was good at, all of his family and friends are back in Utah and I've left behind 17 years of my life as well. He's got a job here in Mississippi but makes significantly less approximately 1,300 less a month than where we were and though we currently have no bills as my family have been kind enough to allow us to love here for free and helped us get things started, we are also absolutely miserable. The member that loves with us full time is elderly, controls everything, has nothing nice to say and is over parenting our children. I keep telling myself it'll get better once we have our own place again but there's a lot of things I don't like about Mississippi in general like the fact my kids are being forced to pay on school, how conservative it is, the lack of jobs and crap pay, the systems in place for those that need it, the schools in general.. I really want to move back to Utah but feel like if I mentioned it to my family that's helped me I'd be ostracized or something like that and don't know what if do, I wouldn't be able to do this move again until at least June to allow my kids to finish up the school year and save up as much money as we can but I just don't know what to do we've been here for 5 months currently and I'm very grateful for all the help we have gotten especially under the circumstances but I don't know if I should wait it out  and stay or start getting myself ready to move such a huge distance again.. Any advice is welcomed, thanks in advance and sorry this is so long.",03Dec2019,1
975,"He just rolls shit up and takes it with him. Doesn’t leave a written or dollar note, ever. 
He’ll just grind shit up, leave it in the grinder, and call me a fiend if I question why the canister is empty. But if *I* grab a nug too many out of a batch *he* purchased (which is rare),I need to “go on a tolerance break or something”. 

“You smoke too much/early”, “That bowl is too deep, you dont burn it right; its wasteful”. 

I try really hard not to approach him with heat or volume because he’s the type to shut down when it comes to discussion he has no interest in. I dont even like asking “wheres the weed” in general. He sometimes wont even answer, just “wait”. Like I’m his fucking kid or something. 

I dont want to come off like I want him to pay me back or something, I just want some fucking communication. AT LEAST. I dont want to have to hide half the stash to ensure I can smoke when I get home from work.

He's been scratching at himself and violently burrowing in my blankets any chance he gets as well as going underneath my bed and my mothers recliner. I have an appointment set up for him to see his vet on Friday but I was hoping to maybe get some opinions of other dog owners, trying to see if this could be an emergency situation. 

We've checked him for fleas and bugs, gave him a no shampoo bath. He has eaten the same dry food brand for over a year and the same soft food brand for a majority of his adult life. we keep his water and food bowls clean, and there are no plants around since it's snowed recently. We haven't taken him anywhere recently and he hasn't had anything out of the ordinary happen to him. I've done some research and so i'm giving extra info that would disprove some things i've seen online that could be the root of the issue. 

Will probably give him an oatmeal soak tomorrow if this persists. Any advice is appreciated",03Dec2019,1

My boyfriend’s daughter is a single mother. She has an 18 year old son and a 15 year old daughter (we’ll call her Jessica). Her son is in college and is doing very well. But her daughter has been spinning out of control for a few years. Her mother is the best mom. She is the kind of mom who you would see in a hallmark movie. But Jessica doesn’t listen, argues, doesn’t come home, skips school, and is starting to get into drugs. About a year ago Jessica came to live with my bf and me to help her mother who didn’t know what to do. We thought If we got her away from the boys and girls who she was doing these things with it would help get her back on track. She was doing great, straight As, playing basketball, and involved in ROTC. But Jessica manipulated her mother into letting her come home because she was “fixed now”. And since being home she has gotten extremely worse. She got a ticket for having weed and is literally not going to school at all. Her mother is at her wits end. She has tried everything. From counseling to tough love to trying to communicate better, nothing has worked. Her mom in concerned for her son and her own mental wellbeing. She’s scared her daughter is going to end up in serious trouble. Jessica’s mom is also afraid that SHE will get in trouble with truancy and if her daughter hurts someone she could be responsible. ANYWAY I know this is a super long post, but if anyone has any advice on how to get her back on track no matter how small it would be very welcome.",03Dec2019,1

983,"So, after finding some time to have fun, me and my two cousins and my cousins wife decided to go clubbing. 

After paying our way in and getting our drinks, we situated ourselves by the wall, and we started to chill and dance. 

Now here’s how my night went down: 

So one woman pulled me into a circle where I danced merengue with her for a bit. 


Then I asked this cute girl who was with her friends to dance salsa, she said yes, and we had a fun time! 

Then I had spotted this really good looking , tall woman with curly hair came with her friends. 

I noticed her talking about me to her friends, since she was sneaking glances towards me while talking to them. Then she  caressed my arm while passing through me to the bar . 

A little while later, I walked by the bathroom and she stopped me and asked what did I dance. I told her “salsa , bachata” she looked a bit disappointed, but I believe she said “ well when there’s hip hop I’ll come find you “ and she rubbed her hand along my whole chest . 

Then eventually I found her. I walked up to her , she grabbed my hands and guided me to her body and we were grinding . Little did I know we were in a circle. My hands explored her body if my hands got too high she’d lower them down her thighs . It was a bit difficult to get the rhythm going but I somewhat managed in the end. 

After a long while she let go and went back to dancing with her girlfriends .  

I had an amazing time. 

Though, I really wish I got her number, it wouldn’t of made a big difference because I live in Florida..",03Dec2019,1

994,"I recently started a new job a few months ago and things were going great. Everyone was so positive and it was such a friendly atmosphere to work in. But over the course of this past month everything has flipped, or maybe I've just noticed how the work place is now, or maybe they've stopped making it look 100% appealing because they know I'll stay. I don't know.

All I know is that I have made a lot of mistakes, I own up to them whenever I do make mistakes. And the training is still on-going because the job is pretty complex. I write everything down and when I don't remember something I refer to my notes. However, there are some things that were not taught and I got blamed for. I took the blame, figuring that maybe I forgot and it's no big deal. But it seems to me that since I've been owning up to my own mistakes that makes it okay to blame me for everything that goes wrong. This is negatively impacting my mood, making me not want to go into work, and is causing my depression to rear it's ugly head again. 

There have been at least 5 things recently that I was never told about, because if I had I would've made notes, and I was blamed for the result of the mistakes that I made because I didn't know not to do things differently. I took the blame, apologized profusely, mentioned that it wasn't mentioned to me before but that I would know better for next time. Problem solved, right? Nope. Everything that goes wrong gets blamed on me. I guess it's easy to place all the blame on someone who is new to the job. A coworker blamed me twice for something that they did, their name was on the submission and I fixed things for them and then told them that I corrected their post via email. They never apologized for blaming me, they were just like ""ok thanks"". 

Today I got blamed for something that went missing, my boss went ballistic and started yelling at me asking me where it was. The task was finished and he had filed the files elsewhere. He had screamed at me, figured out it was his mistake, and then was like ""oh there it is"", but never apologized to me. I know shit rolls downhill. But the fact that I get blamed or yelled at every single day is having a huge negative impact on my mental health. 

So I'm wondering: What should I do? It's not financially feasible for me to find another job, and I don't want to be accused of job hopping. I don't have enough job experience to find a better paying job at the moment. I know that I have to tough this out, but I don't really know how I'm going to manage to do that. Does anyone have any advice for not letting things get to me? I take things personally a lot and I'm sure that's playing a large factor in this. But I also can't help but think that this work environment is pretty toxic. 

Any advice? Thanks in advance, if anyone sees this that is.",03Dec2019,1

A few months back he got a girlfriend and she's beautiful I gotta say that, I was really happy and excited for him when I heard but she has been nothing but rude to me.

I’m not sure if that’s why, but he asked me after class if everything was ok and if there’s anything he needed to know about? I also had to keep myself from crying in his class because I was tearing up on a couple occasions, which I don’t think was visible but maybe.

Honestly I have been struggling a lot in the last month and it’s been more difficult for me to keep up with my job.

1003,"Some background:

1. In September of this year I got a new job that was a total swap of industries for me. I moved from retail/e-commerce/marketing into systems administration. I was likely not the most qualified candidate, but portrayed an eagerness to learn and adapt - so I was hired. I’ve been successful the last few months and did very well on my 45 day performance review. I love the new gig but there is SO. MUCH. TO. LEARN.

2. I stayed on with my old job for 9-10 hours a week, so I’m still doing a lot of the things I was doing - just on a smaller scale. 

3. My wife and I run a wedding/portrait/event photography business on the side. This is in constant need of upkeep, social media, blog posts, and then actual shooting/editing etc.

So, that catches you up. I’m lost on where and how to prioritize these things. On one hand, new job has the potential to be my career for ever. A solid institution with lots of upward mobility and I’m getting experience in a field that’s highly in demand and pays well. So I feel obligated to just come home and study study study.

Maintaining the old job is fine for right now - my wife and I are saving for a house and I’m comfortable with the tasks I’m doing. There’s not really a ton that I have to “learn”, just maintenance tasks.

The photography stuff is something I’m passionate about, and enjoy doing, and let’s me sate my creativity. 

I come home and have so many things I want to do - read, write, learn, watch tutorials, code, edit photos, tweak the website, write blogs, that very little ends up getting done because I’m so overwhelmed. There’s just too much that I want to do, that I want to learn.

So, I guess that brings me to my question. How do I prioritize my life in a way that helps me achieve personal career goals, sate my interests and passions, keeps my wife happy, while still saving some time for sleep? Is it actually not that bad and I’m blowing it out of proportion? Anyone have similar experiences or gone through the same type of things? Do I just do one thing each day?",03Dec2019,1

In one of them that we shared last year, she said that she enjoyed the aspect of competition between the two of us because it inspired her to do better. Never mind that I would be getting grades like 97% and she'd get a 95%, so we'd both be doing well and have no need for one-upmanship, but she seemed to get a kick out of it. I never really cared how she did but it helped her do well and it didn't bother me, so I was ok with it.

I took a math class that she's taking now, and she asked me for the labs that I completed the semester before. I gave her the first few until I was offered to TA the class this upcoming semester, so I cut her off saying I was working for the department now and it would be unprofessional of me to continue giving her my labs to look at. She said no worries, praised me for having good boundaries, and moved on.

Today, I was offered to TA another class so I'll be tutoring for two separate courses next semester. I was excited and put it on my close friends instagram story to announce to a handful of people I trust. Most of my friends sent me congratulations or didn't reply to it, which seemed standard--even my ex reached out to say congrats. But she texted me, ""sounds like it's going to be an easy semester for you, I have to do xyz..."" 

So maybe I'm overthinking this and she meant that as a positive thing, but it did kind of feel like a backhanded compliment saying that I won't be working very hard/didn't have to do much to get where I am. It's a little yikes, but not a big one. Is it worth talking to her about?

(she doesn't have a good relationship with her mom like at all) I know that sometimes you just can't sleep or just can't get up to eat but the way she tells me about it seems like she's not even trying. She's a really good person she just has her times and they can really stress me out. Am I being selfish for wanting to just take a break from her for a little? All she needs is someone to be there for her but sometimes it drains me to. I don't know what I should do.",03Dec2019,1
1011,Hi I’m jimmy. I’m a unhappy guy. Ive been unhappy for years. My question is I don’t wanna be a depressing guy to be around but I don’t wanna pretend to be happy. I wanna be there for friends and help others and make them happy. It seems I’m not able to do that though. I can’t find people who appreciate having me around. I have friends that care about me but not people who need me or want me. I just want people to want me around. I am a pretty annoying and weird person to talk to. Thing is I don’t have anything to really talk about with people. What can I do. Btw I’m still in high school (Junior).,03Dec2019,1
1012,"Hi I'm 17 years old and I need help. When I went to the doctors office, they didnt think that I had the flu and thought it may just be a cold. I've never had a cold this bad and I have had the flu in the past and I dont remember it being this bad. My throat feels like it's full of needles and it hurts to swallow water or even my own saliva when I need to clear my throat. My nose is so stuffy that I need to breathe through my mouth. My throat is congested and I have to suffer through the needle pain and and basically cough up a lung to get rid of the mucus so i can breathe better. The doctor told me that there is really nothing they can do and i would just have to fight through it. I am not trying to exaggerate the severity here. I realize I sound like I'm bitching about nothing and haven't had to deal with much if I'm getting worried over a cold, but trust me I usually have a high tolerance to pain. I went 15 years without being diagnosed with Celiac Disease, and ate gluten daily. Since then, I haven't had some sickness worry me as much as this does now. I have had a few times today where it was hard for me to breathe and I'm worried that all that mucus and stuff is going to clog up while I sleep and basically choke me. Please, any advice is helpful. I swear I'm not exaggerating and above else I'm worried about my breathing. Thank you for your time reading this.",03Dec2019,1
1013,"It's probably no big deal, but my indoor cat was rubbing against my glasses and drooled..a lot.. onto them and it splashed right into my eye.

I instinctively whipped my glasses off and proceeded to wipe off my eyelids.. but her drool was definitely administered like an eye drop.

Should I wash my eye out with tap water, try to make a saline solution to flush it out with filtered water, or just CHILL because it's probably not a problem?
