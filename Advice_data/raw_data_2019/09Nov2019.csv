1,"Help. about a week ago one of my friends have been being overly-aggressive.  

It started on discord as a friendly  (or so I thought)  roasting, until the next day at school, he was still aggravated. At this point, it has turned into what I consider bullying. He started making fun of me, my test marks, and overall making going to school a lot worse. 

he has been physically bullying me as well, by pushing me into lockers, pushing me, and even attempting to fight me IN CLASS. Today, he tried to fight me after school. I backed out, because I didn't want to fight someone who I called a friend. 

No, I haven't considered telling his mom, because she is just as crazy as he is. I doubt that she will discourage this kind of behavior.

What complicates this even more, is that my kind friends are ALSO friends with him, and would stick to his side in this argument. They are smarter than he is, but he still has a stronger relationship with them.

So, Reddit, help. I'm wondering what I should do in this situation. And yes, I have considered talking to a teacher.",09Nov2019,1
3,"So, I'm talking to this girl who has obvious mental issues, and after talking to her for a while, I realize that she doesn't exactly know how the world works, this is how the conversation went:  


Me: ""Do you talk to a therapist or anything like that?""  
Her: ""Yes.""  
Me: ""Have you talked to them about these issues you're having?""  
Her: ""No, fuck therapists, they don't help.""  


So, when someone says that, I immediately take it as a HUGE red flag, and I don't think many people will disagree with me, but I kept talking to her about it, to figure something out.  


Me: ""Hey, don't say stuff like that, it's not true.""  
Her: ""It is.""  
Me: ""Have you ever acted on anything the therapist has told you to do?  Cause if you never take a therapist seriously, never do any of the things they suggest, or never listen to them, of course they won't help. You have to actively work with them, and use their advice to get the proper effect. I know that you might be impatient, and wanting your life to get better immediately, but it takes time and effort. Do you actually take action on your therapist's advice?""  
Her: ""Shit doesn't work""  
Me: ""Yes, but have you tried the stuff they tell you to do?""  
Her: ""No, I'm lazy.""  


...at this point, I'm facepalming hard, because in my mind, I'm thinking that nobody can actually be this stupid, can they? I mean, obviously I didn't say that, cause that would have pissed her off, but I kept going.  


Me: ""Then it's not the therapist's fault, now, is it?""  
Her: ""It's totally her fault.""  
Me: ""...that's not how life works.""  
Her: ""Yes it is.""  
Me: ""...are you serious? You have to be fucking with me right now, please tell me you're joking around.""  
Her: ""No, I'm not.""  


...what the fuck do I do in this situation? Like, what do I tell this woman? Is she even worth trying to help at this point, if she has this mindset? Please tell me what to do, cause at this moment I'm completely fuckin' lost and dumbfounded.",09Nov2019,1
4,"SOOO.. watched this guy grow up along with his siblings (1 disappeared, 1 got run over...) grabbed him ASAP. He was the friendliest and could pet him already so grabbing wasn’t a problem. 

I kept him separate for the 2 weeks, took him to the vet (good health), brought him inside (previously in a heated garage.. we are renovating) and gave him his own room for the time being.. resident cat hissed through the door.. gave it a night.. put kitten in a crate and let resident cat see him.. hissing non stop.. 
we even tried putting both cats on leash and harness and let them see each other that way .. more hissing from resident cat and then she just goes off and does whatever. No aggression from the kitten at all towards her. He just wants to be held and cuddled all the time.. 

Just wondering if anyone has any tips? Or should I just be patient? 

Resident cat was I THINK abused by her litter mate with her previous owner.. so I think it’s more fear aggression?",09Nov2019,1

Anyway I’m 19 now a lot of that’s stuffs still with me ended up walking on to a college and after I finally got cleared for practice I was ruled ineligible so since I’m not at college I’m not around a whole lot of people and i feel the same amount of emptiness I felt then and Everytime I tell people this they just tell me to let it go it’s in the past so it got me to thinking what is it that has me not letting go? is it Truma,ptsd, or normal?

8,"This is something I desperately want to improve upon myself, more so than anything like getting in shape or even studying more for my A-Levels cause I feel if I get this right, everything else will fall into place

As the title explains, I am very socially awkward. I am definitely a naturally shy person my nature and personality but I feel as if something branched from that in a bad way and has led me to trying to fix me. 

Apparently when I was a young kid, I was a very chatty and loud person but I think it all changed when I moved countries. I moved from Ireland to England and kids bullied me relentlessly in primary school for my accent so I never talked in hopes that people would forget. At secondary school, I guess my personality changed so much that being socially awkward and quiet was in my nature. 

I am in a good place now I suppose. I have a good set of friends and I enjoy being with them and I can actually talk to them in a clear voice. But with other people, thats a whole new story. In school, I struggle to communicate with people and this is mainly because I really don’t know how to approach them. I see other do it and they make it look so easy but I just fuck it up each time and make others uncomfortable. It’s exhausting.

I crave social interaction with others but even so, if someone were to come up to me, I will quietly panic and slur my words sometimes and talk quietly. In my head, I feel like I know what I am going to say but in execution, it falls apart. I fail so much to hold a conversation. I even know there are people in my school that like me that are outside my social circle but I just can’t go up to them to talk cause I just know I will fuck up somehow. 

Even with my regular set of friends, going out to hang out with them outside of school scares me as I feel as if I am creating too big of a commitment or maybe it’s because I will feel as if I will embarrass them. I am pretty sure every one in my school year has gone to a house party but not me and its not as if I am not invited or interested, I just feel as if I am too awkward to go. 

One of my best friends who we will call Drew; I am amazed by the way he is able to talk to people so easily. He just goes up to someone and does it. I don’t know how. One thing that does make me sad and feel like I am the odd one out is when we are walking and someone leaves in the group and they say “Bye Drew!” but not me. Like, I get it, I never said anything of value to you but I just feel so socially empty. 

I have tried everything. Watching Youtube videos on the issue but when they give their explanations on how to beat Social Awkwardness, I just feel as if their situation was different than mine or as if what they are saying feels empty? I dunno

My mom moved into our 2 bedroom apartment last year and theres been drama between my mom and us (me and my gf). Its been getting really bad lately, my gf is literally raging and getting sooo toxic towards her I never saw her this negative. So last weekend my GF shows me a necklace, ""hey what do you think of this my mom bought it for me"" and right away, I knew I had seen that necklace before. I didnt want to believe it, so I made excuses and kind of ignored it, but today my mom told me shes missing one of her new rings she bought. She left it on her dresser still packaged and because she wanted to return it. And as soon as I heard I started praying ""please dont let it be true please dont let it be true"". My mom went on to explain how shoe boxes have been ""falling out of her closet"" her plate mysteriously broke, her watch screen is broken, despite it being in her jewellry box, now shes missing a ring. And I really didnt want to do this but I went into my gfs dresser and pulled out her jewellry I'm like to my mom, ""anything look familiar?"" And right away my mom picked it out necklace my gf showed me last week. shes like ""omg that's the same necklace your dad gave me when your were born"" I thought, fuck noooooo. I really didnt want it to be true. I really dont know how tf to approach this situation. My moms moving out in a couple of months.

I'm at a point where I started up a new business and I need some time to focus on getting a steady cash flow.. I have a million other things to worry about I dont want to waste time thinking about this right now. I dont know what to do?

24,"Hi guys. I'm not a big forum poster, but I did it before in the past and I got some good advice. Figured I'd try it again.

I realize I'm not the first or last guy to break up with their girlfriend and want their ex back. But this is a very different situation then typical. So hear me out.

Me and my girlfriend had been doing a long-distance relationship for about 3 months. Things have been going amazing. I went and visited her just 3 weeks ago. I flew across the globe to see her, spent 2 weeks there, and things went amazing while I was there. She wasn't after my money, we split the cost of everything even though she lives in a much poorer country than I. We had talked every day since the day we met. We have been struggling with some things, never fighting though. The most common struggle we have is that she is a very hard working and busy woman. She spends a lot of her life working, and she lives tired. At times I would be upset because we only did small talk instead of meaningful conversations. I probably said this to many times because it was inevitably led to our break-up. Here's the thing though. When she broke up with me, she said that she believes I was the right person for her, the one she wanted to spend the rest of her life with, she loves me and how I support her and love her, but she thinks the timing is wrong. She's too busy to give me the relationship that I want, and she doesn't want to hurt me. She also says she's not ready, but I don't fully believe that, I think it's just because she feels stressed out because of how much time work takes up. Before the breakup, she had already scheduled to have work give her less time at work, so that she would have more time for everyday life and for us, but that won't happen until another month. I asked if she would rather just have a break until then, but she says she doesn't think that ""time-outs"" work, and that in a month she doesn't know if things will be better, so she doesn't want to make that expectation. She was very clear that she wanted to leave things open for the future, that she wants the possibility of trying again, but she doesn't want to tie me down until she feels ready, because she doesn't know when she'll feel ready. It has been 5 days since the breakup.

**TLDR / Summary:**

\- Long distance relationship of 3 months

\- She's a very busy person, and lives life tired.

\- She's so busy that we don't have time for meaningful conversations most of the time.

\- She says she believes in the right person for her, I just arrived at a not-so-good time in her life.

\- She feels like she's hurting me because she can't give me everything I want in a relationship.

\- She feels unready because of her life situation with work.

\- Her work schedule will get better in a month.

\- She wants to leave things open for the future, possibly try again, but she doesn't want me to feel committed to her.

\- It has been 5 days since the breakup.

**Somethings you need to know about her:**

\- She's a very honest person. She never lies, and she always says exactly how she feels. Even if it makes me uncomfortable. I have no reason to believe she's just trying to set me down easy.

\- Her job is not a ""stepping-stone"" job. This is the job she will likely keep for MANY MANY years. Her work is stable.

\- 3 days after the breakup, she texted me FIRST to see how I was doing. There was a brief interaction, but she hasn't responded since.

**The advice I need:**

I want her back. I want to have this relationship with her, with nobody else. At the breakup I already told her I'm willing to sacrifice some comforts for a while until things get better. I love her so much, but I don't understand something. If she truly believes I'm the right person for her, why would she break things off? Why wouldn't you try to make things work? It's obvious she wants this relationship with me, but not right now. Why? How do I get her back? What do I say that won't push her away? What should I do? I don't want to wait, to be with her again. And she makes it sound like it could be a very long time until she's ready. If I knew we would get back together eventually I could live with that, but that is no guarantee.

I know this is all very long, but I'm desperate here. I appreciate all the advice anyone can give me. Thanks. Please let me know if there is other information that would be helpful, so that I can add it to the post.",09Nov2019,1
26,"If I do get angry, I have a strong desire to make loud noises by throwing things. Like throwing a tissue box, a pillow, or being loud when doing chores. 

But usually my anger turns into sadness very quickly because I live in an environment where it feels like I’m not allowed to be angry because there are more violent and aggressive angry people in my family (screaming, hitting the wall, blaming words like “Look what you’re making me do”)

Apparently my limited amount of angry expressions isn’t allowed because they make other angry people even more angry when they see/hear these loud bangs.

So I’m back to tears of sadness and frustration again in an isolated place. But I don’t know if I can keep being sad more.

I don’t this is fair. That other people’s anger is more important than mine. But I want to be able to feel angry without being blamed more for feeling this way. Does this make sense? I tired of sacrificing my own feelings",09Nov2019,1

33,"Ok so I live in BC Canada. I'm on disability welfare and my parents bought me this house that I rent from them for super cheap, plus they were giving me extra money every month to survive on. 

So I decided to try to have roommates for the first time in my life, so that I wouldn't have to take anymore money from my parents. So I don't know anything about having roommates.

In my area big rooms are going for about $900 a month, and you can't even find small rooms for less than $500 these days. 

And I didn't want to do the yard work (I used to be a gardener/landscaper as a job and it got to the point I just hated it), so I thought I would like to help someone out with cheap rent in exchange for yard work, because I knew there are a lot of people that love gardening, and I knew there would be someone who would love to have the garden space and access to fruit trees and free fruit, berries, nuts etc, you know especially someone who likes canning and can't afford much, because that's a lot of free food in the summer. It's a decent sized yard, but it's not too much work. It only takes half an hour to an hour to mow it.

So I found this old man who told me he was an ex gardener, and he told me he was on a pension so he couldn't afford anything over $500. I was like shit that's way less than I was hoping to get but I fell for his sob story I guess, I'm a really caring person and know what it's like to struggle to get by, so I ended up agreeing to a temporary rental situation just until winter. The agreement all along was that all he had to do was super basic yard maintenance, and in exchange he got super cheap rent and he could do whatever he wanted with all the fruit and nuts (eat it or sell it), because I really didn't want to deal with it. Quite a few times, I gave him very clear instructions, and twice I had to physically show him what to do. 

But a few times, I caught him doing things I hadn't asked him to do, while the things I had asked him to do were not getting done, and I had to remind him to stick to the priorities a bunch of times. 

And then, he started taking off for weeks at a time, and then, when he was home, all he did was go on the internet all day. He would always have excuses and keep putting it off. When I kept trying to be assertive with him and tell him things needed to get done, he would get defensive and angry. Basically, the guy started taking advantage of me really badly. 

I gave him so many chances, because the whole time I was thinking maybe I could keep him here longterm if we could make it work out, but he took advantage of me too much for that to be worth my while.

At the same time, I also took on another roommate, who moved into a smaller room. Actually, the old guy initially came into to look at that room because it was in his budget, as I was renting it for only $400 a month to help someone out. But he ended up talking me into renting him the big room for $500. God I'm so dumb I never should have agreed to that! Anyway, my other roommate recently moved out on his own accord, and I was okay with that because I didn't quite like the placement of that room (it was too close to my room which was kind of awkward). So with that happening, my plans totally changed, because I decided NOT to rent out that little room ever again. Instead, I thought it would be a way better idea to rent out the big room for $950 and include the little room in it as an unfurnished office or whatever they want to use it for, and then they'd have a private bathroom and their own suite type deal.

So I recently gave the old guy 2 months notice, and he made some concerning comments about how he was going to refuse to move out, plus he had a tantrum and a really bad attitude, and ever since he has stopped pulling his weight around here completely. Before at least he would take the garbage out for example, but he hasn't even done that for many weeks now. Now I am the only one doing housework and yard work. Needless to say, I feel completely taken advantage of and angry. 

But I have been nothing but nice and reasonable to this guy, and it's just not fair to me for him to be doing this. I gave him 2 months notice to be nice and give him more than enough time, but I said, I would really appreciate it if you could find a place sooner than that because I can't afford it in the meantime. Now I'm having to take money from my parents again, because I'm not renting out that little room right now and I'm having a hard time finding jobs on the side right now. But he made some comments that implied he wasn't going to. 

I am very scared that he is going to give me major issues here. I'm not sure what I can do. There was no agreements signed or anything.

I sort of want to shut the internet off to encourage him to move out (plus that would be the fair thing to do for my parents since they are the ones paying for it) and it's all he does all day, they've complained to me that the internet bill has gone up too high, plus he apparently keeps downloading pirated videos and they keep getting notifications from telus that it's against the law. And my dad said he wanted to shut the internet off to get the guy out, but I don't know if that's fair? I mean the guy is obviously addicted to the internet, so I think it would give him a definite boost to get out of here lol if that were to happen. Personally I don't care, I can make do without the internet. 

And if push comes to shove, then can I lock him out and just put all of his stuff outside under a tarp? I really don't want it to come to that, but I might have to forcefully evict him. I can, because I have a spare key and the room was totally furnished, the only things he has are his clothes and a few other things he brought in that were his. I feel like, even if he went to authorities, they wouldn't be able to prove he was even living here because there was never anything signed, it was never official or anything. But I don't want to be an asshole. Obviously I'm going to be giving him the time to get out, it's just that I'm genuinely scared this guy is going to refuse to leave all together and I just don't know how to handle that.

I mean, I've already gone down to the local center and got him a list of low income resources for seniors, so I know those places exist. It's just that now he's all spoiled, he doesn't want to rent a low income room, he wants to stay here in a big room where he has enough space to dance, without paying for it or working for it. And the thing is, this old man isn't incapable of working, he's probably way more fit than I am!

34,"I’ve been stuck staying up till 2-4 every night and waking up at 10-12 every morning for too long. I finally got back to a decent schedule on Sunday which has gotten progressively better where now last night I was able to fall sleep at a little past 12 and wake up at a little past 7.

I never want to stay up unwillingly past 12 again or wake up past 8.

I’ve had times where I had a normal sleep schedule and looking back it seems like one lobby night messed it all up for a while.

I usually feel the desire to take a nap around 2-4, would you advice against it? I was thinking maybe when I solidify my 12 am sleep time more then I can probably get away with a 30 min nap and still be able to sleep at night.

Would you advice against having a late night on a Friday/Saturday?  Or would you stay away from people who stay out late? I’d love to be social and be with people weekend nights but I’m tired of having a bad sleep schedule and suffering in the morning. I know people who go home by 12 am.

over the summer my dad tried to kill himself in front of me. 

my mum asked him for a divorce and he just got really upset. i tried to stop him and i tried to explain that i love him and need him but he said it isn't enough. i've never seen my dad cry before, not even when my nan died. he calmed down and everything was ok for a bit but he tried again the next weekend. i was all on my own with him this time, my mum phoned from work to tell me to lock all the doors and not let him out because he had threatened suicide again. i forgot to hide the back door keys and he escaped and jumped over the neighbours fence, i screamed after him that i love him but he just stared at me and then kept running, the police showed up because my mum had been on the phone to them during this and he had hit her and they heard her scream, so the police were at the house when my dad came back and they took him away… then they phoned later to say he had to be taken to hospital instead because he had overdosed. he was ok. 

not long ago there was another big fight in my house and i told my dad i hated him. i don't really and i told him i didn't later but he told me to go away. 

i feel like no one understands what im going through. i feel really lonely and sad all the time and i don't care about the things my friends care about. i get scared about going home after school because i don't want something to happen, i hate being home on the weekends or for school holidays because i don't want to see anything else. what do i do? i feel like my friends just want me to cheer up and get over it and that it's not a big deal at all.

I recently started a job at a marketing firm and usually stay late at the office. 
This past Wednesday I cleaned out the communal fridge before I left.
I came into work today on Friday and my boss was chatting with me and mentioned our other Co worker ""Jesse"" had her red bull stolen from the fridge Wednesday, and how much it sucks because we were the only ones here that night and he doesn't drink red bull. I could tell he was insinuating that I took it. I said that sucks and that I'd keep an eye out for it. But I get the sense he doesn't believe me.
Later Friday night I put my drink in the fridge, and sitting there behind a few items is the red bull. It wasn't there before on Wednesday night and was placed pretty clearly in sight. I call Jesse over and ask if it's hers. She is surprised and asks if I put it there. I tell her no that I just found it!
No one has mentioned it, but I'd hate to start this new job with my boss and coworker thinking I'll steal their stuff! 
Is there anything I can do to clear my name? Should I text my boss and let him know we found her red bull?
Should I just leave things be and accept whatever my boss thinks of me?

Said former teacher has been suicidal for years. He will not do anything about it. He has a master’s degree yet he’s dirt poor. Every time he gets a job, soon after he’s unable to get out of bed because of his illnesses and he’ll lose the job shortly thereafter. This has continued for years.

My mother [54F] has also been giving this man money for years. He asks us nearly daily, and while we pay for his groceries, he asks us for cash. I don’t think he’s a drug addict — but sometimes he’ll ask us to Venmo him ten bucks so he can get a meal.

Problem is, my family has basically no more money right now. I had to get student loans to pay for my remaining years of college because my parents can’t afford their parent loans. We cannot keep supporting him. Neither me nor my mom knows what to do. We don’t want to just cut ties with him because we do care about him, but since we’re pretty much all he has left, it would basically result in his suicide. He tells us this too.

about two months ago he got a new girlfined who lives out of town and i havent met yet but who is jealous/intimidated by me (i know bc he told me when they were fighting that him and me texting made her mad)

two nights ago, my girl friend was having a party and i invited him and he said he would come too but had to check w/ the gf. he got the allclear and decided to come. i was realy excited becuase i hadnt got to see him in a while. and he did come for the pregame and walked throuhg the door to the party. but then he i guess texted his new girlfiend who tehn was upset with him for being there (im not sure if it was because of me or because it was a party or what ever) and he was like ""i have to go, she's really upset with me"" so i told him it was up to him (bc im not gonna add more stress to him) and he left

so im kind of upset about it and idk if its fair for me to be upset. like this girlfriend hasnt never met me before and she is like controlling my frined. i dont get to talk to him as much or see him and the other thing is im realy overweight and kinda dorky and i think shes in a sorority bc she's realy pretty and looks like she has lots of pretty friends on her social media. and im happy for him to have someone like that bc he deserves someone successful but i feel like the ugly friend being pushed to the side. and i feel weird about bringing any of this up bc i dont want him to think i have a crush on him again bc i dont but i dont like his gf at all...

52,"I really wasn’t given the best roll of dice in life. I grew up with the most abusive father you could can imagine: Drunkard, Racist, Bully, Torturer, Manipulater, Degrader, etc,a mother who was so used to this abuse she would blame me for stepping out of line, and a older brother, so psychologically and physically damaged from the torment my father instilled that he took his own life at 17, leaving me to deal with my father alone for 5 years. Despite all that, I rose above the bullshit and became someone I’m at least slightly proud to be: ever since I’ve left my father I’ve lost 133 pounds (from 298 to 165), I’ve started receiving therapy for Depression/Anxiety, and I’ve finally started receiving medication for my ADHD.

TLDR; I went from Hell to something much, much better

On top of all that, I even managed to find a girlfriend, my first ever one. This is where the advice part comes in.

My girlfriend doesn’t know anything about my 
past. My dad, the trauma, the weight, my issues, etc. I haven’t even kissed her/ touched her romantically because I have issues with that too. To her, I’m just a somewhat funny nerdy white dude who is a nice mixture of cringe/charming. I kept It from her because in the past when I have actually opened up about my issues to people who see how I usually act without prior knowledge. They never look at me the same way, or even start to desert me, saying “I can’t handle all of that, it’s just too much on my mental health”. Thankfully I have met a some people who stay my friends and treat me the same regardless of my past, and I cherish them. Despite that, I’m still scared to open up to her. She’s really innocent (I.E. not used to super fucking trauma), and has anxiety that I’m worried I could trigger by speaking to her about it. There’s also a part of me that worries that she’ll look at me differently after this, and that would honestly crush me. I know I shouldn’t keep things from a significant other, honestly is everything in a relationship I know that. 

My question isn’t really if I should do It, but how. Thank you to anyone who replies.",09Nov2019,1
53,"Long story short, currently I’m a live-in caregiver for 5 days out of the week. The job is really depressing, dirty, and mentally tolling. I have a wife and son (3 years old) and it absolutely kills me that I cannot lead a “normal” life and see them each day. Even with the two days I get off (Sunday and Monday) is not really two full days as my wife goes to school Mondays. 

I’ll include as many details below as possible so you all can grasp my current situation. Please recommend some jobs that I could look into to change my life around. 

Unfortunately,  there aren’t many jobs that pay as much as live-in caregiving ($175 per day). Additionally, there are other benefits like not having to drive so I save a lot on gas, throw in my laundry with his, etc. 

But as good as the pay is, every single day I’m in HELL. I start each day with a “bowel program” where I insert a suppository inside of another man, then smell excrement when he goes. Inserting the suppository itself is a mission; it doesn’t just go right in, it takes a lot of effort and stimulation to actually get it up there. The rest of each day I just sit there in depression awaiting orders to get barked at me. This continues even during the night, as even in the best case scenario I’m woken at least 5 times a night. It’s like being on call 24/7. It’s depressing enough to be around someone who’s always in pain, depression, or some issue he’s dealing with. 

The isolation sucks... I don’t get to leave even for a short walk, as my patient is a quadriplegic and requires 24/7 assistance. I miss my wife and son so much...I feel like everyone is living life while I’m letting it pass by as I slowly die.

Even the live-in situation is total garbage. I don’t get my own room, the extra room my patient has he rents to a roommate. All I have is a corner of the living room with a bed. Next to the smelly kitchen. So not only do I have zero privacy as-is, but also have to deal with strangers he rents his other room to. 

All this is not to even mention that I have to put up with doing things that are illegal. For example, legally you need to be given a 10 hour break after working 12 hours. I work 5 days in a row (60 hours) without any type of a break. The bowel program, giving medication, changing his catheter, giving testosterone shots...all more examples of things that are illegal for someone that is not a nurse. 

The problem: my wife doesn’t work as she has a year of medical school left so I am the sole provider. We barely make it by with the $175 per day earnings. Once she starts working, I’m going back to school to get a career. But for the next year or a bit longer, I have to be the sole provider. 

So..can anyone please please please help me out of this hell and suggest some other jobs I could try? I’m not afraid to work (obviously) I can do hard labor, construction, overtime, whatever! I just want to make at least the same money I do now and can be home each night (even if for a few hours) with my family like a typical person. 


To give you some background, here is how I destroyed my life and got to this point. I’m 36. Graduated art school. One of the most prestigious schools too (The School of the Art Institute of Chicago). I was under the assumption that when paying $120,000+ for a degree, that I could land a job that pays at least 60 grand per year. After graduation, I was offered a janitorial position!!! I was pissed. Worked odd jobs to make ends meet. 

Then my dad said “Try real estate” as that was his profession. Got licensed. He then said “too late” as it was the time of the big crash and the market was horrible. 

As I was in a financial crisis, I became a live-in caregiver for an older gentleman who was a friend of the family. It paid great so I tried it. Unfortunately, the isolation ended up getting to me, and I quit after losing my mind after like a year or so.

Then I got back into real estate after a few years and the market got better (got licensed again). Thought my dad would be a huge help to build my client base as he’s been in real estate for almost 20 years. Nope. We actually have a bad relationship and I couldn’t stand working with him. He also did nothing to teach me nor help me build a client base. I also hated how you got paid. Best case scenario you are waiting at least 3-6 months for a paycheck (looking/selling, negotiating, inspection, attorney review, financing, etc.). They also don’t take taxes out, so you are really screwed at the end of the year unless you send it quarterly yourself. This type of job makes budgeting basically impossible as even a “sure” deal can fall apart at closing. 

I then tried my hand at insurance sales (life insurance) so again I got licensed to sell health and life insurance. Long story short, the company I worked for was a pyramid scheme and again a job that is 100% commission doesn’t work for my current life situation. I worked really long hours daily (weekends too) and traveled a lot. After getting burned by the company I thought I would try a more reputable company, and worked for Allstate. Had to get more licenses as I needed a property and casualty license too. Got both. The office I worked for was again horrible, and again the commission based job really sucked. By the way... I HATE sales!

During that time, I was working so much and down so bad that I started taking prescription medication for my depression. That, along with a lack of sleep, led to 3 major accidents and my car insurance jumped so high that I can’t afford it ($700 per month!) This really screwed me, as it excludes me from a lot of good paying jobs like trucking which I cant get for at least a few years due to the accidents. 

So please....can someone make some suggestions so that I can live a semi-normal life? I’m afraid that I won’t be able to make it mentally with this job. If it makes a difference, I live in the Chicagoland area. I was thinking of maybe doing construction, but as it’s winter, this is probably the worst time to get into it. 

I have a degree. Clean criminal record. I’m smart, educated, and a hard worker. Is a normal 9-5 job that pays well enough for me to support my family simply too much to ask for? Please help!!! I just need a good paying job for a year until I can go to school for a degree or certification of some kind (almost set on being a lineman). 

I really appreciate anyone and everyone making suggestions because sometimes when you are buried in the darkness of depression, it’s really hard to see a way out.",09Nov2019,1
54,"Hi reddit I met this girl on Tinder about a week ago and we hit it off. She told me she lived with a female roommate who is her best friend, Kris. Cool. Then she starts talking about how before I come over, she has to ask Kris if it's okay. Weird. Usually roommates have the courtosy to warn each other before guests come, but dont have to ask permission. She says Kris is protective of her because shes been hurt in the past, and usually asks a lot of questions to whoever she dates. Weird as well, but not completely unheard of.

Fast forward to today. I pick her up and take her out to eat. As we drive back to her place, she gets increasingly nervous of how Kris will react to me. She says they had a fight this morning because she accidentally woke Kris up. Again, weird that Kris held a grudge all day over that. By the time we pull up, she doesn't want to go inside. I tell her no pressure, and we can stay outside in the car and talk if she wants to. We move to the back seat to cuddle. She is laying her head on my lap.

About 15 minutes later, Kris comes out of the house and stares at us a few meters from the car. When I said ""uh, is that Kris?"", my date jumps up and opens the door. Kris yells ""Why the fuck are you sitting in the back seat of the car? My neighbors are out here. Just go inside the fucking house"". She didn't introduce herself or anything, just questioned and gave us commands. Then starts talking to the neighbors, audibly talking shit about us. 

I told my date I would go ahead and leave, as I didn't want to go into such a hostile environment, and drove off. I've been home about 2 hours now, and my date told me they got into a huge fight and Kris was screaming at her in her face. My date said she would be moving out, and Kris threatened that if she did, she would kick her ass.

My date drove Kris' girlfriend's car to work and is there now from 6pm to 6am central time. Now my date is scared to return and attempt to get her belongings. She doesn't have another place to stay, either. I offered her a place for at least the weekend but I live with my parents and can't just take her in. I am looking up about women's safe houses near her area, but none seem to be taking calls right now.

What are my options? I'm scared for her as I have been in an abusive situation before and this roommate appears unhinged. My date swears that Kris has never put her hands on her before, but I'm not sure whether I believe this. I'm think shes trapped and I'm not sure how else I can help her in this situation. Would a police non-emergency hotline be able to point me in the direction of the right resources? This girl shouldn't have to be scared to return to her own living space. How can I help her get safe??",09Nov2019,1

The venue we have been looking at for a year finally has an opening... next month. Yes it’s soon, but we are ready. We have been living together for 2 years. I’m younger than him so that took some adjustments from my family. But every time we see any friends, or family the first question is “have you guys set a date!?” It’s asked literally anytime we are around people. It’s highly annoying. 

So now we have the date and made the announcement. 

Why has every single family member or friends first reaction is “wow that’s so soon, is she pregnant?” 

Why is it so weird to everyone? We have been talking about venues and a Christmas wedding for over a year now. Now that we finally set a date everyone is confused and assumes I’m pregnant?? Which is so inconsiderate to me. I know no one means anything by it. But WHAT THE FUCK. 

I talked to my mom about it. She says people have forgotten the way things are supposed to be done, find a person, date, get engaged, get married. Because so many people date, get pregnant and then get married because you’re supposed to be married when you have kids

During her visit, she made some great food and I liked it a lot. I regret telling this to my dad.

After some time, they soon started to come once a day every week. I didn't mind that either because I thought ""great food"" and I still had my space. I'm very strict/comfortable with my space in the house ever since I got used to staying in my house alone until 3:45pm while my dad work during the summer vacation of maybe 3 grade to now. Well I thought wrong, food wasn't great anymore and I soon got toys throw at me and bring pushed almost every time I was standing by her son.... Still didn't mind because I realized, at that time I could have gotten almost anything I want because they were just there with us.

It soon got old.

I didn't want stuff anymore. I wanted my space....but also the attention my dad was giving them. I remembered how he showed me love and attention when I was a kid. But now it's fights and at times, putting me down when I don't know how to do things or when he can't understand what I'm telling me. At those times, he gets mad. At a certain time in my life, I would be very scared when he got mad for I thought it was cause of me and he would yell at me so I would go in my room and stay there. I got very used to being in my room...He doesn't know that I would gladly give my body away to any man that showed me any affection when I was 13....and I did at age 15 to one of his old friends. Now ex friend of my dad's. My dad doesn't know a lot about my life and he wonders why I don't tell him about it I think.

But dispute that, I still love my dad with my whole heart. At times, he asks me if I was bothered when the family came... I said no because I saw how happy he was with her and I wanted him to be happy. My fault I know. Now, I'm bothered by it so much that every time I see them in the house (they are coming almost everyday now, spending the nights). I'm hurt that he spends so much time and attention with them but when it was us, I rarely got that. He would go places when she asks to go somewhere. I would have gotten a no because ""I'm tired."" ""Gas costs money"" and others.

I don't even want to go home at times because I don't want my mood to go down. Never in my life have I felt my body and mind go straight to being tired when seeing someone. 

I got in trouble today, mostly an hour ago. I stayed home from school cause I just needed a break from everything. I remember my dad calling, saying about breaking food home. I thought red flag because every time he brings food home, it's because they went out to eat. I don't like this for I feel he does this to not feel guilty about going out to eat with them and leaving nothing to eat at the house. But I just told myself I was wrong and he was worried. 

5:20 something pm comes around and I hear the door about to open. I stopped from my work of messaging my boyfriend something cute and getting better, and I looked up. I see my dad coming in and I smiled. Then I saw them. I didn't want the food anymore. He gived it to me after I had to say a stressed hi to them. I really didn't want to have a fight. I didn't want to be there anymore so I got up, grab my stuff, and walked to my room. He asked what's wrong with me when I didn't want to speak. I soon broke down and tears came out but I still had to play like nothing is wrong. He gets mad at me which made it worse. Repeating the words ""nothing is wrong"" in the voice I knew meant it's my fault and he is really mad at me, while turning around slowly leaving my room. I had a break down after closing my door. Later he came in and got more mad because I place the bag of food on the floor. I can't eat it while sobbing. I know I'll throw it up. I was already coughing from crying to hard. He then leaves again. 

And here I am, typing this while listening to country music and crying.... I don't know what to do anymore. I can't speak up for I know he will get mad at me. But I can't go through this for 9 months until college, that is if I get into one. And I really really don't want to break and do something I will regret.",09Nov2019,1
67,I've tried all the methods online. I've wasted 4 pills and went through an entire bottle of water because I keep failing to swallow my pills. When I try to swallow the pill I end up only swallowing my water and the pill ends up barely moving at all. I'm really frustrated right now.,09Nov2019,1
68,"So the situation is that we have research papers as a semestral projects and its incrsdibly hard. Long story short this guy always passes the day before a deadline at around 10pm or 11pm. The work he passes is always just one or two paragraphs and was written like a kid who just read the topic and wrote an essay.

He always does this and says he tries his best. Meanwhile I have to edit it at night and basically re write the whole thing. In all honesty at first I was delusional and allowed him to fuck around because I thought to myself ""maybe my standards are just too high and I shouldnt be too harsh on him. If I want a paper that is for honor students I shouldnt push it to others.""

However after several months of this almost non existent work, I finally broke down and realized how stupid I was by practically writing our entire **group** paper. For example, for review of related literature, instead of actually reading the materials that I found because ""it was too hard to loom for GPS"" studies, the guy actually went to google and just took paraphrased sentences from the top result.

Its been months and theres still nothing. Right now the only reason why I havent removed him is fear, guilt, and pressure. This guy is extremely friendly with our classmates and Im afraid of being ostracized, or getting singled out with the biggest workloads. There has been no signs of this happening though, its just my anxiety (which is one of the reasons why Im on this sub). Next is guilt, even though he made garbage he still helped. Even though I know he definitely deserves to be rude, Im too weak and easily convinced that I feel like Im the one doing something wrong.

I wrote evwrything down in a list and felt like he objectively doesnt deserve to get these grades, but I just really want a second opinion, some advice, or someone to reason out to me why I need to remove him.

69,"I’m a teenager, so is my sister. My parents have been married for almost 28 years. 

They’ve been fighting a lot, probably the past year or two, I don’t know. My sister has told me they’ve been doing this and she’s had to deal with it long before I knew. 

It’s not just little arguments, it’s full on screaming, threatening divorce, saying they’d rather die, etc. I don’t get involved, I usually just cry and hide in a room because it makes me extremely anxious. My sister always gets involved, she doesn’t know when to shut her mouth, (sorry that sounds mean). 

Today was bad, and it’s still going on. They (parents) went to lunch and came back around 6 yelling at each other. The usual, calling my dad a baby, my mom insecure, claiming my dad is cheating, etc. I sat in the basement and was bawling my eyes out, I’m still down there. I tried to drown it out with loud music but I guess the floors are thin(?). 

My mom was saying how she wants to die and my sister yelled at her, something along the lines, that my sister does too.  

I don’t know what to do anymore, I can’t talk to my friends about this, I’ve tried online counseling (which you have to pay for), I’m too nervous to call someone. I’m thinking about talking to the school counselors, I’m not sure though, do they contact parents or is it between the two of you? 

I just need advice, who can I contact for help, what should I do to get my mind off/away from this, how do I drown out the yelling?

73,"let's me just start introduce myself as a miserable single 30M, I am always a nerd in my earlier age, like, the kind who only read book, study, play games and view relationship/sex as non essential, while my love life in my college life is non existent. I have a dream with becoming games maker, but I'm not born in well off family to begin with, when I work for like 1 years, one of my friend have string with grey area business and invited me to join him since I'm quite good in my field of work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided this is a great opportunity to secure funding for my game making, so I join him, mistake, don't get me wrong, he is a great guy, while have his flaw but he never backstab me, and is paying too, the business is not something like killing, robbing, drug dealing etc, its just morally questionable, I just can't get through myself, I underestimate my rightousness and I found myself keep fighting back, but at the same times, I making a small sum of money with alot of free time, to struggle against my own action. I felt that I failed my friend and I need to make up for this, but at the same time, I don't want to do this anymore, I stay in this condition for like 5 years, needless to say this severely affect my performance, last year, at my 29, I finally put a bitter end on this, 5 years of back and forth has severely impact relationship with my friend, we no longer talk, out of curiousity I go out for interview with a few company, and found that my knowledge is outdated, this is when I realized I don't have support when I need one, all of life is void of love, there is no one there to support me, at 29, I have outdated job experience, have zero relationship experience, and didn't even pursuit my dream game maker life, all my free time is wasted on fighting myself, a total failure if you ask me.

&amp;#x200B;

in my country, there is always tabloid news about lonely single middle age men setup by young women, love trap, I kinda relate with these men, I always think I will be one of them soon, I imagine myself as a perfect prey for these young women since I literally have zero relationship experience, this scare me.

&amp;#x200B;

at first I thought I'm fine, I'm fighter and I going to earn it all, the moment I step out of my friend business, I felt like some burden is moved from my body, I felt less stressful, and feeling like I'm in charge now, but I just don't know I can handle it anymore. I decided to pursuit my game maker life now since I'm earn a small sum of money while working with my friend, at the same time, I trying to fix my love life one step at a time by start talking with women online at streaming platform. I think this is the another mistake I make, there's a streaming channel hosted by a women, at first I just talk to her get a feeling of talking with women, I speak to her like how I imagine a face to face meetup casual talk would instead of solely focus on her streaming content, she doesn't seems to hate it, as time goes on I start to relate with her more and more, I start to have a feeling with her, I think she have a feeling with me too, so I start to win her over, like trying to ask her out, she refuse but later give back some positive signal, a few times, I just, don't know anymore, I have zero relationship experience, I don't even know my signal reading is on point, is she just being polite? or just being shy? is she just play me as a fool?

&amp;#x200B;

I have some progress in my game maker in first few months, but ever since this relationship develop, I go into depression and stopped working on my game

this year, 30, I felt like my life is a train wreck, I don't know, maybe, I shouldn't even try to think about relationship first, I still want her, but I not sure if this is right anymore, maybe I just don't want to let go? I just don't know

I have been doing nothing for 2 months now, I think I'm damaged, I wasted 5 years of most important year in infighting, I'm undesciplined, weak minded, lazy, useless, no partner, no job, no joy, nothing, I have nothing, I'm nothing.

A.homeless
B.drinks during the day and comes in drunk
C.will drink when he is working the bar, only when the new managers are on. 
D.has almost caused fights with people who were being 86'd

I had enough of him doing this causing me to run all events and our front desk. So I just reported all of this activity to my district manager since my general manager didnt do anything except say ""we'll let his parole officer deal with him"" (he isnt supposed to drink while on parole). Now note the assistant general manager liked to drink after work within our center. 

Today I got a text to our management text group that consumption of alcohol was forbidden by managers within the center at all times. This is going to cause a major stir up for the center since we are all hyper social workers. So I guaranteed that I am going to come back to a building of workers and a few managers who are going to absolutely hate me.

85,"This is all condensed and maybe a little out of order cause it’s a lot. This is the mother of my God child by the way and I don’t know what to do! This boyfriend was a friend of a friend of a friend of my boyfriends and came to a party I threw for her for her bday. They start dating. She already has him watching the baby alone no later than 3 months in. Her mom (baby’s grandmother) gets pissed and accuses the man of molesting the baby. Which I find out later the apartment she moved to only has one bed (no bed for 2 almost 3 year old) so they have to be in the same bed at one point. Baby’s biological dad is active in life and pissed at the whole situation but she’s blaming it on jealousy which I don’t think is the whole story. I already am not a huge fan of him because he just looks a little off to me.  (We find out later he’s prob coked our. Or that’s what it looks like to me now that I see the whole picture. He’s skinny asf. Looks dead in the face) 
Next I find out he’s selling big boy drugs. Makes sense cause he’s paying for EVERYTHING I’m like wtf does he do for a job. I’m not gonna say specifically but it’s a couple top ones and it’s not cannabis. I am PISSED. First thing I ask her is wtf are you doing these drugs. She says no and I believe her based solely on her behavior when I see her and the baby is clean and fed even tho she quit her job to go to Tokyo for a MONTH with her, him and the baby even tho bio dad said no. (He’s paying for it) weird to me a man would take another mans baby even tho he said no. They ended up not going because dad wouldn’t sign papers to let baby go out the country. I’m telling her the whole time like “wtf you cant do that” but if you have friends u know how certain ones are and how they can be set. I am concerned for the baby’s safety but don’t want to interfere too much. You know, have my friend go to jail, have the baby get taken. I have the moms (grandmother) phone number and thought about calling to tell her but this could really end our friendship and it feels like betrayal.

She lost her father last year, her mother earlier this year, and she's gotten into several fights with her older sister over her parents' assets. There is also a stressful event that may or may not happen in her life early next year that has her on edge.

She's an artist type, and I'm unfortunately very analytical and a numbers person. We struggled to communicate before this year, and it's gotten even worse as the year went on. 

She's become very critical of every deliverable -- from the recommendations, to even how I worded it. There is always something wrong, and after several days of work, I have to scrap it and start over. It's been like this for most of the year -- in particular, the past two months.

I've been trying to be patient and kind. But after several iterations of this, I'm at the point where I'm at a loss on how to proceed. Even worse, I feel my mind going to a dark place that I don't want to be in.

I can take criticism -- I take it all day. But after jumping through hoops and still being at square one, I feel I need to do something.

What would you do in this situation? I want to continue to support her. But my mental health is suffering. I have the option to fire her as a client.

95,"Long story ahead. Three years ago I lived in a town with a a few thousand people.  I had very close friends there that I would hang out with and talk to them daily. They were like family.  Speaking of family I had very close cousins there as-well. I was in grade 8 at the time. I talked to a lot of people and had many friends. Even a girl that I was interested in that liked me back. Everything was going great, until my parents decided to make us move eight hours away. I was quite upset yet a little optimistic for the new people and opportunities I would have. When I got to my new school it took a few hours and I already had two really good friends. Things were looking great. Around a month after we moved and school had started EVERYTHING went downhill. My grandma passed away and one of my two friends (well call him Jim) started bullying me because the girl he liked started to like me. The girl was across the city and I had only talked to her once with Jim. After this, Jim started to spread rumours about me and got all of the other “popular guys” at my new school to make fun of me. I had a really hard time for around a year, the only thing keeping me optimistic was my old friends that I kept in touch with. Also my other one of my best friends at the time started to distance himself from me a lot. High school came and I finally felt like I had another shot at having more friends again. This again did not go so well. I had some friends that I talked to at school but never hung out with any of them outside of school. At this point I’m in grade 10 and it has been two years since I moved. I started to lose contact with all of my friends and was convinced I would never move back. Grade ten was boring. My grades were fine (high eighties) but I had no social life. This is when I started to play ALOT of video games. I would spend 4-7 hours a day playing and trying to get good. This somewhat payed off when I won 600$ at a tournament but that’s it. It was a massive piece of my life I won’t get back. At the end of grade 10 I still was having a hard time with friends. It didn’t make sense because of how easy it was where I used to live. Summer of Grade 10 I got some of the best news in my life (or so I thought). I was told we were moving back to where I used to live. I was ecstatic. I thought to myself I would finally be back with my old friends, the girl I liked, and my family.  This is now present day. The move went well and we have a nice house. However the girl I liked does drugs and has a boyfriend now. My family has changed a lot and my little (now big) cousins never want to hang out. Also almost all of my friends don’t seem interested in talking to me. School comes around and I talk to a lot of people for the first two days. Then I’m stuck with nobody. All of my old friends have new friends and don’t want to hang out with me. I’m sure I can try and join their friend group but I feel unwanted. One person I actually invited to my cabin, we were there for a week in the summer. We had so much fun. School comes around and he doesn’t even want to talk to me. So I start talking to a really old friend that shares common interests. Right now I have two decent friends but neither of them want to hang out much and I get left on read a lot if I try to make plans. When I do happen to talk to some old friends they seem super happy to see me. I ask them to hang out and they agree to hang out “soon”. Well for 4/4 of my old friends “soon” has not yet happened a few months later even with multiple attempts I made. What happened? When I’m around people they seem laugh at my jokes and like me. But nobody every actually wants to be my friend anymore. Not even my old friends that I knew for 8+ years. I don’t think I’m depressed or anything, I just haven’t been happy in years. I don’t think I am socially awkward or anything. I don’t understand what happened.",09Nov2019,1

I ran back to my boyfriends room for the chips and said to him ""did you know nachos are better reheated in the microwave?"" He was like ""eww no they're not"" and explained why the stove and iven are better. I told him that his dad said the microwave was better. My boyfriend told me his dad told me a small lie because he didn't want me to use the stove for whatever reason and wanted to avoid an awkward situation by saying that the microwave is worse but to use it anyway. And my boyfriend didn't seem to think what he did was a big deal.

It WAS a small lie but to me it felt mean and like he must think I'm not very intelligent. As far as i knew the microwave sucks and doesn't always heat food evenly. BUT like i said I'm not a nacho person so i thought maybe some things really are better in the microwave. Who knows right?
When i told my boyfriend what his dad said to me i half expected it to be untrue. I wanted to see if my boyfriend would tell me if i was lied to or not.

103,"I need some help. Long story ahead. Three years ago I lived in a town with a a few thousand people.  I had very close friends there that I would hang out with and talk to them daily. They were like family.  Speaking of family I had very close cousins there as-well. I was in grade 8 at the time. I talked to a lot of people and had many friends. Even a girl that I was interested in that liked me back. Everything was going great, until my parents decided to make us move eight hours away. I was quite upset yet a little optimistic for the new people and opportunities I would have. When I got to my new school it took a few hours and I already had two really good friends. Things were looking great. Around a month after we moved and school had started EVERYTHING went downhill. My grandma passed away and one of my two friends (well call him Jim) started bullying me because the girl he liked started to like me. The girl was across the city and I had only talked to her once with Jim. After this, Jim started to spread rumours about me and got all of the other “popular guys” at my new school to make fun of me. I had a really hard time for around a year, the only thing keeping me optimistic was my old friends that I kept in touch with. Also my other one of my best friends at the time started to distance himself from me a lot. High school came and I finally felt like I had another shot at having more friends again. This again did not go so well. I had some friends that I talked to at school but never hung out with any of them outside of school. At this point I’m in grade 10 and it has been two years since I moved. I started to lose contact with all of my friends and was convinced I would never move back. Grade ten was boring. My grades were fine (high eighties) but I had no social life. This is when I started to play ALOT of video games. I would spend 4-7 hours a day playing and trying to get good. This somewhat payed off when I won 600$ at a tournament but that’s it. It was a massive piece of my life I won’t get back. At the end of grade 10 I still was having a hard time with friends. It didn’t make sense because of how easy it was where I used to live. Summer of Grade 10 I got some of the best news in my life (or so I thought). I was told we were moving back to where I used to live. I was ecstatic. I thought to myself I would finally be back with my old friends, the girl I liked, and my family.  This is now present day. The move went well and we have a nice house. However the girl I liked does drugs and has a boyfriend now. My family has changed a lot and my little (now big) cousins never want to hang out. Also almost all of my friends don’t seem interested in talking to me. School comes around and I talk to a lot of people for the first two days. Then I’m stuck with nobody. All of my old friends have new friends and don’t want to hang out with me. I’m sure I can try and join their friend group but I feel unwanted. One person I actually invited to my cabin, we were there for a week in the summer. We had so much fun. School comes around and he doesn’t even want to talk to me. So I start talking to a really old friend that shares common interests. Right now I have two decent friends but neither of them want to hang out much and I get left on read a lot if I try to make plans. When I do happen to talk to some old friends they seem super happy to see me. I ask them to hang out and they agree to hang out “soon”. Well for 4/4 of my old friends “soon” has not yet happened a few months later even with multiple attempts I made. What happened? When I’m around people they seem laugh at my jokes and like me.

106,"Hey I transferred to the university I'm at now 2 years ago after going to community college for 2 years. My minor is Japanese and I am in my 3rd year of that so I was hoping to do international exchange in spring then graduate the following fall. Well, after waiting a month for a response on my application I met with the lead professor of the Japanese program here and sadly, I did pretty bad last fall after changing my major and job situation, I ended up with a fat D; which is pretty bad, I know. So, understandably, I won’t be able to go until I fix that grade by retaking the class next fall or go on the summer study abroad program. The latter sounding more like what I'll do. If I choose this route I won’t be able to exchange until next fall and will probably graduate the next spring for fall 2020. My other choice is to still do the summer study abroad, fix the grades, then just head out in fall and find a way to go there on my own. Possibly through a job or, I guess, travel. It’d be nice to hear some advice on what you guys think would be the best option or if you have anything you think would be good to know. Thanks",09Nov2019,1

113,"Before I begin I don’t wanna come across as some kink/fantasy-shaming asshole. If you’re into beastiality (whether or not you act upon it) this post probably isn’t for you, as I’ll probably seem condescending and insensitive.

I think the majority of the sexually active/porn watching community can agree that beastiality is a little weird and a less socially acceptable kink. 

Anyway. Today I caught my brother taking a bath, and, yeah he was watching dog porn. It was an uncomfortable situation for the both of us. I’m 20 years old and changed his diapers when he was a baby and I pick him up from school and treat him to froyo every now and then, so we don’t have a typical sibling relationship. I’m more of a step parent/cool aunt to him. He owned up to it to our parents, I didn’t even have to “snitch” on him. Yadda yadda yadda.

I also want to add that my brother wasnt full on masturbating and just naked in warm water. I talked about it with my boyfriend (who started masturbating and watching porn at the age of nine), and he snickered at my concern and said the kid would turn out fine. I know that, but I need to hear it from strangers who know nothing about me. 

Basically, I want reassurance that my baby brother won’t turn out to be some weird guy into animal fucking.

Apologies if this isn’t the proper subreddit for this. Also, PLEASE don’t criticize the way I’m going about this. I don’t wanna hear stuff like “wHy dO yOu EvEn CaRe It’S HiS oWn nAtUrAL dESiReS LeAvE HiM aLoNe”",09Nov2019,1

117,"He had a stressful family life growing up and grew up overweight. When he finally moved out of home he started going to the gym and losing weight. He became such a regular at the gym he dropped out of university and started personal training. He married his wife, who was later in an accident and is now totally dependent on him &amp; his income as a PT. 

He became addicted to the gym and started doing crazy diets and lost so much weight. He eventually had to go to the family doctor who diagnosed him with anorexia and sent him to a psychologist. He was getting better for around 6 months. 

But recently things have gotten really bad again. His friends and family have all offered support and spoken to him but he won't accept it. He even said ""I can't afford to go to a psychologist"" so I spoke to him about how I know first-hand that our countries universal health insurance WILL cover it! So he stopped using that excuse. And now anytime anyone approaches him he just cuts them out of his life.

I have been to a psychologist before (not for ED), so I'm thinking maybe I'm a good person to chat to him and normalise it..? Or is that not helpful? Any ideas on how to approach situation? I'm a fair bit younger than him so not sure how it will come across getting advice from me...

121,"Hey y'all!

Recently I reported to my coach that two seniors on my team have been mistreating me since I was a freshman. They called me names, insulted me, told me I was worthless, told me I'd lose my spot, insulted VERY sensitive topics of my life, and insulted my appearance/personality.  These have been very pointed and cruel insults that were said when I was alone, already down, or still a newbie so I never stood up for myself. To make things worse: they are the poster kids of our school (though they have a lot of drama).

I've been nothing but nice to them and my team. I'm well-liked and respected at school, so they are the only ones mean to me. 

I am afraid that our coach may not do anything but just make them say sorry, I am afraid there will be a backlash. 

I'm considering telling administration so there will be in-school action, not just on the team. 

I have to have a meeting with them and the coach.

Do you guys have any ideas on how tot alk to them during the meeting? Should I tell the school not just the team? How do I deal with this if it causes drama?",09Nov2019,1
122,"I'm applying to go back to school. My alma mater somehow added someone else's transfer credits to my transcript, ranging from dates when I was still in high school to dates while I was attending this university. AKA, blatantly impossible and against all school policies ever (you're not allowed to attend two universities at once). I also never attended that other university until this semester (a community college). 

They sent the wrong official transcript on the 24th, I asked them to fix the problem on the 31st, they corrected it the next day, it didn't last, and the next official transcript that was received on the 5th was also wrong. I asked them to remove them again on the 5th, they did while on the phone with me, and I was told to wait 24 hours before requesting it be sent again. And then some lady from the registrar called me the same day saying she wanted to go ahead and send it again, and I repeatedly asked her to wait 24 hours. She decided she would call the other office who fixed my transcript (admissions). My unofficial transcript online still shows the correct courses, but I was just notified by the other university that the transcript they received yesterday, the 7th, is also wrong.

I'm trying very hard to be chill. I asked her to confirm if she has two or three wrong transcripts, just in case somehow the transcript received on the 7th and the 5th are the same, and the third, correct transcript is still sitting in their electronic inbox somewhere. I am also embarrassed and worrying about how this is making me look.

If they actually have sent 3 wrong transcripts, what do you think I should do? I've asked my alma mater twice to send an email explaining that the transcripts are incorrect, but so far I haven't been notified of that happening. I've called and emailed, but I have not personally gone to the university (40 minute drive). I don't know if there's someone higher up to speak to. The director of admissions corrected my transcript, but I feel that the responsibility is on the registrar to bother looking at my transcript before sending it to make sure it's correct.

123,"I don't know where to start. I'm so pissed. I'm just going to make this short and sweet via bulletpoints to make this a quick read:

- My mom has recently told me that she worries that I'll get lost when I go out. She thinks I have no spacial awareness and it's one of her deepest fears that I'll lose sight of where I am at any point in time and end up lost.

- She doesn't think I'm capable of working at McDonald's. (I don't want to work there, she brought it up). She said it'd be too fast-paced for me and I wouldn't be able to keep up. She thinks with my brain I'd be more suited to a slow-paced cashier position.

- Today she was telling me about a film she watched about a debate team. But she went in-depth as to what ""debate"" means. ie. ""It's about these two classes that debate; so they read up on a particular topic and try to argue against the other -- even if they don't necessarily believe in what they're saying. So..."" and I was like ""Right."" with a lifted eyebrow, wondering why she's going so in-depth, but also without cutting her off as to let her finish her thought. She then said ""Oh... You know what that is?"" And I was like.... uh yeah?

- About a month ago she came into my room and went on about this strange rant about ""Kids these days think they're so much smarter than their parents. Everyone thinks they're so smart because they know how to use computers, but really, it doesn't mean they're smart -- it's just repetition. Doing it over and over. That's it. It doesn't mean they're smart. Anybody can do it."" ANd I was just like...... ok? lol? 

This just fucking sucks and I'm so upset. So many parents go on and on about how smart their kids are. Yet my mom seems to think I have an IQ of 4. This whole thing is new to me, I wasn't aware she thought this until maybe 2 months ago. Which surprises me, because I used to manage a fucking Golf &amp; Country club (the games, the finances, the inventory, accounting, employee scheduling, etc... everything.) so how the fuck does she think I was able to do that? Idk I don't know what to do.

So now I have this constant feeling, like I have to prove my intelligence to her constantly. But nothing ever seems to be good enough.

BTW, I'm 31 and she's 60. **I know**. I'm a fucking loser for being at home. I had to move back with my parents and brother (20) 2 years ago because I lost everything when my SO left me and I had to move back from across the country. I lost my managerial position, my car, my apartment, my SO of 8.5 years, and I'm super fucking depressed and I don't go out or do anything and I'm unemployed. I know, I'm a loser sand I know I need a job. I feel horrible enough as it is. Also I'm sure on top of my depression/anxiety I'm also pretty fucking lazy now.

Also, I have connected to 5 different recruiters. No offers so far, but consistently 2-3 phone calls a day.

I also have plenty of work at my job while I look for a IT job. I'm inclined to wait until late December, and January to focus on getting a job.   


I'd think that this a fine idea, but my worry is what happens if I start ignoring phone calls and emails.

They first were doing a traditional wedding, then postponed it because she needed to continue school and stuff, then they said one day they're gonna elope (not like suddenly, but they're gonna go to colorado and get married, just the two of them). This somehow turned into it being more like a normal wedding, where family is invited, but only immediate family. They say grandparents aren't allowed. Why? As far as I know, the main reason is that her grandma lives with her aunt, so if they wanted to invite the grandparents (which at this point is only like 3 grandmas I believe) they would have to not invite the aunt who lives with the grandma.

I think this is retarded and makes no sense. After all, they're doing the same thing to all the grandparents anyways, as well as the aunts, right? Well my grandma is super sad about this. And understandably so: my grandfather passed away last September, my grandma is over 80, the only things she lives for are memories and spending time with loved ones.

We were having dinner today and she said ""are you excited about going to Colorado next week?"" and I said ""yeah, sure"". And she just said ""i'm gonna cry"" which made me remember that she's not going with, which is super messed up. Then my mom told me later that my grandma said how hard this next week will be for her (we're leaving for the wedding on tuesday, coming back on sunday).

Me and my parents want to say fuck it and bring her with (after all, it's a small wedding, it's not like they're having a reception or anything; it's actually a really weird wedding. It's in colorado 15 minutes into the forest or something... in november?? I don't know, man) because the only thing that it will affect is how much we spend on air fare. But, of course, this would probably piss off my brother's (evidently crazy) future wife, which doesn't make sense. ""Hey, why are you mad?"" ""Because your grandma attended our wedding when I didn't want her here"". Like.... what????

So essentially the advice I'm seeking is whether we should say fuck it and bring my grandma along, even though it would be very bad potentially, due to my brother's fiancee's weird ass ideas",09Nov2019,1

133,"I had a teacher in high school I was infatuated with. I wasn't shy so he knew this, but he didn't do anything about it. I had him both junior &amp; senior year, and halfway through senior year I decided it was futile. I graduated and that August I started dating my boyfriend. Literally two days later, the teacher texted me on Facebook. I was still interested but I was in a relationship now so I just politely made small talk until he asked if I wanted to hang out. I panicked and stopped responding, and over the next few months he tried reaching out a few more times but I never opened them and he eventually stopped trying. My boyfriend dumped me the next summer so, curious, I went back to mine &amp; teacher's messages to maybe see where he was going. He had deleted his Facebook &amp; I could find no other social media. I gave up and earlier today, a year and a half later, I was feeling pretty sad and reflective about the choices I've made in life, and I remembered the teacher. Still no social media, but I googled him just because you never know what may come up, and I found a phone number and email for his current job. **Would it be best to just leave it alone and accept what has happened, or is it worth coming off potentially very weird by saying ""hey just wanted to say sorry I ghosted you, couldn't find social media so I googled you and found your work email how's it goin?""** I feel like it's a little too weird but there's also no other way to contact him. I can't even find the Facebook of the teacher he always hung out with in high school anymore. I guess I could technically enroll in the college he works at if I move back home lol but I'm not interested in what he teaches. Anyway, opinions on which choice is better, please and thank you!

136,"Tldr: work place turning to shit. I become a manager and earn more money if i stay or find a new work place and earn less

I worked in a big franchise that is from Kentucky. Recently, i took a break to focus on exams. While i was doing my exams, most of if not all of the friends or the people i liked working with at the place have left. Recently, in a Facebook group there was some drama between a disgruntled customer and the staff. Yes, on a Facebook group and not in store. Coincidentally, it happens not even a month after all of my friends have left the place. This gets me thinking, the new people they hired to replaced the old staff are undertrained and have some attitude. But then again, if i continue working. There's a high chance of me becoming a manager and earn more money than if i just find a new job. Should i say fuck it and manage a undertrained, understaffed place for more money. Or should i find a new job where i have to do the training process all over again and probably earn less?

138,"True to the title, I'm currently trying to develop an animated webseries. I'm not very far into it and only have an idea of the characters and plot. The thing is, I'm worried it's too ""edgy"" and nobody would like it.

I'm a 17-year-old queer girl with some mental health shit going on (I've been professionally diagnosed with depression, that's all I know that I have) which might explain why the series deals with teen, LGBTQ, and dark/heavy subjects. It focuses on four (five-ish?) main families each with their own set of issues, and takes place in 2004-2005. I'm envisioning it as a slice-of-life drama. It's loosely inspired by media like Life is Strange, Flowers in the Attic, various crime shows, etc.

I tried typing up a summary, but it ended up being *way* too long, so I'll just say this here: some topics include (consensual) incest, adult/minor relationships, mental health issues, homo/transphobia, family issues, attempted suicide, self-harm, abuse, prostitution... pretty much every sensitive thing is in here.

For example, the Luzhkov family: husband Dionisiy (46), wife Aleksandra (34), daughters Lara (17) and Danulka (15), and son Nikita (9). Aleksandra is an alcoholic who goes out clubbing and hooking up with strangers to cope with Dionosiy ignoring her (like on a romantic/sexual level), while Dionisiy throws parties in order to have sex with girls younger than her. They yell and argue constantly and neglect their children, who have learned to fend for themselves. Danulka tries to distance herself from her mother as as much as possible (which is hard, since they look a lot alike), but still likes being a tease to all the boys. Really, her heart's in the right place; she's just worried she'll screw up in a relationship. Nikita's a nice kid who was raised by his sisters. And Lara is a mechanic with an affinity for the emo and gothic, but she's extroverted and chipper. There's also this girl named Isabella (part of the Henriquez family, with whom the Luzhkovs have a feud) who Lara's dating, all Romeo and Juliet style.

So is that all too much? What parts should I cut out or tone down?

I know it's hard to give me advice with this information, but again, me trying to condense it into this space isn't working out. I'll go more into detail in the comments if prompted (i.e. someone asks me to describe the self-harm aspect to get a better idea of how I can improve it).",09Nov2019,1

Everytime I asked if there was something wrong, she'd quickly just cut the conversation off with a quick ""I'm just having a bad day."" which she only does when she's under a lot of stress. But I can't help her unless she says something.

Just a little while ago, she got really quiet and then starts crying, then sobbing and shaking. I'm trying to console her but she's curling up and is making it hard to help her. Then she takes a few shaky breaths, wipes her tears and then it's over. Like it never happened. She says her breakdowns are always like this, it just comes and goes and says that she's recently been getting really moody sometime before her period.

140,"(REPOSTED because my last one was too long and unclear). 

My cousin has anorexia: under-eating and excessive exercise. He's a personal trainer and his livelihood depends on that - and he has a dependent. So I think he's scared of having to stop working. Plus I think he has a nice community of people who don't tell him he looks sick (although the other gym employees have contacted members of our family about it). 

Long story short - He got sick and started having to see a psych/psychiatrist and started to improve. Has gotten worse again. Refusing all help (financial, emotional, etc) from family/friends. Used excuse that he couldn't afford to keep going to therapy with is BS because our universal health insurance here covers it. Started just entirely cutting out anyone who approaches him.

I'm pretty sure I'm the only one in my family who has a therapist (at least who will openly talk about it)(not for an ED). So I thought maybe I could bring that up and how much it's helped me?

So because I had autism and learning difficulties I got put into a special needs school throughout my time in there I’ve had few friends there but I’ve never gone out with them like  out in public places and shit I mostly played video games and stayed inside it’s probably important to mention as well my childhood was very difficult for me and my family because of my dad and mum going through divorces and my dad and mum was suffering with mental health problems and my dad was an alcoholic a lot of shit happened but won’t get into but so I would just stay inside all the time playing video games on Xbox chat with my “bestfriend” in my school and “online friends” I’ve only really stopped contact with them permanently now because I’ve matured a lot more than them and I don’t enjoy talking to them (this was time was around when I was 6/9) I’ve always had mental health problems as a kid because of my anxiety which cause other things as well but when I was 10 my dad died and it was really horrible for me and changed me a lot and for years without realising I was changing every year I’m still changing now I guess I won’t give you all a sob story because I don’t expect people to be on there knees for me. So because that happened I was already going through mental health problems (I didn’t realise I was or did anyone else) my depression and anxiety was never as bad as this causes me to be a really angry sad person who was very insecure of the fact that I was such a cringe kid and I hated the fact that I wasn’t normal (i was 11/12) my mum was also in a relationship with a man (toxic relationship) I started changing for the better when my mum broke with him (last year August) now that I’m 15 I like the person I and not insecure of shit cause I know I’m a good person I do struggle with mental health still and hate society cause it’s shitty so now I’m 15 with not very few friends and I’m kinda fed up with i want to know people and shit but know how like I was thinking just wait for college and I’ll see people but I live in small city with a population with 250 thousand people and I’m like is there even anyone for me so what is your intake on this shit and sorry for my horrendous grammar and writing I was just kinda putting words into my head onto this but any advice would be much appreciated thank you for reading if you want to ask me anything feel free I ain’t gonna cry over a question",09Nov2019,1
143,"So I have been happily married for 9 years. My spouse and I just recently welcomed our second child into the world and we are so excited! Two beautiful children!

Here’s the thing, I’ve been so depressed since she’s been born.

There’s a few concerns and all I feel are mildly related (maybe more so).

1. I feel I can’t connect with my youngest daughter a lot of the time. I know I’m still getting to know her but I can’t seem to have an ounce of patience with her. I get so frustrated so quickly and I feel absolutely awful about it every day. I didn’t have any of this with my older daughter either so I’m pretty shaken by it.

2. The next thing is I feel I have lost my purpose other than make sure my kids are in bed, being entertained, making sure they’ve eaten etc. I just feel empty and sort of , “ is this it?” Again, I feel like shit about it but it’s a feeling that has hit me hard the last few days and seems to get worse and worse.

3. The worst thing one in my opinion is the fact that I cannot stop thinking about someone whom I work with. We have always been friendly but do not work very close. She is married and has two kids of her own and I am honestly extremely happily married and would never do anything to jeopardize my relationship with my wife. All that said, I feel so heart broken that I can’t shake me thinking about this women. It’s hard to describe in what way I think of her. It’s not sexual. Sure, she is attractive but I don’t envision us doing anything sexually together. 

I think the issue is I asked her if her husband struggled with any connecting issues as I previously stated and she just listened time, encouraged me, and made me feel a lot less like the monster as I see myself. Problem is, I’m turning into a monster for a different reason now.

I don’t know why to do or how to cope, I’m sad and I’ve lost joy in a lot of things that usually make me happy. I just feel like an awful human being right now and I would like to shake these feelings and get back to my happy self and enjoy my time with my family again.",09Nov2019,1

147,"I entered a friends with benefits situation with a good friend from work I'd known for almost a year a few months after he got dumped by his girlfriend. I thought things would be fine since I honestly didnt believe I'd ever fall for him. 

He ended the situation because he and his ex didn't get back together but had sex again. After that I realised I actually did have very strong feelings for him. He ignored me for a bit over a month then finally started to be my friend again. Then we hooked up again on a drunken night out, I thought thatd be it but then he said he'd keep fucking me if i told no one. About a week later he backed out of this saying he couldn't do it as he knew i had feelings for him and it wouldn't be right since he didn't feel the same way for me. Obviously I was a bit upset that I had been screwed around again, I wasn't even the one that asked to continue. I had already made peace at the idea of just one night.

Now hes back to ignoring me and I just don't know what to do. We were genuinely such good friends to begin with and I've genuinely fallen for him. He's only the second man I've been with and the first person I've ever truly found attractive. He used to treat me so wonderfully. 

I feel terrible, I  would honestly do anything to be with him again, even if it was just sex. I don't care if he uses me, I don't care if id have to not speak at all to him in bed. I just want to be with him again. I asked him why I wasn't good enough for him and he said he just didnt feel that way for me. But if i was good enough to have sex with there must be some level of attraction there? If its about my personality im happy to fix or change anything since i like him a lot more than i like anything about myself. I'm sure if he gave me a chance i could do everything perfectly the way he wants it, at the very least in bed. If he just tells me what he wants me to be I'll be it.

Im struggling at work because I can't be around him anymore. It breaks my heart everytime he ignores me. I had to watch him grind on another woman at a work event the other day and it broke me. Ive never gotten so drunk in my life.

I don't know how to navigate adult relationships, i don't know what to do with feelings this strong. I dont know whether to ignore him or keep trying to be his friend or keep asking for him back or keep offering to have no strings attatched sex. 

And most of all, I know everything ive said about him and myself is a gigantic red flag. I know I have 0 self respect and I don't know what to do about it. I feel so stupid. I know this is all a terrible reflection on me and if i dont sort out these issues theyll follow me my entire life. I just don't value myself. And i don't know what to do about it?

157,"So, here's the story, my mom loves going to yard sales, she's a born entrepreneur and loves thinking about business (not in the ""evil CEO"" kinda way). This summer she was driving  through the neighborhood next to ours with my dad and found this huge yard sale selling clothing, and her ""Business-kugan"" activated immediately (Naruto reference). I had stayed at home cause I was feeling a little stuffy and wanted to take a chill Saturday off. She calls me up and tells me to drive over and help load up some of the stuff she bought, because turns out, she bought out the entire yard sale, EVERYTHING. Obviously the people selling the stuff weren't prepared to sell everything in one go, and I wasn't prepared to do any lifting, but oh well. They made these makeshift sacks out of tarps and duct tape, filling them up to the brim. I took a sumo stance and lifted one, and felt a pop in my crotch. I tumbled a bit, but due to my dads ""shitty boss"" attitude that always gets me fired up (I just had to have parents with short fuses, lucky me with these genetics) I couldn't even explain or tell anyone what had happened, so I kept going running on anger and adrenaline. After that, I kinda forgot about it for a couple of days, and eventually felt a little better with my cold. One night I was using the bathroom and felt a bump on one of my testicles, and, like any anxiety ridden young adult, immediately tried to find reasoning behind it, thought it was something it wasn't, and panicked HARD. 

I decided to go to get it checked out at the clinic and got an ultrasound done, turns out it was something called a ""Varicocele"", which is this little tube behind the testi that transports sperm from the testi to the penis (think of it like a ""burner"" that ""cooks up"" sperm and helps push it out). Seeing how it wasn't the deadly thing I had thought it was, I kinda calmed down after a while. But ""because anxiety"", and fear of how it ""might turn into something bad or deadly"" I started checking myself pretty much daily, essentially every time I'd use the bathroom, to the point to where I got my testicles irritated, which got me even more scared (I feel stupid because of it). I went off to the clinic again, and the doc had me go to a specialist and talk about it. I told him the basics of what I felt (fear it might turn into something serious, infertility, ect.), and apparently its a pretty common thing that men have, and that its not something that usually turns harmful (it comes in 4 stages, 1: when its just a little bump that pops out once in a while, to 4: when its serious), and I can do the stuff I used to without worry. 

I was relieved for a while, but I feel like the fear about it is trying to creep back onto me again, mostly cause I saw a picture of what I assume was a stage 4 Varicocele (it was like an extra large sack of potatoes hanging off a guys junk, it got me real riled up). So now, I'm scared I might do something where it can possibly get worse, or it might get worse naturally as I get older (I'm 19 btw), and I'm deathly afraid of surgeries (I've never had one, but after hearing how they do surgery on a Varicocele, I hope I never have to get one). I was going to have a follow up with the specialist after a month of taking some Naproxen he prescribed me to lower the inflammation I had (I read the warning label it came with, saw that it had the possibility of giving people a heart attack, didn't take it for like a week, mostly cause I'm a big dude for my age and height, so, being fat was a factor with it), but after losing my medicare I had from when I was little, going back for the follow up was a bit too much for me to pay. 

So now I don't really know how to go about it, my anxiety acts up from time to time, and due to it I haven't had the guts to find a job due to worrying about not being able to do the job right because of the Varicocele, and its really effecting me within my family life, I can't even go to sleep without checking my crotch and making sure my balls are straight and aren't twisted up for whatever reason (read a bit on ""testicular torsion"" and how it has the possibly of happening randomly, even in sleep, so, thats given me a few nights of feeling on end). And I know I can't rely on google searches to find answers to my questions because ""internet"", so I'm really stuck in a loop here. Not to mention I'm an only child, and ""because Old-School Mexican culture"", I want to be able to have a child so my bloodline can live on (also I just really love babies, my mom babysits a couple and I get this ""older brother"" figure feeling around them). Even just typing all this out its making my Varicocele act up, feeling all hot and whatnot (even though I know its probably just in my head). Any advice please?",09Nov2019,1
158,"This honestly may just be a rant but it feels good to just let it out there.

TLDR at bottom

Before this summer I was a loser- I didn’t have any close friends I could hangout with and anytime I tried flirting with girls it just came out as talking because I didn’t really know how to flirt. I tried asking a girl out and she made a excuse to try not to hurt my feelings about how she was still stuck up on her ex. 

This lead to me feeling really bad about myself and thinking I’d never get into a relationship with a girl at my school. I sat in my sorrows until the middle of summer when I had no one to hangout with. 

I started hitting up random girls 30 miles away from me and just practiced flirting with them. Also a positive that happened is that I also started to get real friends that I could hangout with and I felt really good. These girls got closer and closer and soon I started doing “stuff” with them. 


I thought that if I couldn’t get into a relationship with the girls at my school there is no reason to try. The final goal was to be able to have a relationship with these girls so I practiced on these girls in my area flirting and doing more stuff with them.

This was going well and I felt ok at this time, I didn’t start regretting doing anything until my friendgroup hung out with the group of girls at my school. We started talking and it came out that they knew I was fucking around in the area. Which I knew that that was what I was doing. 


They seemed pretty over me as a friend or anything more than that. It didn’t help that right now all my friends are hanging out right now with them even after telling me they weren’t doing anything today. Now I’m sat here regretting doing everything I’ve done to be where I am right now.

TL;DR I started doing stuff with girls in my area to gain experience flirting and the girls I actually want to have a relationship with found out. They are now over me completely as a friend or anything more and are now all avoiding me with my friend group.

I don’t want to do what I am doing anymore, it isn’t fun and I feel I am stuck where I am. 

I want to know what I can do to make the girl friendgroup see that I don’t want to be perceived like a “hoe” in their mind

164," Alright, LSA, I'm having a problem.  I met my best friend - I'll call  her G - in 6th grade.  For a long time, we got along very well; in 8th  grade, we started hanging out with three new girls - Linda, Isabelle,  and Marissa.  They decided that they did not like Linda, let her know  this, and made it so that the bullying of Linda by our peers became so  rampant that she switched schools.  A few months after she left, I  seemed to become their target.  They started making fun of me, and said  that it was alright because ""everyone does it.""  I noticed G becoming  more stand-offish/quiet around me.  I held onto hope that things might  become better.  They did not.  In a group chat on Instagram, they all  revealed to me that they had been gossiping about me for 5 months, made  fun of me ""all the time"" behind my back, wanted me to leave the school  in the way that Linda did but could not achieve this goal because  ""everyone liked me,"" etc. They told me that I could not talk about what  happened with anyone. G suggested that I try being ""less annoying"" and  that we attempt to repair our friendship after this.  I initially  agreed... until I told a friend what happened, and she told me that this  was not alright/to cut them all off.  This seemed to be the general  consensus when I confided in other friends.  I told the staff of the  school, and they suggested that this was cyber bullying (though they did  not communicate this to the girls.)  We had a meeting, even though I  requested that their parents be told.    
 

Now, flash forward a few months to today - we are in high school.  We  attend the same school, and have two classes together.  My mother  recently started working a new job, and her mother works the same job.   From their first meeting, her mother mentioned to my mother that she'd  like for G and I to be friends again.  I was uncertain on how to feel  about this when my mother mentioned it to me.  It's been mentioned to me  a few times since then.  Recently, G's mother told my mother this: ""G  likes DeloresTheGreat, but finds her talk about grades intimidating.""  G  apparently claimed in conversation with her mother that she did talk  about this with me (she did not.)  I sometimes notice G rolling her eyes  at me during class (or at least I noticed this today.)  What do you  think, LSA?  Should we be friends again?",09Nov2019,1

Hi everyone so my aunt(#1) is a mess she’s always been and so are her kids (well 1/3 of them, the other two have actually started fixing up their lives). Anyway, last week an aunt(#2) came down for a wedding from out of state on Tuesday and stayed with us (my grandparents, my mom, baby bro (18), my BF, and I) which was no problem since we’re used to fam from out of town staying here. On wed we had a bday party for aunt1’s daughter which meant a lot of family was here as well. Okay no big deal it’s a bday party after all. On Thursday aunt1 decided to stay with us as well. I guess to spend time with her sister before the wedding, idk.   Aunt moved about 40ish minutes away to help her eldest by helping to take care of her grandchildren, supposedly. Come Sunday, both aunts are still here. Come Wednesday of this week, aunt2 flies back home and aunt1 is still here. Come TODAY Friday and aunt1 is STILL here. At first her excuse was the wedding, then it was that she had to stay to go with my mom to drop off her sister at the airport. Now?? She needs an oil change and only her “ex”bf can do it but that’s on Sunday AND her car’s registration is expired. 

So my problem is I’m introverted. My job requires a LOOOT of human contact, people who are going through crises blah blah so I need time to recharge when I come home. A week of having people constantly over is very draining now she wants to stay even LONGER without even really asking? I’m dying here. 

To top it all off, tomorrow is my birthday and I am planning on just vegging out all day and I just know she and her spawn will be here all day and judging me for it. I need my time. 

Why bring up her kids in the beginning? Well because her daughter (the one who isn’t really getting her stuff together) is just like her and comes around a lot more when aunt1 is around subtly (not really) trying to get my grandmother to cook for them because “that’s what grandmothers are supposed to do”. So then we have 2 of them, plus the grandchild, here often just bugging us. It’s like they’re so used to overstaying their welcome that it’s become comfortable for them. 

Everyone I’ve mentioned (except for aunt1’s grandchildren) is an adult. The rest of the family who live here are also tired of her but my gma can’t (on a personal level) kick her out. Aunt1 and her spawn already think(know) our grandma doesn’t really like them. 

Culturally, us all being together is normal plus I pay (most) of the rent and utilities, but it’s still my grandmothers domain. 

What do I do??? I desperately want her gone TONIGHT. How bad would it be if I packed her suitcase (red flag I did NOT pick up on when she arrived) and just left it outside??",09Nov2019,1

There’s this guy that I’ve been talking to for around a month that I really like. We’ve been flirting and things like that and have been hanging out a lot. We sent goodnight texts every night and he said that he likes me and thinks I’m really cute and stuff like that (It wasn’t like it wasn’t serious, he was telling me how he’s really into me. Last night out of nowhere, he said that he doesn’t think that we’re gonna work out, and didn’t give me a clear reason. 

I have a really bad habit of falling in love really fast. I don’t know why, maybe it’s just because I’m really lonely and craving companionship. As weird as it may sound, I’m heartbroken. He said that he wants to stay friends but he’s just not ready for a relationship. Normally I would understand this, but my friend showed me texts of him texting her and saying how she’s cute and is flirting with her. He also told my friend how he had sex with someone he met on tinder, and it was when we were still talking and he was telling me how he wanted to be with me.

Did I do something wrong? I really thought we were going really well and the fact that this came out of nowhere just really hurt me. I couldn’t fall asleep last night until like 4 am because I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had planned a whole relationship in my head and now I just feel so empty inside. I’ve had this feeling in my stomach all day, kind of like the one when you go down the big drop on a roller coaster. 

I can’t stop picturing him talking to other people while we were. I just really need advice on what to do in this situation. He told me how he didn’t mean to lead me on, but how in the world was he not leading me on. I just feel so heartbroken, so does anybody have any advice?

I'll try to condense this for your sake and mine (posting from mobile.) For the past two years, I've been trying to find work. I've literally applied everywhere that fits the criteria of my restraints, (10 mile driving radius, and no night driving. I'm disabled, it's complicated.) and I've even tried starting up a freelance computer repair gig, but haven't had business since May. Since then, my only sources of income have been SSI, (which all gets spent on my car payment/insurance), and the kinda stuff you find on r/beermoney. It usually ends up being enough for some semi-monthly retail therapy, but not enough to get me out of my parents' house. I've considered going back to college, but I'm not sure whether I should continue in the IT field or try for something that fits better with the job market in my area. I love computers, but I can't really see a future with them if I stay here. (Which seems to be the likeliest case.)

From the outside it seems like they drifted apart years ago and the opportunity to see other people has removed the possibility of an ‘aha!’ Moment monogamous couples have when they realise the fire has gone out. They are completely infatuated with their sex partner and have outsourced all emotional labour to this partner instead of their actual spouse. They are going of the rails and it’s irritating listening to them pine over this person so soon after their wedding to another. Their erratic behaviour and substance abuse is sad to watch. Despite how close we are, I feel like the subject of their marriage is taboo and if I even ask them the question ‘are you happy in this situation, and if not, what would you wish for to make your life better?’ I’d be accused of being ignorant, prudish or plain crazy for imagining that they chose the wrong person to marry. Should I keep my mouth shut or say something?

204,"Hello everyone. I find myself in a place where I never thought I would be: loneliness. I'm 22 years old, male, currently at University and a have a girlfriend. My relationship with her is amazing and we have a beautiful history together and we love each other deeply, we trust each other like nothing I've ever seen. But, outside my relationship with her, I'm lonely as hell. The only time I go out is with her and I started to realize that I was putting a lot of pressure on her because she always had to be with me and she has a lot of friends and couples need to have their own life's beside the relationship.

 The thing is, I don't have a lot of friends, at my university here in Brazil I didn't actually joined at the beginning of the course, because I came from other University and my classmates change all the time, so I know a lot of people but I'm not actually friends with anyone. Right now my main and only friend doesn't like to go out and he is always busy, we speak to each other but is always by texting.

 These recent weeks I'm not handling too well the loneliness thing, crying all the time and I'm afraid that this will affect my relationship with my girlfriend. Actually today she went out with some friends and I wanted to go out, but I realized it would be inconvenient to just get in her way and force something with her friends so I just didn't try to go. I was actually at the university and I started to look at my contacts to see if I could find someone to hang out with and I wasn't able to find one single person to go out with me. I immediately started to cry and it was even harder because, on my way back home, I walked by a lot of places where people were eating, drinking, having fun together and I just started to cry even more because I felt completely left out. I don't know what to do, I'm not an introvert, I'm not shy, I'm actually pretty funny and when I'm feeling good i get some Jason Momos vibes of energy. I'm good looking, pretty fit but somehow I can't make friends and join a group a feel part of.

I was thinking that travelling somewhere and forcing myself to know other people could help me but I don't know. I just can't take anymore, specifically when I think I'm messing her life up with my problems. 

TLDR: after years of loneliness can't handle anymore, crying all the time, don't know what to do because I'm already extroverted and overall a fun and nice guy, know a lot of people but can't make deeper friendships or join a group that an I feel part of. The feeling gets worse because I feel like I'm holding up my life and disturbing my girlfriend life.",09Nov2019,1
205,"I don't really know if this is a good place to post this, but here goes. 

I've just received news of the loss of a loved one and I'm feeling extreme regret because I did not get to say goodbye to her and didn't visit recently when I could have. It always felt like I had more time even though I knew she was old and getting sick and she probably didn't have as much time left as I thought. 

I feel this constantly. Like bad things can't happen to me, until they do. My best friend recently lost her brother in a tragic accident. I have a sister I barely speak to over clashing personalities and things that occurred years ago. I know that if anything were to happen to my sister I would really regret not speaking to her. But it feels like nothing will ever happen to her so I don't need to put effort into mending the relationship. Even seeing my friend experience this horrific loss didn't make me immediately try to make amends with my sister. 

My mom also has a few health conditions that can be life-threatening if they get bad enough. I am in extreme denial that they ever could get bad enough. She has said herself she only has the mild form of the condition. I'm constantly thinking about how something could happen to her and worrying about something happening to her, but it doesn't feel like anything ever could. 

Does everyone feel this way? Is there a way to adjust my feelings to be more realistic and accepting? I'm lost. I don't want to constantly be worrying about my loved ones dying, but the mentality I currently have is leading to so many regrets.",09Nov2019,1

208,"Hi everyone, 

Me and my best friend are extremely close but recently there was an event that really tested this. 

I recently ended up in hospital after a freak accident which affected my lungs and heart. It was my best friend who took me to the hospital and stayed the whole night with me. At first she was really stressed and supportive while I was laying on the bed, but at the end of the night she suddenly became extremely cold and a bit cruel towards me (e.g. just before that I recently went through a break up with a long time partner and she was saying things like “he never loved you the whole time, was just setting up his life to leave you” while I lay there waiting for my heart results in severe pain). I’m usually pretty good at taking things like that but it was a low point for me and very hard at the time. We have since been rocky and she did apologise for it but all those comments keep popping up in my head while I try to regain my health and get over the breakup. We live together so I can’t seem to get any space and she has been treated poorly by her other best friend recently so I have been supporting her through that. I’m at a bit of a loss at what to do, like I should just move on but I can’t. I feel like there is is something still there. Like she always has to be the victim and it is starting to drive me crazy. She was abused as a child and before this she said she was going great but if I say anything is up with me she was always highlight this saying it’s worse again - so I’ve been trying to help with that too (we been there for eachother for years on that and made such great progress). What do you guys think? Am I just being irrational? If so, do you have any tips on how I can move past this?

on my 21st birthday i was laying in bed, feeling fine and then all of a sudden my heart started racing, i felt faint, i couldn’t breathe, etc. i’d looked into and did a little experimenting and found that i’d have these panic attacks when i smoked weed or had any caffeine (i was a heavy smoker and had at least 2 cups of coffee per day) so i cut both out completely.

214,"I am an 18 year old male (if biology has anything to do with this shit). 

I won't go into details, because I would like to stay anonymous, so I will stay as general as possible. 

Whenever people scream at me, or come into heated conflict with me, after making a few points, I am overpowered, and tears start streaming down my face. My breathing gets panicky, and when I try to speak, my voice gets all shaky and sissy like. I fucking hate it, because sometimes, I *am* right, and its all just a misunderstanding, however in that moment/argument, *I lose my voice*. When I do try to speak, my voice is shaky and easily dismissed. My chest wells up with emotional pain, and my mouth just starts filling with tears.

Its not that I *want* to run away and cry. I *want* to fight. I *want* to make my points known. I don't want to always be some pansy who starts shaking, with his tail between his legs, whenever some family member is screaming at him. (Particularly  a father figure.). Its just that I freeze up, both my body and my brain. 

What do I do? I'm not some sort of coward, I make it a point to live according to my heart, to live up to my own personal ideals. This invariably brings me into conflict with my family members, which is when the screaming starts. And then suddenly, I can't defend myself. I lose my voice. I cry. Eventually I just find myself nodding tearfully to whatever bullshit is being screamed at my face. Half of it always ends up being untrue, because the opposition is obviously emotional as well, and the topic of screaming always extrapolates to some idiotic conclusion. The crying and the nodding on my part make it seem like I am submitting, like I am agreeing to everything, like the opposition has stumbled upon the infallible truth, and I am a liar, as if my previous words don't matter. **I don't agree**, **I just want the moment to pass** so I can escape to somewhere quiet and recollect my thoughts. 

There is nothing more emasculating than crying in my opinion. I've gone to the gym. I've bulked up, I've even tried to talk myself into being less empathetic, less emotional, to fucking *man up.* I don't know what to do. I know many girls who are more solid than me, who can endure the mad ravings of *anyone,* close family or friend, and still retain the emotional composure to tell them to fuck off.

Aren't men supposed to be the tougher ones? I can't understand why I am having such a hard time with this. **I'm a bitch and I know it.** I hate myself for being so spineless when push comes to shove. When the time comes to get to get a girlfriend, to get married, and to have kids, what will I do then when some asshole decides to harass my wife? To bully my child? Will I attempt to shout and fight, before starting to cry? 

How do I fix myself.",09Nov2019,1
215,"Hello fellow Redditors, I need a little help here, I'm in quite the conundrum, but I also kinda caused the conundrum.  
Allow me to explain some background detail.

So there is a few things I need to address first, I'm a senior in high school who is  suffering from a depressive disorder, more specifically Dsythymia (Persistent Depressive Disorder) which causes symptoms such as low self-esteem, low self-confidence, feeling worthless, irritable and or melancholy mood, and a few more. I'm also incredibly lonely and constantly try to seek out positive attention where ever it is to be found to fill that empty void in my sternum. I'm uncomfortable with intimacy and closeness out of fear of being hurt. I go to a small school with only about one hundred fifty students, so everyone at least knows each other. I'm in a friend group of around twenty people, and I haven't told a single one of them about this. Oh, yeah, and I'm male. I've never had a crush on anyone before, and I've never been in a relationship before.  
Now that the depressive background detail is out of the way, allow me to explain the current problem.

So, roughly eight months ago a girl told me they were crushing on me via discord messaging, and well, having never dealt with a situation quite like that before I panicked. I do believe I screwed things up, and I thought I made her lose interest. We didn't really talk in person after that, we did talk quite a few times online though. Any who, as the months progressed and I began to notice her more and more out of the crowd, I began to think about her more and more over everyone else, and I quickly realized that I ended up developing a crush on her. I kept quiet about this and didn't tell a soul for another five months, it was at this point that it kind of boiled over and I told her the same way she told me, via discord. Surprisingly, she was still interested in me. We ended up talking over discord a lot, but when it came to in person, it was small talk that usually didn't last more then a minute. Now here is where the problem begins, so the small talk started to disappear, and she stopped using discord. I don't have the confidence to actually talk to her thanks to a little thing called Dysthymia, I'm also scared because this whole situation I put myself in is just foreign to me. I'm just at a loss of what to do, so I come to you all in a time of need. What should I do?",09Nov2019,1
216,"So my parents have this habit of spying on me. They do this in many ways, but the main problem that I've had is how they try to peek through the door to see what I am doing. My room is designed in such a way that even opening the door the smallest amount will allow you to see the whole room. My parents exploit this in such a way so as to stealthily and quietly open the door a very, very small amount in this way to see what I am doing. When I notice them, they try to slowly close the door again to make it seem as though it was just a breeze. I have seen them stare into my room for up to half an hour at a time, not doing anything but slowly opening the door a small amount and staring at me for 20 minutes straight. This tactic also manifests in them peering through a very small corner of my bedroom window. Before running into this habit, they used to swing the door quickly and loudly at various points of the day trying to ""catch me"" in an act, but they never have. Is this a normal thing that parents do? Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this that preferably doesn't involve talking with them?

218,"Okay (TL;DR at the bottom) 

I am about to turn 22 in a couple of weeks and I just finished heading out of another unsuccessful tinder date. 

I haven’t dated much until I turned 20 and most, if not all, of those dates were through tinder or bumble or any sort of dating app. Every date I have been on has been unsuccessful. The majority of them stayed as only a first date which ended up with me being ghosted right after each date. Only one date went through well to the point where we kissed and immediately (like a day after) was told to just be friends. 

I do not consider myself to be a bad guy. Ive been fortunate enough to have a good amount of friends that genuinely enjoy my company and want me to be happy and successful. I am pretty popular at work and I get along with a lot of my coworkers and classmates at school. I do think I have a friendly and approachable personality, and I have been told that I can be very charismatic. 

I also don’t really think I am that ugly. I am a bit short (5’5’’) and I am pretty skinny with slightly thinner muscles. Ive been dressing well enough to where I look good with casual clothing. I style my hair and I have pretty decent skin with a few blemishes that are clearing up as I work on them. 

I genuinely think I am a good person that is fun to be around with. I am hard working and I strive to be the best that I can be at school, work, relationships, and hobbies. 

This all sounds well and good, but the issue is I still do not understand why I either suck and dating or just have horrible luck with dating. See, I am the only one that I know personally to be around my age that has yet to have a girlfriend or even have sex. The people I have dated in the past, like I said, have only been first dates and the only time I got to kiss someone was that one time that ended with us being friends (I was later told that she never really had feelings for me).  

Now all of the tinder dates I’ve been on has either ended up with me being ghosted or asked to just stay friends, or just ignored all together. It gets so frustrating being constantly rejected by everyone I try attempt to ask out to the point where my confidence has just hit the ground hard. I really enjoy myself and I would date myself in a heart beat, i just don’t understand why anybody doesn’t give me a chance. 

With my birthday coming up, i get increasingly afraid that I am just never going to be with somebody. I have times where I feel like being single is great and I don’t need anyone to be happy, but often times I feel so lonely that I just cry myself to sleep with the sadness and fear that I have. 

Am I overreacting? Is there something wrong with me? I have confidence in myself and I try to portray that externally towards others, but as i continue to be interested in other people, things occur that really hurt my confidence. 

I don’t know what to do. I honestly just word vomited here to try to clear my mind a bit before falling asleep. I really am stuck here and I just want to be at peace with all of this. 

TL;DR: turning 22, never had a girlfriend or have had sex. I see myself as a pretty good person with a good personality that isn’t too ugly, but I haven’t had any success with any dates and I have constantly been ghosted or rejected to the point that my confidence has just hit the ground hard. I don’t know what to do and I just want to be happy.",09Nov2019,1
219,"I’m sorry this is so long oof

So I’m an 18 year old high school senior (I just turned 18 this week) I’ve spoken to friends and family members and they all tell me my mom’s very overprotective, so I know I’m not crazy when I say she is. Hell, sometimes she’ll acknowledge it, but she’ll always try to justify it. Basically, my mom treats me as if I just turned 14. Whenever I go out, she demands to know who’s throwing the party, their parents, and every single person attending. If no parents are there, she won’t let me go. Sometimes she’ll even make me hand over the phone to a parent. When I’m on dates with my boyfriend, she always drives by and makes sure we’re there. If she texts me and I don’t reply within a minute she’ll spam my phone. I was at a birthday party today and we were playing a board game. She called and went “I don’t hear music, I don’t think you’re really at a party.”
My twin brother was forced to go on dates with me and my boyfriend up until recently when my mom decided I would be able to go out on my own. She forces him to go places he didn’t even want to go because she doesn’t trust me out on my own. It’s even come to a point where she’s forbidding me from going to colleges that are over 20 min away from home. She tells me I’m going to “go crazy” and that I “can’t handle the real world” which may be true because I’m so sheltered. 

I cannot have a discussion with her about this. Trust me, I’ve tried. It usually goes one of three ways:
1. She simply ignores or doesn’t pay attention to how I feel. No matter what I’m talking about, she’ll only stick to one point and won’t acknowledge anything else
2. She laughs at me or devalues my opinion of I sound emotional. If my voice quivers or cracks slightly, she’ll laugh at me and just go “oh you’re gonna cry” and ignore everything else
3. She turns it to be about herself. She literally told me on my birthday after a small argument “it’s my birthday too, if it weren’t for me carrying you for 9 months, I would’ve gotten an abortion” and when I proceeded to get upset and cry, she proceeds to laugh at me and devalue the reason why I was upset at what she just said. (I’m not gonna lie, I’m pretty soft. I think it’s because I’m so sheltered though). 
These usually end with her giving me the silent treatment for a day or “apologizing” to me sort of like “I’m sorry you think you’re right” or “I’m sorry you feel that way” and I’m not allowed to say anything back or else she’ll get angrier. 
I can’t lie to her about my whereabouts either because she spams my phone all the time and asks to speak to a parent or for photo evidence. I think this is getting ridiculous, I’m 18 and I feel like I’m getting treated like an 8th grader. What should I do about this? She’s a great mom when she’s not being like this, so I’m not cutting ties with her. I just wanna know how to deal with this.",09Nov2019,1

223,"Hey , I’m 13 years old and recently there has been an older guy who won’t stop bothering me. I have to admit that at the start I was flirting with him because I wanted to try out something new but I didn’t know he’d fall head over heels for me. 

It started out with normal conversations and him saying that my mannerisms are cute and that I’m more matured than my age. But after a few days he started to get extremely sexual and was forcing me to have sexual contact with him. I instantly knew that it was very wrong and illegal to do such actions on a minor so I told him upfront that its just wrong and gross. But he just laughed it off and make things more subtle , like asking me to just go on top of him to kiss him multiple times and to lick his neck. I refused to but he manage to persuade me into it.  ( he wouldn’t take no for an answer )

But a few hours later I started to realise that he was manipulative and that if I didn’t leave earlier I’d be sure he’d do many things that are unfavourable. So I messaged him upfront that I didn’t like it , that I’m not attracted to him and it’s just so wrong. But again he continued to try to manipulate me by telling me to give him “chances”. I didn’t want too so I just blocked him , he managed to message me on a telegram and said that he could just be friends with me. I was relieved so I unblocked him. 


A few hours later he started to act all depressive , writing in his Instagram post that he’s depressed and wants to kill himself. And messaging me that he has schizophrenia and ADD, and also saying we’re both alike? that we both don’t have friends but I shut it off saying that I don’t have an emotional connection with my friends. After that I just ignored him fully because I just didn’t give a damn about him. 

Then the next day he texted me AGAIN telling me whether we could “talk” but I’m pretty sure it’s going to be the same lines of “I’m sorry just give me 3 days , I’ll take this more slowly”. Once again I texted him back saying I’m not interested with him anymore.


I’m very sure he’d message me again , I’ve already block him from all social media platforms but I’m afraid he’d go as far as making a new account over and over again to bother me. I seriously can’t just let this go because HE IS mentally ill and might be a danger to me.",09Nov2019,1

I think this is what happened to me. I do recall my parents never being available to me (emotionally or physically) and I eventually came to an understanding that I had to solve everything on my own. Affection/emotions = weakness which is unforgivable. Now I have all kinds of issues when building relationships. I notice whenever girls show interest in me I instantly shun them off and I no longer want anything with them. My mother also claims she feels I reject her.

I don't know what to do to be honest. I know these types of ""maps"" children create in their heads can be incredibly stubborn to do away with and I really don't even know where to begin.

228,"I(22M) am currently in the process of learning a foreign language as while it is not required, I will be teaching English in said country in a little over a year. I started using a language exchange App back in May as a way to supplement my study and learn more about this country. In the process I talked to many people, and I was purely there to learn a language. One girl(22F) that I was talking to started off with helping me practice, but eventually it was just a more casual talking as her English was decent, but still has its barriers for what we can talk about, nothing truly too deep/personal.Months of talking nearly every single day, texting almost all day and talking on the phone for an hour+ most days eventually made me realize I developed feelings for this girl I had never met.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the part where it gets confusing for me. We talk every day still even with us both being busy but we pretty much NEVER flirt, I maybe call her ""cutie"" once in a while but we still don't really ever flirt, she maybe called me handsome a few times before but not recently. Normally I would dismiss this as a whole as she lives far away and long distance doesn't interest me the slightest, but I will be moving to this country in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

I am visiting this country for a month at the start of December and we are planning to see each other the whole time, she's even meeting me at the airport but I don't know what to expect. I really cannot tell if she's interested in me romantically like I am in her, and I don't want to ask now to make things awkward before I even meet her, I was sort of just wanting to see how it played out when I got there.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I stupid and is she into me? Or is she really just THAT friendly that we talk every single day texting and calling. I just don't want to ruin what can be a good friendship with making the wrong move. And again, we do NOT flirt really at all.

233,"Recently I(14F) have been butting heads with Mom(51F)  


Most of the time things between us are cold; I don't talk to her, she doesn't talk to me. When we do talk to each other she's asking me if I can do something. 

But 3 days out of the week she'll get super drunk and come in my room trying to pick a fight; calling me dirty, ugly, bitch, every name in the book. She'll start nitpicking little things early on in the day and by the end of the night, she'll be calling me names. throwing stuff at me and telling me to kill my self etc.   


About two months ago my dad(39ishM) signed me up for counselling(I was having really bad panic attacks, hair pulling...), which mom hates she says ""I don't want you telling them white people in my business"" She's been trying to get me to quit it.   


 it has been pretty great so far I never really had a support system, so that's nice. Before this whenever she started to mess with me I'd pretend I was sleeping or, just let her do her thing and cry about it later.  
I tried to tell my other sisters about it but their reaction was ""Stop complaining, there are kids that have it worse"" Or ""Lol, you know she has issued just don't bother her""  


My dad isn't available at the moment(County jail, don't ask) so he hasn't been here for like a week and a half. I've still been going to my councilling, by asking my sister to take me. 

  
So four day ago she got drunk and decided she was going to come to my room and start an ~~argument~~ conversation with me. First, she started up a simple convo-already knew this was coming-then she asked why I was hoarding dishes in my room, there were two dishes a plate(from a sandwich I had eaten in the last hour) and a bowl with pudding in it. I said I would put it in the sink which I did, and started eating the pudding finish it and take a nap.

  
She wakes me up like an hour later, and ask why I left a dish in the sink ~~there where already dishes in the sink but ok not gonna argue with a psycho~~ I was like okay...and washed the dish.  
Started to watch some tv, went back to the kitchen to get a snack or something, and when I went back she was in my room holding the bowl in her hand and asked me why I still had it in my room I said I forgot( it seemed like the safe option). so she chewed me out for a minute then started to walked out the room. She was holding the bowl weird in one hand on the side, and it kind of made me flinch. She definitely noticed because then she started laughing saying "" wow you think I'm worried about you?"" ""you're funny...you real funny"" something along those lines.

  
She did end up throwing it at me after teasing me with it; trying to make me flinch. The police came and then left ~~Bravo to Ohio police.~~  she put me out of the house, so I went to my sister's house and called one of my counsellors to let her in on what was happening.

 I went to school the next day and one of my counsellors came in to ask me what happened, if I had a place to go,  if I felt safe/comfortable at home, etc. 

  
When it came down to the last question I wasn't okay...the only place I feel slightly safe in the house is in my room. So I said no and told them why when I got back from school my mom was their(shes suppose to be watching my dads house, and has only been here on weekends) and she was with a lady from cps( who I found out is now my caseworker)

  
she talked to mom, then me, then my younger brother.

  
after that day she told me she was going to stop my counselling, which she did today.

  
I don't know what to do my mom said if I wanna go with them I can just know she'll never deal with me again.

  
and the rest of my sisters or mad/scared cps got involved and won't help me out.

  
 I don't know what to do.",09Nov2019,1
234,"My friend and I were talking about how friendships tend to fade as people get older and busier with life. They told me that they have a lot of close friends they still spend time with and 1 particular best friend. They are 28 and 29 year old females (the best friends). 28 is single, owns her own place, busy with full time work. 29 is married, 2 kids, full time mom. They’ve been best friends for 15+ years. They still text each other almost every day, call each other a few times a week and sometimes a couple of times a day and often meet up with each in the evenings to hang out.  They spend time with each other’s families (camping, afternoons, etc). The kids from the one girl calls the other girl Aunty and calls her friends parents grandma and grandpa).  It got me to thinking, is this normal for adults to continue to have strong bonds and friendships like that even though they’re grown and busy on their own? Am I missing out on having strong friendships like that as an adult? Is this something everyone experiences and I am only only just realizing that this is something I’m missing out on....

236,"This will be long so I apologize in advance, but I really appreciate any insight! 

I recently transferred to a different facility for work but within the same company. It’s closer to home, has better parking, I will make slightly more money because the job title is a level up from my last(same work however) and I was hoping it would mean more time with SO. The shift is graveyard(which I figured I’d give a shot at) full time vs my old shift which was evenings part time(but I was working full time hours at). I had really high hopes for this new position, takes only 10 min to get to work, don’t have to fight for parking, it’s graveyard so don’t have to deal with any supervisors and it’s a smaller, less busy facility so less stress. Or so I thought. 

First day and already started off bad, I had not received any information regarding my orientation which is held by the new location not my specific department. I reached out to my future manger the week before my transfer asking if she knew for certain if it was the first Monday and Tuesday of my transfer and she replied saying it’s at 730am but she’s not sure why I didn’t get any info for it but it’s held on the 4th floor. Cool so I get ready for orientation Monday,  which I assumed would be like the orientation at my old location that had a very strict dress code of business casual. I work in the medical field so business casual is not my usually work attire. I get to the fourth floor and can’t find this dang orientation and tell my manager accordingly. She sends me to the education managers office and I ask him about it. He then tells me there is no new hire orientation scheduled this whole week and that it’s actually next week. My manager had texted me while I was driving saying something like “oh if there’s no orientation you can start work today”, she’s telling me this only an hour before what I thought was my orientation. I explain to her I was not prepared to work today since I was told it was NEO and dressed accordingly. She then sends me a text saying that I’m scheduled to begin work today and what should my excuse be for missing work. At this point I’m already outside her office assuming she’s in there, so we can figure out what happens next. She approaches me barely getting into the department and does not say hi or sorry about the mix up, instead she begins by saying the same thing she texted me pretty much in a mother scolding her teenage kid kinda tone, ending it with “so what would you like me to say is your excuse for being absent”. I was speechless and pretty sure my jaw hit the floor. She then continues “oh, you don’t understand?” I try to explain to her that I was expecting orientation, not a regular work day. She tries to get me to come back at 3pm but I tell her I have a doctors appointment I made after I confirmed with her my orientation times and if she would really like I could cancel it but if not I can come back tomorrow at 3pm no problem. She gets a call from her boss and idk how the other side of the conversation went but her attitude changed and she actually apologized for the confusion and asked if I could please come back tomorrow to train at 3pm as well as the rest of the week. My company gives transfers a 2 week trial period where you can go back to your old location and I’ll be damned if I almost did that day. Some of my old co workers who have worked with my future manager before talked me out of it because apparently she’s a really sweet person and maybe she had a bad day. Whatever, so I decide to give her a second shot. 

The rest of the week went smoothly as I learned the layout of my new department, she even gave me a tour and was being nice so I was thinking maybe it was just a bad day and everything will be fine. I train for 4 days on 3pm shift and then the following week I had my actually NEO Monday and Tuesday which means I still haven’t gotten to even work my actually shift, graveyard starting 11pm. I ask FM if she wants me to come in for my Wednesday shift for graveyard since I was at NEO that Tuesday and it would be considered OT. Of course she said no and just start the next day, get some rest blah blah blah. At my old facially the way graveyard worked is Monday’s shift actually started Sunday 11pm and ended 730am Monday and Fridays shift would then end 730am Friday, you get it. Same company so I assumed that’s how graveyard would work at this location as well and was not told otherwise by my FM. I did not find out until what I thought was my Friday shift, that actually no graveyard does not work that way here. So my Friday shift was actually Friday 11pm-Saturday 730am. If I had know this is how the schedule worked I would of never taken the shift because weekends are my only days off with my SO and we usually have a full day of stuff planned for Saturday. Also, was not informed that I would be working every other weekend which is one of the reasons I left my old facility. Full time employees are only subject to work 1 weekend a month unless stated otherwise in the posted position(which it was not). I had previously made plans to go out of town this weekend and knew I’d be transferring to my new facility soI requested a vacation day for Monday a few weeks in advance, that way I wasn’t going straight into work from being out of town. This was when I thought graveyard worked the same way as my old position. I had planned to leave Friday night and now that I knew how the schedule worked I realized that wasn’t gonna fly. I texted my FM explaining the mix up after talking to a morning coworker towards the end of my graveyard shift and she convinced me that my FM is very understanding and just talk to her about switching my vacation days. Understanding? Hmm, yeah no. She pretty much lectured me how the schedule had been out for a month and it’s my responsibility to request the right days off and as a matter of fact she couldn’t find the paper I printed her showing my requested day off for that Monday. It was approved by my old manager since my FM couldn’t access my request offs till I actually transferred but she said she’s honor it when I asked about it weeks ago. She did eventually switch my days after I explained why I had the schedule wrong for the third time but it didn’t leave me feeling any better about her. Something to keep in mind is she’s pretty new to being a manager for this location and she’s pretty much the only one, besides a temp they sent to help but he just stays in the office doing whatever. 

 At my old facility I had to fight for parking once I got there, and my commute could be 45min long some days. When I got home I had no where to park because my building only has street parking and I would get off work late so I had to either park far away or park illegally in the alley. Management really watched you and would say something if you took an extra 5 min on your break, although for the most part I didn’t have any issues with them. Some of my old co workers really liked to start drama but I ignored them as best I could and it never effected my work. I also had some of the best coworkers and became best friends with one of them and I actually miss a lot of people there. I also know this place like the back of my hand and had been given a lot of training duties for the past couple months before I decided to transfer. My immediate supervisor was really chill and understanding. He worked with my schedule and actually was trying to get me to stay there and was willing to do whatever he could (besides paying me more because he didn’t have that power). The main manager for this location is not a people person at all and sometimes rubbed me the wrong way but I didn’t have to deal with her that much so I didn’t mind. I also was able to go to the gym after work and sleep in because of the time of the shift so I had a lot of ‘me time’ but I also missed my SO during the week. Because his schedule was polar opposite from mine the only time I’d see him was when I’d come home and he’d be sleeping or the weekends and I had to work every other weekend. I decided to transfer for one because I got really depressed spending all this time alone, because the rest of the work worked opposite me too. 

At this new location it’s less than 5 miles from where I live. They have an abundant of parking and even at peak hours I could find a spot right way. Because the shift ends in the AM, everyone has left so street parking at my building is open as could be. I would make a couple more dollars an hour compared to my old facility and I just bought a newish car so could use the money. The people there are all really nice and accommodating and our work isn’t tracked like how it is at my old position. The pace of the work is also a lot slower, and I actually prefer it be a little busier to help the day go by faster but since I’m still learning I don’t mind for now. However the department itself is really unorganized compared to my old department. I’ll be home when my SO gets off work and assuming I slept would have the time together between him getting off work and me leaving for work together. However, he has weekends off and if I’m working every other weekend still and working Saturday mornings on the weekends I have ‘off’ then I would only get one day where we both have it off(Sunday) and he works early Monday morning so it’s really it’s not that much time. I came to this location expecting to work 1 weekend a month and wasn’t expecting to work Saturday mornings on my off weekends. Also I’ve only worked two graveyard shifts but I feel like shit after and when I get home can only sleep a few hours and can’t sleep again later. I haven’t been able to eat like I’m used to or go the gym which makes me sane. I’m grumpy, stressed and tired. I know it takes time to adjust but I’m wondering if I’ll ever be able to. 

I guess I’m wondering what would be better for me but I’m having a hard time making this decision. Maybe someone has made a choice like this before and what was the outcome and are you happy with it or wish you want another way and have some advice to guide me in the right direction. 

If I stay at my new location I would also like advice on how to handle my manager better if there’s any to offer because I don’t want to be on her side. 

Thank you to whoever reads my essay of a post and comments. I love you guys already. 

Tl;dr: can’t decide between making more money, being closer to home, no parking issues, some more time with SO during the week but dealing with a bipolar manager and schedule on no sleep or going back to a longer commute, difficult parking, a little less pay but a schedule I’m used to and co workers and supervisors I love and at least every other weekend with my SO",09Nov2019,1

Her mom has changed and is being a lot nicer now, but i still feel like shes the same inside. So with Christmas coming my girlfriend has been having lots of panic attacks thinking about spending Christmas with the person who ruined her life for so many years. So  we were talking and the plan is I’m gonna message him and ask him to leave by the end of November so we can avoid conflict or else we will tell her mom about the whole situation and he will be forced to leave anyways (hopefully) my question is what do you think i should say to him? How do we break it to her mom if it comes to that? And how would you go about this situation?

240,"I work at a certain superfast pizza place and have for the past few years while in college. Im a shift manager there and recently (5-6 months ago) got a new gm that was previously at the same level as I am. The issue arises with the fact that she loves gossip. To the point where her best pals at work (another shift lead) and herself talk constantly about everything regarding work and outside of the job. Lately we have been having issues due to the other shift lead and a few others coming to the GM with rumors and because she is friends with them, she automatically believes what they say. One such incidence includes myself and my best friend. There was a rumor started that we were dating (not true in the slightest) but because shes a girl and im a guy it became an issue. We were both sat down and talked to about it and both confirmed that we are not dating in any way shape or form. Even so the rumors about it have persisted and now we cant work the same shifts together. There have been other incidents too mostly regarding things said or events that occured outside of work being misconstrued and over embellished but all end up negatively impacting myself and others on the job. My question is what can be done about this? We have talked to the gm about maybe thinking a little more about where she is hearing things and not trusting rumors but it doesnt seem to have helped at all.

241,"Alr reddit I’ve got a situation and idk what to do at this point. Any advice would be helpful at this point I haven’t really been able to ask anyone for reasons I’ll explain below.

To make a long story short there are 2 girls that I’m friends with and that I’ve developed feelings for, and I guess what I’m asking is how do you know that someone’s the right person for you. They’re both super nice, sweet, smart, and I get along with both of them pretty well. The obvious issue here is that I have to chose one of them and at this point I don’t know what to do. They’d both be good matches for me but how do you know who to chose (if that’s even the right way to word this)? This has been something that’s been going on for probably 1.5-2 months so I’ve given it some time too I just don’t know how to think this through. This isn’t something I’ve ever had to deal with before so any advice or tips would be really nice and appreciated. 

I can’t really ask any mutual friends for advice on this either. That’s mostly due to the girls and our mutual friends live in the same place (university dorms, I live off campus this year with a few other guys.) Them living near each other isn’t the issue itself but the issue is that information spreads extremely fast so if I ask 1 person for advice 10 people will probably know by the end of the day.

246,"My mother recently passed and I am in the process of sorting though all of her belongs and essentially her life. It has been incredibly difficult in numerous ways. 

My mother was not a prolific painter, but she did watercolor paintings in the last few years of her life. The paintings that she did are just about the most precious things in all the items she left behind - because she created them. 

One of my mother’s friends mentioned that my mother had apparently “given her two of her paintings” before she passed that her friend “couldn’t bear to take while she was living.” 

While I want to honor their friendship and be gracious about this, I did not appreciate my mother’s friend approaching this as if I was in possession of *her* property. She’s being very demanding and unsympathetic because “she’s grieving.” 

I was comfortable with giving her ONE painting- that I chose. One that I would be able to part with. Not two of the very few that exist. 

This woman just sent me a super long text about how she knows exactly how many paintings were in my mother’s house and how there should be enough for her to get her two. Sending specific information she feels entitled her to receive exactly what she wants, with no regard for how I might feel.

I am about ready to tell her to shove it at this point. I don’t think I will, I’d rather be nice and do something that is both right but won’t devastate me.

247,"My apologies this Is a semi long story, i need actual advice or a different point of view that you may be able to give me. this a highschool student.
So last Tuesday i was in class with my cousin, we have the same math, he got a phone call from a private number and it was some kids that he knew right away of who they were, they made childish threats saying they called immigration on his parents (my uncle and Aunt) and then hanged up. Instead of ignoring it he was mad and he wanted to press the issue with the kid. So he did do it and the very next day at lunch me and my cousin made our way with only 4 others just to make sure no jumping happened, the other kid came in with at least 20 people. We knew something sketchy was going to happen, my cousin never backs down from a fight but he even looked at me and said ""They are going to jump, lets just go for now until we get more prepared"". I didnt agree with the decision because of how I was raised to never back down and hold my ground but I knew it was the smartest thing. however the kid ran up and started fighting my cousin so it went on. About 2-3 minutes into the fight 5 people out of their group start surounding him and start jumping, I didnt hesitate at all to make a move to help so I went in on that bullshit. I ended up getting backed into a corner and jumped by 7-12 of them. I kept standing and got away and my cousin did to along with the others. I was angry, we all regrouped on school grounds in the parking lot. We were all very made that they had to jump and these two guys in our group were determined to catch everyone slipping when they were alone. Well 2 minutes later two kids are walking by and they were apart of the 20 group that jumped for no reason, they got beaten up badly by our two guys and I joined into it out of anger. After that everything changed, the whole rest of the day kids were getting jumped left and right in the hallways, the staff and monitors were scrambling. The threats only got worse and the war keep getting worse and worse to the point yesterday and earlier today there was a rumored school shooting that was going to happen due to the highschool gangs getting involved. My cousin got caught and suspended, rumors were getting pushed on his name that im not even sure are true at this point. Im not apart of my cousins gang but I am down to protect him against anything until the end which is probably what got me caught up in this mess. Ive been getting threats and new problems every single day. Innocent kids even are now getting accused of being in the specific gang and even when they say no they get jumped for no reason. I will fight anyone but I know my limits and I know I surely cannot beat everyone, especially those in redicolous numbers. I was born in the ghetto but for some reason I have a very open mind and vission due to my past. I will not and i have never snitched on anyone, I know the street rules. I just need a real opinion on how I can protect myself when I have no one left to back me up. I am a target just because of the fact im related to my cousin and I chose to protect him when he got jumped.

248,"Hey all. So, I worked for a notably large tech company for about 9 months. I quit back in july. When I worked there, I was issued equipment that is worth about $2000.

It is now November and the company has not contacted me asking for me to return the stuff. 

To be honest, I am debating selling the items. 

I have attempted to contact the company through email to my old supervisor and phone call to the local rep center for the company, so I could let them know I have their stuff. I have also reached out to the recruitment agency that found my resume in the first place. I have attempted contact three seperate times since August, and I have not received any sort of communication from them in return. 

It seems that they have bigger concerns.

My concern is that, given the company I worked for, their equipment might be encrypted so that the general public couldn't wipe it and use it for themselves. And somehow I'd get screwed in the process.

It's all kind of a weird dilemma and idk what to do :) 

Tldr: I still have $2k of equipment from a company I used to work for who doesn't want it back. Thinking about selling it, but afraid of encryption",09Nov2019,1

So, eventually, after this all died down about a year later, I just started saying I was seeing L, the guys friend because my friend group at the time was falling apart only me and my best friend were still friends at that point so I was just telling her this now (I know its so dumb). 

Fast forward to last year, I mean obviously I'm more grown now and not like how I was before high-school and guys are much more prominently interested in me, but maybe its just the ""virgin thing"" or how people say virgins act that I try to avoid so much (so I didn't want people to think that of me, even though, I don't think most people even think that, it was just a thing I thought so I projected it) . but so basically, this guy who was actually cute but i hadn't given him the time of day really just told me that he wanted to talk whatever and etc. the whole thing of trying to get to know me and it made me shut down a lot  I completely shut him out. Which to me was weird because I did think he was cute, kind of fuckboyish though, but nonetheless. short after, my best friend actually meets a guy who, kind of had the same energy as the guy I met. I'm pretty good at reading peoples personalities, so I could tell he was a fuck boy too and idk maybe I judge too fast so I'm working on that too, this was last year though. So anyway, they end up dating from about idk I want to say may and until maybe august. and I don't want to get too into her business I feel like that's mean, but she did obviously talk to me about their relationship and she always was unsure about him and kind of felt on and off about him, which I relate to I think that's part of why I have a problem, but seeing her in a relationship was healthy for me in a way just because it let me see what it is like normally idk **I am pretty shut off in certain ways because I never really dated or felt comfortable dating** (because my mom cut me off from all my guy friends when I was young :p lol) **so that's probably something to do with why I lied, to fit in and feel normal.** But during the summer and their relationship in general she was more cold to me, had less time for me obviously and kind of rude for whatever reason while they were dating, but I just ignored that because I didn't want her to just accuse me of being jealous. Not that I think she would, but our old friend accused me of being jealous because this guy (who flirts with everyone) she thought liked her and I was just saying how I didn't think he did because he is like that with everyone; but she liked him (because she lied about being a virgin, full circle, yup it gets wild). She actually died that year though, 2018. But both my best friend and I still believe she lied about being a virgin because she would say things that she had been with like idk 12 guys, I don't remember she probably said more I'm just trying to give her the benefit of the doubt. She also claimed to have sugar daddies, go to parties with someone she knew's friends (she said who specifically and etc but no way did they let her drink with them and lose her virginity) and just whatever else, anyway it was clear she was lying. I, on the contrary, have a lying problem and for whatever reason make things really believable even if it is a little out there. I don't remember when exactly, last year or the year before I claimed L and W were fighting over me in a way, but during this time W actually I found out had herpes and a small dick from his then EX-girlfriend lol, small world.  (I mostly made L up, I just based it off of a real first name of W's friend) and so I OF COURSE added this into my plot. We conveniently go to a different school and now W and ""L"" are graduated so it REALLY worked out big time for me. My sister even ended up going to college around the same time so if I felt like saying I went to college parties I could, but thankfully I haven't lied about that. I don't know why I lie though its almost like an inevitable story plot. I've died down on it after I had a ""break up"" even though i said we weren't dating because ""he wanted to date but I didn't, so he \*cheated\* even though we weren't dating so I cut him off"" basically. and Honestly I made up a couple of weird ass fights between then that I don't care to share because I'm just shocked at myself. 

A little side note I also made snaps for 3 of the ""guys"" L, W and one of their other friends about a year or 2 ago and oddly enough it made me chill out a lot on it after I got over the whole I could fake any text situation( I clearly have too much time on my hands and my other, real friends are boring). I got bored of that because I didn't want to lie it was mostly for myself I just liked the idea of it, but I didn't want to lie even more constantly. 

So more recently, I honestly think a big part of my issue is the need for attention, attachment issues with my best friend, and being scared of intimacy. I've actually been on and off talking to this guy for a few months (which is big for me, he is the first guy I said yes to in EVER. As a kid I would always think the guy was joking and I experienced a LOT of weird rapeyness from guy friends or whoever; but for some reason, something in me was just like I should give him a chance. I credit a lot of that to my best friend who dated the one guy and despite how that ended it showed me an example so idk it just made me not shut down so hardcore, just normalizing relationships for me and how a guy is when he is actually interested has shown up a lot more in general in my life so that's helped too). , **but I think I grew to appreciate what a deserving relationship is like (oddly enough) from myself and making up this character** who, I know it seemed like shit, like why would I lie about those things in such, an almost abusive relationship saying he basically played a whole mind game about the ""relationship"" and also I said we were originally friends because we all played the same games, but since he was a dealer (at the time we were looking for people to deal to us) so of course, where it all started, I said I had sex with him for drugs, which, I didn't know at the time, but happens A LOT in our town LOL. SO I got crazy lucky with everything I've ever said happened because it always just worked out I never ""took it too far"" (even though the whole thing is way out of left field, I somehow kept it believable, no one doubts me). Honestly I don't even act or look like anyone someone would think was a virgin, I know that probably sounds dumb, but idk people just think I'm a sl\*\* its actually crazy I never even lied about being one, I guess I come off that way? lmao, but I'm deathly afraid of getting pregnant and I have a weird thing about not being able to be without my best friend because of everything we went through &amp; and I've literally never hung out with out her ever since knowing her besides my family.  \*\*\*\*\*so**rry that was a major side note and this is really long, but for whatever reason, making up this character helped me realize for myself what I'd want in a relationship (not the storyline abuse parts) but a connection so well like how me and my best friend have been from since the day we connected from being completely shut out of our then friend group. I don't know how to make that connection again though, its a crazy, soul-bond I know it could sound dumb and a lot of you probably think that we only think we will be friends forever and maybe that's true, but I would never forget EVERYTHING we've been through I'd never have a relationship with anyone how I have with her and I can't believe I would ever of screwed with her trust with this after all we had been through; then and now.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, 

**TL:DR** 

**I'm just asking if you guys think its important enough of a lie for me to come clean about, we could laugh about later?**

 **or do you think its not worth the hurt because it really is such a basic high school lie and I'm only doing it to help my own conscious and it would ruin her trust in people too?** 

( we honestly both need a lot of therapy from everything and we only really trust each other so I think it could really mess her up and could be selfish of me to say, that's why I haven't and why if it is brought up I only dig myself a little deeper because I couldn't bare the pain I would cause her if she fully knew) 

**to be fair though she didn't really care when we ""knew"" our friend lied about being a virgin..** 

(tbh I've even ""came clean"" before a couple of times and anyone there, or her has thought I was joking, that's how thorough, thought out, and BIG of a giant lie this has been)",09Nov2019,1

260,"     Hey reddit, I’m a freshman currently going through my first semester in college. Since I’ve moved away from home, I’ve been going through a long distance relationship with my girlfriend of 2 years. I’ve dated her since high school and she’s been very attached to me ever since. I also really love this girl but I hardly see her or talk to her anymore. I still see her occasionally, but still not that much. The problem is, I’ve had many opportunities where very attractive girls try to flirt with me at parties or a bar and I have to reject them because I’m in a relationship. 
     On the other hand, My single friends get to have all the fun they want, hang out with pretty girls, and go to all these events that require a date. Because I’ve been having to miss out on so much, I’m slowly drifting away from my close friends. I love this girl, but I feel really held down by this relationship and it’s especially hard when I see the freedom and fun that everyone else gets to have. I’ve been feeling very lonely because of this and have no idea what to do. This girl is very special to me and we get along very well. But this has caused me to slowly lose feelings for her. If I ever broke up with her, she’d be completely heartbroken and I don’t want to put her through that. Sorry if this is a lot but I just don’t know what to do",09Nov2019,1

263,"I  was watching this video where a vocational couch gave some advice... I've watched many to be honest. I am confused or allow me to rephrase it: ""I  know what I want so badly that I am too scare to follow it.""

*Since  I was a kid all I did was sing, dance, play instruments, act, write, draw, learn new languages. It is my essence. I feel joy, I have such an  exciting learning curve with the arts, I shine when I am doing the above. I never cared about money enough, and I say ""enough"", because my logical-self knows how important it is.*

I  currently study Finance, wages in my country are not very good, it  doesn't matter what you study (within reason). Math? I can do it, I am not the best but I can do it, Science? Yeah, sure, not a fan but I can do it. 

I know that many people advice against following your passion completely and only since it is better follow the money (financial stability in a capitalist system makes sense); but all I've ever done is art, I love it, I am this, I've practice so much, this is me, I do a bad performance? I don't care, I try to improve, I do a good performance? Still got to improve...  I feel alive and to be honest, I might not be your prodigy, but gosh I am decent and have the strive to improve until my last catch of breath, yet, over and over again I choose logic/money over my essence.

What is the paradigm here?

Well, that even if I am aware to some extent that money is important, every second I give to something financial, mathematics, scientific, I feel poorer and poorer, however when I sing all alone, every fucking minute is so worth it, that I could say with no doubt (or full of doubts, I am very abstract), that this shit is what I've signed for, I get to finally feel rich and generous when I simply focus all my effort improving at the things that I love (art) and share it with  someone who wants to receive a new message, vain or deep, true or wrong, **I feel connected sharing my message, sharing my pain and bliss all at once, sometimes nothing at all, my despair, my joy, everything until I am empty and feel so relieved.** 

I  guess some people really only have one passion or area where they are  good, really have the strive to improve and listen to their true  essence... sadly, I apparently am one of those people and my path is one full of spines and bankruptcy.

269,"At the beginning of our relationship about 8 months ago, I (24/f) asked my boyfriend (30/m) to get tested before we were sexually active. I was a virgin at the time so I myself didn't get tested (although now I know that even if you are a virgin, you should get tested nevertheless. I didn't have much awareness on sexual health/safe sex at the time.)

My boyfriend did get tested and told me, back then, he was clean/clear. I believed and trusted him. Later, we broke up. I got tested after the breakup because we had unprotected sex a few times and I had an iffy feeling. It was the first time I ever got tested for STDs in my whole life and I didn't know you also had to get a blood test for the ""full"" package - not just STD testing with urine, but also Hep A, B, C, and HIV testing with blood samples.

When I got results back, I tested ""reactive"" for Hep C to my devastation. I reconnected with my ex and asked him if he got a blood test back then or only a urine test. He told me he only got a urine test (testing for STDs) and not a blood test back then.

So he got tested for Hep C. He came back non-reactive.

As a plot twist, it turns out my ""reactive"" for Hep C test was a bogus. This was proven because I got two follow-up blood tests specifically for testing in-depth for Hep C. The second and third tests both showed I was ""non-reactive"" to Hep C and both numbers were way off from the initial test.

I got fully refunded for my first test. However, I now can't trust any of my results from that first test. If they messed up my diagnosis for Hep C, what else did they mess up?

During this whole ordeal, my boyfriend and I actually got back together. Before we become sexually active again, I asked if he would be open to us BOTH getting tests. Since I can't trust my first test and I am wondering if he's in the clear for everything else.

However, he adamantly refuses to get another blood test / he refuses to get tested for HIV because he says if he's positive, it should have come up in his Hep C test. I told him the Hep C test and HIV test are different. He still doesn't want to get tested again because ""it's common for a person to have both HIV and Hep C. They test for both, since it's transmitted the same way.""

TLDR; Should I be accepting that my boyfriend refuses to get tested for HIV -- because he is non-reactive to Hep C, and according to him, a Hep C test should show if he's positive for HIV? It would give me a lot of peace of mind (I would get tested too!) but he says he doesn't want to enable my paranoia.",09Nov2019,1

For as long as I can remember, I wasn’t into buying a pet mainly because I didn’t think I’m responsible enough to properly take care of one. Plus, I get very stuffy when exposed to dog or cat dander and I don’t want to meet the possibility of barking, meowing, or other noises when trying to fall asleep. So yeah, I’m not a pet person.

But then I looked at videos and pictures of reptiles as pets and that actually caught my interest. At first, I considered a tortoise until I realize how truly complicated they are especially with their incredibly long lifespan (I’d probably be dead with nobody to care for the tortoise) and how big they could get.

So yeah, I moved on from tortoises to lizards. More specifically, a bearded dragon which were said to be easy to take care of. Only problem is that I don’t know what I’d need to do to be a good potential pet owner for a bearded dragon nor the costs and stuff.

I will spare most of the details as i already feel uncomfortable writing this, as it feels like im already betraying his trust. 

A while after we meet he is diagnosed with Autism. Which was, as i would later find out, a misdiagnosis of schizophrenia. I see it as no big deal. After that his mother divorces his father, who is as stated in the title, abusive. His mother gets full custody and is taking care of him. She later dies. My friend is soon taken his by his grandparents, who live in a nearby town. At this point he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia for a while, and was on meds. However since the case to get their father deemed as unfit didnt work (or something?) he got custody.
This is a problem as he wont sign forms for his medication. I believe, without his medication hes been getting worse.

He has a very distinct way of texting and talk when hes having a schizophrenic episode. Ever since hes stopped taking his meds, hes been talking in this very distinct way more and more frequently. Recently he went overboard while cutting and had to go to the hospital for blood loss. While there a few doctors recommended him going to a mental hospital. His grandparents ultimately said no. Heres the thing though when he was in there he had what was very evidently a schizophrenic episode. A shadowy doctor coming into the dark room to tell him when he just woke up that mental hospitals and my idea of rehab are awful and theyll be mean to him there. He is taking “his” word as fact. This is bad news because before he has always been able to differentiate between what is real and what is a episode afterwards. This is the strongest evidence yet that hes getting worse. He needs his meds fast. But since his dad wont sign the paperwork he has to wait 2 months because thats when his grandparents might get custody. However he cant wait that long because of the:

Enjoy the mess which is my life. 




I’m 20. I turn 21 in May. I still live with my parents, but me being Mexican American and my parents being from Mexico, that’s normal for us, I have cousins who are 25+ that still live with their parents. 

I graduated high school in 2017. Ever since, I’ve been going to a community college each semester, my current being my 5th. My major was business administration, even though I was iffy on if I wanted to go to college or relax for a year and decide on what to even do. 

My degree plan at the college was 60 credits, each class giving me 3 credits. At the rate I was going, with 4 classes a semester, this semester (my 5th) should be my last. 

It’s not. 

Not even close. 

Out of the 20 classes I should already be completing, I’m really only done with like 8-10. I’ve retaken a few classes due to drops/F’s and other classes I’ve just dropped, failed, or haven’t taken yet. I started off well but as each semester passed, my motivation to keep going to classes dropped. The only reason I kept going was because my parents urged me to continue studying because that’s “the only way I could have a better life and earn good money”. 
My parents say this because they came from poor families in Mexico, with multiple siblings (around 10 each more or less), extremely low income, and usually barely any education. My father stopped going to school at 2nd grade and stopped doing homework at 4th-5th. My mom made it to like 8th and that’s it. They both had to work to provide for their families, and they continue to do what they can for the family they have here now.  
They’re more than willing to pay for anything I need, be it the college tuition each semester, books, supplies, and whatever else I need to progress in school and better my life. I owe them the world and more for what they’ve done for me and my siblings. 

But I don’t really want to waste their money on tuition since I don’t really have the motivation to keep attending classes. 
I don’t know how to tell them because i know they’ll be kinda devastated that I don’t want to receive the education that they couldn’t have. 

My dad has told me that if I don’t want to study, then I’ll have to work. He owns a Mexican restaurant, as well as a few of his brothers. I work at my uncle’s restaurant nearby and work 3 days each week, making a decent income for someone who only pays gas and whatever I want to buy. It’s not a bad job, but I’ve had it for over a year and I’m honestly growing tired of it. It’s repetitive, boring, and just stressful dealing with stupid customers, lazy workers, and other bullshit that comes with the job. If I stopped studying I’d most likely start working 5-6 days a week at the same place I hate. I don’t want that. 

So, I’ve grown tired of my job, and I’ve lost motivation and reason to keep attending college. I have no idea what else to do. 

Ive thought about joining the military, since i have a cousin who joined the Air Force and is stationed in Japan. It seems really interesting but I have no idea what I’d do or if it’s really something for me. I’m still kinda debating on it but again, I have no idea yet. 

I’m into cars and trucks, so I’ve debated becoming a dealership salesperson or a mechanic or something, but 1) I’ve read a bit about car salespeople, and starting out it’s a bit tough and overall you don’t really make a nice enough income. I kinda have a bit of an expensive taste and I honestly don’t wanna struggle with my paychecks. 2) Being a mechanic sounds fun and all since I’ll be working with cars and trucks, and I could end up modifying my own vehicles, but what turns me away from it is again the not-so-high income and that it seems like I’ll have to kinda slave my way to a decent paycheck at some average auto shop. 

Sports-wise, I enjoy (American) football, but soccer (technically football, but I’m in the US so yeah) is my number one sport. I tried playing as much as I could in high school, but having been in a small 2A/3A school full of people who didn’t really like soccer, I only got to play my 7th grade year, junior year, and senior year. I loved the sport and would’ve done whatever I could to go professional but my parents never supported me nor did they even go to any of my games, football or soccer. It was as bad as my mom complaining about me playing sports because she had to pick me up later than usual (around 7pm) while she still had to pick up my little sister at 3-4pm. Now, after 2 1/2 years of not really playing besides this recent Sunday league and not consistently working out, I’m now in horrible form and shape and basically have no hopes of becoming professional, so that’s out of the question. 

Another thing I enjoy is video games. I’m a bit of a PC gamer, though I have a laptop (Dell Inspiron 15 700 gaming laptop) so I struggle to play the newer, heavy games like Battlefield 5, but I enjoy playing others like War Thunder, Battlefield 4, GTA V (when my PC is in a good mood), FIFA 20, and Madden 20. I’ve considered potentially somehow making a YouTube/Twitch channel to post gaming videos even though I’m not a good player In any of the games i listed, but that’s not an option. At least according to my parents. 
They hate video games. 
They think video games are negatively addicting and ruin your life no matter what you play. 
I could be playing FIFA for an hour and my dad would get mad because I’m playing video games. 
I can’t play American Truck Sim either because “video games are bad”. 
So yeah, no more becoming a YouTuber/streamer. 

(This is where it get dark-ish)

My only other option is really just to somehow kill myself or something. No, I won’t kill myself, I promise, i don’t have the courage to do it, but i can’t help but wonder why the hell im even alive if I don’t see how i can improve my future. I don’t want to be single forever, living a shitty life, barely managing to pay rent or bills (if I even move out of my parents’ house) and be depressed until I die. I mean, why suffer when it could just all end, right? 

No. Wrong. There’s still hope. I want to change my life for the better, but I’m just lost. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what steps to take or what path to follow. I know I can improve, but I just have no idea how. So please, help a dude out real quick. Give me suggestions.

What the hell do I do with my life?",09Nov2019,1
287,"My dad is very overprotective, and won't let me go by train to my friends, because he said I might get assaulted/raped/kidnapped etc.
He said he just doesn't wanna take the risk. I'm 16. 

What are some arguments I could use against him? I understand his concern but I also really don't wanna rely on when my parents can bring me to my friends house, because that's only ever every second weekend. Also it's way more expensive.

288,So up until recently I always liked politics whatever. It’s something I’m interested in studying. It’s not really important to this question but I think it plays a factor.

290,"Warning: This is long, and I could go on even longer but Im trying to keep it short.

I once nearly attempted suicide. It was an all-time low in my life and I have PTSD from it. I could never shake it and it's hovered over me like a cloud ever since. Occasionally, I feel waves of pressure from myself to do something again but I know I'm stronger than that. So this isn't like a suicide call for help or anything. If it gets to that point I know who I need to call and where to go. But boy do I feel like I inch closer to it every day. (note that I already am taking antidepressants and seeing someone for psychiatry for the PTSD)

Gist is that I'm a 26M software engineer who has been single and living alone for nearly 5 years now. I live away from friends and family. The only social circle I have are those friends from home that I play games with in order to literally remove my brain from my own life. I have nothing to live for in my life except work which is why I live away from everyone.

Work is a tough subject. I love what I do. I'm proud of it. It's a dream job but I can't do it back home near my friends. Everyone looks up to my career, is in awe and sometimes jealous even though I think it's severely misplaced heh. It's personal for me and I'm so attached to it. And even worse: moving for work is why I lost my first and only relationship where I was engaged. Work is my everything now and I honestly think it's the only reason I'm alive today.

So why am I in a bad state currently?  I seriously desire a partner and a closer friend circle. But Im convinced that work, my dream, is limiting or even outright preventing me. For many reasons that would take a book to write and explain my thought process. Between the fact that I've moved to physical places that are not optimal for me to meet people, there are virtually no female coworkers, most coworkers are older than me so it's even harder making friends, and worst of all - I'm away from the people I'm already comfortable with being myself. I'm at a total disadvantage because I'm not the nationality of most people I live around as well, just to put the top on the cake.

I've spent over a thousand dollars over the last 3 or so years on tinder, OkC, Bumble, coffeemeetsbagel, match, Happn, plenty of fish. Want to know how many people actually have spoken to me (ie having an actual conversation or meet in person) through those apps in the just 2019? Around 12, and 4 of which only did so because I tried advice to be aggressive and flirty which is NOT who I am. Sure I got action, but did I like those people? No. As for the others where I try to be myself and nice, they either resulted in ghosting or straight up just finding out we didn't like each other and being honest. 12 people - nearly half didn't even meet me face to face. 

The next recommendation I get from people is ""go to meetups, events, do a sport."" I've put myself out there so much more than I've ever been comfortable with in my entire life in this 5 year timespan that I don't know where to begin with my frustration. Go to meetups that's interesting to me? Ends up being older or uninteresting people. Go to events or places that are way out of my comfort zone? Meet interesting people but I'm not having fun or feel like myself which not only puts myself off but those interesting people are put off by me. Sports? I'm practically paralyzed by the thought of being on a team but I have signed up for two classes! At least I tried for a period anyway before quitting, I only ever feel out of place and not cut out for it.

I'm at a loss. I can't make friends, can't date, can't have a life outside work. I'm most happy and comfortable at work or talking to, playing games with, or visiting my friends from back home.

One of my friends back home is one of the most nerdiest, weirdest, niche person ever. And he has a huge friend circle around our age. I was just on vacation with him and I asked him for help. He just said ""Come back home. There's tons more people here and you fit in. Give up your dream job, forget it, and be happy instead."" And he's at least partially on point I can't argue with, there's tons more people back home that I feel I'll have much better luck befriending and hopefully dating.

But I'd have to give up the job. It's like happiness is divided between work and friends/relationships. And I'm not allowed to have both. I have to choose one or the other. But when he said that, I wanted to move right away and I dreaded headed back to work. But then when I got back to work, I was like ""I really love doing this and I don't want to give it up.""

So in short, I'm torn between my job and personal life. I can't seem to have both. I don't think it's possible for me to make friends or meet someone I love where I live, for work. And that work makes me happy and keeps me alive. Maybe that makes it obvious what I should do though. Work isn't everything and even though it's kept me grounded, it obviously hasn't done the best. Maybe I'm way more happy with good close friends and a girlfriend despite a mediocre job; obviously I should move right?!

If I do move, the result is not garaunteed. My nightmare scenario is: caving in to moving back home, landing into a job I don't like, regretting giving up my dream job, hating myself, then not being able to make friends yet alone attempt to even try to date. I'd actually kill myself without hesitation, I feel it inside me. The thought gives me shivers. I won't have anything to lean on and I'll just give in.

This has gone on too long at this point, I'm sorry. I have so much more to spew to get off my mind... I've rewrote huge paragraphs into little chunks and removed as much branching thoughts as I could. I'm severely desperate, and I'm beginning to feel like I'm going to collapse again.",09Nov2019,1
291,"Found a part time job recently. I was told I would likely have to go through 1-2 weeks of training before I officially start the job, of which I would not be getting paid. I went into training fully aware of this and ready to learn. I wouldn’t say my family felt the same way.

I understand why they were upset because I was working 5 hours with no pay and on top of that, ended as late as 10-11pm in the night. My brother told me that unpaid work training is against the law (if the training is work-related), is this true?

Some information:
-I’m training to basically take orders (pick up phone calls, cash in checks, anything up to and excluding waiting tables and cooking. Everything else I do) it’s $11/hour ONCE I END TRAINING which I’m okay with because it’s a restaurant, I never expected minimum wage pay
-it’s a small restaurant, team is no bigger than like 15-17 people (INCLUDING chef, boss, drivers, other part-time workers), there’s only one branch
-everyone including trainees still get dinner and they’re very explicit about how the job is. Unpaid/paid hours, obligations, etc.

I had an argument about this with my brother because he kept annoying me about it, and it angered me because I really like my job. I didn’t care that it was unpaid because I was still learning, and I think it’s unreasonable for me to get paid for it. It takes time out of the other workers’ day and potential customers to train me, so why should I get paid? (That’s my reasoning.) there’s also no contract so I have no legal obligation to continue the job if I really want to quit. I can just leave. It won’t be nice, but I can. Also, if I were to quit after Training Day #2, (assuming $11/hour for 5hr day) that’s 110$ total, for doing absolutely nothing to benefit the store? It doesn’t make sense to me. Today was my third day at work. Our sales for the past two days were about 2000$/day (for like a 13.5 hour day) and today was 4000$ because it was a Friday. We’re a small restaurant and we don’t really earn that much. I really don’t see why it’s a problem. Is this really not okay? I just want to be reasonable.

TLDR; Work training at a small, one-branch restaurant with no compensation and my brother is getting so tight. Had an argument. Am I in the wrong or is this really not okay?",09Nov2019,1

Because of this she has clinical depression. My sister asks me to spend time with her when I get back from school, and I never have any free times any more. She always makes me watch shows and stuff that I don’t like, but the problem is that she makes me do this stuff for 10 hours. That means I never get to hang out with friends like I used to all the time, I don’t get to play video games anymore which was my favorite thing to do, and I barely get any sleep anymore. The only times I get let out is when my dad does stuff with me, which isn’t super often because he works for a really long time, because he’s a defense attorney, and when I have to do my homework. And she always watches me do my homework to make sure I’m not trying to avoid her.

Second time, I had a friend share something green with me but didn’t know what it was called. So I chose Green tea. 🤦🏻‍♂️

Last time, it was early in the morning and cold. And for some stupid reason my brain didn’t register the word ‘ice’. I got ice coffee and had to walk to school with ice in my hands.

303,"I apologize for this being so long, but I didn’t realize how much this really hurt me ‘till I’m now crying over it at 3:20am. 

Long story short for background on this; A year ago, I knew two people in real life in which one of them was a twitch streamer with 1.5k followers. The channel has not grown in a year since. I knew them pretty well, we used to work together, the guy knew my Godfather who passed away and his girlfriend and I became very good coworkers and friends. 
One night after a depressive episode where my friend had killed himself a few days before hand, they offered to come get me and let me chill for a little bit to make sure I was okay. We ended up drinking, and me and the girl got way too drunk to the point I could only barely get up to go to the bathroom. Next thing I know, I’m getting finger fucked with my pants down and legs kissed while the guy is fucking his girlfriend next to me. I woke up an hour later remembering, not knowing how to feel, but with a very uncomfortable hunch, I left at 4:30am able to drive finally and get out. I left most of my shit besides my phone and chargers. Just a backpack, game, and a beanie. I wanted to get out. I just had started a great relationship with a guy I know very well over years, I was devastated because I never cheated on anyone. To my surprise, he wasn’t pissed and knew it wasn’t my fault. I’m thankful to this day and we live together now. 

A few days ago: I confronted them on Discord a year later. I told them how I had to see a therapist. I’ve only told her (my therapist), my boyfriend, and my boyfriends father. I didn’t really get to put it out there until I was comfortable with it enough. I feel haunted with it now. I told them how it really crossed boundaries and that it hurt the hell out of my feelings as a wondered if it was my fault, if it was planned, if I did something wrong or why it happened. I never saw it as the girls fault either, but she had been with him a long time and I’m sure she knew he was like this. 
After it happened, I told them I could no longer enjoy things like I used to. I stopped streaming when I was doing so good on Twitch at the time without a word to anyone. I stopped drawing when I’m so good at it. I stopped everything. Underlying that I was not having a good time in my feelings, I ignored it for a bit. 
The girl responded apologetically and thoughtfully saying she didn’t mean to sever ties and in hopes that she didn’t bear pain on my relationship. 
The guy on the other hand, said multiple times he didn’t see it as a big deal and once, he was sorry. 

I never responded and left the chat. I sent the girl a message two days later saying that she was a great friend, and I didn’t personally see it as her fault but I don’t trust them and I don’t want them around anymore. I un-friended them everywhere. 

I do not wish backlash, even as bad as I want to run into his twitch stream and yell out that he sexually assaulted me, but I don’t have the heart, courage, and I’m terrified to tell my mother. 
I’m only 20. I was 19 when it happened. 

I don’t know how to move forward from here. I haven’t told my boyfriend/anyone about the confrontation or anything. I just feel lost and depressed like I’m stuck in that room. I’m lying next to him while he’s asleep crying as I type, knowing I have to get up in two and a half hours.

308,So I'm 21 years old. And I've never actually had car insurance before. I've owned one really old truck. And it was the same year and model as the truck that my employer had. So I kinda just said that his proof of insurance for his truck was actually for my truck. And I've never had to use it or even show it. I was in an accident once but a car rear ended me. And I was able to fix my damage myself. So I didnt have to make a claim or anything. But now I'm a few states away and I need insurance. I'm in Tennessee close to Knoxville.  And all the places I've checked have me around 130- 150$ a month. With the lowest being 115$ . And  that's just too much for me right now. I pay 600$ in rent a month and I only make 1200$ a month. And then with 300$ car payments  on top of that.  I barely have enough money for gas and food right now. And if I gotta start paying more than 100dollars more a month. I'm really gonna struggle so.

So basically this might sound weird but I have a super bad habit of biting the inside of my cheeks and lips. Normally it isn't too bad and it happens infrequently but recently it's gotten to the point where I have to rotate through positions in my mouth to bite. It becomes obsessive because once I start, I can't stop myself. Scar tissue has started developing which only makes me want to bite it off even more. 

I honestly have no idea how to stop this habit and I don't even know if anyone else does this. I've done this for as long as I can remember and most of the time I don't even realize I'm doing it until I bite too deep. I can't even eat salty things anymore because I constantly have this happening and it hurts so bad.

So last night my boyfriend and I were having a great time at my house; having a few drinks and listening to music. 

He had an idea to go and pick his dog up to bring her to spend the night with us (she’s like my favourite animal in the world). I was fine with this, he asked me if I wanted to go with him but I didn’t wanna leave a family member in the house alone. 

I ordered him a cab and he clearly told the driver on the phone that he needed to go from my house, to his and then back to mine. That was all booked and then we waited. 

He seemed slightly drunk but nothing too extreme, and he told me to wait in the living room so I’d hear the door when he got back.

Annoyingly he doesn’t have any data on his phone so I can only contact him when he is connected to WiFi; this is why I needed to listen out for the door. 

So off he goes, giving me a kiss. 

And I waited... for almost 2 hours and he never returned. I sent him a string of messages because obviously I’m worried, and he read them without replying; which he has never done :(

321,"  

I wasn’t always like this as a kid. In fact, I was said to be a more “cheery” person as a child. But at some point in my life, I’m not sure when, I became emotionless. I don’t think I ever noticed that I had no emotions at the time but I can clearly remember that I probably felt nothing. I never even had any meaningful memories and everything that happened in my life doesn’t elicit any kind of emotional reaction. I’d done everything in my life either “just cause” or because that’s what society expected. The only people I remember actually caring about are my parents. I vaguely remember feeling bad when a supposed misfortune happened to them. But I’ve slowly grown to stop caring about them after all the beatings they’d given me as a child. I have shown no empathy or actual concern to anyone else except for one case. This one case was basically when a friend was crying to me because another friend blocked him. I actually felt genuinely bad for him to the point I got a frown on my face. Generally, I’m emotionless and don’t feel anything. Due to this I don’t feel the motivation to do anything because hey, why should I do anything when I don’t care in the first place? This doesn’t stop me from doing something but it’s more like “when I feel like it” and it’s like a habit if anything. I have felt some emotions, but they’re either A. Not that strong or B. Very rare. I have felt an infatuation for several characters and one of them lasted for a good while until I stopped caring, that one in particular felt more like an actual crush (I never really had any crushes in my life so this was a surprise to me.) Some friend managed to make me smile one time but I’m not sure if I felt happy or not. I have felt some appreciation and pity for other people (my friends and family mostly.) I felt remorse for some things I’d done and I have felt guilt at some point but it was only momentary. But there is this one friend that I have shown some “special” affections for. I dated them at some point and even though I didn’t feel anything for them, I kind of got very jealous and distraught that they were dating someone else. It kind of felt like I actually liked them a lot? And I kind of feel that I’d do anything to make them happy even if it hurts me in the long run sometimes. I seemingly enjoy their company the most compared to my other friends.  
 

I need to stop lying to myself, I feel generally nothing for other people, not even hate.

My mum had a strong depression, because of her Ill parents (they are now dead) and she wasnt able to do anything anymore, doings 2 things at a time made her head spin already getting close to a panic attack. 

Now that her parents are dead it got better, she also changed her lifestyle, got healthier and so on, but even so it got better it was still not perfect of course.

Now hat it happened with my Dad I already know how my mum wont be able to handle anything in her own anymore. Before we already adviced her to go to a therapy, but she thinks she is good how she is and asking her now again probably wont change anything.

Right now I go to university for IT, I liked to do things on PC, so I just went with that, found out liking doesnt need to mean being interested in it.

So here I am struggling day and night at university worrying that I wont have anything in my future, a Dad that got strong cancer and he is just telling already ""guess our dog will be the last one"" and so on and a Mum in strong depression that wont be able to handle all that.

      So about me, I am in my last year of university, I like to spend time alone watching anime/youtube and play games casually, your typical introvert. I grew up  in KSA, and went to an international school since KG2. Then from grade 4-8 was in an all boys school until we moved to Amman HKJ, where i spent my remaining school years in a co-ed school. 
     As you can imagine, the culture difference was somewhat difficult on me. After all these years I was in a classroom that has boys and girls.

     Soo my problem here that my family thinks that I dont like them or too stingy (emotion wise) cuz I dont speak with then like how they want me to. My mom cuz she had 4 brothers, I think, expects me to act like them, like talking to my sisters everyday, ask them how is like doing and these stuff. I on the other hand only open up when around my friends or relatives.

      My mother just called me today, and told me your sisters are feeling lonely cuz you have been spending time alone not with them, and that they are trying to make me feel happy, keep in mind I didnt ask for anything from them and they want to feel that I acts like how my father would.

- a person crossing the street but not on the cross way/ or walking  very slowly while on the phone, I either wish to run them over or take their face and scrub it on the footpath like when you grate a block of cheese until the noise disappears and leave only a flat face.

342,"Yesterday night I was with my boyfriend and we were laughing at videos on Reddit whilst cuddling. He suddenly says to me ‘the only bad thing about you is your acne’. I laughed for a second until I realised what he said and I said ‘what?’ and sat up. He instantly said ‘wait, can I retract that? I didn’t mean it like that’ but by that time I was already starting to cry about it. 

I hit puberty early and got acne before everyone else. I was made fun of for it often and became the target of dares for people e.g ‘I dare you to kiss OP’s head’. I didn’t have friends for a few years until my acne (mostly) cleared and I believe that it was the route of my anxiety. Even now when my boyfriends friends come over I feel self-conscious and try to subtly hide my face (by pretending to sleep, using my hands, etc).  I take tablets and use a cream for my face which has helped immensely, but I still get a few pimples and  the scars are still there. Anyways, this comment hit hard because of the history I’ve had with acne. 

He apologised profusely and tried to speak to me multiple times but I sat there for around 20 minutes in shock until my dad texted me that he’s outside. I told my dad what he had said and my dad was as equally confused as I was. I was trying to remain calm so that I don’t do something stupid in the moment but I started to get very angry during the car ride and when I got home I called him and yelled at him to which he apologised again and that he will get my flowers (which I had wanted). 

I feel really sad about the situation. Even if he didn’t mean it, I feel like that’s truly what he feels - like everyone else I’ve spoken to in the past. He tells me that I’m beautiful everyday which is why this is so conflicting for me. I don’t understand how somebody could slip up and say something so hurtful like that by accident but maybe that’s just me not understanding that it happens.

345,"I don't really know what to label as my issue, so i'm going to try my best to list some important points to know, and hope for the best. It's a lot of text to read, but if you choose to do it, thank you. :)   


 I have a long history of emotional trauma which led to anxiety, indecision, fear of confrontation, depression, and the worst of all, I'm terribly lazy. All of these things cycling my every day life has led me down into a pit of self-loathing. I've developed what I call a split personality, when really it's not, I just have so much indecision that I almost always have conflict internally for the most trivial things. Example being I used to love playing an MMO and I had one character I was really proud of. Now I create and delete multiple characters over and over and over again because I'm not sure what ""class"" I want to play, I just know I want to play the game, but now I'm boring myself because I can't ever reach endgame and make progression towards anything, but thinking about the hours some of the rewards takes just feels so difficult to dedicate myself to. How can someone be so lazy that video games feel like a chore?   


I know it as a fact that I need professional help. But my previous experiences with that have all ended poorly. I don't trust any psychologist to help me and I hate the idea of telling my full story to anyone. I've done horrible things I don't want to ever have to bring into reality again. I have few friends, none of which I feel actually care for me or my well being. Yet I can't blame them for it when some days I really don't care about them. 

I'd classify myself as an observant person. I'm good at picking apart situations, and some of my friends come to me for advice, claiming previous advice from me has helped them. But my own problem feels so deeply rooted, with so many details needed to make any viable conclusion, that I feel like a literal object that's broken beyond repair.  


I can't do the things I love anymore. I used to draw so often, but now it's rare for me to draw once every couple of months. I want to write for a career. Hell my indecision has split me between writing and music if i'm being honest. Not like I know how to begin down either path anyway.  


I'm a laid back person with such an easy going nature, I've always lived without any negative judgments of other people. I really like that about myself. But over the years, I've lost a lot of patience. And now I'm experiencing unbridled rage for no particular reason. I'm beginning to respond to things irrationally. I get so frustrated at my anger that it builds up and I have no outlets to help me with it. I used to self harm, but I've broken that habit mostly. There are still some moments when I get so angry that I hit myself. Repeatedly. I disoriented myself once from hitting my head too hard, and it scares me. I don't know what will happen if I'm ever forced to fight anyone back. (I've never even thrown a punch at someone)  


I like the idea of spirituality. I have a dream to find internal peace. I share a lot of buddhist beliefs, but my religion remains something I'm still figuring out. I quite like it. I've built my own spiritual belief that's not quite detailed, but it's based on my personal experiences and it grows with me. This is about the only thing steady in my life.  


 I can't list all my troubles with one simple reddit post. But, I want to change. I truly do. I want to change so bad that it physically hurts my heart when I think about it. I just don't even know where to begin. I hate feeling sorry for myself. I hate the thoughts i'm having of wanting my life to end. But the one thing I hate more than anything of this situation I've put myself in, is that I've never once stood up for myself or the things I believe in. I fear everyone. I fear everything. I always have.",09Nov2019,1
346,"Hey guys so  about 15 years ago my family and I decided to take the privately owned vacant lot right next to our house and beautify it with evergreens and other plants and trees because it was an eye sore and we wanted to make our walkway look good.

351,"I’ve been in this school for around 2 years now (moved from another country, had to change schools). The previous school I was in is very fancy- huge classes, no grading system (instead there are written comments on what you can improve), cleanliness, small amounts of people in each class and more. 

I’ve been struggling with my social life and my grades for the time I’ve been here. When I moved, I was extremely upset and confused, and I felt lost. This led to me acting out and being aggressive towards other people, not trusting anyone, and believing that people were only going to be hostile to me. People then decided to step away from me and talk about me behind my back instead, leading to an awful cycle. My grades were not great either: I used to get lots of praise from my teachers, and now I had to deal with written scores, a competitive environment, and a new language. This led to me failing many of my classes.

The new school year after that wasn’t that great either. People still hated me (and still talked about me behind my back). I cried a lot because of this, and started to hit my head a lot and hurt myself in order to try to get rid of some of the pain. I thought about suicide all the time and planned ways to kill myself. My life at home was also starting to decline. My family called me horrible names, and said that I was pretty much the devil (and they still do say things like this whenever they’re angry at me). Of course, my grades barely improved. I tried a lot and was able to improve some of my classes, but others didn’t improve (mainly anything that had to do with language). 

I planned to try and make this year better. I studied every single day and wrote things down twice. I listened to every lesson and did my homework. I tried to become more sociable. I tried to think more positively and treat myself better. I tried so hard, and yet all of these things failed. I constantly deal with academic pressure (which I’m not even sure where it’s coming from), and the loneliness I feel. I’m starting to have more suicidal thoughts. I think of this place as a sort of hell that I am trapped in. I think of myself as a mistake, like something went horribly wrong during my childhood and now I am this way.

Please don’t tell me to just think more positively. Please don’t tell me to go see a therapist, because I already am seeing one. Please don’t tell me to change schools (I have tried so hard to convince my parents to change schools, and it just isn’t possible). Please don’t tell me to talk to my school counselor, because my mother hates her and doesn’t want me talking to her (and she’ll know if I do). Please do not at all tell me to just ‘try and get through this year’ because it’s killing me. 

I just need any way to get out of this hell. I’m so done with it. I’m so done with being a shitty loser.",09Nov2019,1

I'm in uni and I work a part-time job at the same time . A little background on me : I never go out or buy new things because I want to save my money for my future or for any emergencies. But I don't even see any point in saving up anymore because every time I save even a small amount my brother or sister has a new problem in their life and I have to give them money. Every week its either $30 or they ask me for $200. My sister (23) doesn't work and my brother works 2 jobs but keeps saying that all his money goes into paying bills. I gave him $1000 from my savings so that he could save up more and have some emergency funds on the basis that he would give it back to me in 2 months' time. It's been four months and I asked him for my money back and it turns out he only has $200 in his account. He's been working a lot these past four months so where did his money go? I'm so frustrated because whenever I talk to them, they guilt trip me and when I ask them how they spent everything they keep saying things like 'don't talk about money it frustrates and pressures me more'. I seriously don't know what to do because I want my money back and I never spend even a dollar on anything I want but they keep asking for money and I don't have a lot of money in my savings anymore.  I wish I could just disown my family at this point because I'm under so much stress all the time and all they do it emotionally blackmail and guilt trip me.I'm only 21 I never agreed to become the breadwinner of my family.

361,"I have never had cancer myself. But my mom has, here is the stroy.

My mom had cancer twice (ovarian, then kidney).

First time (ovarian) was like 9-10  (I think I was 11) years ago. She had been feeling pain in her lower abdomen, and went to the doctor, they did a scan, and there it was. A huge tumor in one of her ovaries. Luckily, it was only stage 1, they caught it very early (which is probably what saved her life). I was young, and had no idea what was happening, and was happy that I was spending a lot of time at my friend's house (a girl who I had a crush on at the time). And that after I knew what was happening, I was talking to said friend, and this other kid overheard the conversation, and told me that he hoped she died, I still haven't forgiven him, probably never will. They ended up having to take basically the entire reproductive system out because of the size of the tumor. 

Then, the second time (kidney) was this year. She had to go in for an annual check on her numbers (I forget the actual name for them) for her ovarian cancer, and they were higher than the past few years. They ran a bunch of tests over a few weeks.  The n ew ws wasn't good. I'm 20 now, and it scared the living fuck out of me to hear that she had cancer again. Me and some friends had just pulled up to one of their houses in my truck when she called me with the news. They basically watched the color drain from my face. They asked me what was wrong. I didn't answer at the time. I just slowly got out of my truck, slammed the shit out of my door, and almost broke my hand on the window as I punched it. I was surprised that both my hand and the window survived the hit intact. Luckily, it was confined to her kidney, and hadn't spread.  They had to take the whole kidney.

She managed to pull through both times, and I'm grateful to God for that, even though I haven't prayed in years, I should start again. I don't know if I can survive hearing those words again. From anyone I know. Fuck cancer, I can't wait for the day that we erase it from existence.",09Nov2019,1

370,"My father passed away and left all things to me in his will. He did not own a great deal and most of his possessions were not of value, just sentimental. ‘Family’ - his siblings and parent- have been very unhappy about this and took items on their own accord. I got a lawyer, requested all items be returned and legal consequences were clearly explained. 

We recently went to collect items, I took some items that were sentimental or useful to me but was willing to leave items that didn’t mean a lot to me and they were okay with me leaving items, especially things they had expected to be left as they were ‘theirs’ (e.g all electrical goods). Some items were Left as they were possibly sentimental to others in the family, or just a gesture of me not taking everything in attempted to diffuse. 

Verbal abuse and threats of physical assault were thrown in the short time I was there to collect items, police were informed and assault charges could have been laid, as I was later pushed (Not too hard, but enough to move me). For obvious reasons, I didn’t get to take everything I had hoped for before leaving the property. Mainly, I did not collect a large collection of vintage car parts. I’m unsure of value but my father had stressed for me not to throw them away as they were valuable. Other close sentimental items have also not been returned. These aren’t of value but I’m furious they chose what they would keep when by law they were to get nothing. 

I have two options: return with police, collect what remains of parts and if I choose, push through the legal system for other items taken. These ‘family’ members could well end with jail time, or at very least some hefty fines/legal bills to pay. We will not be in touch once this is over, so I’m not concerned about losing the relationships.

Alternatively I walk away from a helllish situation calling it tough luck and praying they don’t contest the Estate in the future (unlikely, but can’t be ruled out). The car parts aren’t sentimental, purely monetary, and I have other things I can remember him with.

I have various people pushing me to fight/not fight and I’m too lost. If I go ahead, i have significant stress, the possible damage of relationships with family who don’t think I should do this (family not apart of the situation, just my main network of family), and possible legal fees (though costs are to be charged to those causing issues with the property because of their obstruction).

371,"I love my father, i really do. When i was a child he was abusive towards me and my mom. He has had 2 restraining orders against us, but with time things got better and he hasn't been abusive for a long long time. He loved my mom so much that he changed.
Well he thought i didn't remember it since i was quite young, but i do. And of course things like that leave traumas in people. As a child you think that's normal, since you're raised with living in fear.
It makes a person stronger, but it also leaves extreme fears.
My dad is soft nowadays and doesn't get physical. Sometimes he's verbally abusive, but nothing else. When i see him i get extreme anxiety if i have to ask something, because i'm afraid asking something that seems normal to others might make him mad. How do i help myself ask things without getting scared every time?

381,"I'd like to start off by saying, before anyone comments on this please have the patience to read ALL of the post. As every little detail matters. 

So to make a long story short for backround purposes, my ex fiance used to be so obsessed with porn that it led to our break up. It got so bad he wouldn't even touch me. And if we finally had sex, he HAD to look at it while having sex with me. He would lock himself in our walk in closet and watch porn all night (he set up a desktop in there specifically for that). He even blew 5,000 of our wedding budget on subscriptions to porn. So for that reason,  I am one of those people who consider porn as cheating since it literally destroyed my relationship.

Now, I told my current partner all of this and he was very well aware that I considered it cheating and said he would not ever watch it.

 About 2 months in, I caught him watching it. Idioticly, decided to to through the history and see exactly what he was watching. He was looking up specific body types very opposite of mine. I am petite but busty (small waist, big boobs, big butt, thick thighs) he was looking up petite girls but the no tits,no ass, noodles for legs type (I'm NOT saying anything bad about them,  i think all body types are beautiful, I'm just trying to explain the major difference). 

After a week I decided to forgive him and take him back as he apologized profusely and explained he didn't realize how serious I was. He also promised to never watch it again and I really don't think he has.

Now, naturally his eyes wander at times and it's ALWAYS with girls with that body type. Also, he never initiates sex, he can never go more than once, and he can't get it up half the time. He blames it on his age but he is young! He is 36, I'm 26. I find it very hard to believe he is having these issues already. 

So the problem here is I'm literally OBSESSING over this and CANNOT get over it! It's been a year and I think about it almost 24/7 and can't get over it. It's gotten so bad that when we are out in public and a girl with that body type is even remotely in sight I automatically get mad at him and get insecure. And I've NEVER been insecure in my life and I hate this new feeling.  

It's gotten so bad, I avoid bringing my friends with that body type over, or want to leave a restaurant if the waitress has that body type.  I don't even like going out with him in public anymore. 

I strongly feel he loves me but is not attracted to me and I constantly tell him about feeling this way when his eyes wander or he can't get hard, and he INSISTS he is attracted to me and that I'm ""sexy as hell "" (whatever that means). 

A few weeks ago I tried leaving him cuz I can't get over it and he was literally on his knees begging me not to leave him. So I mean is he just in love with my soul or am I way too traumatized and am ruining something good? 

Please someone HELP me. I don't think he understands I am literally OBSESSING over this and that it is literally on my mind almost 24/7. Any little thing he says or does that I believe has to do with my body, automatically jumps to him not being attracted to me and I get very depressed and mad.

Ive had a few visits from friends/family in the past and my brain has always frozen up and made everything awkward because i don’t know how to act with them at my workplace in front of work colleagues.

Currently, my issue is that I have avascular necrosis of both my hips and it caused me to have a limp as well as issue of climbing stairs, wearing pants etc. I am currently undergoing physiotherapy to strengthen my muscle. I was advised by my transplant doctor to undergo the hip replacement surgery but my orthopaedic doctor think otherwise(issue of being too young with the need for another replacement in 20 years and having weak muscles). Anyway, that’s not really the point.

I am also a medical graduate that is supposed to be working in Malaysia government hospital. To be honest, I am very afraid to go back. Most of my friends have undergone the housemanship for 2 years and they have started questioning why they are doing this, many have contemplated leaving or have stopped being passionate about this job. My stamina is no longer as last time. My hip issue would be a real challenge to overcome while working because of the long hours of standing, running and climbing stairs. However, if I don’t work as a doctor, there isn’t really anything else that I can do. I know there are options, but my degree is kinda useless that you can’t branch out as other degrees. 

What should I do? I can’t really talk to my parents. My mum of course supports whatever I do as long as I am healthy but I can see that my dad wants me back at work as soon as possible.  

Currently, there is another issue with the government because we will be contract workers. It might be an issue sooner or later that they no longer take medical graduates. 

Any advice?",09Nov2019,1

398,"The thing is, i am a high student, and along my student years i used to have a Youtube channel where i post stuff, funny &amp;, well edited and all... But after some time I stopped doing that cos of some toxic people i knew , but that's a different story,... 

But what happend from that channel is a guy came to me in search of an editor, basically one of my friend showed him my channel, and he was very impressed by my editing, turns out he was a aspiring local rapper so he came to meet me, it was 1-2 years back.. 

so i was a student, but i wasn't busy all the time.. but I definitely didn't want to indulge in this work, as I was scared that it would just be a huge waste if time, but, he was very optimistic about his career and wanted help, so i felt i should definitely help him if he pays at least anything.. (and it would be a great practice)

Now comes the part where we talk money, i clearly told him, that whatever he could afford is fine.. 
He said 500rs (about 7$), i was ohk with it, then, cos i didn't know how much work does it take to make a music video,

• I dealt with a lot of problems..
• 1st he shot the whole thing on mobile,( and all of them had variable frame rate, pain in the ass)
• 2nd very poor quality, + wanted each and every effect he ever saw..
• he even asked me to make 3 posters and 1 thumbnail
• he rejected the reviews 5 time before the final product... (2weeks)
 Although i don't have a problem with this cos, i asked for 1000 rs (14$)

The problem starts here.. he made do 3 other music videos (with the equal problems before) and even got his friends skit ""2"" done for 500 rs (7$)

He had a total of 4000 rs (56$) to pay, and i lowered it to 3000rs (42$) to afford it, cos he wasn't paying for months after the last project,..

The funny thing is that, it wasn't even like he can't afford, i used to go meet him occasionally, and every time he spoke about, how he ordered 
• a new mike
• soundcard
• a whole ass computer
• 2 pairs of monitor speakers..

And every time he said he bought this thing so he doesn't have money,..

• He even paid about 20,000 rs (280$) for a bigger production house to do his video, and told me that he had to do it so he get an idea of show biz, and become famous...

I never asked for money, cos i never wanted the conversation to go that way, but after 4 months of this happening I started asking him,..

I also wanted to upgrade my ram on my computer so i could use that , cos my actual laptop, which i used for editing started ti die, and i told him it would take me 1600 rs (22$) to get a ram..

He wanted to work with me more so, he offered to pay atleast 1500 rs, but only after another one month, coincidentally just 2 days before he hands me over a new project...

At first i was happy, but things went on and exams came (basically it's my last year as highschool student) and now i m scuffed, I m having immeasurable tenstion, i was already 2 week late to start the thing, and when i did turns out my new computer doesn't have good gpu, and  in short i m having frequent problem with my pc, i also have to study for exams, I don't go out anymore..

It's mentally hurting me 😭, what should i do...?
I want to tell him that i no long want to continue...

399,"My current job has made me the most depressed I've ever been. I am not a drinker but I got alcohol poisoning twice this year and abused other substances to a very dangerous point repeatedly. Every single time I was blacked out this year my only wish was to die. I am currently steering away from almost every substance because I don't want to be like this and my goal is to not let myself go through with it one bad night. 

Right now I can't sleep because I'm thinking about how my job has so little respect for me and my coworkers. I just replay the rude things my bosses say to me, despite me trying so hard to help them hit their goals. I used to have thick skin, but it's been worn down by the daily aggressiveness at this job. I don't think managers are allowed to act the way they do at my store. I should know, I've worked several. I only switched jobs because I'd move basically. I am too scared to reach out to HR, I feel like in this company they wouldn't be on my side as this particular company doesn't offer anything to regular employees and everything to the managers (raises, holiday pay, etc).

I thought I could stay at this job until I found a better paying job in my field of study, but I desperately need a change even if it's just a swap of entry level jobs. 

Without realizing it happening, I've been going off the deep end lately and it feels like I'm wasting my life very fast. I'm more anxious than ever. I am convinced I need medication to stay sane, maybe a real diagnosis. Maybe I was born with a mental illness that needs to be treated. I am probably not manic or bipolar but it would not surprise me if I were. I initially only attempted sobriety this year because I had one day I felt nothing but happiness and I thought maybe I could have more positive days like that. I feel like a delusional happiness, like a too happy to be real happy, happy without a cause, at 3 or 4 A.M. I can't stop thinking ever. I keep thinking until I feel like I'm crazy and like people will stop associating with me if they were to know anything about how I am and what I've been doing lately. I feel too low to crawl out of this hole I keep myself in. I try my very best not to blame anyone but myself for how I am and act, I don't know why I'm frozen in place. I assessed the situation, the solution is clear, but my motivation and self worth hold me in the same spot.

Anyways, I would prefer advice like: what companies are more or less good to work for, successful ways you unwind after tough days, maybe about how to improve the situation- that kind of stuff, if possible. I don't want to call anyone or seek therapy about it. I don't want to spend any more time focusing on how life sucks anymore. I just can't stop thinking about how this doesn't feel like a good representation of me, I hate thinking I'm weird because I am in this state of mind.",09Nov2019,1
400,"I'm 15 f. So we live with our grandparents and their old dog died two years ago, at 7. Half a year later wet
Bought a new dog. We thought of adopting a dachshund or a German shepherd, but my mom didn't one the latter as she thought it was too big. She wanted a Labrador. We ended up going to a shelter.  They didn't take me as I had to go to school but they said they wouldn't bring a day g home without me.

They ended up bringing a dog home. He was male, despite the fact that we always wanted a female on like the last time. He was as big as a german shepherd, despite the fact that my mom said she wanted a smaller one.  He was 1,5 year ild despite the facct that we wanted a puppy, so that He could be trained easier.

401," I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to post on but I don't know where else to post this. If there are any subreddits that provide more specific advice, I will gladly post there. I am typing this on my phone so forgive me for any formatting errors, and sorry if this is long. 

Some background - I am a 19M Indian living in Scotland with my parents, studying in college for a course my father, paid a lot of money for. I am unemployed and have been working on applying for jobs this past week. My mother and I are here as dependants on my father's work visa and have been here for a year. My relationship with my dad has always been strained as he was always controlling and over-protective of me. He is quite a Conservative Christian and he places religious morals over everything else. Recently, my dad got laid off one of his projects and we faced the possibility of moving back to India, so he gave in the notice for our apartment last month and we have until Thursday to move out. On Monday we found out he got another project in Bristol and that he would be moving there tomorrow. He told me to look for a house for my mother and I and said he would pay the deposit and rent, but that I'd have to get a job and help him pay after the first month. I agreed and I found a house that we could apply for. The next day, my dad suddenly told me that he didn't have money in his account to pay for two deposits and rents (as he would be moving to Bristol and would have to do the same for himself), that he only had 6k in his account and told me and my mother to pack and go to India. He waited until two days before he had to move out to say this and refused to talk to me in person or respond to my texts. I offered the idea of my mom moving with him or to India to live with her mom and I could find a flatmate and live on a cheaper rent. He was furious at this suggestion and he said I had the option of quitting college and coming to Bristol with him as he did not trust me or care to spend any further money on me to live alone in Scotland. He also said he will cut me off his visa and that I should get a work visa if I wanted to stay in Scotland by myself. He said it was either that or he would send me and my mother back to India.

I am not sure what I can do. A couple of my friends have told me they could help me pay the first month's deposit and rent but I have no idea how I can write this on the apartment's application as I don't have a job and my mother often falls sick and is unable to work.

TL;DR My controlling father is moving to another city and refuses to pay the deposit and rent for a new apartment for me and my mother.",09Nov2019,1
402,"My parents aren't bad people. I know they care and mean well. However, they do bad things because of how they grew up and because of general thoughtlessness. I have come to realize that they were pretty terrible parents to my older siblings. I can rationalize my parents' actions and see how they weren't trying to be hurtful, but that doesnt change their impact. One of my older siblings has serious issues because she was emotionally neglected (second child/first daughter). I think it's because of my older siblings that my parents improved by the time they got me. They dont understand how their actions make her feel. Growing up they'd insult our appearances, screw up birthday presents, etc. but were better with me and my younger siblings. Even now, my mom is more financially supportive of us younger kids. Even though they were terrible in some ways, I know my parents actually care about my sister. They want my sister to be happy and successful and want to have a good relationship with her. They're just really bad at being parents. Keep in mind that I'm only describing my parents' worst qualities right now when you give advice. In summary, they're well intentioned, but have some emotionally abusive habits. (I know how weird that sounds) My sister thinks they dont care about her, and she had legitimate reasons to feel that way.

405,"I’m an American that owns a nazi metal and I’m not sure if I should keep it or donate it to a muesum

Mods if you’re not ok with this at all feel free to delete it I’ll just find another sub

So basically I own a Nazi metal. It’s not like an SS metal based on my research it’s a 5th place metal for the 1939 sporting event run by the Nazis. It has the Swastika on one side and the Nazi eagle symbol on the other. 

My great uncle acquired the metal in WW2 when he was fighting in Berlin. The story I’ve heard is very vague but he grabbed the metal while in combat and he died in combat so his friend wanted us to have it. Come around 75 years later my grandpa is about to get sent to a nursing home by adult protective services so he drops off a shit ton of stuff from his storage unit at my grandmas house, where I just so happened to be staying and I got to keep some of his stuff. My grandma told me the story about the metal which was in its case and everything and showed me my great uncles obituary and said that he wanted our family to have it.

I had just put it in my closet and forgot about it until I recently found it and felt I should probably give it a museum but felt I should keep it because my great uncle would have wanted the family to have this souvenir. I’m quite far left on the political spectrum and don’t really want to be associated with something neo nazis would drool over.

So should I keep it or should I donate it to a museum and if so how would I go about donating it?",09Nov2019,1
406,"Alright very generic advice title I know. Basically I’m 21 male, and a college student. I consider myself pretty good at talking to girls and do alright for myself in that department. I’m kinda tall, take care of myself, and can hold a conversation pretty well.

This past semester I was forced to take a gen ed class that really wasn’t something I wanted to take. I walk into the first day of classes and one of the most most stunning girls I’ve ever seen walks in and sits right next to me. And I froze up, like this girl is seriously incredible, and I can barely even manage to talk to her without stuttering at first. Over the next few weeks we talk more in class. She’s incredibly funny and super down to earth. We will call her Abbie. Eventually she mentions a boyfriend, and so while I was going to ask her for her number... I decide against it. In fact, before I found out she had a boyfriend I asked for advice on here.

Fast forward a few weeks and we have our midterm. I usually walk around with headphones in, and the day of our midterm was no exception. I decided to leave for class about 40 minutes early, just to get in those last minute study sessions. I walk into the building, up to the third floor and into the bathroom, music blaring. I come out and Abbie is outside and says I’ve been calling your name since the first floor. Cool. So we start studying and she is just laughing the whole time, and I’m honestly doing the same thing. We get into class and the two girls who we sit next to started talking to us and somehow the conversation leads to them saying that they thought me and Abbie were dating. We both kinda look at each other and start laughing. 20 minutes before the midterm starts, Abbie begins to play sad music. Sad music is my forte, so of course I give her some sad songs I really like. I find out later through a friend she broke up with her boyfriend.

So my question is what’s the move here? It doesn’t help our professor cancels every other class. I think there really is a lot of chemistry here, but I don’t wanna make her sad if she just got out of a breakup. Should I straight up ask for her number? The semester is coming to a close and I don’t want this to be a situation where I never see her again after this class. Thanks for reading and all advice is welcome.",09Nov2019,1
407,"So I'm 19 years old, and have been disabled since I was born. It's called hEDS for anyone interested, short version of it is my joints are terrible, my skin is weak and I always have pain somewhere in my body. It's very tiring to move, and I couldn't finish school because of all that.

I tried to go to school every year again and again, till they told me to stop trying and that they didn't legally force me into school anymore.

Personally I feel that the reason it failed is because none of the schools bothered to keep my disability in mind, even schools for disabilities. Like one of the schools promised they would do a lot of things that would help me if I gave them some time. After the time limit passed they told me it's my fault they haven't started literally anything, saying I didn't come to school enough. I missed maybe a week cause I was sick, and this was multiple months we're talking about.

So now I'm here, without a high school graduation certificate, only finished elementary. I tried applying for a lot of jobs, mostly part time. All of them were fine with me at the start, saying it wouldn't be a problem to get a chair so I don't have to stand, but in the end they always tell me they don't want to take the risk.

Because I'm a legal adult now I need to pay my bills, and my mom told me to try and get the disabled benefits so they would give me less than the minimum wage every month. There's one here (the Netherlands) that's specifically for people that have a disability since that they were born or at least when they became 18, so I tried there. They rejected me, but the documents they gave us as a reason why looked like they were mixed up rather than mine.

Turns out they reject everybody the first time and that you need to file a complaint so that they look at it again, I didn't know that and my mom didn't give me enough support to handle all the legal stuff I never did before. (She's a procrastinator and every time I asked her to help me I got the answer tomorrow) A year later and we still aren't a step further. So we wanted to try again, see if we could get it this time.

Then I found this amazing job offer, a game consultant offer, the job sounds like it's handmade for me as the tasks are everything I love. There's no real requirements besides knowing English and loving games. Since it's in Greece I don't know the exact wage, since they would have to calculate it with taxes there. I think it should be around the minimum wage here, but the houses in Greece are way cheaper than here so I should earn enough to get a nice saving.

When I found it I couldn't get the job out of my head, I got so excited for it. They pay for the flight ticket, 2 weeks stay at a hotel, they cover most of the health insurance and they help with all the paperwork and finding a house. Basically all I need to do is take a step into the airplane and they will help me through the whole thing.

I told a lot of friends about this job, even my mother's friends. Also told my physiotherapists, since I go there every week to make sure I move enough. They all were just as excited and told me to take the step and apply, just try it and all.

So I applied, they called the next day to chat about the offer and ask why I applied. The conversation went well if I can say so, I was excited the whole time and they were excited that a girl gamer applied for a job they mostly received guys for.

I asked them if it would be possible to get a special chair, one with head support and wheels so I can move around in the chair if needed. They told me it wouldn't be a problem for most companies but that they will ask to see if it's possible.

They will call me back in a few months when they get more starting dates, since the current starting dates are full. Which is fine by me, cause that leaves me time to finish my stuff here.

Only then I will get the real interview and see if they hire me, so for now it's still unsure as this was really just an introduction call and them informing me about what to expect from the job.

I personally only see pros here, if they hire me I have a job. If it works out for me I get a year experience on an amazing job and can take that home to maybe find jobs easier, or even extend my contract there for another year.

If it doesn't work out because it's too much for me, I can at least say that I tried, and then go back to the disability benefits proving that I do really want a job but that I can't, since they always think everyone there is lazy and doesn't want to lift a single finger to get money.

My mom however only sees cons, she did think the call went well, as we live together and she heard everything I said. Her cons are that even living on my own will be hard, let alone work while doing household tasks. I feel like if I live alone in a small house it will be less work than here with my mom and three cats. I've been cooking the whole week now because we were trying something and my mom underwent a surgery that means she isn't allowed to do a lot for a week.

It went fine for me, yes it's tiring, and I take 2 hours for a so called 20 minute recipe because it's a lot harder for me, but I had fun doing it. If I have a job I would probably make easier recipes that I know instead of new recipes I never heard of before.

For cleaning, small house, one person and no cats. With a job which is 40 hours a week, I don't expect the house to pile up dirt and all the other stuff. One person is less dishes and less laundry, and we've already worked out an easier way to do those things. (Cook for two days and do the dishes on the second day for example.)

Yes it will be a hard job, and yes I will be tired, but I really want to try it, I've never had a job before, only some volunteer experience.

But  every day my mom complains about it, saying it will ruin my chances at a benefit, threatening me other ways and saying I wouldn't be able to do a single thing there. I really want to get away from her because it's always the same thing with her.

But she says that every day, and I'm not allowed to be excited about the job because she will shut me down. It makes me sick, and now I don't know if I want to try it anymore, like I regret applying because of all this and I just want a timeskip so that it's over.

The job is answering tickets and calls from people in game that need help for whatever reason, they train you for that and provide you with a software to change account information and all the other things people might want to change.

It really doesn't seem like a heavy job for me, even if it's 40 hours. If they give me the chair like I have at home, then I can sit the whole time with maybe a few problems that can be fixed in a break hopefully.  I feel like it would be one amazing experience, living outside the country and having a job that's exactly what I've been doing for free to my friends and family.

What's the difference between this job and the previous ones I applied for? The ones I previously applied for were little places that were part time and not a desk job, and they said they were fine with a simple chair so I can sit in the standing jobs, but they didn't really care.

This job is a full time desk job, big world famous company (The company from clash and clans) and instead of saying yes when I said is a special chair a problem, they asked me what I need on the chair and made notes of that. That really surprised me since I never had a job ask what I need for a chair, all of them offered simple bar stools. Like I stuttered with saying what my chair needs since no one ever asked me before.

All that said, I might not even get hired there, but I found a lot of jobs through the same website that are almost the same but not for games.

Should I still go for the job? Or is it a stupid impossible dream from someone with a disability that wishes to have a normal life and I should get my application back?

I really don't know anymore, I probably see it through some rose colored glasses, but I feel like my mom is having them in the color black. But well she also spit out the words that I would never be coming back to the Netherlands again.

Thanks for reading this long long story lol.

TLDR;

I really want to try a job in Greece, but my mom says my disability means I can't do that job at all and should instead go for the disability benefit. Should I listen to my mom or not?",09Nov2019,1

411,"I need some outside perspective or maybe just to confess it to anyone.. I am 32 years old and have a home with my young daughter and common law husband.

But for some cruel reason I've been dreaming of another person, different dreams and scenarios- not always sexual, and I'm always deeply in love with this person in my dreams (and I feel like emotions are amplified in dreams.. they must be)

My mind creates this connection with person and I have no idea why, I feel crazy. It's someone I barely knew in highschool, a lifetime ago, and I've barely seen him since. I've always felt a connection with him but nothing out of the ordinary.
The last conversation I had with this person (about 5 years ago).. and I was turning him down for a date.

I had an active dating life through my teens and twenties, I've met and connected with many people. It's not that I feel a sense of missing out.

When I think I've finally broke out of this dreaming pattern, he'll creep back in. They're not bad dreams, they're really nice dreams.. but I feel like the emotional feelings are tricking my actual feelings. There are periods when I think about this person constantly in my waking life (when the dreams become intense) *deep breath* I feel like I could love this person. WTF.

I realize the Insanity attached to this.. I don't even know this person. This poor person, why have I fixated on him? How do I stop? I would feel so violated if someone I barely knew were thinking of me on this level. 

My poor real life partner, I can't even tell him of these thoughts or feelings, because they're crazy and hurtful.

I'm not even sure what helpful advice to expect.. but I'm desperate to confess with no one to confess to, and I would love to put these dreams and feelings in the past.",09Nov2019,1

413,"This is gonna sound really silly and stupid but I’m going post anyway because writing things down helps me and I could do with some advice.

 I’m an 18 year old girl from England studying at College and I’ve had a major crush on this teacher for 2 years ever since I started my first year, he’s 25 and really cute looking and he’s such a nice and caring guy, we’ll call him ‘A’.  A has been my main course tutor since September, before then I never had him as a proper teacher, I would just see him around a lot.

I developed a crush on him within the first few weeks of college 2 years ago. I had A for a couple of lessons as he needed to cover for my actual teacher who had an injury. At first I didn’t really think much of him until one of the lessons I suffered a panic attack and he was really nice and looked after me and after that day it’s like I just fell madly in love with him and I don’t know why.

After my proper teacher came back, I didn’t have A teaching me anymore but I still saw him around everyday and we would speak every now and then and my feelings never went away they just got stronger.

In September I found out that A is going to be my main tutor for this whole year which means that he is in charge of my college course and I get to have lessons with him everyday. I’ve been really happy and enjoying having him as a teacher until yesterday he made the announcement that he’s leaving after Christmas and is going into a different profession😢💔 

I know I seem like a right weirdo crying over a teacher but I really like him and I love seeing him and talking to him. When he goes, I’ll never see him again😞

I literally can’t stop thinking about it, My chest hurts and I feel really nauseous too.

I know a relationship is out of the question as he’s my tutor and it’s inappropriate, but I wish there was away I could still speak to him somehow even just to be friends. I’m gonna feel lost without him.

I’ve been trying to keep my mind off him but I keep replaying the moment he said he was leaving in my head and it’s driving me mad to be honest😞💔.",09Nov2019,1

416,"Before I start I’m on mobile so sorry. To start I used to go to a program for people with mental illnesses. My second year there I met my first crush K. K is a girl and even though she is bisexual she isn’t interested in me in the slightest. She started at the beginning of my second year and we became good friends. I still have some feelings for her but they’ve mostly faded since it’s been awhile. Then comes C. It’s around the end of the second year. Instantly I’m a lil attracted to C. Course I keep it to myself it’s not like I have feelings or anything... we become friends and I catch fucking feelings. So I tell K about this and she’s happy and all for me. Time passes and here I am now. Two nights ago K texted me at like 12:30 am saying that she also had feelings for C. This caught me off guard even though we’ve always had similar taste in guys it’s been like just being attracted to them. Being K she is really shy and comes from a different culture than mine. I know it’s hard for her to ask people out or be openly flirty. In her culture that’s a big no no. She also is just again a very shy. I am naturally a very touchy person and also when around crushes I start getting a  tad flirty without even realizing it. Now that y’all know all of this here is the problem, what the fuck am I supposed to do? I really like C and he’s like actually my dream guy. He’s sweet, funny, smart even if he don’t know it, attractive, kind hearted, and just like the rest of my check list. (He even uses reddit so imma cry if he finds this.) C also looks like an awkward past crush of mine, but it’s not cause he looks like my old crush that I have feelings, more so I have a type. I also don’t know if C has even any feelings for me or K. But I really want to ask C out, but can I? Is it fair? What happens if we do end up dating? What if C rejects me and our friendship ends? I really need advice on this situation on what I should do next! I don’t want to hurt K, but I also really want to shoot my shot. Also don’t want to ruin my friendship with either C or K.",09Nov2019,1

425,"Recently started training for a new chain restaurant opening, as its one of the first we have all had to receive a training program for 6 hours a day for two weeks.


Everyone was partly chosen on personality so everyone in my training group is really friendly and fun. However, there is one girl who is a bit different (which I'm all for and I take people on personality only) and has an anime bag and a pokemon lunch kit and has mentioned fortnite a few times not tryna judge but just explain and paint a picture.


For the first couple of days I tried to be friendly and inclusive of her, as did the others I have lunch with and we invited her to come with us for lunch and I talked to her. However, after that she just stopped joining us and went and sat by herself outside the mall and looked a bit unhappy (?), I felt bad but it's not like we actively excluded her and she could have left and joined us as we all just walked off together. 


I try speaking to her but she just wants to talk as bout herself with stories that are tedious and don't get to the point quickly or don't have a point. I try to sympathise and be patient and listen but it can be a struggle.


However, she has gotten increasingly worse the last couple of days and wants to be front and centre when our supervisor quizzes us and talks over people who try to answer (she already has the job, why does she need to impress so much?) and refers back to her old job to which the supervisors told us not to do as this company is very different. 


She also doesn't listen to people, a couple of times we were assigned tasks to do as a group and when I asked her to prepare more food to be fried so I could fry it and get it done quicker she just walked away and did a task that interested her. She also loves to criticise people on how they are doing things and always holds it over people that she knows how to do everything.


We have been having a bit of fun in the workplace and roasting eachother as an ongoing joke which has helped us get closer and enjoy each other's company. One of the guys knocked over a bottle of sauce and picked up a bag of vegies on the opposite side and both went everywhere so we all were teasing him about him getting fired and not doing things right (he enjoys it and laughs and reciprocates when I make mistakes with a sly grin).


However, this was ruined when we were on break and teasing him (he was laughing) and the girl decided to white knight and call us out on our behaviour and tell us that bullying isn't right or fair at all and we should all be more mature and ashamed  and she might tell the manager etc etc...it felt so awkward and everyone raised their eyebrows ateach other and left real quick. Hasn't she heard of banter and sarcasm? It didn't stop us for long though. I feel like she might have high functioning autism or something.


It also affects our work environment in other ways, one guy's whole demeanor changes when she goes near him and he stops being relaxed and laid back and another girl, who is a so sweet and cute and lacks a lot of confidence which has started to improve through reassurance and praise by us, is nearly back to square one after being assigned on a task with this girl.


Everyone has started to feel the same and it was finally brought up on our lunch break yesterday. We are all over it and don't know what to do. I've tried to be patient and understanding but it can only go so far.


I don't know whether I should tell our supervisor/manager as I don't know if she realises and lets the girl get away with everything, including answering every question?",09Nov2019,1

427,"How do I handle work when my toxic best friend is my boss?

So, I’m in a difficult situation and would really like some advice.

A few years ago, my best friend offered me a job working in her team. She is a manager, high up in her company. She has no direct boss, and has shares in the company so her position is very safe and protected. Jobs in my field are very hard to get so I jumped at the chance.

The last two years have genuinely been the most miserable of my life. 

I’ve discovered that most of what she told me, both about the job and our friendship, were lies. She actively tries to make me look bad at work, isolates me, is jealous whenever I get an opportunity. She doesn’t support me and I think she talks behind my back to colleagues.

My father died last year and she was awful to me when I was off, and on the day I came back she barely looked at me. 

In our friendship, she treats me like a servant - she only contacts me when she wants to complain about someone else and the things she says about people are so awful. She expects me to feed her pets when she’s on holiday. One time she got me to go to a medical appointment with her only to leave me to make my own way home when her boyfriend turned up.

I’m truly, honestly done with her but my problem is the work situation. If it’s wasn’t for that I’d 100% ghost her but I can’t. We work in an open plan office so I see her the whole day. There are literally NO jobs anywhere else so I can’t leave right now. Any advice on how to cope with the working day and set boundaries?",09Nov2019,1

Need some light on the situation, for anyone who has the time.

Tl;dr - mother becomes unbearable to live with because of self-entitled, ‘you’re here for me’ mentality. Can’t focus on my own stuff because it becomes about how I’m not helping her. Am I being unreasonable in wanting to leave?

For a bit of background: my mum has always maintained that a mother is the queen of the household, and that everyone should listen to her no matter what. It was half-legit, since her decision-making skills were top-notch, and she is a powerful woman who can make the house sparkling in one sweep before anyone is even up. But she absolutely refuses to accept that anyone can have anything negative to say about her, and has shamed me for having negative thoughts of any kind, because she is my mother, I need to cherish her in any situation, and she would never think poorly of her own mother so my counterarguments are shameful.

That, combined with always believing that everyone is to blame for any situation, can be really overwhelming. I have never heard her say “sorry” to either me, my sis, my dad, or my later stepdad.  When something doesn’t go her way or according to her (often unvoiced) expectations, then it’s the end of the world, and she will find someone to humiliate and blame. I’ve always felt sorry for her husbands, cos I could hide away in my room for days, but they can’t. I was also the goody-two-shoes child, so I never once stood up against her, but was expected to answer her in a “yes, mother” manner. My sis moved out abroad as soon as she could, I did the same when I was 18, and we both live far away.

In the last few years, she was happy with her husband (who was sick), because she was free to shout and get mad for whatever reason and he loved her so much (and appreciated her for looking after him so loyally for years) that he would just apologise, make peace, and then give her gifts. He was in love with her until the end. He passed away last year. When I came to visit to help, or even the final few years actually, she was more understanding of my own life problems and didn’t seem as angry or self-entitled as before. I thought maybe she started growing out of that. She became more easygoing, easily brushed off things that would otherwise make her livid, and I didn’t have to walk on eggshells as much. It was bliss.

After her husband’s passing, I decided to come live with her to help. She was alone and needed support. She kept guilting me into coming back for her for years, so I finally ended up leaving my job abroad and giving up an amazing apartment I loved to be with her. My bf decided to join, so we both came.

It turns out that she’s back to her old ways, but even more intense, as now there is no husband to vent at and it’s all focused on me. She gets mad if I leave the house - she sees it as “partying” selfishly and leaving her alone. So i get anxious going out and decide to stay. She gets mad if we stay in the house - she feels suffocated with our presence. These contradictions happen numerous times a day. I wanted to change careers, and am currently unemployed to study online (learn as much as I can for free instead of wasting funds on courses for the time being), but my mum sees that as lazing around doing f all on my computer. It’s an IT-related career. Yah. There are no courses around here that would fit my career path, so me and bf want to go abroad again, for his work too. Cue exclamations of abandoning her and leaving her alone. All the while saying we haven’t helped out a lot and used her house as a hotel (she would have been alone in the big house anyway, i don’t see how this is relevant), and we are messy and make more work for her. We’re fairly tidy people, but sure, we don’t prioritise waking up at 5am to clean and scrub every door knob every day. We feel there are better things we can be using this time on, but are always super available to help out with anything, and tell her this multiple times a day. She hates asking people for help, so we try to guess what she might want to be done, but her expectations are outside of our realm of understanding (cleaning specific handles of drawers in the kitchen after cooking X because there is more chance of grease piling up). I feel that without communicating these desires, like we’ve asked her thousands of times, we can’t “help” her to the level she needs, because maybe we just need guidance on what we can do. She doesn’t remember our asking itself, but just has memories of her doing something around the house and us not. Rinse and repeat. Every day. It drives me up the wall. She’s stuck in this cycle of not being able to communicate anything she needs, doing it herself, and getting mad we hadn’t thought to do it at that exact moment and shames us for being incapable. I have almost completely stopped functioning and doing my own stuff as this is taking up so much mental space. I just wake up anxious, and start panicking everything i haven’t yet accomplished and other things I don’t even know I need to do.

My relationship with my bf is strained because of it, as I start taking things out on him, with him trying to keep himself small in his spare room (which is unlike him) and not get involved and actively help. Which, of course, is 100% understandable and I am actually (when I’m not being moody) SUPER glad he’s doing that to keep his sanity. And that he is still there for me. I’m forever grateful. But I am in no place to be there for him, so we bought tickets to leave as soon as possible.

I’m not sure if I’m being an asshole, for thinking these thoughts. She tries in her own way, maybe I’m not appreciative enough. She is for sure going through her own stuff, and I have a bf I can talk to whereas she feels like she has no one. Maybe she feels even more alone since she has a couple in the house. But talking to her for longer than 10 minutes gets unbearable. She is now upset that I don’t invite her to go out somewhere (i don’t think I can handle it, but she also never suggested it from herself, and the times i did ask, she refused for reasons like not feeling it or it being rainy or that she needs to work on the garden etc.) as I’m expected to do since I came here for her. Every time I try to focus on my stuff, she gets upset and lectures me on how I can put my silly hobbies aside and try to make myself useful by helping her advance in life. So I do that, but she isn’t satisfied with what I do, or criticises how I’m not more active or enthusiastic in coming up with new ideas for her (I do, but she deflects them, saying “that’s ridiculous, you know I live alone, have no one to help, have no friends excuse excuse” etc etc etc. 

I want her to get better, but at this point I have zero clue, and since my efforts to help aren’t appreciated, I can’t gather the willingness to actively help her with anything. She will find a million things to criticise there as well.

I feel super guilty that in my last few days before we leave, instead of taking her out and spending time with her and helping her around the house like a good daughter, I just hide away in my room. I don’t know how to not let it affect me. This is ridiculous.

440,"I’m currently 15 right now, and every now and then this memory keeps coming back to me. I can’t tell what I want from it or how to get rid of it. It has to do with one of my cousins. I remember that it occurred before I moved away so at the time I had to be at most in 2nd grade. My cousin (let’s call him Bruce) was in his teens when it happened, and his family was over for a visit. I was playing around with his little brother like kids do and Bruce walks in and suddenly picks me up onto his shoulder and pulls me into the closet. The closet was a walk in closet that had room to move in a straight line so as he placed me back down in the dark room, he starts kissing me. It was weird and cold and wet.
Now I don’t know why I did this, but I returned his kiss, thinking that if I just gave him what he wanted then he’d leave me alone. The closet door opened again and I saw his little brother walking in, oblivious to what was happening. Immediately I jumped out from under him and ran out of the closet, not even able to process what had happened. I tried acting as if nothing happened but Bruce was able to pull me back into the closet two more times, kissing me in the same fashion before giving up when his brother kept following in after us.

I didn’t understand it back then but now that I have a understanding of what sexual harassment is, this memory has been coming back to me. I hate it and I just want it out of my system. every time I hear his name it’s like a trigger word and I start internally freaking out.",09Nov2019,1

I find it really hard to engage with other people irl and on social media, but I’m willingly to step out of my comfort zone to seek out for these people. Do you guys have any tips or experiences in how to make foreign friends and start a convo eg.?

443,"For a bit of context, I (20F) immigrated to this country by myself 3 years ago, met my boyfriend (22M) a year and a half ago. We've been living together for about a year now, and it seems like our relationship may be coming to an end. Besides my heart being broken, now I must rearrange my life, and i feel like I have no strength for it.

In the beggining of our relationship my landlord kicked me out out of nowhere in the middle of the school year (I'm in college) and my boyfriend offered me to stay with him until I found a new place, but eventually we realised we were happier together, we created a small home, and it was way easier to split the bill of one room between the 2 of us.

This summer, before this school year started, I suggested I could move out to avoid this current situation. I explained to him that if for any reason one day we break up, for me it would be much more of a deal than it would be for him, since i have no friends or family in this country, and such a sudden change in the middle of my school year would be devastating for me. I insisted on it several times, and he would always reject the idea, saying it will only distance us and with such full schedules we have we would end up without seeing eachother. He practically begged me not to, and I ended up trusting this was my home now and that wouldn't happen. 

Yesterday, in the middle of an argument, he told me he thinks i should look for another place. And I don't know what to do now. He told me I can stay as much as I need, but I feel I wanna get out of here now, I don't wanna be here if he doesn't want me here. I don't want to sleep in his bed if he's thinking it'll be better without me. 
I have nowhere to go, I have one only friend that is currently very far away. The only place i can think of is the couch of a coworker i'm not even that close to.
Also, I have a lot of homework and projects for school I barely have time for, I can't afford loosing time, and with all this happening I don't think I'm gonna be able to finish anything.

Now I have to stay in a place i'm not wanted, sleeping next to my love that doesn't love me anymore, working the double to be able to save up a bunch money as fast as possible, go visit apartments, move out and continue paying the very expensive school just to fail all my classes since I have no time to study nor work on my projects.

Besides that, I'm emotionally devastated and I really feel I can't do this right now, although I have went through worse, I feel this is too heavy for me right now. He is the most important part in my life and I'm loosing him, I have no one else. And it must sound needy, but it kind of feels none of this is worth it without him. 

Everything is falling apart and I don't know what to do, or who to talk to. I don't know how to fix this nor get ut of it. 
If anyone here has went through a similiar situation, how did you deal with it? 

Thank you for reading me.",09Nov2019,1
444,"This is something I desperately want to improve upon myself, more so than anything like getting in shape or even studying more for my A-Levels cause I feel if I get this right, everything else will fall into place

As the title explains, I am very socially awkward. I am definitely a naturally shy person my nature and personality but I feel as if something branched from that in a bad way and has led me to trying to fix me. 

Apparently when I was a young kid, I was a very chatty and loud person but I think it all changed when I moved countries. I moved from Ireland to England and kids bullied me relentlessly in primary school for my accent so I never talked in hopes that people would forget. At secondary school, I guess my personality changed so much that being socially awkward and quiet was in my nature. 

I am in a good place now I suppose. I have a good set of friends and I enjoy being with them and I can actually talk to them in a clear voice. But with other people, thats a whole new story. In school, I struggle to communicate with people and this is mainly because I really don’t know how to approach them. I see other do it and they make it look so easy but I just fuck it up each time and make others uncomfortable. It’s exhausting.

I crave social interaction with others but even so, if someone were to come up to me, I will quietly panic and slur my words sometimes and talk quietly. In my head, I feel like I know what I am going to say but in execution, it falls apart. I fail so much to hold a conversation. I even know there are people in my school that like me that are outside my social circle but I just can’t go up to them to talk cause I just know I will fuck up somehow. 

Even with my regular set of friends, going out to hang out with them outside of school scares me as I feel as if I am creating too big of a commitment or maybe it’s because I will feel as if I will embarrass them. I am pretty sure every one in my school year has gone to a house party but not me and its not as if I am not invited or interested, I just feel as if I am too awkward to go. 

One of my best friends who we will call Drew; I am amazed by the way he is able to talk to people so easily. He just goes up to someone and does it. I don’t know how. One thing that does make me sad and feel like I am the odd one out is when we are walking and someone leaves in the group and they say “Bye Drew!” but not me. Like, I get it, I never said anything of value to you but I just feel so socially empty. 

I have tried everything. Watching Youtube videos on the issue but when they give their explanations on how to beat Social Awkwardness, I just feel as if their situation was different than mine or as if what they are saying feels empty? I dunno

Please, what can I do?!

446,So my wife and I are expecting our first child in 2 weeks. And we've made it a priority to save up money to buy a house by April or the end of May at the absolute latest. Our lease ends at the end of May. But we have enough money in our savings to put about 5% down on a 300k house. Which buys us a very nice house in the area we live in. But we're hoping to get a loan that doesn't require closing costs or purchase a house the the seller will pay a large chunk of closing costs cause I'm sure in 6-7 more months we will have another good chunk of money in our savings. But we would like to try to keep that for an emergency fund.  But we got a pretty good idea of the area we want to live in. And know what we can afford based on our lifestyle and income. We haven't talked to a realtor yet. Or got pre approval for a loan yet. Our combined income is 120k and our credit scores are over 700 so I don't think we will have any issues getting approved. But we don't know when it is the best time to start that process. So any tips would be very helpful.,09Nov2019,1

454,"I'm 4 months into my first job. This problem I'm having really bothers me because it makes me seem like I don't pay attention to what's being said. When my colleagues and I are discussing something work related, especially when it's about timetables, I can't seem to understand what was the final version that was agreed on. 

For example when we're discussing which week would be the best to start our new production line everyone shares their opinion, pros and cons of each option are weighted etc I never seem to grasp what the final conclusion was. I always find group conversations too chaotic and it's often unclear to me what others mean by what they say, how it's relevant, what it means... ugh it's so hard to express myself in a foreign language. 

I just... don't know what to do about this. I also have a problem with forgetting things just seconds after being told. It's like my brain switches to DANGER MODE: INFORMATION INCOMING and I forget everything immediately. People at work are often bewildren why I find it so hard.

458,"I went to university at the normal time but I flunked out due to a bad bout of depression that I didnt get treated for. I spent the next couple years working odd jobs until I got a contracting job which led me to be hired on full time as a data entry guy for a large bank. It has benefits and good pay that's allowed me to move out and support me and my gf living on our own.


However the bank is downsizing and by the end of next year I will be out of a job. I applied to a local university but was denied entry due to my horrendous GPA. The way I saw it I had to options. I could try to go to community college, raise my GPA, and then apply again to finish my degree at a university. Or I could jump straight into a trade.

My degree was for computer science which will give you insight into the type of person I am. Def not blue collar. But looking into electricians I saw that as something I could be into. And the local electricians union is literally only 3 min from my apartment. I always scored very high in physics and math classes and industrial electricians make BANK

You can join and get started with pay right away and the pay isnt that much less than what I am making now. If I went back to college itd be at least 3 years before I got a degree.

459,"I broke up with my boyfriend of 3 and a half years about 6-7 months ago, it took a lot for me to finally end it, he was my first and only and I knew a while in that I didn't love him the same as he loved me and that I didn't want to be with him forever (well I didn't really know at the time but now looking back I can see what those feelings were). There were reasons I stayed with him, he's a super sweet great guy with an awesome family that accepted me like one of their own (which I was desperate for since my family is completely broken) we got together when we were 16, I never introduced him to my family because at the time I was very resentful of them and just wanted another life to escape to. I told him my reasons why I didn't want to introduce him and he never really questioned it. 

I knew I wanted to end it a year before I actually did, I did love him, but I wasn't happy but I didn't know why. Now I know it's because I was using him to run from my problems. I wanted to grow up and move past who I was as a teenager because I wanted to face my family issues but for so long I was afraid to be alone. I used the fact that I was moving away for school as a reason to break up with him, however I ended up breaking up with him even before I got accepted because I couldn't wait. When I broke up with him I said things like ""I don't want to stop talking"" ""I don't want anybody else (trying to reassure him that I wasn't leaving him because I had another interest i guess)"" ""I just need time to focus on myself because I have so many problems that I need to fix and I don't want to hurt you in the process"". 

We tried to stay friends throughout the summer, he seemed really down and not himself which I understood. He would come to our friend group hangouts but would be completely silent and go off on his own and 'pout' somewhere. I felt horrible, I tried so hard to continue to be his friend because I didn't want him to feel abandoned and alone. 

At the end of the summer (this was after I graduated college) I went off to University (where I am now). However I decided to drop out after this semester and move back home. I know that he hasn't bending well he texts me every once in a while and asks me how I'm doing, I talk to him but when I ask him he says things like  ""not good but whatever""  ""poorly but its fine"" then ill ask what's wrong and he'll answer ""me"" or something very depressing. I try to comfort him but it got to the point where I just try not to talk to him anymore, because in my mind I feel like he needs to move on from me. I look back at the things I said when I broke up with him. I don't feel those things are true anymore. 

What I need advice on is this: Do I start a conversation with him and tell him he needs to move on and that the things I said before are not how I feel anymore or do I just not bother and just continue to distance myself (I already told him I don't think it's healthy for us to talk a lot because if he's really feeling alone and depressed talking to his ex girlfriends won't help- this might have been a little harsh but I was really frustrated with his texts to me)

461,"I am tired as I am writing this, so sorry in advanced if it is disorganized, but I have been having this internal struggle with past trauma. I was molested once when I was younger, which I spent most of my adolescent not remembering it. Now that I am 24, and have remembered it, It is something that cant leave me. I have never had friends, and have never done well socially. I think this is a combination of being traumatized and being on the spectrum.

I am seeking therapy, but I cannot tell the therapist about it. even though my entire mental problems (anxiety, poor socializing, paranoia, mistrust) can be easily explained by this event. The reason I cannot tell the therapist is because I share this trauma with my brother, and he I guess handles things different internally. The person who molested us is in the family, and he has mentioned to me personally that he honestly forgives the person for doing it. I mean logically he interprets the perpetrators upbringing and unfortunate life, as the cause of this problem. This person offers so much emotional support to us, while other family members do not. It is as if he regrets and is seeking to make up for it. My brother fears that telling someone, might cause him to commit suicide.

This is why I cannot tell my therapist about it, but I know that a large chunk of my problems can be explained by it, and proper treatment i suppose can be used. I want to understand this world better, and myself, but it feels like I have to lie to the therapist and make up constant excuses for my behavior, which conflicts with the therapist. Put it this way, it is easy for someone to think I am acting a certain way because I might be lazy, when in actual reality I am acting a way because I am avoidant  stemming from the event. 

Can someone help me understand why I don't really remember it, but my brother seems to remember it entirely. For example, I remember being chased and scared, but he remembers being chased and scared because he was masturbating. I remember not being able to leave my room, my brother remember not being able to leave because he was masturbating. I may be wrong, but is this dissociation. Also if it is that, could it be the reason I have felt through my adolescent that I wasn't mindful or had terrible memory.

Also sometimes i feel like It was more so done to my brother and i was just a witness. I do remember him being dragged out from under the bed, because we were trying to hide from him. Why is it that i mainly witnessed this and still suffered. I remembered him making us shower afterwards why he watched. My brother added to that saying he was telling us something inappropriate. He put on a sexually themed movie also, as if to lead up to it. I don't know maybe he just had it on i don't know.

Another thing I don't understand is for some reason I am have recollection of waking up naked laid over the bed with my pants down. Like maybe someone was playing with me. I was also hyper-sexualised as a kid, i was masturbating really young, could being touched cause something like that? My brother has a memory of someone ELSE in the family moaning and do something to him. He would of been two. I remember having dreams of this person rolling over me and do something I don't know. But this person has a distinct look i remember the hair and the shirt pants. there is a photo at Christmas time in the same clothes when i was two, I had this dream when i was maybe 12, and have seen this photo at 24. Could this be coincidental or is it likely these are recovering repressed memories.

There is so much more, I am very disorganized so i leave it with this. I have tried saying these things on here before, but no responds so i hope that this one gets a response. I just mainly want to understand how i can understand all this, I cant seek emotional support from others, my immediate family ain't good at giving it. I lack social skills to get friends for emotional support. I lack friends because of poor social/emotional skills. It just feels like i cant learn to make friends because i cant emotional get friends to learn how to speak and function to utilize that in jobs or such. and on top of that i have a past event involving people in my life who are still very much there.",09Nov2019,1

Due to my mental health state my boyfriend and the people around me even myself have noticed that I don’t have hobbies or a passion or even anything to focus or set my mind on for when I graduate in June and this really scares and worries me. I have always been dependent on my boyfriend for happiness and it wasn’t until recently when we took a break because the pressure was too much for him I finally came to the realisation of how toxic and destructive it really is to place your happiness in the hands of another. 

I want to find something worth living for that isn’t just a person/people, I want to find a purpose to my life and I really want to find something I want to do for the rest of my life that makes me happy, I’m currently trying to figure out which hobbies to take up and see how I feel when I do take them up but in the long run I really want an aim and purpose for myself because I feel like I don’t have one as I’m unsure of what it is I want to do because due to my depression I feel like I don’t even enjoy anything and always lock myself in my room. 

I also don’t have any friends so it doesn’t help that even if I want to do things I don’t have anyone to go to regarding that, which really affects me and I’m struggling to make friends which makes me really sad. My boyfriend is extremely supportive of me but I just want to be able to support him back and stop pressuring him and let him live his life and work on his masters and build himself without being an obstacle. I want to focus on myself but it’s just so damn hard and I’m struggling so much I just feel lost as a person.

475,"I'm turning 19 in a few months. I don't have a car, I don't have a degree (dropped out of 3 different schools already) and I'm fucking up this school year as well. I have no money, no part time job, no nothing.

I'm a completely worthless member of society and all my peers are doing better than me.

Depression hit me so hard after my girlfriend cheated on me that I had to drop 3 of the 5 classes I'm taking this year after having already quit 3 different schools.

I'm saving money for a drivers license only because the guys my ex dated after me both had cars and not having one is making me feel inferior. 

I recently started following this girl I used to know on Insta and she's already got her own place even though we're the same age.

Most friends I have or used to have finished school or are busy getting a high level degree in college.

I hate how little I've accomplished, and every time I talk to people about it they tell me that it's okay because I've had a rough childhood, or that as long as I'm doing my best despite my depression it's fine.

But I absolutely hate using my past or my mental illnesses as an excuse.

How can I possibly get my life together? I'm turning 20 in a year and I won't even be close to having a degree at that point. I might have a car if I actually save money, but I won't have enough to move out. I'll probably still be single, too. 

In a year I'll be an adult. I won't be a teenager anymore, but I'll be an actual adult. A total failure. A complete screw-up.",09Nov2019,1
476,"My old ceo messaged me asking if I was ready to go back to the company. I said it would depend on the offer but now I'm worried I didn't seem interested enough because he hasn't replied.

I've missed my old job since I left (3months ago) and have been debating asking for it back but there are a few things I still want to change, which is why I haven't yet. My plan was always to work here for a year and then go back for a more senior role. 

I was entry level (granted doing the work of someone 2 levels above) and the company had about 300 people, so I don't get why he's even interested in me going back and I'm quite interested to know. He also 'endorsed' me for leadership on LinkedIn when  he messaged me.

477,"As some background, my mom caught wind of my EX's sister being locking in a closet and decided to call CPS on her house. This was the final straw for her dad and he kicked her out of the house. My mom felt guilty because she thought that it was her fault that she got kicked out and invited her to stay at our house for a bit.

While I was completely against this (I finally cut ties with her), I kept my mouth shut because I understood her situation and the original plan was for her to stay a week or two and then my mom's friend could take her in. Its now been a month and my mom's friend didn't want to take her in anymore because she was worried about CPS complications (I think).

Well while my EX does work, she has not payed for anything during her stay yet she is always buying new things (ex. Snacks or clothes). That puts a lot of stress on our budget and we have almost entirely stopped eating out as a family because of her. 

A week or two ago when I asked my parents when she was leaving, they said on her birthday, which is in a few days. I was exited as I was finally going to be getting my privacy back. Unfortunately when I asked again yesterday to explain more concerns with this situation, they explained that she hadn't been saving very well and wasn't planning to leave until the middle of January.

That was the most infuriating thing to hear as it is completely her fault that she hadn't been properly saving while she didn't even need to pay rent. She has overstayed her visit, taken advantage of my parents hospitality, and I just want her gone now. My parents agree to an extent, but they don't want to just throw her on the street so they ultimately have no say without an alternative. I need ideas to get her out of my house for good. A few of my ideas included making a gofundme to get her out of the house, but that's all I can think of and its not a very good plan.",09Nov2019,1

I told her how much it hurts me to steal my nannas present and she thinks it's not a big deal and never really apologized. 

Now she's coming again for Christmas and I'm expected to buy her a present, and I really don't want to. But I will.

482,"This is a 15-year long story jammed into a few paragraphs, and I need advice from all kinds of people.

I’m gay, and one of my oldest friends, who we’ll call Ahmed, is a religious Muslim man who, everyone believes, is also gay. Ahmed has never come out to anyone and I don’t think he ever will because of religious reasons. He prays 5 times per day, eats halal only, donates regularly, and fasts every Ramadan. Basically, the whole deal—a good Muslim.

He and I have never talked about homosexuality, though. I’m currently in a happy relationship, and my boyfriend thinks that Ahmed is in love with me. 

Ahmed and I met about 15 years ago through mutual friends and almost instantly started hanging out. We would go to each other’s houses and watch movies. I don’t know how much time went by before it started happening but eventually, we started cuddling. He would always be the big spoon and would occasionally even hump me. If he heard footsteps, he would jump off and sit away from me. We never did anything more than that, and I never initiated it because I thought he would be insulted as a Muslim. He would massage my shoulders even though I didn’t ask him to and a couple of times even caressed my chest.

Whenever I would get a boyfriend, Ahmed and I would kind of stop being friends. But it’s been different during this current relationship of mine. I put time and effort into our friendship and insisted on having Ahmed hang out with my boyfriend and me. A couple of years into my relationship, Ahmed started being rude to my boyfriend. I didn’t really notice it until my boyfriend approached me after Ahmed left one day and was like: “Well, Ahmed is kind of a dick, isn’t he.”

And I stopped whatever I was doing and was like: “Wait. He *was* a dick to you. Oh and last time, too. Oh and the time before that.”

Then we talked about all the times that Ahmed was being rude to him, and I am a little embarrassed by how oblivious I’ve been to it.

And so, my friendship with Ahmed started to wilt once again. He wasn’t texting me anymore, he forgot my birthday this year, and when I texted him for his birthday, he replied with just a thanks. I wanted to talk to him about why he was being a dick, but the chance never really came up.

Then he texted me on Facebook and told me he was getting married to a woman. When I received his wedding invitation a few months later, I noticed that he didn’t give me a +1. And so I RSVP-ed no.

That’s when my boyfriend first mentioned to me that Ahmed is in love with me. I never thought about it until now. (I’m clearly a wee bit slow with these things) So I asked a few other friends who know Ahmed, and apparently everyone agrees and thought I knew. :/ Even my mother!

So I guess I’m posting this because I need someone neutral to tell me the same thing. Is it possible for us to go back to being friends? I’m sad that such a long and complicated friendship had to come to an end. I live in a small town and I’m bound to run into Ahmed one day. Should I bring up the whole being rude to my boyfriend thing? Not that I would leave my boyfriend or ever be with Ahmed, but it’s bothering me because I get very emotionally attached to my friends and they become my family. Every other time Ahmed and I would stop talking, I guess I knew that it was temporarily, but it doesn’t feel temporary this time. Please, give advice.

Thanks.",09Nov2019,1

485,"I’m almost positive that my best friend has an eating disorder. I think she’s had one for a long time. She’s always been small, but starting a couple years ago, she started looking extremely thin. Sometimes it’s hard to tell because she often wears baggy clothes and she has really big boobs, but if she ever wears anything fitted, you realize how small she is. Her tricep is almost the same size as her wrist. The thing is, I don’t think it’s a conscious thing. She’s always eaten like a bird even as a young child and she eats so painfully slow. That might just be how she eats. But if that’s the case, it’s still not healthy I don’t know how to tell her that the way she’s been eating for 19 years is not good for her. Doctors have told her to gain a little bit of weight, and she says that she wants to gain weight. But then she doesn’t hardly eat anything. And I don’t feel comfortable going to her mom about it because her mom seems to like the fact that her daughter is so small. And the mom also has an eating disorder when she was in high school and college. And I can’t go to her dad because her parents are divorced (and her dad sucks tbh). And any problems that she has (depression, period issues, autoimmune issues) she seems to think are separate health issues when I think they all stem from the fact that her body isn’t getting enough nutrients. Anyway, I’m not sure what to do, especially since she doesn’t think anything is wrong with her eating habits and she’s a really sensitive person so I don’t want to upset her and make it worse.

486,"So I have 2 roommates, one of my best friends and the other a random girl. We all decided to choose 2 days to wash our clothes.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed when one of my roommates does laundry she'll move my clothes from the dryer into the washer so she can put her things in the dryer.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The first time we did laundry she moved my stuff to the couch. I told her not to which is why she's been moving my stuff to the washer instead. I kinda wished she would just message me or knock on my door so I can go get my things from the dryer.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However, I do my laundry on Tuesday and Thursdays and she does hers on Wednesdays and Sundays.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I was at work on a Wednesday and she texted me asking if the laundry in there was mine. I said yes and that I'd move it out when I get back home after 10pm. She said she already put her things in the dryer and moved mine in the washer. I told her I preferred if she'd wait until I moved them. She was like ""Well we're keeping our laundry days right?"" I said, ""yes I just forgot to take my stuff out of the dryer last night""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I will admit I often leave my things in the dryer hours after they've been finished drying because I forget about them.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Fast forward to Sunday\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*My roommate posts in the roommate group me\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey, let's remember to remove our laundry once we are done, before other peoples' laundry days. That way we won't have to worry about moving/touching each other's things""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I asked, ""Are clothes in there right now?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She said ""yes the dryer""

&amp;#x200B;

497,"I really need some advice because this is eating me up inside with anxiety! I apologize in advance for what is likely going to be rambling and slightly rant-ish. I'll include a TL;DR at the end. For reference, I am 26 years old. I am currently working two part-time jobs and possibly will be going back to school in January. I love one of my jobs where I work at a local library. It's great and I know I want to stay there for right now at least.

The other job, though, is an issue. It's technically a research assistant position through the school where I completed my last degree. It was fine at first, just basic data entry, analysis, etc. Nothing crazy but it was all stuff I signed up for and I didn't mind it and it pays pretty well for an RA job. But now, I am finding myself being pulled into all of these crazy projects that are nothing like what I thought I would be doing when I got the position. Specifically, there are these online meetings I am having to organize and attend and I'm losing sleep over trying to coordinate them. A related issue: I can only work 900 hours a year and I am nearly at that max so I am being expected to work on emails and such on my own time. 

So, I guess I've been feeling like I'm being taken advantage of recently at the RA job. Because I am trustworthy and organized, I am being given responsibilities and expectations beyond what my fellow RA coworkers have been given. I think some of the duties I now have are those of a full-time employee, not an RA that works three days a week at most. ALSO, super annoyingly my boss at the RA job has been implying that I might have to work some of my pre-scheduled library hours around this new project and I do not feel that is fair. The library is a stable 20-hours a week position that is scheduled a month in advance. Furthermore, I have to be available to help library patrons so I really can't just run away to conduct a meeting in the middle of a workday but my RA boss seems unable to understand that.

Further compounding issues: I recently applied for a Masters degree program at the same school I am working at. My RA boss wrote me a letter of recommendation. She also discussed how I would be welcome to stay at my position if I get into the program for as long as I am still in school. Honestly, I'm almost starting to hope I DON'T get accepted just so I have an excuse to quit which is awful.

So, I just want to know what you all think I should do? Would it be incredibly rude of me to quit and leave this project hanging or falling to other research assistants? How do I respectfully quit without burning bridges? I like my boss as a person, but I think she has a one-track mind when it comes to work and career. It's always been #1 for her and I think she expects the same of me, but I've always had the mindset of ""work to live, not live to work."" Again, I'm sorry for the rambling post but I would REALLY appreciate any and all advice about how to handle this situation. 

**TL;DR: I have been working as a research assistant for three years but have recently been given duties I did not sign up for and actively hate and are giving me anxiety. What should I do? If I quit, how do I do so without causing too much conflict?**",09Nov2019,1

I have an uncle who has a mental disorder, ever since he had a motorbike accident back in the 70's. Since then he can't understand certain things like a 'normal' brain can understand.

Thanks to his disorder he can't work fulltime so of course, money is tight every month

We have made clear to him that this whole lottery is a scam but he can't get that trough in his head.

We have tried contacting to this lottery and there doesn't seem to be a clear phonenumber or email to get in contact with these people. And if there would be, they won't magically stop the letters so it would be pretty useless

Any advice on how we could get through to him? Or how we can stop the letters from this lottery?

511,"My much older sister is a dysfunctional piece of work. Her ex-husband is equally interesting. The two of the had a volatile relationship, rife with physical abuse, serious drug abuse, and neglect.

Sister and her ex breakup because ""he can't live with her"" and he walked away, literally, and didn't even take my niece. He just left this poor kid.

Flash forward, Niece is 12. Her life has been one episode of ""running away from CPS, running from the cops, don't tell anybody what goes on at home. "" There is more, but it's not relevant to the story, it's just been a very long 12 years for me.

Now she wants to contact her dad. They were in secret communication until my sister broke my nieces phone when she found out. And granted, I think children have the right to access their parents without interference.... But this guy.... As awful as my sister is, the two of them totally deserved eachother. But my niece doesn't deserve either one of these pieces of human filth.

518,"My name is Haylee and I'm 17 years old. I live with my mother, my 26 year old sister, her 1 year old, and her 31 year old boyfriend. When I say I live with these people, it's more like they're infesting my house with negativity and bullshit. My mother and I both have jobs (part time for me) and I go to school. My sister and her shithead do not have jobs and instead sit on their asses all day and watch a screen on the wall. Although my mother and I are rarely at the house anymore, coming home to that sort of thing make me wish they were dead. Sometimes I wish I was dead. They don't do anything. They don't work. They don't clean. Hell, they don't even take care of they're 1 year old half the time. The house smells like shit and looks like shit. Any of the money they DO have goes towards cigarettes, weed and even meth sometimes.
These people have lived with us on and off for over 12 years, each stay getting longer and more torturous. They insist on talking shit about us even though they ZERO room to talk. Both of them dropped out of highschool and never went to collage. My sister has gotten fired from every job she's ever kept, and her lame boyfriend quits after 2 weeks because its ""too hard"". They hate eachother, they claim they don't but I know they do. What kind of couple screams and fights all day and calls it love? What kind of couple uses their time to plan out how they'll make the people who actually live there want to live on the street just to get away?
They steal from us. They steal our most precious belongings and sell them for drugs. They steal the food we buy and eat all of it in less than 2 days. They stole my childhood. My happiness. My will to survive. They stole my life. I don't even think I'll have a future.
We have a restraining order on the boyfriend but he's still here... Every time we try to get him out the cops say they can't do anything BECAUSE he is still there. He never left. He's verbally abusive to everyone, even the baby, but especially to me because I'm half his age and he thinks he can push me around. He's tried to attack me. After I take a shower he looks me up and down when I come out in a towel . I'm just lucky the bathroom is right next to my room or I'd probably be in rehab right now...

519,"I thought my roommate was going through my stuff when I was out of town so I got a security camera. Lo and behold, I almost immediately catch not him, but his girlfriend, going into my room naked. To make this slightly more complicated, she is an intern at the company both myself and my roommate work at. (Personally I think it's weird to date an intern, but to each his own.)

I approached him and told him to not let her in my room in the future. He asked how I knew at which point I told him I had 1 camera in my personal room and I again asked him to not let her back into my room. He told me she went into my room to check if I was there (obviously a lie, as she was naked) and so I asked him to just text me in the future. I did not reveal to him I knew she was naked in my room.

This has created an extremely uncomfortable situation for me at work as I view this as a serious invasion of privacy and have to see both of them every day. This situation actually happened a few months ago but I recently found out she's been spreading lies to other co-workers that I have cameras all over the apartment among other lies that make me sound like a strange, messy, weirdo. (And I'd like to think I'm none of those things, ha)

I guess here's where the advice I'm looking for comes into play. I feel like I have been/am being harassed at work by her spreading these lies about me. How would you approach this situation professionally and appropriately? Should I involve HR? Should I just let it be? I'd appreciate any and all perspectives on this as it's been weighing on me a silly amount. 

(Also, while I know this is not the legal advice subreddit, does anyone have any input on whether I am breaking the law by having inadvertently recorded her naked? My security camera ONLY records in my room. It is very clearly my personal room and it has no view of any shared/public space in our apartment.)",09Nov2019,1

521,"I don't know how to start this since it has been going on as long as I can remember. I really love my mom I really think she's the greatest but, she always talks down to me. Especially these past couple of days. The most recent example(s) being that my grades aren't acceptable (acceptable as in above 90%) and she doesn't stop talking about how I don't study and that I don't appreciate her. Even though I know I study hours everyday she never checks in on me and then says really degrading things. Even for the good deeds I try to do, she critiques me. Next Monday, my school will be organising an event to plant trees in our city to help with climate change and I'm the organiser for this event and when I told my mom she said that it was a waste of time and that I should focus on grades. I feel like everything I do for her isn't enough. She always looks at my flaws trying to make me the perfect child she wants. I've tried talking with her about this but she just said how I take her for granted and that I failed her and then she plays the victim and profusely ""apologise"" and say that she failed as a parent. She's always sarcastic and childish in arguments most of the times mocking me and continues to degrade me. Let me tell you, when I was talking to her about how she never supports me, I was in tears and I was begging her to talk to me like I'm a human and her to support me then she got really aggressive saying that she's right and she doesn't need to do anything for me and that I don't respect her. My question is should I ignore her since I'm moving out in 2 years or should I talk to her again or should I tell her she actually failed me as a parent? I can't take her anymore and at this point I don't think I'll ever get back my actual mom and instead have this entitled woman as a lame excuse of a parent.

528,"Hello redditors. So recently after the beginning of this year I seemed to have gotten a crush on some one or like someone, not sure what you call it. They are a really good friend of mine and I also go to a small school with them. I see them everyday and it’s really hard to keep that from them. I feel like when ever I’m around them I’m not myself and I’m shy or scared or something that I don’t want to be. I only think about this person when I go to bed, or when I’m showering because I don’t want to be the way I’m acting and because I guess I like this person. About a month ago I thought that maybe I do like this person but I don’t want to and it becomes more apparentt that I like this person every-time I think about her. I don’t know what to do because I would rather be friends and not like this person and I feel like if I told her that I did like her, a lot would happen. I think that she might not want to be friends with me, and other things that I can’t think off the top of my head. The only reason I would tell her is so that she can understand why I act like this and help me stop but I don’t think that would happen. I want to be friends with her and not have a crush on her, I don’t know how to change that. I have a grade of 12 students which is also my class. So it’s very hard to not be around this person. I want to talk with her but of course she has other friends, and they are better to her. Every time I’m next to her I have to start a conversation or else she won’t talk to me, at least at school. Out side of school is great well sometimes. When she’s over at my house it’s ok but not at my house, like subway or something I just don’t do good. I don’t want this of course. Also I text her sometimes and I feel like I text her more than I talk to her in person and I don’t like that so much, if I could tell her this with out anything bad happening I would, but I’ve know this person for some time now and I know it’s not that easy. Any advice? Thank you to any one and feel free to privately message me.",09Nov2019,1

533,"So i’m 20 years old, and i lately found out a really strange pattern with my father. Basically he would get extremely angry with my for something really silly, than right afterwards he would confront my brother for something silly too, and afterwards he would blame me for being angry to him and starting the whole thing. An hour later he acts like nothing happened at all and this cicle would go on every two days or so. So today, when he started to shout at me for something stupid I actually confronted him, and started treating the situation with humor, because of how stupid it was getting (mind you, we were in the lunch table and my younger brother was with us so i was trying to lighten the mood a bit too). This only made it worse because he started getting angrier and calling me things like “idiot” (he even said to my brother:don’t listen to her, she’s mentally ill, which I tried to not pay attention to). After this i tried imitating him, so he could see how stupid it was getting, my brother and i git a laugh out of it. We finished our meal and without a word he got up and left. A few hours later i hear him gelling to my brother for leaving his shoes in the floor.

After this i go downstairs to have a snack while i was working, and my dad comes into the room and starts reprimending me about how bad of a person i am and how this was all of my fault because I got angry. I said to him: “ok, you have to stop this, you can ruin my weekend, but not my brother’s”, then he laughs ironically and says “Like you care about your brother”. This made me very upset because i love him very dearly, but i tried to keep my cool after that trying to make fun of the situation once again. This didn’t last long when he started to get very frustrated and made a threatening gesture at me . After this he started to shout and i shouted in return, went to my room and punched my door twice out of frustration. He of course followed me and started to punch my brother’s doorframe (the one right next to me) repeatedly until bits of the cealing started to fall. After this he went downstairs again and after an hour he comes into my room like nothing happened and being nice to me (without saying sorry to me of course, only to my younger brother).

Any advice on what can I do to stop this? I love my dad, i really do, but he sometimes can get really angry and it sometimes is too much to handle for me every damn time,",09Nov2019,1

535,"I’m a sophomore at an Ivy League school right now. In high school it was my dream to come here. Looking back, I don’t know why I cared so much about prestige and anything I could gain from it, which really isn’t much. Basically, I’m just miserable here. I haven’t made any real friends and I don’t care about what I’m majoring in but I see it as my only option. I don’t feel like I belong here. I can never go home because I live 1000 miles away, I work or have class every day of the week, so it feels like I can never really rest. I have to wake up to an alarm every morning which kinda bums me out because I would like to have just one day to just rest and do what I want/need to do. I have also struggled with anxiety and depression since I was 12 so that doesn’t really help either. 

I want to transfer to a different school but there are so many things keeping me from doing that. At the school I go to, I get a lot of financial aid. Like, nothing another school could offer would even compare. I wouldn’t get many scholarships to transfer either because my GPA is around a 3.2. Also, when I talk to my mom about transferring, she just sounds so disappointed. She never pushed me to go to a competitive school, but she always just tells me that I will be throwing away a good opportunity and essentially ruining my life if I leave this school. I don’t really agree with her, I feel like I have to be the one to make opportunities for myself. Being at a good school isn’t going to carry me to success and I know that being so unhappy is not really helping me put myself out there. 

I’ve thought about transferring, taking a year off and coming back here, or just dropping out completely. I try not to let this influence my decision, but it would also make me a lot happier to be close to my boyfriend, but my mom is super against me transferring to be close to him, which I totally understand.

536,"Hello, this is my first post on reddit, I created this account for the sole purpose of getting my friend back. I am a Freshman in High School, and within the first two weeks, I made a couple friends, one in particular that I would like to name ""C."" Over the first two months of school, I began to develop feelings for C and over a while, my feelings for her were unbearable. We were in a friend group together and I quite enjoyed spending time with these people. But in secret, I was in need of an outlet for my feelings.

That's when I discovered an Instagram page. It was based in my High School and was marketed as a place where if you message them about your feelings for someone, they will anonymously post it on their page for your crush to see. It sounds like some shitty middle school drama, I know, but hear me out. I messaged them saying that there was this girl named C and I was having some feelings for her, but i was unsure of what they were. She liked the post and I sent it to her, admitting it was me. This whole thing was a shitty thing to do, and I understand how uncomfortable it made her. She kindly rejected me, and I asked her if his would change our friendship and she said that she hopes not. 

The next two weeks, I avoided her trying to make it less awkward for the both of us, because I already had done something so stupid, I didn't want to make things worse. I did, however, talk to mutual friends to try and get advice on how to get close to her again. One in particular told me that C wanted to talk to me in person instead of over text. We made plans to speak to her yesterday during my free period in front of the wood shop. When the time came, I waited for her, then I saw her talking to a mutual friend, she made eye contact, and a group of people walked in front of them, and when they passed, they disappeared, like in a horror movie. They went into the cafeteria. 

I went into the woodshop and shot her a DM, telling her that when she was ready to talk, I was ready to listen. This was ironic, because the conversation we were supposed to have was about me avoiding her. I was planning on apologizing to her in person yesterday, it was supposed to make everything go back to normal. My next period was Theater, which C was also in. A mutual friend saw me acting different and explained that C just ""Didn't want to talk to me."" Which was funny because it was her idea. When school ended yesterday, I saw that she had left that message on read. I knew she would have done this, but I took a deep breath and walked home.

I went to message her again, but saw that the little ""Seen"" marker on the bottom of the screen had gone away. It also wouldn't tell me when she was last seen online. She restricted my account. And I do know why. I have been telling people this story since the situation started, and that is all on me. I was looking for advice from these people, but C was upset I told them the story, which is perfectly reasonable. When I told people that she restricted my account (another mistake) they either were on my side or on her side. I just wanted a non biased source of advice, so thats why I turned to Reddit. I know I did wrong, I have accepted that, I'm just looking for someone to help me know hoe to clean the mess I had started. Should I go back to my original plan and leave things be to cool down, or should I do something else? Any help would be needed. Thank you.",09Nov2019,1
537,"For the first few weeks of school I really liked my roommate she was sweet and kind and we
got along well. However, now she relies on me for her happiness and walks all over me. I have my car at school and she demands I drive her places and when i say i cant, she insults me. The other night she said “jesus christ you eat so fucking much” (keep in mind i am extremely fit and have to eat every few hours to maintain my muscle growth, and she on the other hand never gets out of bed and only eats Mcdonalds)

I understand that alot of her anger roots from insecurities so i try to let it go, but its getting to the point where i just cant deal with her energy and its sucking the life out of me.

538,"I don’t have a mother, she had abused me for 4 years until my father took full custody of my brother and I and he took us away from her for good reasons.
I’m still in high school, but my father just passed yesterday around 3:00PM.
He had a mild heart attack March of this year and as a result he was ill for months, he had pleurisy and many other illnesses. He lost 50-70lbs during this period. 
As soon as I got off my bus I noticed police cars around my house and I was confused but I entered my home anyway. 
So I didn’t know anything until after I walked into my home and opened my dad’s door slightly because I was going to talk to him. And when I cracked the door open I saw partially his body face down on the ground. An officer pulled me away as soon as I cracked the door open and he led me into my living room where my family was at and I was informed. 
I haven’t had an appetite for 4 days now but I’ve been eating now and then for the sake of not losing my health. 
I tried to sleep last night but as I calmed down before sleeping, I saw his body again. I envisioned his body 3 times as I tried to sleep and each time I would jolt awake. I would physically jolt to a different position as I was lying down. 
It’s been around 20hours since his passing and my family is trying to set up legal and financial things. He never was open about his financial business and we don’t know whether he was payed retirement for his 17 years as a police officer or not. 
We’re still shaken up from this but three days ago I felt extremely depressed or just absolutely horrible. I talked with the psychiatrist at my high school (I had been consulting her for 2 months now) and she asked me how my father would respond to me having to be put on anti-depressants and I didn’t have an idea of how he would react. I’d always been open to him about it, but I believe he’s had this fear of me becoming like my mother (she was schizophrenic paranoid and she had other illnesses too). I don’t know what to do about myself or anyone, it’s a scary time as I no longer have direct parents. Just my little brother, little cousin, older cousin, two uncles, an aunt, and two grandparents.

539,"I need some help dealing with a particularly troubling situation within a writing group. 

It's come to light that one of our members has a history of writing about sexual assault. He writes supervillain fantasy novels that often feature the protagonist (who is a villain) sexually assaulting people. The group knew he writes novels from a villain's perspective, but was unaware of the sexual assault element until some issues arose with his behavior during group meetings and some of our members took a closer look at his portfolio. The issues were that he would sometimes talk over people, dominate the conversation or make problematic references (using the holocaust and offensive black stereotypes to illustrate his points about writing in front of Jewish and African American members, for instance).

There have been no incidents thus far where he has physically or sexually threatened a member of the group, but some of our members are now demanding his removal because they believe it is only a matter of time until he does. Compounding this is the fact that he has expressed that we're his only social outlet, a fact that has given some members sympathy towards him but made others feel he is even more of a risk of lashing out if asked to leave the group. One member has gone so far as compare him to a school shooter who is waiting to pull the trigger. 

This has caused a schism within the group, with some members recognizing the issues with his verbal behavior but believing that he's shown no signs of harming anyone. This side believes that talking to him and giving him constructive criticism about his behavior can give him room to grow, rather than be pushed further towards the fringe. To be clear: if he had actually harmed or even verbally threatened a member of the group, he would be gone. Since he has not done so and the disagreement is over what he *might* do, this side still believes there's room to defuse the situation without excluding anyone. 

The other side, however, is already reaching out to battered women's shelters and resources for sexual assault survivors inquiring on how to deal with a potential assault risk. I don't believe his name has been given out yet, but it wouldn't be difficult for one of these groups to determine which member of the group has the catalog of writing dealing with sexual assault. He has a very public presence with a decently sized online following. 

The concern is that it's only a matter of time until one of two things happen: A) he's publicly implicated in something he hasn't actually done yet, but certain people believe he may do, and his name is added to assault shelter watch lists or B) the concerned side is right and he actually *does* harm someone.

We can't just ban the guy, because the concerned side believes he will physically retaliate if we do. We can't just talk to the guy, again because of one side's fear of retaliation but also belief that he'd simply continue his pattern of verbal behavior. Many of us don't even *want* to ban the guy and would rather help him understand the problems with his behavior. The leadership of the group is absolutely paralyzed right now because none of us can agree on what, if any, threat this guy presents, much less what action should be taken to make our members feel less threatened.

So what should we do?",09Nov2019,1

I joined a medical magnet high school and graduated top of my class, got accepted into an accelerated pre-med university track and graduated in 3 years, took the extra year as a gap year to study MCAT and apply for med school, and then finally got in.

My first semester was rough,  but I somehow got by.  Second semester first year I was rougher, and I had to stay over the summer to remediate a course but I was able to pass and I felt like I understood the material much better over the two-weeks of summer than I did the entire semester (crazy, I know). And I've been consistently passing all my labs, so no issue there.

I'm in my second year now, and I have no idea what's going on. I feel so...exhausted. I have never been in a situation where no matter how hard I try, I'm not able to pass my exams. I'm doing everything I normally do, I'm trying to understand the material, and it's just not working. I feel so worthless, and sometimes when my parents call I'm scared to talk to them because I'm just so depressed from not being able to do well in my studies (they've been really supportive, though, telling me that it's okay and to just to my best, but I just feel like I'm always constantly letting them down and I hate doing that). I've never had this issue before, and I've also felt like my health is getting worse (probably from all the anxiety). I just really hate myself for not being able to get good grades like I should be. 

I've hit the point where I wonder if I'm even cut out for medicine. Everyone seems to be doing so well, but I'm struggling so badly. But my whole life has just been aiming for med school, I just don't know what to do if I don't end up graduating. And don't even get me started on the immense debt I'm accumulating. And even if I somehow graduate, will I even be able to get a residency with my grades? I'm barely scraping by with my normal grades, so what if my board scores are crap? I'm wondering if I should just leave now and cut my losses so I don't accrue anymore debt. But then I don't know what else I can do with my life.

I just feel so cornered, and I feel like I'm getting more and more depressed...I could really use some advice...sorry for the bother...",09Nov2019,1
545,"I'm 19 year old girl with helicopter parents. I started living alone by this month and they have contacts with my land lord and has asked the land lord to tell them when I'm going out and coming back. Today I had gone out for a stroll and didn't come back by 9:00pm so the landlord informed my parents. My dad called me and I told him I was sleeping. I was out and he caught me lying. He was really angry. After I reached he called me and (I reached by 9:45pm) scolded me so much.  Called me a bitch, saying that I'm his dog and he should obey me. Called me prostitute for going out and not returning my 9pm. (I had told him I went out to buy groceries. I did go to buy groceries and things for my new place) 

I've had enough. I've been living like this my whole life. Till I turned 15 I would be only allowed to go out for school that too accompanied by my mate this my school gate and brought back. I've had enough of this. I have been suicidal my whole life because of all the pressure. I'm also taking up a major I don't want to. Today was the breaking point for me.

548,"My niece is 16 and recently had a suicide attempt, it wasn't a close call...but a definite cause for concern. She's got a bad relationship with her dad and my sister (her mom) and her have always been by each other's sides. 

My sister is very maternal and traditional with her parenting styles and wants the best for her daughter...but it makes it hard for my niece to be able to openly talk to her about issues that will cause her to get in trouble. When asked by the therapist if there were any adults she felt she could openly speak to about whatever, I'm the only one she named. 

My niece is my life, I love her so much. But I'm not sure what to do. Today she was here and she confided in me that she's been smoking weed carts and gave herself a couple of quick poke tattoos with an ink pen and safety pin. 

I just don't know how to approach it. I smoke weed and love it, don't see anything wrong with it. I can't give hypocritical advice and say ""don't do it it's awful"" when I'm sitting there stoned. At the same time I can't tell her go on with it because it would be a huge betrayal to my sister (maybe?). I also can't trust mentioning it to my mom or sister without them telling each other and reacting to it...essentially breaking the trust that I have with her. I don't know if it'd be betrayal due to the fact they asked me to be there for her. She trusts me for a reason and it's because I make a concerted effort to hear her out and not jump into protective mode like they do and be realistic about the likelihood of a 16 year old telling all her friends she's done doing anything rebellious because her mom and grandma said to be.  

I am not so hard headed that I would just be like ""fuck them, smoke it up!"" But I'm not going to say don't. I let her know to stop with the weed carts, she doesn't know who they're coming from and is getting ripped off. She prides herself in being an old soul so told her just smoke bud if she's gonna be a stoner, keep it classic. Obviously the tattoos I told her just stop that shit. But now I'm wondering, if she's gonna smoke she's gonna smoke..and I know she thinks nothing will happen with the bs carts she's buying, so do I offer to get her some that I know are legit? Or let her hit mine? I just think about how growing up I always wished there was another stoner in the family. Could help build an even bigger bond and allow me to be able to know if she's facing bigger dilemmas and to be there for her.",09Nov2019,1
549,"So my second semester of senior year I walked into my gym class and saw this guy we’ll call ‘Cody’. I knew of cody but never talked to him until this class. My gym teacher gave us the option to play volleyball or basketball and my friend and I always chose to play volleyball and so did Cody. Most of the time he was on my team and we were always next to each other. He would set up the ball so I could spike it and I would do the same. We would talk a bit during gym but never full on conversations but we’d joke around with each other. (I forgot to mention in the beginning that I’m gay surprise!) A few weeks later our mutual friend was throwing a party and I honestly didn’t expect to see him there but by the grace of God he is! I walked over to the drink table with my friend and as I’m pouring my drink I see from the corner of my eye someone waving so I turn my head and it’s Cody waving at me. (At this point I wouldn’t really consider us friends but more like school acquaintances) I’m just gonna get to the point because this is starting to drag on, So I message him on snapchat saying that I like him and sorry if its going to make things weird blah blah and He was super nice about it saying that He appreciates the compliment and that we’re still cool. its been about 5 months since then and we go to different colleges but I cannot seem to stop having a crush on him.

551,"My roommate and I recently got in a big blow up fight. I’m admittedly a terribly messy person, and my depression is not helping. So my half of the room is pretty bad a lot of the time. I do try and clean up though, when I have the energy, but it’s hard and it makes me feel more depressed so I don’t really bother with it as much as I should.

My roommate is, justifiably, sick of it. She’ll tell me to clean my half of the room (which I do when she asks), but she only does it over text and when I’m not there in order to be “non confrontational.” This last time pushed it over the line, though.  I asked her why she never asks me about it in person, and she says it’s because she doesn’t want to be mean. She said I always talk about getting better but I never do, and when I told her how hard it is for me and I am really trying to get better, she told me I use my mental health as an excuse and that she’s been  suffering with depression and PTSD for the past two years and that it isn’t an excuse for her. She said, and I quote, “you are an adult now and have obviously been relying on your parents and sister to pick up after you.”

I’ve been traumatized since I was nine years old. I have severe chronic depression, severe chronic anxiety, and an OCD disorder that makes me pull out my own hair, and high functioning autism. I have struggled with these since childhood, and I was pulled out of school for 2, probably more years that I can’t remember since I’ve repressed that time period of my life in order to learn how to function as a person. My mother had thyroid cancer around this time period as well. Stage three, borderline four. We’re lucky she’s alive. I am terrified of change, and during my high school years I cooked and cleaned and worked a full time job while taking AP courses and getting into a very good college. I helped my mom learn how to be a student again after she stopped everything to raise me, and my sister and I would exchange chores so I wouldn’t have to clean and she wouldn’t have to do any of the other household stuff she doesn’t enjoy. I am, however, fully capable, and have far exceeded what my therapists thought I could handle.

And now my roommate thinks I’m a spoiled brat who uses “muh depression” as an excuse for not cleaning my half of the room. I’m in therapy, and I’m going back on anti depressants, and it’s still just an excuse to her. I flipped out, and said some really mean things and she said some really mean things back that I don’t want to count in this argument since we were both heated. I already apologized for being so extreme in my reaction, and I’ve already forgiven her for being so mean in turn. But now it keeps escalating.

I didn’t want to stay in the room for the rest of the week so I went to stay with my boyfriend. I told her I wanted to talk when I got back home, and I took some screenshots of the chat to look over and think about my actions and what I want moving forward. I wanted it to be a peaceable conversation, and I haven’t changed how the room works at all. She still uses my rice cooker, and she still uses the fridge I bought for us to use. I’m not going to take away those things, but today she told me she had already gotten the RA involved without telling me she was going to.

She isn’t communicating with me at all about what she’s doing or what she wants to do, and I’ve told her already I just want to talk about things she’s said to me (she’s been rude and talked about my relationship with my family before) and how I want them to change, but she’s said nothing about what she wants and as only said I’m making it a bigger deal than what it is. When it’s my family, who have done nice things like buy her cups and the like that she wanted more of, that she keeps talking about like she knows them and my relationship with them.

It makes me so upset. I want to cry just thinking about it. I wasn’t ready to talk about it when I left, and now two days back into my break at home she’s continuing to stress my out. I don’t know what to do. I thought I was going about this the right way but I don’t know anymore and I don’t want to go back to school. Im so sad. Just so fucking sad and tired. What can I do to end this already so I can try to be an adult again? I don’t want to live there anymore and it feels like I’ve given up.",09Nov2019,1

The local government knows about my problems and I'm starting a part-time job very soon to start saving up for stuff like rent. Except the local government can't help me as much with the problem as the country is already in a housing crisis. I will try and call for an urgency to get higher on the queue the coming Monday.

553,"okay so i live in virginia (born and raised) and i absolutely hate it here, lately i’ve been so depressed living here and every time i visit a different state i feel way happier. i’m also 16 and a junior in high school, i’m also looking to go out of state for college. 

i’ve always wanted to live in texas, arizona, nevada, or california because i’d have tons of opportunities, the warm weather, the lower cost of living (other than california),  it’s far from my home state, and i want to feel independent. now some of y’all may say new york, charlotte, atlanta, and even northern virginia near dc has good opportunities but, i simply want to move to a state w/ a lower cost of living and year round warmer weather. i’ve also thought about florida and i love it every time when i visit but my parents always makes some type of smart remark about florida is full of “crazy” people but it’s crazy people in every state even virginia. also to add, they wouldn’t mind if i did move to florida. 

whichever state i decide to go to for college i do want to stay permanently. my parents are all in for me going out of state for college they just don’t want me to leave the east coast. i already brought up going to school in texas but they immediately said no they also said “i can get the same education in virginia” so obviously i’m scared to bring up california, arizona, and nevada. yes it would be cheaper to say here for 4 more years but i simply just don’t like it here and it’s to help my mental health and have better opportunities.

they said they would get me a car so if i decide to go to texas i can drive home but, if i decide to move to ca, az, or nv then i could simply just fly home for breaks or they could fly to me. i really love my parents but i really want to move cross country plus i’d be 18 when i graduate high school. plus what’s the issue of moving to one of those states for college than later when i’m (or if) in a relationship and have a family you know?

555,"Throwaway. My family used to run a restaurant in a city in the bay area, we did well, but the place was shady. So we moved to a nicer and bigger location 30 mins away from home. Problem is, the rent is high af.

At the new location, we made enough for rent, but little else. Can't hire more workers, which means we cant uphold demand. We may have to sell it for the 2nd time.

We're a family of 5, 4 of us working and one hired chef. It's not enough. After work theres so much cleaning and preparing for the next day that we dont get home until 1-3 am. Now, my parents have had a history of fighting, so this causes for a lot of arguments between my them almost every night. They've also been arguing in our previous location too(also part of the reason why we moved.)

It gets so bad that im worried my dad will get physical, it has happened before. They blame each other a lot, plus my dad(typical loud asian father) is too stubborn to get help. Most of the time, my dad has a short temper and my mom always fans the fire. She always asks me what she should do, and if they dont want help then I have no fucking idea. It's hard enough to talk rationally with them without bursting into tears.

I've told her to try to find separate jobs from working with my father, but she says that the income wont be as good as when they're running their own business.

Im sick of it, my job and the fighting. And I don't know what to do. I'm trying to study at college and juggle with the business and my family's problems. I'm worried that if we do sell the restaurant, I won't find stable income for my tuition for a while.

558,"I keep crying and I can’t talk to anyone because all my family is involved. I feel like I’m in the middle of it and have access the most to how people feel because I’m so close to everyone. I’m 26 by the way. 

My grandparents need my father (his parents) to go drive them 26 hours away with their car. He’s done that a couple of times and it’s the best for them, and my father likes driving. 

However, my grandmother from my mothers side is getting really sick. She’s been having a lot tests lately (colonoscopy, scans, biopsies, endoscopy) and rather quickly considering our healthcare system is really slow. She’s having short term memory loss. She hasn’t had any test results back yet, but she started giving stuff away, which breaks my mothers heart. 

My mother is devastated. My father thinks she has some unresolved issues with her mother from her childhood, which leaves her unable to function. She needs psychological help but won’t reach for help. She’s acting like everything is fine but I see that she’s really not going well at all. 

My father wants to please everyone and wants to leave to drive my grandparents, even though my mother told him she needs him to stay home. She wouldn’t be able to deal with the situation if my grandmother died while my father was away. I know my mother and I know she would feel abandoned when she needed him the most. 

I don’t know what to do. I told my grandparents that my father shouldn’t leave my mother alone but I feel terrible. They can’t drive and would need to take the train but they don’t have tickets.

560," Hi, I wanted to get some feedback from reddit on something that’s been haunting me a lot lately.  

Ever since high school, I always thought I was gay. I was always someone with very strong opinions who knew where I was going at any given point (even if my plans or future vision have changed, Ive always have a very clear vision of what I want and who I am at any given moment).  

For whatever reason, I was never the “out and proud” type to family and coworkers, but I was open to all my friends about my sexuality and not ashamed or anything, and I very much felt like a gay identity lined up and made sense. I was attracted to men, I fell in love with men, my whole fantasy works related to guys and the question of navigating masculinity.  

But now...I’m not so sure I know what I desire any more when it comes to an adult relationship.  

The truth is, even back when my sexuality felt coherent...it always sort of felt like it had an expiration date. My gay identity or romantic fantasy was always very youth focused. I liked the vision of a semi-secret, semi-transgressive somewhat angst-tinged relationship with another young guy. But I never really liked or even comprehended the idea of, like, being with a man past, say, 40. Frankly, that just feels sort of gross or somehow...sad, to me.  

Meanwhile, with society getting so accepting of gays, the idea of such a relationship being forbidden and exotic has gone away, and that oddly makes the whole thing less romantic to me too. And since college my friends have mostly been men, gay men mostly, and now I'm almost like...missing the feminine presence in my life (before college, most of my friends were girls).

I had a seven year relationship with a guy in my mid-twenties that was torrid and a real mind-fuck, and in many ways played out all the angsty melodramatic fantasies I had about relationships. I came out of it much sadder but wiser. I think I used to be looking for a man to “complete me” or to have access to a masculine energy I didn’t feel I had. After that relationship...now I sort of feel like I am complete in myself, that another person can’t complete me, and like I’m comfortable in my own masculinity.  

Now I’m in a relationship with a great guy who loves and respects me, but...I just don’t know about what I want for my future, for once in my life.  

Or rather, I know a lot. I know I want kids. More than anything. I want a house in the suburbs and a big family. But I just...feel really ambivalent about the place of another adult in that vision. 

Like...the thing that sort of makes the most sense for what I want is a wife. I think I want biological children, and I want them to have a mother in the house. I just don’t know what my relationship with her would or could be like. 

Growing up, my parents had a relationship based more on the kids...and it worked. They didn’t have much of an independent or terribly deep relationship with each other, but they each had great relationships with the kids, and related and relate to each other in and through the family as a whole. And it worked and works, somehow. And I sort of like that model.

Sometimes I imagine just adopting kids as a single, maybe having a partner who doesn’t live near by that they know of as “Uncle” or whatever, but that doesn’t really seem fair to the kids or the partner. 

And the truth is...a relationship with a man has lost a lot of its coherence for me. My emotional desires and my sexual desires used to very clearly line up. I’d dream of a boyfriend who was both emotionally a companion and confidante, and who I really lusted for.  

Now, I’m not sure that’s even possible for me anymore. I’ve discovered that sexual attraction of that type is, for me, largely predicated in unattainability anyway, and was possibly always sort of an illusion for me. I don’t find most gay men attractive. I’m mostly attracted to straight men, and have even found out a lot of my favorite gay pornstars are actually just gay for pay.   

Meanwhile, I have a good affectionate supportive emotional relationship with my boyfriend...but I knew from the start “that sort” of chemistry wasn’t in it for me. We have sex, sometimes (pretty rarely actually; one of things that keeps me with him is that his sex drive is as low as mine)...but for me I've always found that sex is more performance than anything, but I never seem to really be able to access the psychological ""substance"" the performance is supposed to represent, and I've sort of lost my faith that anyone really does.

And so I keep being haunted by the question “if i don’t really think I can find, and no longer even really care about or trust, that sort of chemistry, that sort of limerence, that sort of erotic charge...why does a man make any more sense than a woman at this point?” 

And I don’t have an answer for that. My raw physical “pornographic” attractions are definitely still towards the male body and masculinity...but I’ve just totally lost the sense that that “energy” has anything to do with real life or healthy relationships anymore. It’s lost it’s connection from any romantic vision or coherent relational model, it doesn’t cut me to the core on an emotional level anymore, it’s just sort of become like a low grade itch. 

And if they’re disconnected, I’m not sure there’s any reason I couldn’t have the sort of affection I have with my current boyfriend...with a woman. And a woman would sure make a lot more sense in terms of my other dreams and goals.

But then, I know a lot of women (men and women really) are looking for “falling in love” and erotic chemistry and all this...and I totally get it as I was in love with that idea of love for a long time myself, a ""hopeless romantic."" But now I've sort of lost my faith in that (and a loss of faith is what it really feels like; like some people have concluded that the emotional intensity of religion doesn't actually ultimately point to any real higher reality...I've concluded that the fantasy of ultimate fulfillment and hyper-investment of longing society has invested in the god Sex...is a promise that isn't real, and that the emotional intensity is an illusion, and somehow I just became unplugged from that symbolic channel).  


It's not that I had a bad relationship and got burned and now am too afraid to open up. I was burned by my previous relationship, but then my current boyfriend has been a wonderful balm for that and helped me to feel so loved and worthy and special. It's more that my various little impulses and desires and fantasies around sexuality just don't line up anymore, they are contradictory such that they can't be pushed into an organic unified single vision, and I've realized that some things are just going to have to be sacrificed that can't be integrated.

565,"TW: child abuse and its consequences. Throwaway for obvious reasons. Sorry if this is confusing to read; it's not the easiest thing to write about.

When I was young, my brother, who is seven years my senior, used to molest me. It never escalated to rape as far as I remember, but it was enough to mess up my psychological development about as much as you might expect. I'm a grown woman in therapy for childhood trauma (among other things), I take a lot of meds, and I've been in and out of the mental hospital multiple times. I'm not blaming all of my issues on my brother, but I'm pretty sure he caused a whole bunch of them. In any case, I've cut off as much contact as possible and I'm perfectly happy keeping it that way.

He got married about ten years ago. He now has young children, a boy and a girl. And ever since his kids were born I've wondered if I should tell his wife about what he did.

I don't know her well and don't particularly want to get to know her, but that's not her fault. I have nothing against her. We met a few times and she was nice. She seems happy and I hope she can stay that way. She's younger than I am, which doesn't actually mean anything except that she's, I guess, technically my younger sister(-in-law), and I have strong feelings about how family members should support each other, as convoluted as those feelings become when applied here. Even if she weren't extended family, though, I would still wonder if I should tell her.

Doing so would lead to an emotional shitshow on my end. I don't think I'd wind up in the hospital again at this point -- my last hospitalization was a few years ago, and due to a change in meds I've been doing better since -- but it would definitely be bad. I never reported him partly for that exact reason. Honestly, I'd prefer to keep the whole issue between me and my therapist, but there's a reason why people go to prison, rightfully, and for a long time, for the things he's done.

Best case scenario, I'm worrying for nothing, I was just a convenient outlet for his hormones in his teens and young twenties, and he never does anything like that again. On the other hand, if something happens to one or both of his kids and I never said anything, I don't think I could ever forgive myself. I've been through enough therapy to know that it wouldn't be my fault, but I would certainly feel like I'm partly to blame.

What do I do?",09Nov2019,1

572,"Ive had a horrible ant infestation in my 9th floor apartment for over a month. I originally tried to place down traps, to try and see if I could get rid of it in the beginning but with the cold weather its just gotten so much worse.

I haven't been able to talk with my building manager because I don't know their office hours. They aren't posted anywhere, and other residents say they also don't know and it seems to change day to day. When I leave for work in the morning, its closed. When I come home from work around 5pm, its closed. The sign they hang says to call the 24 Hour Maintenance line.

I have called this line twice now. Both times, they have just taken down my number and info and said they would get back to me. But this also means I don't get a paper trail of maintenance requests, and I haven't had anybody follow up on either of my calls.

Im getting desparate. I have cats, and I can't feed them without ants swarming their food dish for the crumbs. They've taken over my coffee maker. My girlfriend and I have woken up to ants crawling across our faces and arms. I have gone to work, put down my stuff, and seen ants crawl off of it across my desk because they travel with me.

Long story short, my mom lives 1400 miles away and in order for me to get a loan or add the vehicle to her insurance she has to be present at the time of purchase in order to be listed as a co registrant. So, in order to get this car, I have to buy it outright and get my own insurance.

This means I'll be out $35,000 after my trade in, plus $350/month for insurance. This negates the cost savings of owning the Tesla.

Should I just keep my vehicle now (2016 Ford Fusion) and wait til the spring to purchase a different vehicle? I drive 500 miles a week for work. I live in New York so the weather now is the not the best for a new vehicle. Also, there are other cars I'm more interested in terms of appearance such as the Lincoln Continental. However, it's the gas savings offered by the Tesla that appeal to me.

I like his personality, how funny, his charm, hair, charisma, thoughtfulness, weird, and kind he is. I say I think he liked me by sharing some things about his past.

My husband's version is one where we get another woman into the mix and all date each other committed. Mine is having an open relationship, but still being loving one another just more freely.

I (23 m) told my girlfriend (23 F) of 6.5 years  basically everything that I said in this post and I didn’t back down at all. She kept telling me how ridiculous I was being, and that I was just too sensitive and she wasn’t being mean or she isn’t controlling. We then started to talk about how different we are, and how I’m not the put together, planning person that she has always wanted me to be and I said that I will no longer censor myself to go along with how she feels. She said her personality is just very blunt, and if I’m too sensitive for that then maybe we aren’t right for each other. Then, she said she wanted me to pack up my stuff that I have at her apartment in a bag “because we might be taking a break for a while.” 

I said that I think the solution was for us to breakup.... then she completely flipped her script. She said no we are not breaking up, it’s not happening, no way. She started unpacking the bag and I said it needs to happen and that to our core we are too different. Idk what changed in her, but she broke down and said she didn’t actually mean all of those things and she only said them because she is so embarrassed that she hurt me for all of these years. Her voice sounded very sincere but I reitterated that I think we should break up and to our core we’re different again. She said “no, opposites attract and that’s what makes us so great, give me another chance and I’ll change.” 

So I said okay we’re not broken up, but we both need to really think about this and what we want for real, and not just change our mind now spur of the moment to keep a long relationship going. 

After I left, she texted me “at the end of the day I know what I want and that’s you in my life forever. So the ball is in your court. Let me know when you are ready and want to talk.” 

I don’t know what to do or how to handle this, I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up and idk if she can really change

Tl:dr my girlfriend and I realized that we’re very different, she said that maybe we need to take a break and need time to think. When I broke up with her she refused, said she put up a wall and didn’t actually mean what she said, and asked me to give it time and not break up with her",09Nov2019,1

However, for a while now, she has gotten pretty depressed, and that is due to many reasons: she got cheated on by the same guy twice. She recently got dumped by a close friend of mine. She has moderate family issues (dad and mom occasionally fight, and there isnt a real family connection) but nothing abusive or too harmful

And as a pretty cheerful guy, I honestly can't relate exactly to what she's going through. Up till now I've mainly just made her laugh and comforted her in the dozens of times she has come to me crying or sad. However i feel that what im doing isnt helping on the long run, because its just making her less receptacle too help and happiness, and has led her to mainly just becoming sarcastic and pessimistic about her situation.

Early this year, I found a new job, and while I'm still not making much money, it's way less stressful and doesn't make me feel worthless. In short, my life is so much better, now.

I dunno. 's not that great, as far as I can tell. Anyway, (as I'm writing this sentence, at least) 30 minutes ago I was watching Explained on Netflix and learning a lot about my favourite animal, the swine flu. There's an episode about ""The Female Orgasm"", I was alone at midnight so I clicked out of curiosity. My curiosity was peaked. A few days ago I tried to figure out my sexuality by masturbating to different porn, discovered a new fluid by looking in a handheld mirror, died a little inside, and took a shower. Not being turned on by (well, anything), I wondered if maybe I could be asexual, or maybe I'm still in the immature ""eW kiSsiNg"" phase of life. I pressed play and poured myself some frosted flakes. So, these women were talking about how magical and stimulating their orgasms were, and I'm sitting there like ""huh? she squirts, takes a shower, and 'feels like a bad bitch'? I don't even squirt and I'm grossed out by fluids."". Long story short, IDK if my state of disgust with the human body is asexuality, youth, or being ""eXtrEmeLy giFteD"". I'm grossed out by secretions in general, not only sexual, but while I do have ""turn-ons"" I'm turned off by being turned on!

We've tried all solutions including asking for a break so that he can have some time apart but this pathetic cunt refuses to leave her for even a day. He accepted going on a break but then comes back within a day and starts with his melodrama again.

She's also blocked him but then he starts calling up all her friends and they in turn either start to turn on her or try to talk her into giving him another chance. He's not stable at all.

He has also threatened to leak her nudes which she had reluctantly sent on WhatsApp and threatens suicide evertime she presses for breakup. He threatens to inform her family that they've had sex which is a big deal here before marriage. Both of them are 21 btw.

I suggested going to the police but she doesn't want to get the family involved as it is a big deal to be in a relationship where I'm from and it would bring a lot of shame to the family coz she's from a very conservative background.

He also accuses her of cheating on him with me which is not true. He refuses to take responsibility of the breakup in any way and keeps shifting blame on one person or another.

615,"I’ve been noticing more and more lately over the past few months that I’ve begun to obsess and stay upset over “big mistakes” i regularly end up committing. What i mean by this, is something like breaking my expensive iPhone twice in a month (after having broken multiple iPhones in the past, breaking my Apple Watch a week ago, losing my $300 winter jacket that my mom got me after I lost my old one. These are just some of the bigger examples but this obsessiveness has translated to smaller issues as well - like forgetting to turn in an assignment. It’s problematic as i will begin by feeling crappy about what happened, but then start to ruminate about how stupid i was, how i should have learned from my past mistakes, how this just makes my life harder, etc. this then turns into hours and hours of back and forth thinking and then I end up ruining my whole day.

Then the cycle of anxiety begins where i start feeling stupid for being so obsessive but then can’t help but recognize this feeling is there for a reason.

Important to note, i have adhd and mild anxiety and am aware both of these are a factor into these negative thoughts, but I also have been regularly working on my anxiety/symptoms and the coping mechanisms that help me with my general anxiety havent translated well to situations where I fuck something up.

Anyone experienced something similar and know how to work thru this? 

For example, I’ve been crapping on myself all day about how I lost my jacket last night - I took it off at a bar (stupid me!) cuz i was a little warm (lol are you serious) and kept it next to the bartender. Well, i forgot to take it when i left and drunk me didn’t think twice about it. Now it’s gone.  Can’t afford one similar to it, and it was so nice and kept me warm and it’s all worse rn because it’s winter here and I’m gonna be constantly cold without it.

I guess as background I'll start with the fact that for the three years of high school, starting sophomore year, I was in love with graphic design, and creating things in general. I took three years of courses on it and took a school-to-work job for a semester at a print shop (basically manual screenprinting, laser-engraving, sign printing, etc.) . after studying at college for a semester I realized that I wouldn't get enough money to support myself and my family. I plan on marrying my boyfriend of 3 years and he is set on becoming a high school teacher, which unfortunately does not yield much pay as of now. Anyway, after this realization, I decided that I needed to change majors, so I am now in an Accounting major. I am good at math, I like puzzles and logic, so it seems like a good fit.

But I can't shake the feeling that I'm going to regret it. I know that I need something that utilizes my creative side and one of my favorite things is making people happy about themselves. So about a year ago, I tried my hand at dress design (just wedding and prom, basic things) because I remember the feeling of wearing my first prom dress and just feeling so happy and confident with my body and myself. (this is a rare occurrence btw.) But I know that unless you're the best of the best, you won't get noticed. and in order to generate some income, you have to be noticed. 

I suppose what I'm trying to communicate is that my fears, (not being good enough, failure, and financial stability) are getting in the way of what I want to do. I'm scared to fail at what I'm passionate about, so I took the safer route. But I'm afraid the safer route will leave me unfulfilled.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate any and all advice you guys have, thanks.",09Nov2019,1
619,"I don’t know what to do and I seriously don’t want to go to anybody I know in real life about this because I’ll be so embarrassed. 

I am a girl who got a phone way too early (seven years old) and came across explicit content when I was eight. It was a video of girl stripping. At the time I didn’t know what I was doing, but I felt tension in between my thighs and accidentally kind of masturbated. 

For the next four years I began watching porn and masturbating more often. Maybe a few times a week. Over the course of those four years, I refused to watch any porn with men in it. I just wasn’t very attracted to men and would only watch lesbian porn.  

When I turned twelve, I began looking at porn with men and women in it and liked it more than I did when I was younger. 

Now, I don’t know what my past actions say about my sexuality. I can sort of see myself in a relationship with a woman and I can definitely see myself in a relationship with a man.

Yes I know it’s seriously fucked up that an eight year old girl was looking at porn and masturbating. I didn’t have anybody monitoring what I was doing on my iPhone 4S. Also I was a super early bloomer and pubic hair growing at age seven, breasts developing at age nine, and a super regular period at age ten.

623,"I’m unsure what all to include and what not to include to help you guys help me. I apologize in advance for any lack of information.

Me and my 2 roommates (All 20M) are all long time friends. Our fourth roommate, let’s call him J, is new to our friend circle but his egocentric personality is withering down all of our patience towards him. One of my roommates (19M), let’s call him K, vouched for him to room with us last year but didn’t realize the how problematic J could be until it was too late.

Things that J does:

-Constantly talks about himself or tries to prove himself to others in conversation (Brags about the littlest things that are overall insignificant such as what my 10 y.o brother does to me, but J is not 10 y.o)

-Belittles K (who knows J the most and closest to him in the apartment) to elevate himself in front of others

-Can never be wrong or act like he lost. Finds the littlest thing to celebrate victory (not in terms of self-improvement)

-Always makes things a competition, even when it’s clear that everyone is just trying to have fun and enjoy themselves

-Can’t be proven wrong or criticized without being pouty afterwards and killing the vibe

To give context though, K has had a very rough childhood and was abused terribly as a child which probably stems his toxic personality. J told me and my other roommate this during one of our small vents about him which we do occasionally to keep our sanity rather than develop resentment. All of us do not want to be resentful towards J, but our patience is dwindling. Although he has the biggest ego of everyone I know, it is also the most fragile. Therefore, we can’t directly address these feelings towards J or he will most likely get depressed and kill himself. 

He is a kind person for sure and likes everyone to be included whenever we are with friends, but his lack of clear social cues and his berating and competitive personality is not only affecting mine and my roommates’ mental health, but also multiple friends outside the apartment. It’s much harder to enjoy many things with J than when we were doing stuff without him before. 

There are so many other things to say about this situation that I can include (My roommates and I had a 4 hour long venting session last night of him) but I think I covered the core problems. How can we approach the situation to cultivate his behavior into something more acceptable to not only keep the sanity at the apartment, but also not scare off our friends?",09Nov2019,1

626,"In April, myself (22F) and my boyfriend (23) went through a rough patch where, behind my back, he was speaking to another girl in his insta DM’s and on Snapchat. I found this out in August. This has caused a lot of distrust on my end, especially because he almost broke up with me in early April over what a friend of mine (who was also once an ex) told him about his attempt to diagnose me with bipolar based off of our past together. Now my boyfriend and I are suffering the consequences today. For the past few days he has said he does not deserve the anger and frustration I have been giving him. In my head, I always saw it as being upset for him doing what he did and I tried my best to overlook it and still keep us happy. Of course, that was in my head. On the outside, I manifested these feelings into constantly expressing that I could leave and go home from our apartment so he doesn’t need to deal with me. I would tell him I could sleep in my car after an argument so he wouldn’t need to see me. And on top of that (looking back it makes me cringe at how I act during these moments) I would claim that how he called me “his person” for so many months was just exactly what he called his ex as I saw in a previous text he wrote her a year ago so I couldn’t be anything special. There is more that leads from my atrocious behavior, but now he has told me that he’s spoken with other people about our relationship and they have told him that he should break up with me. On top of that, my friends that I introduced him to that encouraged he break up with me in April are who he wants to spend all his time with now.

I’m a nervous wreck, and he said he wants to try and see if we can be happy again, but I’m terrified as well that it’s too late. How can I apologize to him in a genuine way so that he knows I mean it? I’ve never been good with apologizing and always feel awkward doing it, but I want him to know that by my holding onto the past I may have let it affect us then but I certainly will not from this point forth. I do have jealousy issues and I know he does to at some moments, but my jealousy of how he acts around these friends I introduced him to has now ended the friendship between me and them, and my boyfriend still maintaining his friendship with them and claiming they are some of his best friends.

He and I are going to speak tonight when I get home from work, but any pointers on apologies or overall whether I should just let him go to be himself after all I’ve put him through would be helpful. This is some of the worst anxiety I’ve ever experienced at the thought of losing him, but I don’t know if I can take his heart being pure enough to say he wants us to be together when inside he says he’s numb and just wants to be happy again. Part of me feels like he is afraid to let me go in the fear that I will hurt myself.",09Nov2019,1

So i was/am seeing a girl from my school who i met about a year ago at a school party. After the party we slowly started texting with on and offs. At one point we met, went to see a movie. Texts were flirty and so on. Everything seemed to be fine between us.  
 Then at one point when we had hung out more, she said she likes me a lot and so i brought up topic about becoming official in the future. Then couple of days later she texted me that she isnt ready for a commitment yet. She said relationship is a very serious thing and she isnt ready for it now and needs more time to become comfortable with me, which I completely understand.  She said we are going to be friends at the moment. 
It was a huge shock to me and i dont know how i should proceed now, because i really had feelings for her.

So for the longest time I struggled with my weight. I was at about 200lb (I’m only 5’5 tall) and my doctor said I was very close to becoming diabetic. This really scared me and I decided to make a big change in my life. It’s been a year now since I made that decision and I’m down to 150lb. I’m now a lot more active and I have a new love for running and going to the gym. I recently ran my first half marathon, something I never thought I could have done. 

This past year my wife has also expressed her desire to lose weight, but I don’t think she is taking it too seriously because of the way she continues to eat. She has also wanted to express her desire to have a baby, but I’m afraid to have a baby now if we are not committed to make a change in the way we eat. I think our eating habits it’s more like emotional eating.  I don’t mean that we have to always eat healthy, we can enjoy a meal out, but we were at a bad point in our life eating out for every single meal.

I really don’t want to hurt her and I don’t want to say something like you are overweight and we need to change the way we eat before we have a child. Also, this is definitely not something I want because of physical appearance, but because of our health. I’m very worried about her health the way I was about mine.

I need some advice on how to express this to her. I feel like any time I bring up this subject she just rolls her eyes and gets mad, but then she complains about not being able to eat and how her clothes don’t fit anymore and it hurts me because I want her to be happy and feel better.

646,"My behaviour has been really unusual recently, I'd appreciate an opinion from a third party

Apologies if any of this is a mess/doesnt make sense, I’m pretty confused with what I’m going through at the moment

So some background info about me: I’ve lived a lonely life. My childhood involved a lot of verbal abuse, and it affected my school life as well. I have felt neglect from when I was around 8/9, up until I turned 19/20 (since the beginning of last year) and since then I’ve been doing better (family wise/making friends) but I think it’s affected me mentally, especially with relationships (friendships, even)

Almost all of my relationships (4/5) have been LDR. And I’ve been pretty okay with it, but lately I’ve noticed that in the past 5 years, I’ve jumped from one LDR to the next within a month of each other. In all my other LDRs, it was either they broke up with me because of distance (like being in a different country), or my partner was going through mental health challenges. But in my last LDR, I ended it right before a visit, and immedately regretted it, almost like it was “right person wrong time” sort of thing, but it was so strange to me for some reason…I was so into them, I really wanted to visit, the only things holding me back were my slight fear of flying, and despite there being no end date we were willing to go do a semester of school at the other’s university, but I just ended it after a stressful day out of nowhere, but perhaps it was for the best? I still think about him constantly, and I'm so mad at myself for not going over there anyway, but now I think his family just hates me for it. Even though I feel like I might love the idea of him, I can't help but think I really fucked up. I think a big reason why I love LDRs is that I get to travel and explore and leave my city. But he was younger than me, and I was his first relationship and he's not even halfway done university, which also makes me fearful that he wanted to be with me because he doesn't really know other girls.

It leads me to believe that I’m dating for the sake of not feeling alone, but in addition to that, I feel scared of commitment. It’s almost like I can’t trust myself when it comes to dating. It’s not like I go for the next guy I’m slightly interested in, I genuinely like them, but I usually get bored after a while or I get scared. Even with friends, despite having some decent friends at the moment I’m just so tempted to go out and find new friends, even though its an endless cycle. The one guy I dated in person was super into me...if I was sad he would go above and beyond when It came to taking care of me, and I really liked him back, but it felt like I wasn't 100% invested despite how much he did for me. Looking back, it makes me feel like I have depression, because anyone would kill to have someone like that as a partner.

Has anyone dealt with this and got through it? Any advice would be appreciated…I will be seeing a counsellor again in the next couple of weeks. I’ve done screening tests for anxiety/depression/ptsd and got pretty high scores, but the waitlist to see a psychiatrist is over 8 months long. I feel like I'm losing my mind because I'm also working full-time while in university and its stressing me out so much, I can hardly think what's right/wrong. Usually I'm a pretty happy/kind person as well, but my recent behaviour says otherwise.

tl;dr possibly too depressed/lonely for a relationship, and have ended some decent relationships because of it. Not sure how I should go about improving myself.",09Nov2019,1

Dan is a fast mouthed and funny but a foul hearted dude who used to bring out the worst in me but was a unique dude. Now me and Dan last year used to be close as hell, we had construction and oceanography together, we would mostly bond with us saying edgy shit either in general or towards each other and mess around in the group, yknow just every day shit but now in senior year I don't really see.him even close to a friend anymore. The small banter towards each other turned into harsh one sided verbal bullying and we don't ever bond at all when he's around. All he does is just talk shit and rip on me for everything and get immensely into it for no reason and essentially verbally breaks me down. I'm sure he's just going through something and is just using me as an easy target to let his anger out on because im a passive easygoing man who's 5'9 and 165lbs and this dude is 5'11 and probably over 300 pounds with half of it in muscle. Now I ain't the type to be scared of getting my ass kicked, no man really scares me and I'll throw hands if i have to even if i have little experience and the odds of getting my ass kicked stacked against me because I'm not no bitch but the thing that's stopping me is that we share Construction 2 together and the teacher said if i pass construction 2 he could find me an internship somewhere and having some immediate money like that is needed in my situation because i have a daughter I need to feed (ik a daughter at 17 tell me about it) but i fear that if this dude snips my last nerve and i end up fighting him that I'm gonna get kicked out of that class and lose that opportunity and Ive already took the steps to avoid it (staying with that group less and going to a different one, staying out from his vicinity as much as i can in class, etc) but he's said and done some evil ass shit to me and im growing tired of it and I wanna put his fat ass in his fucking place. So I guess the question I'm asking here is if anyone knows a really good way to knock this ego tripping shit stain down to size without it ending in me losing the only class I have an A in and throwing hands (ik it hurts to say but there's a chance that it'll worsen his act and i don't want any chance of that).

The doctors do really know what to do and think it is caused by her multiple concussions and a med mixup (she accidentally  took too much of her depression meds the first time this happened, we don’t know what she took the second time, and this latest time she didn’t take her sleeping meds and had been drinking). We aren’t really sure what exactly is going on with her but it is really worrying (the first incident lasted a week and the second was two weeks and this latest incident has been going on for a month now and she doesn’t seem to be getting better). She is confused and can’t remember anything and now she has started to blame us for everything. I am really stressed out because I am the only person in the family she will take meds from. I am a senior in high school and trying to apply to colleges and am taking some high level classes this year so I am already pretty stressed with school. I am also trying to understand my sexuality and how I can be a Christian and keep my religion and still be bi. My sister is also acting up and going through her rebellious phase I guess (she leaves and we aren’t able to find her for a couple hours and we are pretty sure her friends are drinking and vaping). I am barely able to hold it together. How should I handle all this? How can I help my mother? How do I get my sister to trust me? What can I do to stop breaking down in the guidance councilor’s office every time I run into a little problem with school or college admissions. I have been thinking about staying home from school to help my dad watch my mom but I don’t want my grades to go down. What am I supposed to do?",09Nov2019,1
660,"As a 20 year old woman the stigma of being autistic follows me everywhere, but I don’t suffer from any symptoms of autism or feel like I have it. Since autism diagnoses are based solely on what the parent reports, my narcissistic mother was able to easily have me diagnosed when I was about 7 or 8. She told all her friends and family and I feel like there is absolutely nothing I can say to anyone to get them to treat me like a normal person because by extension almost everyone in my life sees me as autistic. Also, she didn’t tell me about the diagnosis or even mention autism until after i was 18, but i’ve seen the documents and it’s all legitimate. It was one of the most painful moments of my life to learn that my little sister (who I always tried to be a role model and teacher and parental figure to since our parents are clearly very shitty) was told I wasn’t normal and ordered to keep all of this a secret from me. All of my accomplishments mean nothing to my family because they just don’t take me seriously, it seems like they have already disregarded me as a failure even though I graduated high school a year early, I’m working on transferring to a university from community college, and I’ve had two amazing jobs in my field of study (biotechnology) which is more than many people my age can say. In the last year I have become really stressed about social interactions because I want to seem as normal as possible to prove all this wrong but it’s truly miserable. I try my best to sound mature, intelligent, and professional, but it’s not how I like to act at all. My personality has completely changed and I hate the person I’ve become, I’m way quieter now and a lot more judgmental of others and I miss not caring what most people thought of me. I don’t know what to do. I can’t get over this because it follows me everywhere. I hate my mom and I can never forgive her for this. I really just wanted to write out a brief version of the story and ask for advice. Any insight would be appreciated, I’m just frustrated with the way I’ve been treated all my life and I don’t know how to change it.",09Nov2019,1
661,"I live with my brother. My parents have passed away. The house is in my brother’s name. My brother has always played mind games with me. My father would intervene in most of the times until he passed away two years ago. I’ve been an easy target for my brother. He treats me like a dog. He controls my every move.

Few weeks ago, a recruiter connected with me on LinkedIn. They are a company in Europe and were offering to help relocate. They were giving me a decent salary also.

I really wanted this job because it would finally mean, escaping completely from my brother’s influence and lead a happy life of my own. The recruiter set up a meeting and called me on my cell. I told my brother that I needed the living room for an important work call. He left the room. I had a call with the recruiter and the job sounded great. They looked like they were ready to hire me. I noticed my brother moving about near the living room. I suspected he was listening in to my conversation. I didn’t think much of it. Knowing him I knew he was going to interfere and decided to keep this from him.

There was an online test and I took it. I passed the test. The next was a video interview call over skype. I couldn’t take the video call from work because they would know that I’m interviewing elsewhere and I hadn’t resigned yet. Two days prior to the interview I told my brother that I have an important work call and would need the living room. (It’s a small house and I sleep in the living room. )

My brother told me he won’t be home and will be at the movies. When I came home at the day of the interview, he was there at home. He had canceled his plans. My interview was about to start and the plumber came. I’ve been dealing with anxiety and my brother knows this. He knows I get flustered very soon. I was worried there would be a lot of background noise or the WiFi won’t work or unforeseen interruptions. And then the plumber was home doing his business making all the noise of metal and talking loudly. I became very anxious. I changed my computer setup location three times to get in a place where I could have the call. But, I had descended into that anxious state and couldn’t speak well at the interview. I was rejected.

I started to think why that plumber had to come on the same time of my interview. Yesterday I saw an email on my mobile that was delivered as read. I checked and account was being accessed from the home computer. I pulled up the event logs to see when my account had been logged on. I found out my account was logged on several times when I was at work. There was also a login on the day of my interview at a time which I remember I had not logged on. My brother has somehow figured out my password and has been logging in my account and reading my emails. I took a forensics course so I know that it was a manual screen logon and someone physically typed in the password. 

I confronted him about it. He outright denied all the allegations. He said I should stop using his computer and leave the house if I’m worried about my privacy. I told him I’ll be reporting all the mental harassment over the years to the police, at which he stormed out and locked himself in the bedroom. 

I’ve threatened him with legal action and knowing my brother, there will be consequences. My current job doesn’t pay me enough for me to live on my own. I’ve been depressed a long time and don’t see a way out if opportunities (like my recent job offer) will continue to be squandered away. I’ve had suicidal thoughts quite frequently now. Please advise my way out of this.

TL;DR: brother secretly spied on my email and spoiled my  job interview, that could have changed my life",09Nov2019,1
662,"About 2 months ago me and a group of friends (about 10 people) took homecoming pictures together. Afterwards one of my friends took pictures with just a few of our friends, (4 girls) and I wasn't in them, but I was in the back. I looked over at the camera briefly.

My friend posted the picture, and I look weird in the back, like I look jealous or something. I didn't mean to look like that but I just do and it bothers me, I don't want people seeing the picture and thinking that. It just makes me look bad.

It bothers me that she chose to post that picture even though I know she had pictures where I wasn't looking in the background. 

I commented on the post ""I was gonna join in on the first pic but it was too late :("" and she didn't respond, just liked my comment

And I just sent her the post and said ""I look so bad in this!"" but she didn't respond, just liked my text... what the heck.

667,"So I'm a 15 y/o girl, sophomore in high school who has a friend group that we call the ""Spook Troop"". We were ""founded"" on Halloween this year to watch spooky movies and just chill. Well, we held this 'spook troop recruit' at my friends (who we'll call), Sarah and Anna's house. Well, Sarah and Anna have a brother named Alex (not his real name). He goes to school with us (i think he's a senior this year). 

The first time the troop had a get together, Alex just kinda minded his own and watched some of the movies with us (to which he screamed 'hell naw' and ran upstairs bc a movie showed mangle titties....i mean mood but yeah). Well, last night we had our second ever recruit and my mom worked til 12am so I ended up spending the night. Alex wasn't there bc he had to work.
The night was great and we all had fun. After everyone left, me and Anna stayed up talking tea and how her brothers were man-hoes, as she put it. It was great.

Then the morning came. Anna had to go to work at 12pm so i text my mom and told her to pick me up at 11. Mom said she would and Anna left me in her room to jump in the shower. Eventually, Anna and Sarah's step-dad came down to tell us that we could go up to get some cereal if we wanted, and I happily took the offer. 

Grabbed my backpack, charger, glasses, etc. and made my way upstairs. I was alone for a moment until I heard Anna's step-dad and Alex coming up the stairs. I was pretty happy because I needed to know where the bowls were. 

This is where it's kinda uncomfortable for me.

So their step-dad happily shows me where the bowls are, but as this is happening, Alex passes by me and under his breath says ""she's kinda cute though"". 
I know this sounds like me being like ""WHAT? a BoY tRyInG tO mAke kNoWn hIs fEeLiNgs?? FoR ME? EWWW! MEN ARE P I G S."" But it was kinda the energy behind it and also the fact that Anna said he was a man-hoe???  

I'm kind of embarrassed to say something to Sarah or Anna bc I don't want them to think I'm just making something up or being dramatic? They aren't like that but I'm still scared. I don't know how to address it or if at all. 


TL;DR:

My friend group had another movie night at one of the friends' house, and since my mom worked late I just stayed the night. The next morning when the friends' dad was showing me where the bowls were, the brother of those friends passed me and said ""she kinda cute tho"". Reason for that making me uncomfortable above.",09Nov2019,1
668,"Okay so I have a problem at this point in my life and I honestly don't know what to do at all. My problem is I don't know which path to take: a serious one or a happy one. I know I can take science and math seriously. If I were to pick a typical steady normal person sit down job, I think being a chemical engineer is the best idea. I can take it very seriously and figure out complex problems through hard work, and am very good at math and science, at least comparing my performance on math and science to 90% of my grade of about 400. I am very intense, and in my college recommendation, a teacher said I am a very intense person in conversation, in my actions, and in the classroom. I have intensity I can bring to a lot of things. This intensity, however, does not make the serious things in life enjoyable. I could be a run, and do chemical engineering for a living, but true enjoyment is me being random. I used to think I wanted to be a writer, a director, an actor, but I couldn't take any of those things seriously and couldn't get better than pure beginner. Chemistry and algebra/calculus, and my time on my schools track team has shown me a sport I can Excel at, as I was borderline varsity material at the start of my junior year of high school( I'm a senior now) and I had never had so much success in a sport prior to sprinting where I ran a 13.0  s, 100 meter dash ( varsity numbers around high twelve's at my school) .  However, I decided to not do track because I didn't know if that's what I really wanted to be. I still don't know if I really want to be a locked in person.  I can be productive and successful, but I despise it and prefer to thrill seek and join new projects. Every new routine I start soon falls apart as that lifestyle brings no enjoyment. I have yet to balance fun and productivity, preferring to remove one from my life for blocks of time. I don't know where to go from here.

671,"I'm gonna be kinda rambling/venting, (I do have a problem, and I think context will help you understand where I'm at in my head, but if it doesnt just skip to the end,) so this might not be super comprehendable, but fuck it. I really like this girl and for minutes at a time I would stare at a text just basically saying ""Do you wanna go on a date?""

She had to take the ACT and I also forget to reply to messages that I wake up to, so I was pretty ok with it, even though it hurt too. So I vent a little to one of my friends during lunch and she finishes her test and texts me: ""Hey sorry for not texting you sooner, and idk rn.... PS: Dont send your friends after me next time plz!"" Apparently friend texted her and said basically ""Fuck you for ghosting him."" And said this exact quote ""I'm doing this on his behalf,"" which makes it sound like I told her to. Which I didnt. So gonna shorten this.

Today I unsent the last message from the chat (which was from Thursday), and she got a notification about it. Which was another awkward conversation. 

I want to keep being friends with her, and I think my personal awkwardness is coming from the fact i have things i still I wanna say to her.

674,"I know some people say they'd rather have no friends than have ones that aren't positive, but in my case I disagree. I crave people's company and in especially in having experiences, i.e. going bowling, the movies, ice skating - these aren't things I'd enjoy doing myself. And if I don't have close friends to do them with then I'm gonna miss out on a lot of things, and the social aspect of my life outside of college and work.

When I was in high school I was very shy and had a lot of anxiety (still kind of do but much better now) so I only managed to make about 2 close friends (and 2 other friends that I hang out with occasionally) that I took eith me to college. 

Close friend A has a lot of awesome aspects to her but also a lot of negative ones. She's really insecure and so she always tries to put me down. I'm not saying this at all to be arrogant, but I'm much smarter than her academically, have a much nicer body than hers, etc .. and so she makes fun of me at every opportunity, such as that I'm dumb, or my boobs are too small, etc, even though I have done nothing but compliment her, and I NEVER brag about myself. I confronted her about this before and while she does this less now it still hasn't stopped.

She also treats me differently when other people are around. Suddenly I go from being her best friend (she says me and another girl are her 2 best friends) to being a 3rd wheel. The making fun of me thing also increases when other people are around, like she does it to be funny or something. At this point I feel like she makes me more upset than she makes me happy.

Close friend B is a great person with a kind heart, she never actually does anything to make me upset. My issues with her? She never contacts me first. I always have to initiate hang outs, checking up on the other person. She says that she does with everyone, not just me (which I do believe because her other friends have complained too), that she has too much going on. Yeah well, so does everyone else. I go to college full time, work part time, am a member of many college clubs and still manage to make time for the people I care about. She goes to college full time, doesn't do anything else, and while I do understand that she has more of an introverted personality, I can't help but feel that if she really did care about me (and her other friends) she could at the minimum just text us to see how we're doing. I've brought this issue up with her multiple times but nothing changes.

I'm just tired of putting them first and not getting it back. It hurts. I've been sad since yesterday and cried a few times because I went to a party with friend A and she barely hung out with me. She treated me more like a classmate than a best friend. I'd go up to her a few times while dancing but she'd end up leaving me like a minute later to dance with someone else. It really hurts to see your ""best friend"" of 5 years putting other people before you.

My issue is though I don't have anyone else, other than the more casual friends I hang out with. occasionally.  My university is mostly a commuter college so people just go to class and then leave. The social aspect sucks. It's not easy making friends (this is a common complaint at my university). Even when I'm volunteering at events, it's not that easy finding someone who could potentially be a really close friend, only casual friends you might hang out with every now and then. For the most part everyone already has their close friends from high school.

I just want a close friend, literally just 1, that puts me first like I do for them. I don't think I'm anyone's 1st (except my family). 

*tldr; my close friends bring more negativity to my life than positivity, but without them I'll have no one else and so I'm hesitant about keeping them out of my life.*

679,"A friend of my best friend is having her birthday tonight. She and I aren't close but we've known each other for a few years, and we only hangout when I go out with my best friend and we are partying. We never talk, and the extent of our communication is her inviting me to her birthday party tonight about two weeks ago, and sending a massive snapchat to everyone as a reminder. Her invitation is more of a courtesy IMO, she knows I'm always with my best friend and wants me to know I'm welcome. I don't think she cares if I'm there or not. It was very kind of her to text me and she's always been super welcoming even though I'm not a real part of the ""group"". She didn't come to my birthday, just saw me at the club and stopped by for a few minutes. 

Note: I don't really like going out with my best friend's friends. I'm always uncomfortable because they're not really MY friends, but I do frequently go with them for convenience and when I want to party. They're nice I guess, but not who'd I'd choose as my own friends. 

Twoish months ago I started dating a boy. My best friend really dislikes that him and I are together and hates his friends, for valid reasons. They went to high school together and his friends were assholes to her. Her and my boyfriend were always on good terms though, she is just bothered that I'm around his friends whom she doesn't like. My best friend and my relationship has been strained for months, it's extremely complicated but long story short we aren't as close as we used to be and she hasn't been very kind to me -- most say ""very mean"". I honestly get scared of her sometimes, which I know is NOT normal.

I don't get to see my boyfriend very much, maybe twice a week, because he's studying for his CFA exam. I made plans with him to hang out tonight, with the thought I'd get out of the party by saying I'm staying in and don't want to go out tonight. This would still irritate my best friend, but it would be fine to deal with. 

Here's the problem: My boyfriend just found out his best friend from high school is visiting and his friends are going out for it tonight. He really wants to go and really wants me to meet his best friend before they go home tomorrow. BUT if i go out tonight, I'm ditching the birthday to be around people my best friend really doesn't like and the boy she's mad I'm dating. At least if I stayed in it wouldn't look as rude, I guess? I hate confrontation with her so I try to avoid it at all costs... 

Honestly, I don't think the birthday girl would care and I don't feel that bad in that aspect. I'm worried my best friend will be really mean about it and make me feel guilty, and I don't know if I should feel guilty? It'd go something like this: ""She has always been so nice to you and you're ditching her BIRTHDAY for a boy you've know for two months?? She invited you, I can't believe you'd do that, you're becoming a really shitty person"" etc.

681,"So, for some more information. I live in Belgium, and school isn't ""incredibly"" expensive here, although, of course, it does cost money. In 2018 I graduated high school, and then went to a university for one year. After that year, I thought I had problems with the school itself (deadlines being changed, teachers not being correct in multiple ways) so I told my dad (mum's out of the picture) I wanted to switch schools. He said it was fine, then I started going to a more expensive university in 2019. I've been there for two months now and have realized that it wasn't the school specifically I had problems with, but rather school in general. I've been working as a freelance artist, as well as have published one book, so I know what I'd rather be doing with my time, and I know I can make money with it (even if it's not as much as I would like). But now the thing is, how do I tell my dad, who's been paying for university and everything that comes with it, that he's been paying for nothing for two years?

682,"So I asked a girl out that I really like. She said no, which is fine with me, but I still wanna be friends with her. I think she is on the same page, but for now I'm still like very awkward when I'm around her and kinda sad when I think about her. I think/hope that is coming from the fact I have some stuff I still wanna say to her, but just a lot of awkwardness y'know, being a high schooler. So how do I approach saying ""Hey, I wanna talk more about feelings,"" without coming across like I'm pressuring her into going out with me and with as little awkwardness as possible.

684,"I’ve been talking to a girl for about a year now [M15][F14]  at first I was the one to catch feelings for her and eventually told her how I felt and In no surprise I got reject but we kept talking (during the whole time I’ve known her we would talk bout a lot of sexual stuff and acted that way to one another for months) about 3 months after I asked her out we stopped talking because her mom found out we were talking and I guess she didn’t like me so during that time you can imagine I was pretty depressed because at that point she was everything to me and there was nothing I wouldn’t do and for her just to leave me out of no where and not tell me why she left destroyed me. But I picked myself (I was overweight at this point as well) started working out and dieting improving myself to be a better person so fast forward 3 more months I went from being 240 pounds to 160.  After all this I started my freshman year in high school as a new person I come to school see some of my old friends and then yup I see her and she sees me we both had that look on our faces like should we say hey or something along those lines. A month into school I eventually had the courage to talk to her and ask her why she just left me like she did to my surprise she explained it all and said that she never wanted to leave and it wasn’t her choice to leave and that she had been depressed even more than she already was and that she missed me . We start talking again everything is good we’re fine we start pretending like we were a couple even though i had a feeling we weren’t after being rejected but we always had acted like we were together so I just took it as it was. About a month later we start acting and talking about sexual subjects again so I though oh so I guess we are friends with benefits but never asked if we were. A few weeks go by and we had one of those nights again and out of no where she starts talking about other guys and ofc I didn’t like that so I decide to tell her I was going to sleep and that was it after that night we completely stop talking and during the time we weren’t talking I was told by a friend that she was talking shit behind my back and saying a lot of stuff I once again found the confidence to ask her what happened but she didn’t give me an answer and that’s where we are now . I don’t know if she’s ready to have a relationship we both act like we are a couple every time we are asked if we went out she would always be first to answer by answering with a question and avoiding the question if we were together I tried asking her if we could talk and try and solve problems like: what even are we at this point, why do you keep leaving without a reason(she left about 3 times) before this, do you rlly see us being together having a family like we talked about , should we just completely stop talking to each other if it’s not working, I just rlly don’t know what to do and it’s honestly stressing me so much I’m trying to be the more mature person and try solving our problems and clearing things up but she hasn’t responded back to my text asking if she had time to talk (it’s been 12hours) I just want sum advice on what to do.

687,"So basically me and my friends went for a night out and one of them had some cannabis on him so we all smoked and got high, one of my friends let’s call him josh never smoked before. When Josh had a few puffs he felt sick so he sat down on the street and couldn’t get up and didn’t want to talk or anything he just sat there saying he is dizzy, tired and he can’t move, even to the taxi, which is like 5 mins walk. So all our friends left him (about 8) except me I stayed with him bought him water and stayed sat for like 2 hours. While we wear sat he said 

“I beg you forgive me, I’m a really bad friend to you, I always talk sh*t about you behind your back (at home, to our friend, at school), because I’m jealous of how you have better clothes than me and how my dad compares me to you (grades etc). Don’t ever trust me I’m a bad friend”

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing as he is one of my best friends, I dropped him off at one of our friend's house he slept the night. And left in the morning he called me and was crying in regret asking me what he said last night (he could only remember a small part) I said “don’t worry about it and I know it’s not true” but deep down I’m really upset as the last couple months he’s been trying to make fun of me in every situation, but I can take jokes so I didn’t really pay attention but now that I know it was caused by jealousy I really don’t know what to do.

694,"Hello, everyone. I am 21 years old male and currently going the college. I need your help. Let me explain the situation i rented a house in my name and i really worked hard on this house like finding house with my family (looked over 30+ houses), meeting landlord , making  the gas,water and electricity contract ect.. I love cleaning the house and doing house chores, i am tidy person who loves clean house. In the other hand my both roommates does not love that side of me. I own the most of the Furniture in the house even their beds when i moved to the house i bought the all furniture from last resident of the house so i paid almost like 1500 in our currency and added new fridge (second hand but a good one). In my class i had 2 people willing move in  with me. I told them i am tidy person if i see a trash or anything thats not clean i will tell you guys to clean it, use the utensils well and dont distrub the neighbours other than thats it use it like your house. 

Lets dive in the real problem at first i was ok with them i gave them time get used to my life style like taking out trash , cleaning the house washing dishes. It seemed to me that everthing is going ok. After i went to my hometown for summer break (we have 3 month summer break) one of my roommates has issues with his family so he stayed in the house on summer lets call him A, my other friend lost his only parent his dad so he stayed too Lets call him B. Turns out b has some relatives in his hometown so he leaves house after one month. B in the other hand does not leave the house. In the Middle of summer landlord contacted me and said wanted us out so i told my friends about this and i said 'please help me with this its urgent or we are homeless.'. -PS Before i leaved the house  i told them turn off gas,water and electricity if their is no one at home and told them to left a clean house.- All the sudden A got sick and left home. When i came back the house with my family kitchen was teribble my mom threw up after cleaning the kitchen. Gas, Water and Electricity was open. I got mad tried to explained myself to them. They said nothing other than bs. They couldnt come to help me finding a new house and moving it. I get the b cause he is short on money and he cant come but A? he got sick what a timing. After long debate they agreed they will clean the house and help me if anything happens. So in the end i find the house and talked with the lanlord for giving us time to move our stuff which is he agreed. End of the summer they came we moved the house but i had to come twice where i study becuase of this and my father easily made 1300$ expanses like gas for the car and food ect.. Now i am 2 month in college autumn season and still having the same problems. B does not clean his trash i do it after him said million times. If dont say B to clean his trash he will not clean it. Lets come to A he is a mess forgets everything i mean *everthing.* When i say please clean this part of the house it is your part i cleaned the bathroom he says ok but he will not do it.  By time passes i had enough and started be more lets just say passive aggresive and annoying. This is where it all went south i am tired of this i want them out of my house immediatly but one side of me says it is middle of the college season where they are going to live?. They are complaining about me being annoying at saying things over and over again for them ' i need to be more polite' and be more 'relax'. I hate to say it but they kinda right about me but i do not like dirty house and it just my personality. I told them about this they said no worries we will get along  so i let them in my house.

 So what should i do?  I  am in a dilemma. Should i try to talk with them once more about this problem and trying fix all together? Or Should i just end it all and tell them to leave the house?

Please forgive me about the grammar mistakes. English is not my mother language.",09Nov2019,1
695,"This girl I used to be friends with all of a sudden just hates me? She unadded me  and blocked me and is all in all just mean to me now. The only reason I think might be happening is because I told her she was wrong when she was wrong. We've gotten into fights in the past that are usually a result of her being awful to me for example, She told me that I was an awful person because I ""lead"" my ex boyfriend on and only said negative things about him even though he was abusive and had sexually abused me on one occasion followed by all of the emotional abuse that he done to me (guilt tripping me for not spending all my time with him, making me feel bad if I didn't want to cuddle/makeout 24/7, him cheating, him letting his friends mistreat me, etc). She also said that I was over-dramatic and I should be able to control my depression and anxiety and that she was mad that some days I'd just need to be quiet and keep to myself, She said I was selfish for asking my friends for rides even though my mother can't drive and my dad works 12-14 hours a day and I myself can't drive (I'm 16), etc. I wish I didn't forgive her because she even turned my friend on me and she said the reasons she gave were good reasons (I introduced them and he had a crush on her and now they're dating) and she basically made my life a living hell. Fast forward now and we were driving home from a rehearsal when me and her were talking and I told her I personally didn't think this one person (my ex surprise surprise) was that good of a drum major when looked at in a profession view point (I had my reasons) and she yelled at me saying that I act like I can do better when I can't and I just simply told her ""I never said I could do better I'm looking at this from a in comparison view point"" and then she said something incorrect about drumline so I corrected her and so did her boyfriend and she got pissy and then we moved on to the topic of members in our band and she claimed she always had to tell this one kid in my section to do this and that right and he would only listen her and she always had to separate this two guys from arguing all the time.. both of them were in my section and we hardly ever worked with the winds and all in all she said she always had to deal with them when in reality she hardly did so I called her out because it offended me considering 1. they both had autism and she was being really rude about it 2. She played it out like I never dealt with then even though i was in their section. Fast forward a few months and we're in a group chat and my friend suggests we change something and I agree and she only calls me annoying and everyone kind of calls her out and so she gets mad and leaves and then joins back and acts like nothing happened no apology or anything and after our finals she posts a photo tagging everyone (including my closest friend who hates her and she never talks to) but doesn't tag me? it's just annoying because she tried making me out to be the bad guy in that group chat when I clearly wasn't and has just been talking behind my back. So I guess just help me out? why does she hate me and what do I do? (don't really want her as a friend after this)",09Nov2019,1

697,"A few weeks ago, news of my dad possibly having a child from another woman came about. He has a history of drinking and cheating on my mom, but they're still together. 

Each time this happens, mom stops talking to him for some time (a few weeks usually), my sister's reaction varies (ignoring him or barely talking to him) and I always pretend everything was fine. I was always the neutral ground. Because of this, my parents often relayed messages to each other through me.

I'll admit it, I'm closer to my dad than to my mom. Our characters work well together. So I never felt good treating him differently when something like this happened. Even if I felt betrayed and hurt.

But, when these recent news came to light, I felt sick to my stomach. I sent my dad a long message about me deciding I wouldn't talk to him until he divorced mom. The decision felt right. I won't forgive him this time because I am really hurt, as if all my past scars have been opened again. It's done out of respect to both myself and my mom.

And then mom told me they couldn't properly divorce because of some property issues my dad has with his brother. And they left it at that. They reconciled. Back to as if nothing happened.

I live in a college dorm and I come home twice a month. I was dreading coming home because I wasn't ready to live in a fantasy where we're a happy family.

It's been a day since I've come home and I haven't looked at my dad or spoken to him at all. What made this harder was my mom who secretly asked me to at least say hello to him. If it was anyone else who told me that, I'd brush it off. But her? The main victim in all of this? I didn't comply despite her wishes. I can't forgive him.

I know if I speak to him, I'll say too much and we'll dive into a conversation. I'm like that.

With no divorce in sight and with this guilt and anger that keeps brewing in me, I wonder if I did the right thing?",09Nov2019,1
698,"Something that's been on my mind for a long time now is that my conversation skills aren't great, specifically in a small group of 1on1. A little background: I've always been quite outgoing and not shy to get involved in things, because my humour is usually sarcasm or wit I find in group scenarios I have always been fine with joining in the conversation or adding a small joke but not consistently having something substantial to say.

Recently i really have been noticing myself struggling with keeping a conversation going. I can ask all the small talk and make a few cliche comments but when it comes down to actual substance I just panic and end up repeating a lot of the same phrases, it makes myself cringe as i hear myself doing it.

A little bit about myself if that helps make anything relevant, I'm 27 with most of my spare time playing video games (With other people online so i am constantly talking to people) and then football once a week etc. I always notice people will always talk about their life experiences and that's always the best part of conversations, I'm starting to panic i just haven't had enough out of my life to have someone enjoy a conversation with me. Should I be starting a new hobby, branching out with some new friends to make some new experiences? Even when thinking about trying something outside of my usual comfort zone i don't know where to start and just give up.

I normally would never really post on here but these last few months have been really low. It gets to the point now where even before a conversation I'm trying to think of something I can talk about to keep the conversation going and not look stupid, so much so that it just blocks a normal conversation thought train.

I'm sure other people may have had other things like this. Would you suggest anything to help conversation skills. A new hobby? Reading materials? Or is it just something im gonna be stuck with.

700,"Hello Reddit,
So today I (M21) went to my recruiter in order to begin the enlistment process. I plan on going from Enlistment&gt;ROTC&gt;AMEDD. I’ve always wanted to do this however there’s one problem, I have to choose either to omit possible disqualifying mental health admissions or apply for a waiver that may not be granted, ending my career in the military before it even starts. I am more than willing to apply for a waiver because I think it’s dishonest and wrong to lie when trying to serve your country, but I’m terrified of being denied.

My recruiter said that I could simply omit these facts during MEPS, and that as long as I do not have a complete and total mental breakdown (which I’ve never had before), that my medical records won’t be pulled and I will be okay. Further research shows conflicting thoughts on this matter, especially when going for security clearances.

For the medical waivers, I’ll have to get my medical records anyway, along with notes from my psychiatrist saying that I’m not a nutbag. I don’t think that will be a problem, seeing as I am not a nutbag, not currently on any medication, or been hospitalized since I was 17. All the while, I’ve been working diligently for my associates and working a part time job before I transfer to my four year undergrad. While I do see a therapist once a week, it is not for a matter of learning to cope with mental issues but more for the deeper self exploration that helps me put into perspective career and personal goals, such as joining the military; without personal bias. 

How screwed am I? Or, what are my odds of being able to enlist and serve my country? I’ll leave my case specifics below:

-Hospitalized at age 17 for suicidal thoughts, no plan and never attempted to hurt myself or others. Diagnosed with depression and anxiety there, have had no episodes since that single hospitalization.
-Seen a LCSW for the past two years, he says there shouldn’t be anything within my case history to deny me entry into the armed forces.
-See a psychiatrist for around two years, not frequently and discontinued meds over 6 months ago.

TLDR: I’m super scared I could be denied a medical waiver for a prior mental health issue, but I do not want to lie at MEPS.",09Nov2019,1

I told them that there’s no way that I was giving my hard earned money to defend him and that even if he didn’t do it, I’d lose my reputation at college by publicly defending him. 

They got upset with me and now both Ryan and the rest of my family aren’t speaking to me. As far as I know, Ryan is staying with them and they are working on a defence with a lawyer. 

I really don’t know what to do in this situation. I don’t know if I believe that Ryan is capable of doing what they said he did. He’s always been my hero and if he did this then my whole life is being turned upside down. 

At the same time, I don’t want to give my money to support a potential rapist.

I wish I had a bit more mass in general. I don’t even care about muscle, I just want to eat more.

Everyone else my age looks to be a healthy weight and doesn’t have skinny arms or legs like me. 

In general I’m just not that happy at home but when I’m in school I’m happier. It’s no doubt a factor in why I am not eating enough.

714,"We are short-handed at work and have immense pressure for an upcoming deadline. I work full-time and get health insurance through my job. I started working with a new therapist on Friday, and I foolishly decided to be completely honest, and things went very poorly. If I speak as openly with the psychiatrist I’m seeing on Wednesday I don’t know how it will go for me.￼￼

There is a very high chance that I will either be committed to inpatient treatment, or intensive outpatient treatment (3-hour group sessions 3-5 days a week either in morning or early afternoon, plus one-on-one meetings).  Obviously inpatient care will force me to miss a few weeks of work, so I am desperately trying to avoid this, but the outpatient treatment would also require me to miss at least four hours of work per day as their sessions are only during business hours. Even if I try to make that up in the evenings, there’s only so much that I would be able to do, as many of my job functions are supposed to happen at certain times during the day.￼

This is very uncomfortable for me to talk about, and I’m very afraid of how my job will be affected, let alone if they even keep me. Can anyone advise how to approach my boss about this on Monday, so in the event I am committed, it’s not some sudden surprise?￼￼￼ if it helps, location is Louisiana, USA.

Or honestly if I should downplay it so I can just kinda keep chugging along. I feel super humiliated over the whole thing.",09Nov2019,1

I just can't stand that everyone has a dream, everybody speaks about what they achieved and how they are progressing to get to that target. And me? I'm just playing games to kill time, working out to have healthy body but what should i do later? What I want to do in my life? I just can't get it.

729,"Heyo reddit. I don’t usually post here but I was wondering if I could get some advice from y’all. So, as a little bit of context, my middle school had after-school musicals. We would rehearse every day up until the end of the year. At the end of the year, we would put on the play. I decided that I should audition to be in one, so I did, and got in. I realized that I loved musical theatre and wanted to do more of it. So, I did. I was in my school’s production of Annie and The Lion King. These plays were some of the best times I’ve ever had.

Flash forward to now, and I’ve just started high school. My school doesn’t have any after school plays. It doesn’t even have a drama club. I find myself starting to miss being on the stage. 

So, using my big brain, I decided to try and start a drama club. I wrote out a nice essay on why we should have a drama club, what time we would meet, stuff like that. I gave it to staff. I was pretty confident. I mean, this club could go so far. We might even be able to put on our own plays, like in middle school! 

Ha, NO. 

Basically, to start a club, you need to have a teacher sponsoring it. All the teachers are already sponsoring a club. I have to wait until NEXT YEAR when I’m a SOPHOMORE, cause that’s when there’s a new teacher coming. Plus, there’s no guarantee that the new teacher will even agree to sponsor it.  

So, my hands are tied. I want to get back into theatre, but my school ain’t helping. Switching schools is not an option, cause this is a really good school. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

Tdlr: used to do after school plays in middle school, want to do more, but can’t in hs. Can’t start a drama club either.",09Nov2019,1

I'm also super socially awkward, are there some common ground topics I can talk about with people I kinda don't know? Like safe topics.

731,"I feel extremely lonely. My father passed July 9th so it’s the 5 month anniversary of his passing, and it’s been 3 years since my mother abandoned my 2 brothers and I. Growing up, they never really have me affection. They were always busy with the other kids or fighting with each other to tell me they loved me, talk to me give me affection. So I just stayed alone. 

My brothers now, have girlfriends, plus the younger one is always rude to me for no reason and the older one never has time to talk or asks me for advice and doesn’t really listen to me. Same as my friends. They don’t listen to me. My so called best friend only talks about herself, her boyfriend and her new mustang she got. Any time I mention anything about my life, we never talk through it, she gives a short answer and moves on to herself. We share the same friends, I know if I stop being friends with her, I lose everyone. 

Which brings me to my question. I’m considering getting a boyfriend just for the heck of it. I know people say “you can’t force it, you have to do it right and wait for the one blah blah blah” but I’ve never felt like anyone has ever actually listened or cared about me. Do you understand what that is like?, I haven’t been hugged in months I’m sure, I haven’t been able to vent since my last therapy session, and I can’t see them again until January, so for those of you who say “get therapy” I’m working on it. 

I just feel like a boyfriend would actually listen to me when I speak, and give me reassurance, I just feel really desperate, we are social beings, and I read that people can’t actually die from loneliness and heart break, I don’t want that to happen. I just want someone to care so badly.

733,"I am getting a 2k~ refund in the next month and I am scared to spend it on stupid things. I have some mental disabilities which make it hard to detract myself when I want an object or something in particular. It is difficult for me to exercise control when it comes to video games and other electronics in particular. I tend to buy it on impulse, use it for a bit then return it because we are poor. It is a vicious cycle I cannot break. (We currently only own a TV and a roku, no game systems anymore.)

I am a single parent and I know my daughter and I need things very badly like clothing, a new bed for her, and other necessities. We live impoverished so we generally do not have money to spend on things other than food, utilities and we do not really have a budget for anything fun. (We go to the park or go window shopping, but do not generally buy anything)

I have been doing my homework off of my cellphone, and do not currently own a computer, but know I am going to need one eventually. I have been eyeing a laptop for 1100, which is a spectre. I know it is overkill for school but i just have wanted one for a long time. I have also found a more resonable priced computer for 499, but my brain says screw them both and go for a gaming desktop for 1499 with all of the bells and whistles. It is hard for me to make a decision even though I know the 499 would be the best decision monetary wise. 


How can I practice self control to purchase what we absolutely need ? Instead of buying and returning? It is very hard to do. I have thought about maybe paying in cash and destroying receipts so i can not return the items.

I have talked to a behavioral health specialist and she is also stating it is just part of the disease I have - the uncontrollable compulsiveness and it is hard to control even on medication.

27 - F - Texas - Accounting student in her senior year at Texas A&amp;M University Corpus Christi. 

While you may have guessed, I'm in school late because of my own decisions. I created a failing business, met a guy on the internet, and wanted to run away with him, and did basically nothing for my 20s. I worked, sure, but I lived with my parents and nothing came of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

At one point, I tried to pursue my passion, aerospace engineering, but realized I wasn't' smart enough, and dropped out.

I'm going for accounting now, and see all the other buisness majors pursuing things that seem so much more interesting to me. I'm going to be going directly after for my masters, then doing becker for a year while working, then paying back student loans. Any desire to travel, to do exciting thing, and go on adventures in my 20s has been squashed. I'll be well into my 30s before i can truly live, and that's if I'm even smart enough to get to the CPA point. 

&amp;#x200B;

The kicker? I hate accounting. School is absolutely exhausting, and I want to quit every single day. I hate how stuffy wearing suits to events is. I hate feeling like my work means absolutely nothing. I hate feeling like I'm going into a field that so many people hate. I cry about it regularly. I feel like I royally fucked up my life.

&amp;#x200B;

And the reality is, I'm too far in to turn back now. I'm 27, as aforementioned, and will be 28 when I get my bachelors. I'll be 29 after my masters, and 30 when I become a CPA.

Today I was called downstairs by my mother saying there were police to ask me questions. They wanted to know where my now ex boyfriend was. Didn’t tell me the reason why, but it was “administrative”

In conversation one said “I’m sure I saw you walking down (street near my home) this morning” after saying it wasn’t me he asked if I was sure. It definitely wasn’t.

This was at 10am I said I was in bed all morning. Again he asked if I was sure. I was. Then started asking if I was in bed so late because I work night shifts.

What is strange though is that someone I know a street or two away from me told me the officers were knocking on doors asking where I live or if they know me. And mentioned my mother uses a wheelchair.
Now my mother doesn’t use a wheelchair other than once a week or two ago when we used one in a supermarket.

Is this is a coincidence or strange? I don’t know if it worth mentioning but the officer did have my phone for about a minute while taking a name. And I have seen officers slow done driving past me house when I was getting in the car today.

759,"TL;DR: When I was 14, I used the n-word on my old, irrecoverable YouTube account about page, also included a way to contact me which used my real name, it now appears in the first page of results when my name is Googled. How will employers see this? Should I explain the situation and own up to it?


Longer version: When I was younger, I was very much into graphic design and made a fair few channels (rebranding I guess) related to showing off my creations. One of these channels is irrecoverable -- I'm not sure whether it was hacked or I just can't remember the email/password I used, either way I'm not getting back onto it. Being into graphic design and hoping to make things for other people, I put some contact details in the ""about"" page that YouTube channels provide, one of these details includes my full name. When my name is Googled, it is on the first page of results and sticks out from the rest. Unfortunately, being younger I was very much ignorant of the world and the people in it, and also included the n-word in the about page. Now, I didn't mean it in a disparaging way (although it could be argued its use alone is disparaging), it was simply, I don't know, it was used in the greeting to the page. ""What's up ____"". You get the idea. It wasn't the actual spelling (...ars, as if it makes a difference). I must stress that this word is not in my vocabulary. I was young, foolish and made a mistake. Frankly, the fact that I did use the word on the page makes me ashamed of myself.


I am now older and looking for a full time job. I even have an interview lined up, although I was told that there would be a pre-employment screening, which includes searching through social media, etc.


My question is, how will an employer react to this? It is noted that I can give advanced warning of any instances that will flag the social media pre-employment check. How would I even go about explaining that? Am I doomed because of this?",09Nov2019,1

763,"I got broken up with yesterday. We both genuinely liked each other but it was long distance and we hadn't defined it so it was lime dating without the label. Yesterday he ended it saying he's losing interest because we're both busy with college and he doesn't see it going anywhere in the long term. We'd been seeing each other for almost 3 months. 

I used to always make time to talk to him, no matter how busy I was. I put in a lot of effort - I started watching stuff he used to watch so I'd have new things to talk about with him as well. Yesterday he said that he thinks our conversations have become stagnant. 

I genuinely liked him, and I think I even loved him. This was my first relationship and the first time I'd been so into someone. I can't stop crying and reading our chats and looking at his pictures. He made me so so happy and I was so excited to see him when I go home, now I'm not excited at all. How do I let him go?",09Nov2019,1

765,"So I signed up to be a tutor at school never thinking I’d get picked to actually be one since not a lot of people ask for help with English.  Nonetheless, I’m very excited. This kid is in a program for kids with learning problems who won’t even get a diploma when the graduate, they’ll just get a certificate. This kid wants to get a diploma so he’s asked for help in English. I’ve never work with someone with a low reading level before. Not to sound like a douche or brag but I have a high reading level and I’m currently a grade above in English and it’s an honors class (even if my grammar on the internet doesn’t show it). All I’ve ever known is reading the classics and having a high reading level. I don’t know what it’s like to be in his shoes. He asked for help and I don’t want to fail him because everybody deserves to succeed in life and I want him to get his diploma and do great things. I’m think about getting him to read some books and annotate them but idk what books for him to read. Please if any of y’all have any suggestions or any advice, please share.",09Nov2019,1
766,So I've met this really dope girl that is kind of a hippie and I am infatuated with her and I need some basic advice on how to get girls like that to like you. Also I know this is basic boring question but would appreciate the help.,09Nov2019,1
767,"I say “prom” because it’s a bit different. Either way, I was under the impression, since my entire friend group is single, that we were all going to go together as a group. Well I was wrong. Everyone in the group wants to go with a bf/gf. The prom isn’t until next year but they’re all planning it as if it’s next week and I feel behind. I have no idea who I’m going to go with and on the one hand I don’t want to go with a partner because I’m just not ready for a relationship at all and I don’t want to end up using them just for a stupid school dance thing but on the other hand I don’t want to go and be the only person to show up alone. Stuff is being made for pairs. You can only buy two tickets. Get a table for two. Assigned seats for you and your partner and so on. Idk what to do or how to find someone even if I did want to go with someone. Idk what I want from this post but anything will help really lol.",09Nov2019,1

770,"Hello all,

I wasn't sure what sub to post this question in, so I hope it's an okay fit here.

As my title says, my sister is potentially getting out of jail soon. Her sentencing is only 2 weeks away, and her lawyer just informed us that she might be free to go on her 11 months served in the local jail.

This was totally unexpected. She was originally looking at 3 years. My family is completely overwhelmed, and we have no idea what to do. She needs somewhere to stay, and I am the only family member she could stay with, but due to her charges, my husband and I are not comfortable with her staying with us. Some charges are drug related, and some are more serious.

She is working on transferring her probation to her home state, but that will take about two months, so she has to stay in this county for now.

She has no ID, and has to pay $1300 in order to get one, due to some DMV fines. She obviously does not have this, and my family does not either. A loan/credit card is not an option, due to our low income and credit.

We have no idea where she is going to go, and we don't want her to wind up behind bars again. Her credit is fucked, and she has several companies coming after her for money, so she can't even open a bank account. No family member can afford to take 2 months off to live with her out here. We are afraid that if she is by herself, she will get depressed and start using again.

Is a halfway house or some sort of sober living place a good option? We cannot afford any fancy rehab programs, as she has no insurance.

I'm hoping someone out there has been through something similar. We are really struggling to find out how to get her a job, how to get her a place of residence for probation, and how to help her thrive, in such a short time.

Thank you",09Nov2019,1
771,"I know this is pretty insubstantial in comparison to other people on this site but regardless, how can I buy a PS4 with my parents permission? Their main fear is that it’ll screw my grades up yet I’ve said that I always will do studying and my music practise before I even touch the console. They don’t seem to listen to this, and I’ve tried explaining that the free time I have is spent on YouTube and my phone which they would prefer over me playing video games. 

Can anyone help me with this irrational logic? I’ve tried to use reasoning with my parents but they always ignore the fact that I’d be spending my FREE time on other equally useless things.",09Nov2019,1
