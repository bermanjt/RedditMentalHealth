0,"I want to be a chef 100%. I've been a cook before, and it was the most fun I've ever had. Listening to music, crackin' up, making delicious food, eating some of that delicious food. Awesome.  

  

I am 21, studying for an IT degree; graduating in December. I'm good at it, but it isn't as fun to me. However, I would be pretty comfortable financially. I have a job lined up after college that pays well for the region I live in (the US). If cooking wasn't my passion, I wouldn't give it a second thought; I'd be in IT. The kitchen doesn't have any of that office talk bullshit and political correctness. It pays shit though. I just don't know. Maybe I wouldn't be happy in a shitty apartment with no money to do anything.  

  

One side of me is like, ""fuck the money, money doesn't give you happiness, I'll just live in a van down by the river idgaf."" Then the more reasonable side of me chimes in with ""money does attribute to happiness somewhat, you can do different things with more money, you'll be more open with an IT career.""

  

I don't necessarily need chefs to answer me. I need someone who chose something they love over something that pays and the pros and cons that come along with that. It's such a difficult decision because they're on the exact opposite ends of the spectrum for me money wise, but they aren't on opposite ends for happiness necessarily.  

  

I watched my mom eat shit for us for my entire childhood to provide for us and hated it, and I saw my dad bust his ass for the things he *wanted* to do. I'm not sure what I admire more, in retrospect: doing something you hate for the people you love, or doing what you want for that sliver of happiness.  

  

I want to know the realistic decision for me. I'm torn. Shit.",08Jul2019,1
1,"Posted in relationship advice as well, but need any advice i can get 

I'm at a loss for how to handle this friendship. My best friend has been at my side for the past two years since we started college and has become a brother to me. We have both been through so much together, from the death of his teammate/good friend, my friend getting cancer, and even the smaller events, me driving him to sports practice and him looking out for me when we go out or making sure i'm always happy. He is one of the most selfless people I have ever met and when my boyfriend can't make events due to sports (both athletes) he will take me to dinner or out downtown just to take my mind off of it, no questions even asked. I could go on and on about the things he's done for not just me but people he is close to, but there's one aspect about him that i just can't shake: his aggression. He's extremely giving, but over the past two years i've seen how quick he is to become angry, almost as if it's out of his own control. Here are a few examples for perspective:

&amp;#x200B;

1. the first time he ever yelled at me was when his teammate died after getting into a motorcycle accident. his teammate had actually called him a few times before his death, but he missed the calls because we had gone out drinking and he was taking care of me (note i didn't ask him to and we had plenty of friends there with us). After the news broke, he avoided me for the whole day the morning after during which i tried to contact him over text and call but he never answered. I then went over to his apartment to make sure that he was alright. when he saw me in person he screamed at me, blaming me for his teammates death and saying if i wasn't so reckless and he hadn't had to take care of me that maybe he could have done something to help. I was in shock and what he said immediately brought me to tears, but I understood that he was grieving.  After another week, he apologized for this and i forgave him.
2. Next, during our lab session, he was my partner and we needed help figuring out a part of our lab. I asked one of the assistants numerous questions, however, he didn't know the answer to any of them. Admittedly, this was frustrating, but I just asked other around us and we figured it out, no problem whatsoever. However, after i had asked the lab assistant for a third or fourth time and he claimed he did not know, my friend yelled at him (not at the same scale as the previous story) saying ""what the hell do you know then?"" the entire room got quiet, and he proceeded to berate the poor lab assistant even making him feel so bad that he agreed to bring us the ANSWER KEY. I told him that it was fine and we can figure it out, but he told me i was naive and just as clueless about how to handle problems. I didn't want to make a bigger scene and didn't know what to say so i just stayed quiet and left the lab feeling so bad for the assistant ( i even apologized to him on his behalf after i saw the assistant crying)
3. This previous weekend was one that really hurt me. we had planned a get together with our friends at his apartment and to go to our universitys golf course afterwards. He told me that i had been ignoring him (which i did not try to do at all) and wouldn't take no for an answer when i told him i had to do my homework (my grades had been slipping and i needed to maintain a certain gpa to be able to continue playing on my sports team) I eventually agreed to come, but told him i would have to do a few problems first to which he said fine. Cut to the get together, everyone is having a great time, but we run out of wine coolers. He had an extra case at my apartment and asked me to go over and bring them, to which i said no problem. However, i was in the middle of talking to someone, and after i finished the conversation i was about to go get them. He meets me at the door and says that he would get them himself since i could never prioritize him/do anything for him. I was confused, because i had agreed to go and i told him such and he started yelling and said that i clearly didn't want to leave. At this point his teammates tell him to relax and i did not want to be there, so i slipped out the door and grabbed the wine coolers. After this, i came back to do some problems in his room while the other were relaxing in the living room. I was working, when all of a sudden he barged into the room and starts yelling. He said ""what the hell is taking so long"" and when i told him i was stuck he told me that he would help. he grabbed the pencil out of my hand and starts writing the problem down super fast, and i wasn't following his explantation (i have condensed text dyslexia and just generally am not great at math, i've struggled with school and he knows about this too) he then yelled at me because i didn't understand the problem and berated me for not understanding the subject until i started crying to which he then stopped. He also claimed that i was holding everyone else up although our tee time was an hour and a half away and when his teammates came into the room after he started yelling he claimed that ""i was holding everyone up and that i always do this"". He knew that i would leave my work and go if the time came up and his teammates even said that themselves. After that, i decided to pack up my bag and just head home i told them i wasn't feeling too good, and as i tried to leave my friend followed me and yelled at me saying you're really going to make this scene? i told him i wasn't feeling good and as i left to go down the stairs he grabbed my arm/wrist and i fell, causing my wrist to get sprained. after he realized what happened he let go and said he would grab me ice, i told him to forget it and left to go home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to handle this situation or what's gotten into him. I honestly don't even know what to say at times because im scared he will yell at me more or cause a bigger scene. Im very nonconfrontational and ive told him before that i dont deal with yelling well at all, so he knows this about me too. im just at a loss for how to deal with these situations

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: my best friend who is otherwise one of the best friends i have had in my life, is very agressive and yells at me knowing that i am nonconfrontational. During an argument, i tried to leave, he grabbed my wrist and sprained it. i don't know how to assert myself or de-escalate these situations and am scared of making a scene and don't like to argue at all. What do i do?",08Jul2019,0

I've been asking for some advice in another subreddit and almost everyone that had an interest in commenting about my issue gives me an answer that in essence tells me to give up in whatever I want to achieve in life and, as if this wasn't enough, they also decided to downvote my post and comments. And when I see someone downvoting me, I interpret it as if the person who downvoted me is indirectly saying to me that I'm an idiot, a fool, a little shit, or that I should feel ashamed of myself for posting or commenting whatever they downvoted.  


I feel really, really awful.  


This is not the first time. Back in 2017 and 2018, where I was more active, it was the same thing. That's part of the reason as to why I stopped talking with people on Reddit in general, because for some reason it seems like every member of this social media is an apathetic jerk that doesn't actually want to help me or to make me feel good about my day, about what I'm trying to do, I don't feel that this community wants to support me, I sometimes feel bulied, shamed by the people that I expected to help me.

&amp;#x200B;

And I don't know why's that. Nobody on Reddit knows me very well, not even in real life for that matter. But then, when I see other redditor's posts, asking for advice for their own problems, I look at other people's comments and I see people giving advice or commenting something in a way that it's clear that they care about the person who made that post, they show empathy, they show respectful towards them, but when it's me who has a problem and comes here to ask for advice because I need help, people just comment ""just give up"" or something that can be interpreted as this.  


I've been here before, and people usually say that's my problem, and not other people's problems. And I think they're right. I have very low self steem, I take medicine for depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughs that my psyquiatrist prescribed me. So yeah, it's very likely that what I just said up to this point is just bullshit and that the only person in the wrong here is me. So, if you also believe in that, just ignore my post or make fun of me in the comments if you feel like, maybe by you doing this will give me more willpower to actually end it all.",08Jul2019,1
3,"I have been studying away from home for a number of years now. Now that I have finished my studies I’m planning on staying put with my partner in our current town. We have great support system here and my partner is honestly the kindest, most amazing person I know.

I have always been close with my family. I visit often and am usually only a plane journey away, but I still feel like a large part of me is constantly far away. It seems that every time I have to say goodbye after a visit it gets harder and harder. I feel completely torn between two places that I love at once.

4,"  I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",08Jul2019,0
5,"Hey, so I don't want to write something super long so I want to keep it short and sweet.

For a bit of context I've been single for over a year now. My last relationship turned into a huge toxic mess with constant gas lighting. It really messed me up for a long while but now I've gotten to the point where I really want to start dating again. Problem is I now seem to have a ton of self doubt as I keep backing out on my chances to ask this girl out as I think Im afraid of another relationship turning into something terrible.

Basically theres a new girl at my work now whos been there for about a month now. We've been talking a good amount the days we've worked together about 3ish weeks ago and I started to notice it seemed like she was into me, so I figured next week when I saw her I'd ask her for her number and to go out sometime.

Problem is, now that I realized that I kinda like this girl I feel like I've just been too awkward. Its harder for me to get a good conversation going like I was with her before and Im worried, as its feeling like she might be loosing any interest if she had any, or its just me being awkward.

Basically, I really want to ask her out but now that I see that I want to, I now cant seem to make myself do it, and Im worried Im running out of time and she'll lose interest. Im also just worried about if she says no to going out, as it will be awkward working together after that. Is there any advice/tips on how I can get over this anxiety and fear?

tldr: Previous relationship has me over thinking everything when it comes to trying to get into a new one and doing the steps to ask a girl out and need help to overcome anxiety.",08Jul2019,1
6,"So this has been on going now... I'll cut to the chase. Here it is, My gf (20f) and I (21m) have been dating for the past 11 months. Things are good, she's nice, pretty, kind. But when it comes to my friends it's a little different, she's gets super upset if Im with my friends (Gals and guys) I've known them for many years, they are my best friends, don't do drugs, just super chilled and clean people. 

Anyways, my gf will start crying and swearing at me (Over text) if I'm alone with any of those girls or just hanging out in general, it's honestly starting to piss me the fuck off.... She also wants to know where I am all the time, if I'm with friends and if we go somewhere else she wants to know where etc, she gets jealous. 

I cant watch movies when she's with me if there's women stripping or nudity because she gets upset. I told her today that I feel like I'm being controlled when she said ""Why didn't you tell me you went out to take pictures?"" Then she got pretty pissed off lol Seriously though, I know something is wrong. But what should I do? I tried to talk to her about her jealousy and I mentioned that it would be nice to actually hangout with my friends without her overreacting and getting upset. I'm honestly lost on what I should do about this. If I do talk to her about things, she starts crying and totally blocks me out. So it's useless...",08Jul2019,1
7,"So recently I have been thinking about changing my last name. My father's side of the family disowned me when I was little due to the fact that my terrible dad could not get along with my mom. I stayed with my mom's side of the family and she raised me, but my mom was not mentally well, so my grandmother ""unofficially"" adopted me, when I was 17. A few years after that, I changed my last name to my mom's family name which is Cadena(which people get confused with Cardenas all the time, ugh!) Unfortunately, a few years after that, my grand mother died. Due to the toxic nature of my mom's family, my grandmother was the only one that I was really closed with. 

Eight years after my grandmother passed, my sister and I ceased all communication, its been almost 4 years and I have not spoken to or talked to my family at all. Even if I was still in contact with them, it was always me calling them, and me going to their house. Now, Ive moved 300 miles away so that is no longer feasible. I am thinking of changing my name to Palacios and I wanted to get advice. Should I just suck it up and forge ahead with the old name? My grandmother is the only person that I was close to there and she was the only one that really helped me and advised me. Or should I try to finally start something on my own and change it myself?",08Jul2019,1
8,"This happened recently at a family reunion. I’m a young teenager and I love to draw, and everyone knows that in my family. So my grandpa knocked on my door and asked if he could have this artwork I made a while ago (took a few hours to finish it too) and I politely declined. A little while later my mom confronts me about this and says “Can’t you just draw another one? You have all these drawings and you can’t give him one? You’re selfish.” 

Now I’ve been thinking about this and Im debating whether I should’ve just given him the drawing since he asked for it. Am I really being selfish?",08Jul2019,1
9,"I don’t really know where to start off with this. I’m not looking for attention, sympathy or anything like that, I just can’t really deal with this on my own anymore. I just want to put that out there. 

To get straight to the point - I’m losing hope. I have been for years, but just recently it’s been starting to really get to me. I don’t have any friends in real life, and I’ve tried so hard to change that, but nobody in this world seems to notice me. I feel invisible to everyone and everything. I have tried so many times to get in touch with people, yet nobody ever replies. I never get invited to places, or to do things. Even my pets seem uninterested in me sometimes and it makes me breakdown and cry (as stupid as that is.) 

I hate myself, I hate how skinny &amp; tall I am and how big my nose is, it makes me so self conscious and I hate it. Even something as simple as going outside is a huge task for me because of this. I get anxious and have really bad panic attacks. I feel like everyone is staring at me constantly, looking at me and noticing how ugly I am and thinking to themselves “wow, i’m so glad I don’t look like him” or if I hear somebody laughing, I presume that they’re laughing at me. 

I spend every single day alone in my room, I sit at my PC pretty much all day and do anything that helps me to pass the time. I play League of Legends pretty competitively (cringe) but I’ve been losing interest in that too. Without that though, I don’t really have anything else to do. I had to leave my full time job in May because I was so stressed and depressed that it had actually began to cause me physical problems. I’m working at a part time job at the moment because I can’t go straight back into a new full time job, even though I would like to. I wish I could change my lifestyle, but I don’t know how.  Obviously, I hate being alone in my room all day, but it’s the only place where I’m comfortable. I want to go places and do things with people but as I’ve mentioned before nobody is interested in me. All of this hasn’t just been going on for a couple of weeks either, it’s been going on for years. I’ve been alone for years. I’ve been suicidal for these past few months but just recently it’s gotten so much worse, I really don’t know what to do. I’ve tried medication, I’ve been to therapy multiple times, etc. but what else am I supposed to do? Nothing seems to work and I’m scared that I’m going to hurt myself. 

There is so much more that I could talk about too. I hate being a burden on people, so I’m sorry if I’ve bothered you with this post.  If you have any questions or anything i’ll do my best to reply. Thank you for listening to me. I’m just pretty desperate for help right now, I don’t want to disturb anyone or anything. 

Lots of love.",08Jul2019,4

15,"Probably should be on a throwaway, but I don't have one, and I'm not all too worried about it at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a bit of backstory here, so I'll try to be brief. TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not allowed to go out with those of the opposite sex. Like, ever, unless there's some kind of chaperone present. This has been the case since I had female friends (so, the age of 13/14), and I'll be 18 in a couple months. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents (my mother, especially) consistently ask me whether or not I have a girlfriend, and, for the past year, I've avoided labels in any kind of relationship so I wouldn't have to admit it. The last ""girlfriend"" I had was an extremely short-lived relationship, as the rules in my house changed; I wasn't allowed to see her unless we were out somewhere with other people. This included going over to her house, regardless of whether her parents or siblings were home (the two times I did go, they were). *Plot twist: my parents were the ones who told me to ask her out.*

In the end, the relationship died because we weren't able to be alone, ever. 

Now, in the past month, I've been talking to a new romantic interest, but we've been friends for a bit beforehand. We'd gone out (accompanied, of course, by her younger sister) a few times as friends, but then ended up ramping up our relationship to a kind of friends-with-benefits deal, to avoid rules in our homes. We've met up secretly a couple times, but two days ago I went to run some errands, my parents got suspicious (multiple ""where are you"" texts from my father, all of which I answered truthfully), and found out that I had met up with her. Unsure if they know any details about what we did (we made out for a bit, nothing heavy at all).

Now, honestly, I love my parents with all of my heart, but their rules are hard to live by (another is the new Apple Screen Time feature, that activates at 8:30). They were already mad at me this week—I have to do schoolwork throughout the summer and I was slacking on it—and I had lost my phone. The day I got it back I did this. I understand I've screwed up here, but what do I say? What should I come prepared with when they confront me? I know my dad did this as a kid, but now he's a different person. 

&amp;#x200B;

18,"I’m not sure if “control issues” is the proper term for the toxic behaviors I see in myself, I don’t try to control other people or my environment, but I’ve heavily struggled with change and loosing control in situations that deal with myself. I don’t like going outside of my comfort zone and I have no desire to do anything other than what I’m used to doing. I get bored very easily yet I don’t like expanding to try new things. 
I used the term control issues because I can’t stand the thought of loosing control in my own life, I know where this stems from but therapy currently isn’t an option for me, and I’ve always hated talking about how I feel. The internet feels much safer than a real person.
What are things I can try? I’ve thought through it on my own, obviously a first step would be meeting new people and trying new places, but there has to be something more I can do.

21,"It's because of a lot of things.  But in the forefront right now, I met someone really nice whose attitudes toward sex kind of mirror my parents'.  He was kind and his life was together. He was kind of awkward and successful. We cuddled.  I ended up ending it today bc he wanted someone who was wife material and a keeper.  He wanted someone who was drug free and focused on building their life/career and that's not me right now.  I didn't wanna waste his time.   When I was with him, he made me wish I were doing better for myself.  I wish I were less promiscuous and more focused.  I have a shitty job and I've been in college for 4 years (I have a long way to go)  I'm wasted or high almost every day and I kind of don't want to be sober.

22,"Hi guys.

I live in a house with my sister, and her French friend came over to my country last year. As soon as she came we hit it off, and eventually I learnt good French and we got together. 

It was great, but a bit claustrophobic because we lived together from the get go. I ended it after half a year over stupid reasons. I had no intention of getting back with her either, I thought this relationship was a closed book.

After the breakup, things were awkward but quickly returned to normal. We stayed strictly friends for a month or two, until we had a short FWB stint for maybe 2 weeks, which ended because of me being an idiot. That left some hard feelings on her part I believe, and we both ended up disliking each other for a while.

Now, in the past few weeks, we have been messing around together late at night sometimes, cuddling and more etc. We talked and agreed that we liked that we were people who could fool around as friends.

In the past week, she's been on my mind more and more. I think I'm beginning to develop feelings again. The worst part is she is leaving to go home to France at the end of August.

I'm coming to all of you to see what your opinion is on whether I should try to get her back for these last few weeks, and if so any ways I can bring it up with her? 

Thanks guys.",08Jul2019,2
23,"The title refers to the following: [Self-Verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-verification_theory) \- a drive toward actions and situations that verify who you think you are, which is problematic for obvious reasons when your self-image is negative. Not all people who struggle with their behavior do so because of this, and not all who have a negative self-image see it manifest in this way. It just explains me very well and works personally as a context here.

Standard disclaimer: yes, I have a therapist. I can go to them if this is too much.

To keep it brief (lol, let's be real, I won't), I'll start just by outlining list-ways the system I'm stumped for a way out of:

*Belief:* Strong moral values, preferences, and opinions. I have put a lot of thought and time into knowing them in great detail. I could describe what *a good person* actively does and doesn't do in their life - and this is a key phrase.

*Belief:* That I am *not a good person*, based upon evidence. We could be here all day if I listed all the things I have done that I disagree with (btw, ""the past no longer exists"" arguments aren't realistic IMO - literally all information we know was generated in the past, and also, let me know if you *truly* don't judge others on what they've *done*). Most of these errors are fairly quiet, such as being a bystander when I knew I could help someone, or not standing up for myself. Others are more active and severe, such as losing my composure in public. 

What they all have in common is that I don't think they are good, and I would lose respect for any person at all I saw doing them. Some of them, I would even say are grounds for cutting someone out of my life - *but I caaaaan't*, because the doer is me! Their presence burnssss. :(

But why, considering that confidence in my disagreement with them, do I make these mistakes anyway? Isn't that irrational? No. Actually, it is consistent:

*Situation:* An opportunity to choose what to do in an emergent situation. Stress and unsureness are probably at play. I know what's right and what's wrong according to my beliefs. I know what a good person would do. But I also know something else. A flash of disgust occurs, suddenly, when I think about what's right: \*but I'm not a good person.\* Suddenly, I truly just want to show this to everyone and myself - that I'm a coward, an asshole. I've observed this as it is happening, and in that moment, this is what I want. 

*Outcome:* A new piece of evidence supports the belief that I am a shitty person, which will only increase its influence the next time a decision comes along. The cycle begins anew. Knowledge of what's good, no matter how deep and precise, will not help me to do what's right so long as I also identify as someone who is not it.

So, here is where I'm stuck. Not in being unable to see options for change, but because I'm having trouble finding one that isn't blocked by having sunk too deep for too long into this cycle.

The option of ""just start believing you are not bad"" unfortunately is stricken down by a few especially egregious past errors that I made because I'd let the cycle escalate to a certain point. Don't you believe that some actions permanently strike a person from trustworthiness and a ""good"" designation because they show that the person is capable of a certain level of bad that most people aren't, and will always be, whether or not they may do it again? I do. And is this really, truly unreasonable? To have deal breakers? Unfortunately, this nails down the belief in my badness that drives more actions I don't like. It also invalidates the sub-option of seeking out past evidence of good.

The option of ""just start doing things you like instead of things you don't like"" is something I've actually gotten better at over time. However, there are still bad days - even days like yesterday, where I gave in to a serious self-punishing behavior that I had previously been able to hold off on for *years*. If you know a technique for consistently, lastingly motivating someone to do something whose problem is that they are drawn to the pain of failing to do things, let me know.

And finally, the weirder options. Perhaps what I'm specifically writing this advice thread for is to challenge you to convince me that these things are okay - if, of course, they actually are. The essence of them is this: the cycle moves because if its consistency between belief and action. Could a lapse in consistency be a way to escape? Such as:

*Lapse in belief consistency with past actions:* just believe I am not bad. *But* stop depending on evidence for a moment. Do it on faith. Could this moment of irrational faith be worth it for precipitating real, new behaviors that support it? For precipitating its own eventual backing evidence?

*Lapse in action consistent with belief:* just do things I like instead of things I don't like. *But* don't hope right now for them to impact my identity. Don't expect any truth or authentic meaning from them that would make failure an enticing punishment. Simply establish a good routine for a break from actions that would reinforce the bad self-image. Nothing but an umbrella of quiet from the reinforcement blows that will let me do some deeper work, uninterrupted, beneath it.

*Radical lapse in action consistent with belief:* accept having permanently blown the chance to be a good person per my personal value system. Keep working at doing better things anyway, because even if there's no hope left for your own character, is goodness all about you and what you can claim to being? No, we try to be good because goodness is about our impact on others and the world. Make the best one I can with the time I have left. Accept the truth and the cost of the lost time.

*Radical tl;dr advocacy:* walk away from here and talk to my therapist about what might have made me so confident, even since I was a kid, that ""good"" must not describe me. An emotionally invalidating parent (yes, this is one thing that is true)? However, my belief is no longer based on the initial impetus so much as my own mistakes since then.

So, what can one do when their self-hate actually has reasons that make sense? Is it legit to try faith or otherwise temporarily break from consistency for the sake of change?

My alcoholic dad keeps stealing all of our money and wastes it on alcohol, cigarettes and other bullshit, I've tried talking to him about it when he was sober but every time he just told me to fuck off and insulted me in other ways.
Normally I would just let my mom deal with it since I'm a minor and these things are technically not even my responsibility but the main problem is that we are very poor at the moment and we can't afford to waste any money, and my dad spending the few savings that we have is not helping at all. My dad has manipulated my mom so much that she feels guilty and powerless so she doesn't want to stand up for herself, but nobody is realising this is also affecting me because my parents haven't been able to pay my school yet and if they don't by the beginning of the new school year (in a month) i won't be able to go, and that might seem like a lot of time but my school is EXPENSIVE. I told my mom I could change schools if we couldn't afford it but she wants me to still be with my friends no matter how hard I push.

32,"All I care is my own world and my own interests. I do not want to deal with adult life; I do not want to work, get a job, get a career. I do not want to raise a family. I do not want to grow old. I do not want to deal with the constant hassle of everyday life, constantly dealing with people every day. I do not want annoying responsibility. I do not want to see family members grow old and die. I do not want people to rely on me, annoy me, ask me for help. I do not want anything that isn't related to my own interests and the things I like doing.

&amp;#x200B;

I despise reality and constantly, without ever stopping, imagine many wonderful fantasy scenarios where I have some kind of supernatural influence or ability and am able to just breeze through everything I dislike and despise and reach perfect bliss. It's all I want, really. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never had dreams nor ever even cared about 'my future'. If anything my ideal world would be peaceful solitude. I don't want to build or work for anything. I just wanna play videogames and have fun with the other things I do, like playing DnD, gardening, cooking, reading... It's all I want. And I don't want to be bothered by anything or anyone forever. I want only my friends and the people I allow. I hate conflict, hate stress, and I realize that most conflict and stress is generated by people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, y'see, I've already made posts like this a thousand times, and I always get the same responses every time, so honestly by this point I really don't feel strongly about it. I just keep doing it because it's the only way to express myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

People have called me immature, delusional ( duh ), said I was whining, said I'm spoiled, said I'm a horrible person, that I'm selfish. I'm not saying they're right or wrong, but it really all phases through me; it doesn't mean anything. I don't like reality. I am set in my ways. I've spent so much time growing, thinking, developing this mindset that this is me. I don't need help. I don't need change. And I don't want any sappy pseudo-motivational just-got-my-diploma-in-psychology-with-a-minor-on-coaching shit saying 'oh but you want to change since you typed this'. 

&amp;#x200B;

My greatest wish is supernatural shit happening and giving me power. Otherwise I don't care. I barely feel sad about it. I remember when I used to feel really bad, but now I got used to it. Doesn't mean I am depressed; I enjoy myself a lot and have a lot of fun and can feel happiness and excitment. It's just that I really meant it; I despise reality. That won't change. Ever. My daily plan to go about each day without letting myself feel horrible is just to ignore things and not think about them. It just works.

&amp;#x200B;

And anyway, all I want is some supernatural occurrence happening to give me ultimate power to do whatever I want and cut away all that I hate. It's all I care; it's my ideal future. But, since everyone has got to have a plan B, here's mine.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll go do university again; gave up first semester this year because I was hating it and it was getting to me, also I skipped like 80% of classes, lol. I gotta do it for real this time to keep up appearances and for my parents not to think I'm a lazy parasite ( also for me not to feel like a parasite ) or to think there's something wrong with me. This time, I've learned my lesson so I'll pick an easy major that doesn't take much of my time. Also, I'll get back my PC ( don't have it since february, made things really tough, all i wanted was to play games man... ) by the end of this month so I'll be goooooood; it'll feel like restoring your humanity in Dark Souls. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I''ll do university again for real, because that's what's expected of me by society and by my family, so I can keep up appearances, and I'll do just enough to actually pass the grades and not struggle, then on the side I'll just keep doing my stuff! Playing games, playing with friends, other stuff. And then when the time comes and I hopefully have played all I wanted to play, read all I wanted to read, watched all I wanted to watch ( It's a finite number; I'm very picky about what I consume ), and I finish uni and am forced to go into the brutal world of adult life, getting a shitty soul-crushing 9 to 5 job to work the rest of my life, till i die, and on the side deal with alll the annoying shit of adult life...I just wont do any of that and I'll end it all and end this charade. I'll be free then; sure its sad and I don't want to die, but it's my plan if until then I don't get any supernatural powers or whatever. I guess it's unlikely that will happen, since it seems I really am just a regular human, no matter how delusional I am.

I have lived by myself for two years, in dorms and then my own apartment, while i went to college. I have finished my associates now, and i am to the point i have to decide my life path now. I know I could always go for two more years and get a degree, but I cannot afford to continue living in my current arrangements with my current job. My main decision is if i should move back to my home town and pursue a certificate in a well paying job field, or stay in the town I have lived for two years and find a career to start.

Some things I have to consider in my choices is this:
1. No matter the choice, financial independence is my key goal. I would like to be completely financially independent from my parents.

2. Either choice, i must find new living arrangements, and moving back in with my parents is not an option for me, because reason number one. Also rent costs a significant amount at either place, and buying would actually be much cheaper. If I buy in my home town, I have to get rid of it in a year when i move away.

3. I plan on living where i currently do, even if i spend a year away.

4. My friends are incredibly important to me, and though i have friends at either place, the ones i have made around where i currently live are friends i can see myself being friends with for my adult life.

5. Im not sure if i can find a job that will pay enough money for me to become financially independent if i do not get a specialization.",08Jul2019,1

* He stares at kids very inappropriately.

* He stares over the shoulders of kids as they work, and not in an observant way. Just creepily.

* He flirts with female students, and the mothers of students. Especially when it isn’t warranted whatsoever.

* He has asked female students to talk with him alone in his office, and if they said no because they felt uncomfortable, they would be punished. One time, he grabbed a girl by the arm and tried to pull her into his office when she said no.

I don’t know what to do. 

There isn’t a way of getting photographic proof because of our schools strict no cell phone policy.

Other than grabbing the girls arm, he hasn’t touched any kids to my knowledge, but this whole situation still feels wrong.

The only evidence I have is witness testimonies.

And our principal is too concerned about the school looking good to care, we have won some amazing awards while this director has been here, and I think our principal is too worried about winning more to care about what he has done, and yes I have spoken to him about it.

Alright on to my question, for the last 3 months of school I’ve been giving 3 of my friends a ride to school every morning and every afternoon. It started off as a “yeah that would be cool to try out” because they live down the road from me so it isn’t actually that much hassle to do so. But towards the end of the year, a feeling of expectancy began to develop. I wanted to stay back at school in the afternoons to work in the welding shops (the only cool thing in the school) and my friends seemed slightly pissed that I wasn’t willing to give them a ride that afternoon. This happened rather often towards the end of the year as I tried to get my projects finished which really did bother me. Now I don’t blame them for being disappointed. Their options were to either take the 40 minute bus ride or ask their parents. I always gave them plenty of notice (about 45 minutes over text) with a reason for not being able to do so. Eventually I asked these people to let me have the last week to myself at which point they started bringing out all the guilt trips in the world to try and get me to give them a ride. Nevertheless I did not, but now they’re asking for “occasional” rides next year. Next year I will be in my senior year and also have to give my sister, who is in her sophomore year, rides in the mornings. I personally don’t want to give the people any rides out of fear that it will evolve, like it did this year, into an every day thing, which I cannot escape with ease. So, what should I do? Give them the occasional rides? And if it evolves into an every day thing should I pull the plug on it or not? Or should I say right from the start that I won’t give them ANY rides.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way.

48,"I don't think I'll be able to give the full context, but basically:

&amp;#x200B;

My cousins family in order of age consists of his father, his mother, himself, and his two little sisters. He is 18 years old.

We recently had a family reunion trip, and my family (my mother, younger sister, and I) had to stay with their family in one house. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we used to be very close when we were little because we lived together. He used to lie a lot to make up cool stories and we did not think much of it.

&amp;#x200B;

He is a pretty nice guy in person but in certain situations he would act very weird during the trip, specifically when he is upset. The first instance was when we were in a restaurant and he was upset because I guess he felt sick? But he would do weird things like bang his head against the wall in the car or just lay his head down and shake the table when we were seated. He would stop when I told him to but it was just strange to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the trip this behavior escalated to the point where I had to confront him in the basement while he was making a huge ruckus late at night (Banging the walls, breaking objects) fully prepared to defend myself but was sent back up by his mother whom he was arguing with. 

On the way back my sister explained the situation to me from what his little sister told her.

Basically he has been acting like this at home. He would have violent fits and sometimes they would escalate to the point where he would actually physically hurt his family members. He would also break objects in his house. It's actually kind of similar to a drunk dad coming home and wreaking havoc on his family.

Another thing worth mentioning that I already knew before this is that he is a HUGE liar. He constantly lies about everything with ease. He makes up stories all the time. Nothing he said on the trip was taken seriously by my sister and I because we either knew it was a lie already or the story was not believable anyway because he has literally always been like this.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a history of mental illness in our family so I guarantee there is something wrong with him. But the problem is getting him to seek professional help. Apparently his mom has tried to get him to see a professional but he would never actually go to the appointments when scheduled. On top of that he is 18 so he has the right to refuse help.

The worst part is I think he thinks there is nothing wrong with him, so he probably believes that he does not need professional help.

So my question is what can I do as an outside family member to get him to seek help? My sister and I has tried confronting him but depending on whether or not he was in snap mode he would either brush off what he say or escalate his tantrum.

In terms of drugs I know for a fact he does marijuana 24/7 because of videos on social media but idk of other drugs he could be doing.

I can give more details if needed but my main question is how can I get him to seek help before something irreversible happens?",08Jul2019,1
49,"So I need to take a certain physics class for my major, and I have two options of when to take it: summer or winter. Taking it during the school year really isn't a possibility for me. There are pros and cons to both times.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros for summer, I would get it over with, it'd be decently easy to plan when I can take the tests, and I've dealt with all the paperwork so now it's really a matter of just paying and taking the class.

Cons for summer are that it's expensive and while I do have the money needed to take it, it still won't be easy on my bank account, plus needing the textbook and to pay to use a testing center near me. It also will be hard to make sure I have the time for it, as I work a graveyard shift internship/job that takes a decent amount of my time (I do have time during the day though, four or five hours usually depending on when I get up). 

&amp;#x200B;

Pros for winter, I'll have a lot more time to dedicate to the class, I won't have an internship or anything taking up my time.   I'll be able to save up money from my internship and my job during the fall semester, so the price of the winter class won't hit as hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cons for winter, I have to deal with the paperwork of planning it, and I have to make sure that I can set up the testing centers/make sure it won't interfere with the beginning of my spring semester.

50,"i'm 13 years old and i'm not sure what i should do in my current situation.

my parents refuse to order food when the fridge is empty, they don't really actively cook or do anything. when they do order something, it's almost always chinese food. we barely if not rarely eat anything healthy. our house is also very poor, there's mice and cockroaches and there's always rotting garbage everywhere that they refuse to take out.  they have more than enough money to fix things around there but they're barely are putting the forward effort to do so. i haven't grocery shopped with my parents in at least 6 years.

&amp;#x200B;

i've told my parents i was concerned about this multiple times, but they just say their taking care of it although it's been almost 10 years now since they had this house and the condition just keeps degrading and degrading due to their neglect. i also consistently get threatened to be beaten or have something of mine be taken away if i try to disagree with them. i was beaten by my mother 6 times when i left the house by myself to purchase groceries when the fridge was empty for almost a week, and any improvements i try to do in this household just gets undo'ed by my parent's laziness and lack of progress.

&amp;#x200B;

so i'm not sure what to do anymore. i want to live in a comfortable household and i'm tired of all these major issues being neglected. i do have a older sibling so i'm not a only child, but he still lives with us and he's not really putting that much of a effort either. i'm too scared to call the cops and a crisis hotline i've texted wasn't that much help either. so what should i do?  i feel quite miserable.",08Jul2019,1
51,"I don't really know what I'm asking, but my dad called me today and talked to me about physician assisted suicide. He was saying it was good news that it was legal in our state, but I didn't really see his point of view on that until he mentioned that the doctor we saw said that if he operated, there was a chance that my dad would lose his penis, testes, and may need to evacuate through a tube. This would be worse than death for him, as he has said ever since he was diagnosed a few years ago. He has been keeping it in check since then by following a strict diet of sprouted seeds, wheatgrass, barley grass, and carrot juice. Recently, he has been secretly snacking on chocolate and coconut desserts, providing the sugar the tumor needed to almost double in size. He is in constant pain now that is unbearable unless he eats enough CBD to make him loopy. He is no longer able to take any trips with us out of the house, which I think was helping his mood. I could try to find some great surgeon to try to do the surgery, but I feel like that will just prolong the inevitable. I also don't want to watch him be in more and more pain and getting more irritable as his tumor grows unchecked. I'm pretty sure he also doesn't want to keep going the way he's headed - He snapped at me recently and has been really regretting it. The pain makes him irritated, and he doesn't want to take that out on his kids, leaving us with that memory. He wants us to remember him as he was, authentic and adventurous. I can see now why he wants to leave us sooner rather than later, and why it is good news that assisted suicide is legal in our home state.",08Jul2019,1
52," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'eh that lads just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she stared at me and quickly grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in this night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her wiping the table , she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit. The blonde walked towards me to  say bye on her way out smiling and the brunette was out before her holding her head a bit looking tipsy but the blonde seemed fine .

53,"I know no one is going to respond to this because whenever i post something here it gets 2-3 replies that don't help me at all and i end up deleting the post. 

It's just unbearable and i don't think it'll ever get better. It's too much. My parents are manipulative and abusive both mentally and physically. My siblings (1 boy, 1 girl) are extremely rude to me and have no respect towards me despite me being the oldest.

When i was younger my father used to beat me badly. He now stopped, but he keeps threatening me and sometimes even runs after me. Im fucking 18 years old but this fucking moron still thinks he can do this. 

Same with my bitch mom. Although she works for us just like my dad does, she's still extremely manipulative and abusive. While my father has stopped hitting me, she started doing it more and today she hit me so often that i had to punch something so i punched my desk till i broke my hand. I swear to god that im writing this with a broken hand because i got so angry that i punched my table. 

I dont really care if any of you believe me or not. Im just letting out anger so if you have any doubts fuck off. 

All of that because she screamed at me to pick some candy up i dropped earlier and didn't pick up. She's fucking insane!

My family is loud as fuck and just embarrassing. When i tell them to talk respectful to me they tell me to either move out or live with it.

I am definitely going to move out as soon as possible.

When i need money my mother gives it to me, because if i ask my dad, even if its 5 dollars he starts an argument about how i always want money, although i never want it from him, which is why my mother wanted to sign me up for my driver's license, but she keeps threatening me that she's not gonna do it and I've had enough. If i do it I'll pay for it myself.

We somehow are always low on money although both of my parents work and make decent money. They are 100% lying! Im not fucking retarded. 

Today my father told my and my brother that he wished he left us when we were younger, because we are such big disappointments to him and thst because of us he lost friends and time. 

My ex was a dumb, annoying and disguisting bitch who i hate so much that i dont even want to write about her in this post. 

All of my friends are annoying fucking assholes who always fuck with me in some kind of way.

One group of friends keeps insulting me for how i look or what i say.

The other one makes me feel left out or just gives me insecurities knowing damn well that i care alot about being invited to events.

The only 2 people i dont hate are my grandparents who have always been there for me.

I also have major anger issues i have to deal with, which makes this alot more complicated for me, because when these people annoy me i get angry really fast and make irrational decisions.

Everyone annoys me in some kind of way, but they do it so much, that i wish i could either change them or take them out of life. 

It seems like there is no escape for me. I fucking hate everyone and ones my grandparents are gone i have nothing, that keeps me here, which breaks my heart.",08Jul2019,1

Now, our drives to and from the school are quiet, just me, my brother, and this girl, I don’t know much about her and don’t really know how to connect with her. So can anyone give me advice as to how I can turn these awkward car drives around, and help me to ask her out?",08Jul2019,3
56,"This is pretty long so if you want to just skip to the last paragraph that works too!

Okay, so I (19 F) am usually really good around parents and they tend to be very found of me. Well, my best friend (19 F) has a pretty rocky relationship with her mom. 

Her mom will disrespect her a lot, disregard her opinion, in private she will yell at her, she will threaten to cut her off for nothing (the last time was two weeks ago because me and my bestie were going boating and she didn’t like that), and just stuff like that. 

My best friend is no angel, however, and is almost equally disrespectful back and has a tude. When I am with her and she is being sassy, her mom will text her and say she is being ugly or ask her to go to the bathroom with her to yell at her, but never calls her out blatantly in front of me. My bestie, on the other hand, will sometimes snap around other people and straight up tell her mom she is always mean to her. For example, yesterday I was with my bestie and all of her family/ relatives and her mom told everyone that she was really glad my bestie had me in her life because I am a very good and a kind friend, but my bestie was sad because her mom never says anything like that to her and in front of everyone goes “you never say nice things about me”. 

I don’t want y’all to get the wrong idea about my bestie, because while that sounds bitchy her mom was being a little bit mean to her all day and it built up to her snapping. 

After this incident we went up to our hotel room and she was crying about how her mom treats her and about how her mom likes me better and treats me way nicer. Her mom earlier that week had given me a bracelet from her jewelry box that she never wears but matches the bracelet I wear everyday, and my friend was sad because her mom has never given her anything from her jewelry box. I couldn’t not take it because that would have been rude and I honestly wasn’t expecting it at all. While I do not know if my best friend has or has not received jewelry from her moms jewelry box, my best friend has trouble seeing how much her parents give her and is under appreciative in my opinion. (She has many gucci and Luie stuff and David Yerman bracelets and doesn’t work and really can get anything she wants)

I told her she should talk to her mom and tell her how she feels, but she insisted her mom would never listen and just get mad at her.
My problem is that I just never know what to do in these situations. My mom and I are super close and so I never really have experienced this mutualistic destructive relationship. I also cannot find it in myself to be rude to her mom, because her mom has not been rude to me. I do not want my best friend to resent me because of how her mom treats me either. She is hands down the most important person in my life. I just do not really know what to do, should I start being less chatty with her mom, should I just continue being myself and let them fight, should I side with my friend? Currently I’ve been avoiding being around her mom to avoid the situations, but I’m just looking for advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation, where their friends mom treats you significantly better then them .",08Jul2019,1
58,"I seem to have a huge complication in my life. I don’t have friends. Whenever I start out getting to know someone, it is great. I introduce myself as liking instrumental music / liking to read books / being interested in politics. Everything goes well until I get to know the person more. Basically they start making fun of the things I like. They think that “ I think that I am better than everyone else”, “I am an asshole”, “a snowflake”. I am very sensitive, and I try to avoid confrontation, so I basically just ghost them. But I’m starting to notice, that not only am I getting into confrontations with these type of people, but I am also always fighting with a family member. I basically have no one to talk to. No friend, nothing. Even within my inner family I am despised by my siblings.
I can’t help but feel that something is wrong with me. Can someone tell me? No one seems to tell me what I am doing wrong. I am avoided by everyone.
I am an introverted person, so I don’t need many people to hang out with. But I at least need 1 person from outside my family, and I can’t seem to find someone that won’t make fun of my interests. At this point, the only people who share my interests and are like willingly hanging out with me, are my father, and my distant uncle.

67,"So I just graduated (with one more class to go) with a degree in Anthropology, and while I was in school I took a class that lead me to my current job, which is working with homeless youth and youth in foster care. At first I loved it because I was part time and could choose which shifts I wanted to pick up and had a ton of flexibility, but then a full time position opened and I jumped on it because I was really getting along with some of the youth and relate to them on many levels since I was given up by my parents when I was 13 and bounced around to different institutions until I was 17, and then found myself homeless.

Anyways, I've been working 40 hours a week since March when I went full time and it's been incredibly over stimulating. There are always a few kids who are extremely demanding of my attention (and by kids I mean ages 17-24), and who overwhelm me with their needs. I just kind of shut down and try to stay as calm as possible when this happens, but I'm starting to realize that this job working with so many people who need me emotionally is just not going to work out. I mean, I rationally empathize with them but all I can offer is logical advice which many don't seem to want.

Yesterday at work, I had a youth who is on the spectrum and is constantly demanding attention fuck with me really hard, to the point where my coworkers and I had to exit them from the program for a couple of days. On their way out, they told me to go fuck myself and that I was a bad person...etc etc. I'm highly sensitive, so I came home from work having a 4 1/2 panic attack that my fiancee had to calm me down from.

Obviously, this line of work isn't sustainable for me, and being recently diagnosed has made me realize that I should stray away from working with too many people for the sake of my sanity. I'm afraid to talk to my boss about this, but I'm going to ask to go down to part time when I see her on Monday. Any advice on talking to her?

71,"I grew up with a mom who highly values material possessions (to the point of posting pictures of new, expensive purchases on social media) and constantly brags about her success and fortune. It's something I'm embarrassed by, and I'm not sure if it makes me hypersensitive of my own behavior or if I truly am becoming my mom.

I own a business and am fortunate that it has been a successful venture. I am 26 years old, and for context none of my friends own businesses - many are a few years out of college or rising in their chosen careers.

When I talk about things that are happening in my day-to-day life with my friends or partner, I find myself internally cringing at the things that I say. Particularly when I speak to my partner, who I share more information with than my friends.

For example, I recently had my business valued. I was excited about the valuation because it far exceeded my expectations, and I shared the figure with my partner who of course was very happy for me. However, I left the conversation feeling like I just humble-bragged.

Another example: I had a meeting with my bank to gauge how far off I am from buying a home. It was a good meeting but for some reason I picked up the phone and texted my partner to let him know I just had my first meeting RE buying a home. I'm feeling really shitty about it now.

I don't know why I do this, or if it's even normal. Part of me wants to share these things with my partner because my future is also his future, but it pains me to think I would be anything like my mom.

The situation:

He (30m) seemed to have shown a lot of interest in person and he used to arrange for us to see each other a lot. He wasn't a big texter though and claimed to dislike social media, yet he seems to be online very frequently. I (21f) triple-texted him and since he hasn't responded, I do feel really embarrassed. I deleted our chats and I don't think I'd feel comfortable talking to him again unless he reached out to me properly. I'd probably bump into him in person someday soon too :/ The bad thing about the triple texting was that it was all a few days apart... One was to wish him luck and give thanks, one was to ask him how he's doing, and the last one was a song rec. He read them all immediately and left it at that.

In our last conversation in person he seemed happy. He suggested a potential meeting on any day we're both free, but we'd be seeing each other for sure someday soon (due to going to a same event). Though over text, I think he got annoyed with me talking about my negative emotions. His response was that I just have to get myself busy the first time I mentioned it, and the second time I mentioned it, he ignored it and sent a message of a different context (congratulating me for something). 

The worst part is that this isn't the first time for this to have happened.

75,"I’m 16 so I know that my brain is growing and this will probably change in the future. However, most of the things I will list are things that I had for my whole life.

1. I think very slowly, getting my brain to do the desirable action takes a very long time, especially when it’s logical thinking. Most of quick actions are based off memory and previous planning. 

1.5. My social skills are absolutely atrocious because of above. I always have to “question” myself before doing something, which can be a good thing, but it slows me down so much and I can’t do even repetitive tasks. Even after that, it’s usually the wrong decision. 

2. Every single time I do a certain action, I think of a better way to do the action 2 seconds later or 2 years later. It’s very frustrating to regret so many actions that your present self did and it loses the sense of trust in myself. 

3. I get distracted by my environment extremely easily, When I talk to someone, it’s common for me to ask me to repeat what they say due to the background noise. 

4. I get mental pauses where I just stop what I’m doing for a few seconds and stutter when speaking and go on “autopilot”. Even when I’m not speaking such a sophisticated conversation. These have been getting rarer and shorter recently though. 

5. My thoughts and emotions are spontaneous. I can go to happy to sad, quiet to loud in a matter of seconds and vice-versa. However, I’m mostly a calm, neutral person. 

I don’t think any of these were detected in my early life due to severe social anxiety throughout my early life. When I was 14, I was prescribed Zoloft to eradicate my social anxiety, and it worked, but it decreased my grades dramatically so I stopped(gradually). I don’t think I have any social anxiety. 

Also, my parents didn’t teach me how to socialize with American children, so I had developed those skills way too late in my life. 

This is my cry for help. My mother clearly displayed that she doesn’t know how to deal with mental health so asking her will just bring me to the wrong people. I want to solve this ASAP, before I get a job, before I start a new semester. Your move, internet.",08Jul2019,1

78,"I have multi-degenerative joint disease, recently exacerbated by an unfortunate mishap in February, which caused severe damage to many joints. I am now in real fucking pain and suffering and have serious thought of just ending it (which issue I will not discuss here, I only mention it to underscore how serious the situation is). There is only one viable treatment for my condition, a procedure which requires me to travel to an offshore site because it’s not FDA approved in the U.S. (it’s currently in early stages of trials but still probably 5-8 years from approval). I had this treatment two years ago and it was no miracle cure, but it did work, partially regenerated the cartilage in many of my joints and saved my ass from what was then very serious pain. After the Feb incident, I need another treatment, but don’t have the money. My dad offered to help. We aren’t super close, and I am very uncomfortable asking for money, so I threw out a figure knowing it was too small to cover all the joints necessary, and he agreed to it like it was no problem. I’m grateful for every cent, but I need 1.5-2x what I requested. I am so fucking uncomfortable asking for more, but my ass depends on it. I’m going to approach tomorrow asking for more.

79,"(TRIGGERS: Animal abuse, self harm, suicide, possibly neglect if youre uber sensitive to it)

Im on mobile, so I am sorry if things are mispelled or structured weird. Thick thumbs and weird Reddit layout don't combine well.

So, I have an autistic brother as the title says. I dont like the phrase ""severe autism"", but he is on the higher end of the spectrum. He is verbal, fortunately, but he has the mental age of ~7 and with a very low IQ (not like IQ really means much). Just for reference with puberty, he is 14. 

We were fortunate enough to get into a state/federal program (costs are split between the two, somehow, except the federal costs went down, but ill go into that later). This program accepts only 100 kids, starting from 8, and goes onto supporting them until they are 21. This program offers behavior techs, therapy, devices that may help in development, and even camps. So, for a long time, we had a behavior tech.

Before then, my brother at a young age could pin my overweight mother to the wall. He practically beat her. He was so oddly strong, Im wondering now if its due to some of the meds he was on. My mother always had black eyes, bloody noses, scratches, bite marks, bruises, and once my brother did something to me that resulted in double black eyes. It was so bad CPS was called in suspect that I was abused.

This behavior tech, now deemed BT1, really helped my brother learn basic human skills. Such as shopping, how to use a library, reading, how to deal with volume (both his voice, and external volume), how to take a break, ect. BT1 was amazing, an absolute doll. He had to go away after working with my brother for 4ish years, I think. I was pretty young, so I dont entirely remember when he started. But, I noticed a huge improvement. A remarkable improvment in volume and aggression.

After he left, around 4 years ago now, I noticed regression. Not as bad, but still. We got a new behavior tech. BH2. She was lazy, sat and worked on her novel while ignoring my brother, brought her kids over (but my bro could never go over to hers?), AND EVEN SLEPT ON THE JOB. My mother refused to listen to be because they happened to become close friends. She needed one, but we couldnt have a bad behavior tech in those formitive years. Even 12 year old me knew that.

In this time, he kept watching those weird Go Animate videos. Those GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED ones. I tried warning my mom that his behaviors started to correlate to his tantrums. He would purposefully hurt and say someone else did it to get them grounded. It kept getting worse, and worse, and worse. Until I was finally listened to. They ( BH2, Mom, and Dad) tried to do things about it, very weakly. None of it helped. Its all small stuff that doesnt matter. 

Now that he has formed to like watching others in pain, and sad, he craves it. He keeps hurting a dog we got a few months ago. ACTUALLY ABUSING A DOG. Our BH2, four years later, left due to budget cuts from that program. Mixed with teenage hormones, and learning insults, no behavior tech, and now my mom is having a mid life crisis, he is just terrible. I hate saying this, but I really dislike him. I dont want anything to do with him. He rubs shit on the walls and my tolietries (because, oh, by the way, 2 years after BH1 left he got BACK into that habit), constantly insults me, hurts my fucking dog and cats, and wont do jack. I cant hold him against the last part, but Im so angry with my parents focusing on themselves and not listening to me.  I cant really hold any of this against him, he doesnt know better.

In the meantime, since middle school, ive been experiencing depression symptoms and huge anxiety symptoms. Ive had these issues for 4 years, and after many many mentions, one suicide attempt, self harm. I still have not received help. My sister immediately got help for ADHD symptoms, but Im left in the dust. To help my brother, held to a high ass standard, and to deal with panic attacks alone.

I dont know what to do. This household gets more chaotic by the month. Any advice? Maybe resources to help push my brother to the right path? I really really really dont want him to be outcasted by society in his future. Ive tried to talk to my parents about it, but due to abuse from my mothers childhood, anything questioning her parenting leads to a massive emotional breakdown. A month ago she was in the hospital over it.  Im so so afraid of my brother completely regressing, and going back to hurting people. Hes already hit kids at school recently, he has given death threats to kids, he keeps hurting our dog, he is getting louder... he is almost as bad as he was when the program started. 

Sorry for the rambling. Im at a loss.",08Jul2019,1

I was homeschooled my entire life until college. After college, lived with my parents until I got married. They have always been pretty clingy.
Now I am married and live with my wife, but they will not stop calling me and texting me. When I don't reply to a text as soon as they would like they send a bombardment of texts, or just keep calling.
Today has been about 11 days since I saw them last and I told them we couldn't come to the house today. They continued their onslaught and started telling me that it was my wife's fault for me not seeing them. 

On the other hand my wife just wants me to stand up for me and our family, and I am stuck in the middle trying to make both parties happy.

82,"My grandma has been having a drink every day since as long as I could remember. I never really thought anything about it since she’s retired and thought she was responsibly drinking. 

Tonight, after she went to bed, my grandfather sat me down and pulled out a large bottle of scotch. He told me that she killed 3/4’s of the bottle in two days and she’s been drinking since 10:30am. I was quite baffled because she seems totally fine every day and she’s so nice and caring. 

My grandma has lost a sister to lung cancer and her son is addicted to harder drugs. I believe that is the reason she drinks so hard. In other words, my grandfather has a son that almost lost his life to heroin and a wife that has a heavy alcohol addiction. I feel so bad for my gma and gpa for separate reasons. I asked my grandpa if there’s anything I can do to help and he said no she has to want to get help and even if she does it’s a long road.

I was born right before he died so she didn't worry about me but when I was young she was adamant on telling me to not question things and has a regressive attitude.  The extent of her jealousy would be that her friends had a new purse and she didn't so she went to buy a new one to show off- this is middle school behavior.

88,"Apologies, for i am on mobile. 

My best friend ""Undies"" was my favorite cat. In late May, he went missing. I have been heartbroken ever since. Yesterday, we hopped over to Petco, and saw this little (but actually incredibly huge) cat. 

This cat is eight years old. She was given up by her owner, due to the lack of spare time for her. She is a very sweet cat. When we got her, we noticed two things. 

1: She is abnormally obese, probably around 20 pounds. 

2: She drank a lot of water. 

My first thought of course, was ""This kitty was probably fed human food for most of her life"". It also reoccurred to me that a diabetic cat is usually obese, and does drink lots of water. But I am not sure.

She has not gone to the bathroom, and it has been about 24 hours since we got her. We managed to get her to eat one pebble of cat food. But here is the twist. To get her to eat it, I had to dip it in a bit of cheese cake, for her to eat it. That is definitely not a good method, so I am wondering: How can I get Mika to eat her normal food? How can I get her to lose weight? 

There is a five day time period where a check up is free and we can make sure all is well with her. We are planning on doing that, so I will post an update on my big girl's health. 
TL;DR: Mika is an obese cat (possible diabetic) that refuses to eat other than human food. How can I get her to eat what she needs to?",08Jul2019,1

Usually I get treated like a kid and talked down to despite being 20 and am not asking for help or needing help when I am.

I was going to stay with the company through July of 2020 and then leave. The store was aware of this.

Reasons I want to leave: Move in with my fiancé and try out a new job. I also get a severance pay as well which would help me until I found a job. The severance would be roughly $4500.

Next, we stayed up late. Or, me and another of the girls. I guess they're in trouble for that. 

We went back to one of their other houses (they're moving) and we were picking up some stuff that was a bit gross, so I jokingly wiped my hands on their little sisters shirt (lets call her M). M ended up wiping me with mud, and I jokingly threw some grass at her (didn't expect it to hit her and it didn't). She threw grass in my face. I took the low road and I dumped some water on her as revenge and she dumped water on me and threw the top to the container at me (hit me in the back and hurt a lil). M's older sister ended up getting in trouble for talking to her in a certain way, I'm assuming after I walked away from getting water and a lid thrown on me by M. 

It's all my fault. M got the bruise because of my stupid shoe, her older sister got in trouble because she was defending me (i'm assuming), and their eldest sister is also in trouble for.... well, I don't really know exactly.

Our roommate has so graciously offered to act as Ted and will keep time for boyfriend while the other two friends and I look on and hear all of boyfriends thought processes and choices narrated (boyfriend also coincidentally loves explaining his methods of cooking so it’ll be like a little show for us). I’m not worried at all that we can all have fun and enjoy the evening with just boyfriend cooking and being challenged. 

The advice I need is about the food. I’m not super inclined to kitchens and have generally no knowledge in cooking. I was wondering what should I stock the kitchen with as food he can use in addition to the twelve basket ingredients, and then what should the twelve special basket ingredients be? 

I’ve been testing him to see how much he can think on his toes by playing a game when we go to the store: I pick out 4 random food items as we pass them and he tells me in full detail what he’d do. I know he’ll be fine with anything, as long as pimentos aren’t included (he hates pimentos). So I’m wondering how crazy I should go with the basket ingredients. 

Additionally, roommate and I are lumping funds together to get him kitchen related gifts that he’s been wanting: nice knives, a spring form pan, a set of smaller durable spatulas, and maybe some cool cooking gadget he doesn’t have. This makes me wonder if there’s any foods that go specifically with those tools he might want to make and if I can subtly push that with the ingredients chosen. 

So basically, what general foodstuffs should I stock the kitchen with, what would you suggest I put in the baskets, and how could I lean toward the tools he’ll be getting as gifts if I can? 

Thanks so much in advance for any and all advice!",08Jul2019,1
111,"This guy and I were together for several months, and last week he cut off all contact. He hasn't blocked me but will not reply to any text/call, will not even say goodbye. I try to move on but today I couldn't help but look at his social media. He seems happy and this girl was flirting with him, saying ""you have pretty eyes"" with heart emojis and there was flirting from him too. It just made me really jealous and angry and sad, and I know it's my own fault for looking at his instagram...i promise never to do it again because it hurts. He seems to be having fun and like i never existed, and i'm just this loser all alone. He told me he loved me and i'm his dream girl etc, but obviously it was all just pretend. I feel sick inside that somebody else gets to be with him...I haven't been with a lot of guys because i'm shy and not very social, so he really meant a lot to me and I thought he was the one...like finally, somebody loves me back? Just wish I could forget him and move on, i have no one to talk to so i'm on reddit. Feels like the end of the world. Thanks for taking the time to read, any advice is appreciated.",08Jul2019,3
112,"A year or so ago, I stayed in a hostel in Edinburgh, and there was a guy working there who was really chill to talk with. I am a bit of an insomniac, and he worked nights, so we chatted it up for a while for the duration of my stay. He had a super unusual name, so I remembered it, and he's been stuck in my head for a while. I joked while I was there that I was going to use his name in a novel someday, and I have since done so (he was cool with it when I said it, and the character isn't at ALL based on him, so it's all on the up and up). But I'd love to tell him that, maybe catch up. He was planning on studying linguistics at university, and he actually seemed to know what Classics was, which I appreciated. Idk, he was really friendly and had a good sense of humor. He also gave me a bunch of tips about exploring the city of Edinburgh, of which I took full advantage. It'd be cool to get in touch with him, if only to tell him that I totally stole his name for the book I was working on. 

&amp;#x200B;

How does one even begin to search for a missed connection like that? Especially internationally? Is it even worth doing? I know his first name, where he worked last winter, and the country in which he was living as of the beginning of this year (I went back to that hostel for a few nights for Hogmanay). That's about the extent of the information I have to work with. Is this a case for the Twitterverse, or what?",08Jul2019,1
114,"So I was invited to go to an academic all-girls camp mainly for high schoolers, although I just graduated high school and am 18. The counselors are my age and up. I get along with both the high schoolers and counselors.

One of the girls I got to know today and hoped to be kind of friends with .... well when we were doing some art, I found out some disturbing shit and I am very concerned and sad for her. But I don't know what to do.

She told me that she doesn't get along with her parents. Okay. Then she told me she doesn't feel anything towards them .... ""I don't want to be stereotypical, but they don't understand me"" .... and at some point she showed me scars on her arm and told me they don't care, and they are ruining her and she is already seeing effects. Finally she said that she doesn't think she will live much longer.

So yeah obviously during our conversation over drawing shit escalated. Now, death doesn't really make me freak out much. But I would really, really hate to see someone just die in vain.

I showed her my scar also on my arm back, and said that my parents didn't care either. I told her that she needs to put her foot down, and take care of her health -- when I realized my parents didn't care, I took the initiative to want to go to counseling and get medicine. (If her parents are against counseling, though, she will be stuck -- her school counselor just wants to talk to her parents as well.)

I also talked to her a bit about CPS, and explained that technically the minor has more power in the relationship -- the worst they will probably do is punish her or take away her phone, whereas she can call CPS or whatever or start a legal case. At which point she told me she already looked it up and you can't call CPS until you're 16?

So I told her I'm 18 and would call for her. I told her I would even talk to her parents. But nothing I say seemed to convince her to do much -- she seemed, well, really defeated already.

Also, when we were talking, she said at one point that her mom physically abused her when she was younger .... O.O

Again, she doesn't seem to want to change the situation. She said that getting foster parents or other parents or whatever would be too much of a change. She also said that she wants to manipulate her parents to get them to buy things for her, like some really small mini-house when she wants to move out. I explained to her why she shouldn't stoop to their level, but she seemed set on the idea.

Now, obviously, I don't want to live my life knowing a 13 y/o is going to go back home after this week and be degraded to the point that she kills herself. Something really needs to be done but she doesn't want to do anything about it. Isn't there anything I can do to stop this? I feel like the police should absolutely be involved. I have been thinking about getting her name and her parents' names tomorrow, and just calling the police or CPS on them. However, I am concerned if they end up not having enough evidence -- she will likely get abused either physically or verbally and it might drive her closer to suicide, especially since she doesn't want to move out or change her situation.

She stays at this camp overnight, but me and a couple other people are commuters, so I leave in the evening. It is Sunday night now and I met her today. I will probably see her tomorrow through Friday or Saturday (the last real camp activities are Friday, and Saturday is when check out is).

Please tell me what I need to do to stop this situation. If there is absolutely nothing I can safely do, please advise me on how to convince her to do something (although I would prefer to act myself).",08Jul2019,55

120,"So basically this started with me wanting several ""party"" drugs. I had safe dealers for drugs back where I used to live but here I knew no one and had to find new dealers.

121,"This is quite a complicated situation but I’ll try to explain everything briefly.
I told this guy I liked him, we talked about something sexual and I felt as if I exposed too much about myself and I stopped talking to him out of embarrassment. He completely understood I needed space and said he was alright with that... but I dragged it out for months. During those months he’d purposely make eye contact with me (and so would I) so I knew he wanted to talk to me again but I was filled with thoughts that maybe he didn’t like me the same way I like him. I’m always nervous around him, my face gets beet red, and I just get shy. He doesn’t show that. He has lots of girl friends so I noticed he talked with this girl a lot and got along really well wither  and I got jealous. So even more months go by.
A month ago I, a coward, knew he occasionally would look at what people like on Instagram so I’d like posts saying I’m sorry, those wholesome meme posts, and I realized he was responding to them by liking very similar posts (like the I’m sorry one he liked a “I forgive you” post)
i recently apologized saying I’m stupid for not talking to him, I’m childish etc. he was ok with everything and I was so happy. But he hasn’t texted me at all since then.

122,"Quite recently I (F19) joined tinder to explore my sexuality. I'm bicurious and have only hooked up with guys. On Friday, I matched with a girl (F21) and immediately we start chatting. She invites me over to ""hangout and make some fun memories."" Intrigued, I reply I'd be down. Because she lives in a different borough she offers to pick me up. Up until this point she has never specifically said that we were going back to her place. The words she used were ""you come through,"" and when I asked for her address she simply sent me it. She said she would be getting dinner in my borough anyway and would be able to pick me up after dinner around 10pm. She calls me right after dinner and says she's on her way to pick me up. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the part that gets me. 10 minutes before she arrives she texts me to tell me that she has a friend (M21) with her and we would be going to his place to smoke and have ""fun."" Ofcourse, I already gotten ready and didn't want to ruin the night so I asked if he would be ""hanging out with us tonight too?"" When she replied yes I just went with the flow. By now, I felt quite sketched because she has had many opportunities to tell me we weren't going to her place but her friends instead. She also made it sound as if we were going to be alone when she knew her friend was going to be there all along. Nevertheless, I went. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once we got back to the guys apartment we smoked, drank, and did coke. Within the first 20 minutes, her ""friend"" asked me if it would be cool if he joined if we got down to hooking up. Caught off guard, I didn't straight up say no but I implied that I was only attracted to the girl. As the night went on, we started dancing, I was high from smoking and coke, and we all ended up hooking up 3 way (no sex though). Before this, he has also told me several times (when the girl went out the room) that he wanted to make out with me and when I said no he would imply that I should leave soon/ getting late/ etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

This happened a few days ago and has gotten me irritated the more I thought about it. To be upfront, I didn't find this guy attractive at all. If I had wanted a threeway hookup I would've looked for that and not for girls on tinder. Although the hookup was consensual, I felt a little cornered into it because the girl was not upfront about another friend being there. She said SHE was picking me up but in reality it was her and her friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about it so much that I came up with the theory that this was their way of luring bi girls into hooking up with the guy. In exchange for free coke and weed, the girl posts on tinder to look for potential hookups for the guy. There are clues here and there that suggests that this isn't the first time they've invited bi girls over without being upfront about who would be there. One of the first questions she asked me on tinder were whether I was bi or lesbian. And in a conversation we had sharing weird tinder date stories, they brought up a time when they invited a girl that claimed she was bi over but when she showed up she was a complete dyke and they were both put off by that. Suggesting that this wasn't the first time they invited bi girls over. I would not have agreed to ""come through"" if I knew that meant I'd have to makeout with with a guy I wasn't attracted to.

Erm, maybe my feelings are shaping my world view here. 

I think to some extent there is truth to this statement. But at the same time I'm cognizant of the fact that I myself experience this very consciously. I just cannot help but look at a woman I perceive as less attractive, and value their opinions less, or devalue their character. Perhaps the most noticeable behavior of mine is that I always find myself liking attractive female YouTubers more. Considering their opinions more. Just in general.  I never seem to perceive an elderly woman's opinion as valuable. Call me a piece of shit or whatever I don't care. I don't enjoy having these thoughts and feelings. I'd like to change them.

Now this is where it gets *really* confusing. I myself experience gender dysphoria. And intend on transitioning. All my role models are women. And I actually exclusively relate to women.

127,"Okay, so the title is kinda click baity but forgive me as this is my first time using reddit and also I'm scum.

These past couple months have been absolutely crazy. 

To give context, I somehow got into university of Manchester doing a business course and was doing OK most of the year. 

Before I talk about the shroom part I want to state, I know this was my fault and the way u took the drugs was stupid... Its not drugs that are bad. 

On the last week of my exams, I decided to take shrooms(truffles mixed with shrooms) ... Even though I never had taken any crazy drugs properly before. I had done this as I have had many mental health issues before and had heard that shrooms have helped so many become better people. My issues were bad when I was young (12 ish) to the point I was hospitalised for months, but I recovered well and have lived a good life and no one could spot me having any mental issues out of a crowd.

Anyway, so long story short I took a shit tonne (nearly 20g which is crazy even for an experienced person) after doing an exam with a history of depression, anxiety and depersonalisation alone in the dark in my studio. 

I felt nothing for a half hour and decided to play some spiderman on my ps4, (oh yeah I was also fasting so no food for whole day) and I realised I was thirsty. I went to reach for my bottle and when I leaned back into the sofa...

Well I could see my self in third person, well that's what it felt like. I suddenly started to say "" no no no no no please no"" as I had this intense feeling of dread as if I'm dying. I force my wiggly body to the toilet and stare at myself in the mirror and I'm having a really bad trip so seeing myself felt sooo fkd up. Anyway, I was relieved by the fact this won't last long as it had felt like hours had gone by. I check the time and it had been 13 minutes. I started to panic even more, I was losing my mind hearing and seeing crazy things feeling like I was falling off a million storey tower. The exact feeling when u just drop ur new expensive phone in the toilet, but imagine that for 8 hours straight. 


Anyway, this fucked me up and the next day I still didn't feel right. I started watching videos on how people go into psychosis and go crazy after shrooms and even on Joe rogan podcast a guest saying his friend was never the same after a bad trip. I knew my life was over, all those psa we watched at school were right. 

I then got a fever of 40 degrees Celsius and went to hospital and they gave me a drip and said I had a viral infection, 

Again all this in my week of university finals... 

I started to get this feeling so strongly that nothing around me was real, I was like in an permanent high... I went to see my parents and didn't really recognise them. This is when I started to panic even more and cried for the first time in nearly five years or more. Nothing around me was real and I didn't know who I was. 

I realised I had a similar but not as intense feeling quite a bit in my past, and searched and realised I had something called a depersonalisation disorder which I asked a psychiatrist and confirmed with. 

Anyway this was around a month ago, I still am off and am on loads of meds but slowly getting better... But also not the same. I used to play story games for hours alone and that was paradise to me, now I hate being alone and start to get panic attacks... I have trouble sleeping and get intense nightmares when I do. 


Baically somehow I passed my first year uni with not a bad grade, something I didn't expect at all. I can easily progress onto next year.

But,  I had discussed with parents that I may stay here at home and relocate uni which is possible, but I don't know if I can mentally. I feel like I fucked up and now I'm going to downgrade a university and change my whole life even though I had a good future prospect in a good uni of Manchester. 

I know this was long but I would love any advice, I know I'll dwell on it and regret if I move back here at home in Wales. But I do want to stay sane, but. I don't know if I'm being a wuss if I stay at home I really am conflicted. If anyone has any knowledge about psychadelics am I broken forever now? If not how do I recover?

129,"This is confusing but basically, there’s a guy that I like. Really like, actually, and I’ve liked him for a while. The thing is he told me recently that he liked me and I completely freaked out because the prospect of a relationship is so daunting to me; my parents are unhappy in their marriage, both of my past relationships crashed and burned and I don’t feel good enough for anyone. I’ve always felt insecure about my body.

Because I freaked out and had completely no idea what to do, I told him I didn’t like him in that way. Now, a week later, I am so pissed because I made literally the worst decision ever. I so badly want to tell him why I lied and explain how I feel and how my insecurity makes me feel like I’m not good enough for him, but I’m scared that it’s too late. I can’t work up the courage to tell him.

We were close friends in the first place and now he keeps talking about other girls too, he was talking about going to a nightclub this Friday because he wants to try and get with a girl. I am so, so jealous. The thing is, I’m ashamed of myself because I have no right to be - as far as he knows I don’t like him and he’s just trying to move on.

I just don’t really know what to do. I want to tell him how I actually feel like I said but I really don’t want to mess him around and telling him that I like him would be doing just that. I just feel very, very stupid and lost because I know that I’ve lost out on a chance at happiness. 

I’m not sure where to go from here; I’ve wrestled with the thought of telling him but again I don’t want to mess him about.

130,"I’m going into my Junior year of high school in a month and time is going by fast I can’t believe I’m already into my third year of high school.  I’m a 15M and I’m scared of losing my closest friend who I consider my best friend.  I met him technically freshman year but we rarely ever talked until our sophomore year of high school.  I really didn’t expect to be close with him,  I thought he would just be a regular classmate who I only talked to in class.  But after talking, hanging out almost every single day,  we started being close friends and I really like hanging out with him,  he’s someone that I can trust,  tell him about anything,  he’s someone that I can go to for anything.  I forgot to mention that I’m gay,  I’m really not the flamboyant type of guy, and I dislike the people who right away assume that if a homosexual boy is hanging out with another boy who’s straight , that boy likes him.  It’s just not right to be assuming that without knowing about the person.  I’m a person that really didn’t have much friends due to my personality,  I was often bullied in middle school due to my sexuality and most of them were from guys.  I was “in the closet” for awhile until a classmate was looking through my backpack and saw my notebook that was often me writing about how I was going to tell my parents and if they would accept me for who I was.  The following day almost everyone from my grade level knew about me and a lot of them didn’t support me and were confused to why I wasn’t the flamboyant type.....I just wasn’t. They called names such as “fag” “faggot” “gays deserve to burn in hell” “you aren’t going to make any friends” etc. It was hard for me to talk to people and trying to make friends until high school.  Yes, I made a lot of friends freshman year but most of them were girls.  I wanted to have guy friends that I can really relate to.  But often my sexuality would get in the way which often really made me depressed, sad, etc.  Until Sophomore year when i met, who is now my closest friend.  I had only one class with him and in that class is when our friendship had started which I really didn’t expect to happen.  He’s straight so I thought that he wouldn’t really wanna be close friends due to my sexuality and the amount of people that would judge cause of that.  But I was wrong,  one day I told him that I was gay and he really didn’t care.  He had no problem with me being gay and I was really surprised and I wanted to cry because I’ve never had someone tell me that before.  I found someone that I can relate to and have a lot of things in common with a guy that wouldn’t judge.  I respect him so much and he’s the person that I trust the most. We talk almost everyday now and I still think about the day, when he said that he didn’t care about my sexuality because I was struggling for years to find someone that I could relate to.  Now we’re about to going into our junior year and I’m afraid that it’s not going to be the same and I know it won’t be,  I’m just afraid of losing him because junior year is often the most serious year for classes, grades etc.  I’m not really sure what I’m going to do or what to do when we do go back to school.

My parents are against me getting another. I’m not sure why when the piercing I want is also on my ear. I’d understand if we were talking about tattoos or  belly button maybe. But they really don’t want me to get anymore no matter how much I try to talk to them.

Recently I just met up with them and I've started to pick up on some things that I somehow didn't think about before. 

My parent constantly is high strung, stressed out, easily agitated, and plays victim when getting called out.

I don't know what's been going on at home while I've been away, but I worry about my younger siblings. One in particular who constantly gets screamed at because of their attitude, making it worse and not helping their relationship.

They will often make off handed remarks about us (jokingly but still hurtful to hear) like ""is it too late to abort/put up for adoption/drown/etc"" And when things get too bad they will often talk about killing themselves right in front of us, putting us all on edge and fearing what might come. They will start instigating my siblings attitude problem then bitch at them until they start crying and refuse to acknowledge that they're in the wrong on the situation.

I attend a preparatory school, for which obvious reasons I won’t be naming , and the school itself is not a bad place. It’s got good education quality, alright teachers and a tolerable student environment. So why would I want to change?

You see, the other school I’m considering enrolling into is actually quite similar to the one I’m currently in, with the one exception of their art program. I really want to enroll in their art program and my parents don’t have anything against me pursuing art as a passion, they just don’t want me pursuing it on *that* school.  It’s like they’ve been brainwashed to love my current school.

My current school allows for easy access into a university (both are from the same parent company) which is why my parents wish for me to stay. By easy access I mean that they’ll take you in as long as you have good enough grades, no application process.

But I do not wish to study in their associate college, I’ve been looking into other colleges and their animation program (what I’d like to study) seems so much better.

144,"I regret the way I've been behaving towards my parents and 2 of my 4 siblings but I also feel like the scapegoat / black sheep of the family and often feel unappreciated. I'm a 31 y/o female living at home with my parents (I've moved out before and leaving in Aug for grad school ) and have too many memories of fights with my parents. They are extremely loving and kind but they both can lose their tempers and say really hurtful things. Moreover, given that they are immigrants (I was born abroad but raised in the U.S. growing up) there were a lot of arguments around cultural differences that we still have today. For example, my mom is religious and homophobic and also treats my brothers like they are princes when they visit while I'm expected to do dishes and just be a coy woman in the corner. My parents love me unconditionally but I have memories of my mom luring me to a room when I was 3, for example, to beat me for using swear words around her friends (I had no clue what I was saying at the time) and many memories including recent ones of yelling matches where we both say hurtful things to one another but she would never dare speak to my younger brother like that. My relationship with my 2 siblings is stable and has at times been very positive. I've helped both of them overcome drug addictions and 1 of them created a lot of stress for me during his addiction and in high school (stealing from me, etc.) which he was fully recovered from. I'm proud of where both of my brothers are but I often feel like my family sees me as the complainer / trouble-maker because I try to have conversations about differences and sort things out verbally while everyone else likes to brush things under the carpet. This weekend my brothers were both over to visit and I got very ill on the 4th and my mom (in a bunch of stress about getting the house and meals ready for her royal sons) dismissed my illness as me not ""Eating good enough"" (her and my dad constantly remark about our diet since childhood which is a cultural thing but I've begged them to stop because they are completely wrong the majority of the time and it's really condescending) and treated me as the burden for being ill. I got frustrated and stayed in an Airbnb to avoid everyone. I feel like I'm pulling myself away from my family including other relatives (aunts, uncles, etc). because of all the horrifying stories, my mom has told me in recent years about how everyone treated her when my grandma was dying when she was a teenager and now I don't want anything to do with anyone. I also feel very alone and sad that no one has called to check in on me about my health and is pretending that all is fine and like I was exaggerating. To be fair in the past when I had a serious health issue 2 years ago everyone was very supportive but I feel like now they almost assumed that I'm trying to steal the spotlight or something when in fact I'm not feeling well. I also feel like I have supported others and stood up for them way more than anyone would for me. I feel like if the tables were turned I would go out of my way to find out what was going on with a sibling or relative as I've done in the past even going as far as ""overstepping"" to find out what was wrong when I could read that something was but in my case everyone seems unbothered. This is all starting to leave me very depressed and sad. I'm also the least religious person although I believe in God I just can't with the cult-y-ness of their flavor of religion and I find that it makes me appear even more problematic.

145,"Hi everyone,

For the record I’m 22 and my gf is 20

I met my gf just over a year ago and have been with here for about a year too.

Last year, a couple months into us dating, before any feelings had developed, I went out with some friends, got drunk and was approached by a girl, after drunk talking she got onto the subject of her boobs and asked if I’d like to touch them, I just thought “fuck it what’s the worst it could do” (famous last words) and that’s that.

Later on outside she came over to me when I was smoking, being very forward and flirty, trying to put my boobs in her face etc, placing my hand on her crotch.

I pulled away after a second and said I don’t wanna do this I’m dating someone.

The next day she texted me apologising and saying she was drunk etc, I said that’s fine but if I see you out again I won’t be talking to you, she understood.

At the time it didn’t bother me too much as there weren’t any real feelings between me and my current gf, but as the years gone by our feelings have grown a lot, and now the thought of it  happening makes me feel sick, and I think she has the right to know.

What I’m asking you guys is, should I just give her a general run down of what happened and explain it was very long ago and that I’m sorry? Or should I include all the details? I’d prefer not to because I think that’s unnecessarily going to make her more upset. 

I haven’t slept with, kissed or been romantic in anyway with anyone since I met my gf, other than this drunken boob touch incident short into our relationship, I just want to make that clear.

She loves me very much and I love her, but I don’t want to see her upset.

Any advice is appreciated thank you",08Jul2019,2
146,"I (18F) will have been dating my boyfriend (18M) for 2 years as of this August. We met our freshman year of high school and began dating early junior year. We will both be attending the same college but he will be living at home and I am moving out.

When I first met my boyfriend, he was quiet, funny, shy, and incredibly kind. He still is. But I also guess I have learned the other side of him from being a relationship with him for so long. He is very lazy, hard to talk to seriously, and unmotivated to do even simple things. I understand one might be quick to think this might be due to some underlying issue (like depression) but I assure you it’s just his personality. I guess I just worry because I know now that we see life from very different perspectives and want very different things out of it (i.e. He never wants to move out of our town, I do. He doesn’t even want to go to college, I do. He has no idea what he wants to do for a living, I do. He thinks it’s okay to not take showers/brush teeth, I think it’s gross.) I am in no way saying that his views of things is *wrong*, I’m just saying that they very much differ from mine. I have tried to talk to him about my feelings about these things and how I worry about our future if this is how things are more than once, and the conversation basically feels like me talking to a wall. I get absolutely nowhere other than empty promises that things might work out. 

I guess I just feel like this relationship isn’t really going anywhere. I love him to death and he treats me so well but I have a lot of doubt about our relationship working out.  What should I do?",08Jul2019,1
147,"How I feel is that I'm only living because I am supposed to. I feel like breaking down everyday because I just can't cope anymore. I am not suffering at all, it's mostly from thoughts and my imagination. I am 20 this year, and I just didn't know how detached I was from reality all these years.. detached from improving and where my life is heading from my habits and mindset. I am not really sure how this happened, but I think I have autism or I'm just overly socially awkward, people always think I'm not paying attention and most of the time I m not since kindergarten..I had friends but it was hard to connect to them and they soon realize there's really nothing much about me. I had a lot of trauma and abuse during childhood, it probably impacted me today, maybe caused me to have anxiety and over obedience. When I was 10, I found out a virtual world in internet, discovering that I can talk to people and be whoever I want in the world that's similar to real life. 

Ever since then I was no longer depressed and suicidal..i met so much friends, so much best friends, ex girlfriends all these years from that game. I didn't only play that game, I played other games as well. It's like my self esteem is based on games and how known or good I am at them. If I'm good at it then I'll usually act mature, but if it's a game thats a virtual world where I can't really be good at anything, I would troll in a inoffensive way and get attention. These years I have only been getting high from attention online and rarely caring about my life. I wasn't really entirely detached from real life..I still thought about how when I become older I'm going to study hard at college and get a good career and that I can't live like this forever.. but never really had friends. I'm still that socially awkward kid that could have autism from what I read. During these years I also fantasized a lot about my future life, fantasizing about owning a mansion with a swimming pool or I would rather not live at all. I think I really was living in my own head and world and I liked the feeling of it. I just wanted to neglect and avoid real life because I just don't have much in real life and I don't like the country that I am at born at that makes peasant money compared to the US and AUS. spending time playing games with my online friends that I met from that virtual world was my meaning of life. I was always still unsure about the future but still fantasized about it.now I'm like 20 and I still have nothing it's going to be July in 5 months I would ready be considered 21 without a diploma. Online friends I known since I was a young teenager are growing apart too, like having their own life now. This actually already happened since last year, and I have talked to them lesser. 

but I still had a gf, she was enough for me..this year she met new people online from another game, realized she liked them more and cut me off. I guess they are more normal than me, without the social problems IRL and doing better in life like in uni or college. This event was what broke me. Been 2 months since then I have just been laying down and don't want to do anything.. all I could do was just thought about what was wrong with me. we don't talk much anymore, I was hesitant on holding on to her and she surrendered even when she has a new online 21 year old boyfriend from a third world country now that's studying electrical engineering and a better person than me. She just left everything we had behind..and wants nothing to do with me. This girl is a little weird, I never really understood her as a person, shes eccentric. Now whenever we talk, theres just no spark..like we have nothing in common..like strangers..this could really be how I feel with anyone, always starting the conversation with how's your.../how are you. She was special to me, she cared about me for years, now she gives all her attention to someone else now that does deserve it more, that could help her become a better person and her schoolwork. while I'm here with nobody.. and I feel like I am about to die, she REPLACED me, she used to tell me everything.

 I'm not sure if anything could change how I feel about life.. I'm aware a lot of my mental flaws and I'm not even sure if I can fix them..black and white extreme thinking,often unaware I am only seeing from one perspective, superficial and difficulty seeing beneath the surface, too blunt, lack of context thinking, very weak core personality, low conscientiousness, low extroversion, high neuroticism, low openness to experience, I have narcicistic thinking too. I feel it, but I don't think it. I really just want to know if I will forever be like this because I'm just born like this and I won't go far? My goal in life is really just to live in a mansion with a swimming pool and a partner and never having to go out again. I really just hope maybe someone here can change my perspective about life here... But deep down I feel that there's no purpose in life..and kinda want reassurance that suicide for someone like me is the best choice. I am really just not sure what my problem really is now...how I feel about life is just so genuine, and makes sense for me.",08Jul2019,1

150,"so a few days ago me (16F) and some friends (16F), (18F), (18M) were drinking. I had too much. Way too much. We were dumb and were drinking at a playground. Friends left me with the older guy to get another guy. When they returned, I tried standing and fell flat on my face. Friends were freaked, ofc. Called a bunch of people to help get me in the car/make sure I was okay. They brought me home, I basically threw up everything. I was lucid but out of it. Pretty damn scary for all of us. It was a wakeup call to be safer about drinking and to make sure we do it in a safe place next time and drink safe amounts. We all realized this. 

Anyways, my friend told an older guy (19M) that this had happened, even though he frowns upon minors drinking (despite him having done shit with minors before. Ie, exchanged nudes with a 15F whilst he was 18.) Anyway he came over and gave me a huge lecture about how I shouldn't drink, I am a CHILD and am too young, etc. I should wait til I'm 18 (we live in US, still totally illegal) to drink. Yet he gave his own sister (17F) alcohol and ""drinking lessons"". 

He told me he knew who all my friends are and he would find out if I drank before 18. He said he would have to ""tell people"". Found out from friend (16F) that he meant he would tell my parents... They are extremely conservative and would never let me out again. Found out from another friend (18F) he said he'd ruin my life if he needed to by telling people. I'm very upset. Concern is fine, but he is NOT my parent, not even my brother. Him ordering me around and manipulating me is out of order. I don't drink often and never have I been this drunk.

&amp;#x200B;

Dad, you are probably the most man child person I ever know, and you happen to be my father. Your over the top screaming and tantrums, lack of being able to reason and listen to others, always thinking you're right, making others feel uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

You were never ready to be a father let alone a husband, Yes you may provide for the family but the stress and negativity you bring into the house every day is unbearable and has been unbearable for all my entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

Im sick of it at this point. Tbh, yes I would feel sad if you were to pass away, but at the same time, I wouldn't at the same time either. It would be mixed feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

You refuse therapy, you convince yourself that it is other factors that lead you to be angry/negative/and emotionally selfish when in fact it is ENTIRELY YOU.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone goes through trauma and shit and negative experiences, but you decide to hold on to them and let them take part in justifying your shitty behavior towards my mom and me. 

&amp;#x200B;

You are genuinely so blind that you cant see where you are wrong. Your sense of ego and pride block any vision or attempt that will help you become better.

&amp;#x200B;

You smoke everyday, and you drink everyday because of your stress, but if you learn that you can control that stress and how you deal with it PROPERLY AND IN A HEALTHY FASHION, you wouldnt be resorting to these negative crutches. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now you have high blood pressure. I wonder why? (Stress, smoking, excessive drinking)

&amp;#x200B;

You never learned how to tame your mind and you let it run wild, making you miserable. 

&amp;#x200B;

My goal in life is to never become a person like you and treat others the way you do. Its honestly pathetic and so negative.

&amp;#x200B;

IDK if you ever will genuinely change at your age now, and TBH, I am over the phase of wanting that father role, I had to look up to those around me and most importantly MYSELF growing up. Yeah it sucks, but hey I guess we dont get to choose our fathers.

They're divorced but I spend some weekends and summers with my mom and everything else with my dad.

My dad is kind of entitled and always thinks he's the smartest in the room, and he doesn't know when enough is enough. He's also homophobic. He has a horrible temper and gets mad at the smallest things. He doesn't try and sort things out when we fight. Whenever he gets realllyyy mad, he threatens to make me go live with my mom.

I'm insulted that he would threaten me in the first place, but also on my mother's behalf. Why is living with her used as a threat? I started hating him this year. He cares kinda I guess. But he's a horrible parent. He's also clingy and guilt trips me.
Then he called me an idiot.

My mother is the one I hate the least. Still hate her. She has also called me an idiot. Many times. Always says how I'm just like my father. She says I'm getting nowhere in life. 

She's also a bit hypocritical. We were going to a restaurant when she asked me if I had the pads in my shoes that are supposed to correct my walking patterns, when I said no, she got pissed. She asked me what I thought they were for, and since I didn't really have much of an opinion on them and I didn't really know, I just said I didn't know.

She then went on this rant about how I didn't think and I was just like my father, blah blah, whatever. And then she called me out for getting nowhere in life. A g a i n.

She also has a horrible temper.

I know they just care and stuff but it's getting me kinda down. I mean, they both call me out and how I'm just like the other, and I mean I'd say that they're pretty alike. Calling me an idiot and everything.

I'm just gonna work harder to spite them. I don't even want to make them proud anymore. I just want to prove them wrong.

I feel weird, I'm not even into my early teens yet.

This sucks. I feel like I shouldn't be complaining.",08Jul2019,1

I see so many people travelling and having fun on Instagram, meanwhile I’m sitting in my bed at 3pm watching Youtube.

Last month, he told me that when my friends came to visit this week, he’d take the three of us out to eat before our flight to LA. Today, he said that he may not be able to anymore because money is tight again. I had to ask him about it in order for him to tell me this. 
I’m perfectly fine with him not flying out, or not taking us out to eat. That’s totally okay, and I completely understand that money doesn’t always permit it. 
What’s not okay is him making plans promises that he can’t keep and not telling me when those plans and promises are cancelled. 
He’s done this so many times and I’m at my wits end. When he tells me things or makes plans, I don’t know if I can trust it. I don’t like not being able to trust my dad.

166,"Forgive the long post, I will try and summarize as best as I can.

Also, I will try and explain this without sounding racist myself but I do apologize if it does come across that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friend, M, has always been a liberal person. She makes her opinions very clear, especially pertaining to the black community. M grew up poor and in a predominately white town. 

As long as I have known her, almost 2 years now, she has mentioned over and over how she wishes she wasn't white, how white is ugly, and that she will NEVER date a white man because they don't have large penises. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago she picked up a high-end nanny job for a rich family that also happens to be half-black. This detail comes up a little later.

&amp;#x200B;

Within the last year, M has been acting more ""black"" I say this meaning NO offense, but she is now speaking in ebonics.

I also work in childcare and see M often, she has been speaking ebonics to her nanny-kids and has bragged to me about teaching them what ""entitled white woman means""

I feel this is racism. 

This 4'5 paper-white woman is saying to her 2-year-old nanny-kid 

""whatchu want, lil man?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He just so happens to be half-black so I'm not sure if this plays a part? I feel like she's characterizing black people and playing into a stereotype without even realizing it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto the next hurdle!

&amp;#x200B;

M has now started dating a man from Africa. In his culture, interracial dating/marriage is NOT ok. His church and parents don't even know he's with her. 

M is now trying to tell me that she hates her skin color, wants to tan, and that her naturally curly hair will make her boyfriend's church accept her. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I confront this? I think she is delusional about her race and appropriating African-americans. Its very uncomfortable watching her interact with her nanny-kids. It's uncomfortable when she comes over for a drink and suddenly starts saying things like ""shiiiiit man, why you so stupid?"" 

I guess I'm just asking for advice on how to confront the situation. Or maybe I'm the one being racist and assuming she's acting ""black""? 

I think I just need outside opinions on this.

167,"Hi guys, Im making two separate posts for two different shit situations in my life. heres another letter.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Universe or God or whoever runs this shit,

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry for being an asshole in life at times. As a kid growing up, I would sometimes get made fun of and get my fair share of rejection from girls and that would shape me to be an asshole at times to others online or in person. 

I also had to deal with a complicated emotionally abusive and angry/negative father at home too. 

I've been through a lot emotionally, but I always tried to stay positive and good.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up, I did grow into a new face and new body and that changed my life around in terms of girls being attracted to me and etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, now I am dealing with a face issue that misaligned some parts of my nose and jaw, damaging my physical appearance.

&amp;#x200B;

In life, I do have plans and I have a vision for life that I can be happy and content with. My face that I grew into was a huge part of that vision in terms of fame career, dating life, and etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ask that you can let my face thing I am going through heal completely and let me go back out to the world as a better and more positive person. Most importantly, if my face does come back fully, I will want nothing more than to get to work on what I want to accomplish and experience in life.

&amp;#x200B;

If I ever do reach that position of success and fame in MUSIC, I want to give back to the community and help other kids reach and do something in a musical career too.

&amp;#x200B;

I have plans for life. Intentions of gold and good for others and for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been a relatively good innocent kid. yes, Ive made mistakes here and there, but I ask that you can forgive me and allow me to heal through this FACE issue and get back out to the world. Meet the people, experience life, and accomplish what I want to.

Thank you for listening.",08Jul2019,0
169,"So here’s the situation:

I have a really good friend who is just perfect; funny, honest, open and accepting (of course everyone has their flaws, occasionally we might have a spat but nothing that doesn’t get solved within a day) and I always kinda had feelings for this friend but I’m fearful it might get weird and I’ll lose him and all the qualities I love. The beginning of this year, I learned that these feelings are mutual, I didn’t really know how to react and I was being pretty indecisive. So, I just explained that I didn’t want it to get weird and all that. There wasn’t really closure and I feel like we were both kinda confused, but that’s how we left it.

Fast forward to later this year, there’s this girl that I’ve had a crush on for years, although I didn’t really know her all that well. She got put in my class and the teacher partnered us up. I was pretty happy, but I discovered we don’t have that natural connection like the previous friend and I do and conversation wasn’t easy. I chalked it up to we’re both pretty antisocial and it’ll take a while for us to warm up to each other, and we kinda did. Later on I learned she liked me as well, and we are currently “dating”? But..I don’t know. I think she’s cute, and sometimes we have some really good conversations, but I feel like a lot of the time it’s kinda forced. I will say that I never really got a chance to talk to her in person other than in class sometimes. I don’t know if I’m convincing myself of this because I’ve liked her for so long. Fast forward again (Sorry this is getting long lol).

That friend from earlier, he just messaged me a few days ago. He told me when we talked before, he didn’t feel like we had closure and it messed him up emotionally the rest of the year, but he didn’t want to say anything. Sometimes he felt like the feelings were mutual and some days he felt like they weren’t. Apparently he was getting mixed signals from me (I felt horrible because I was completely oblivious). I didn’t know what to say again, but I knew I had to answer clearly this time because I didn’t want to make him feel worse than he already did. So, I just told him I wanted to stay friends. However, I feel like I messed up. I think we go well together, but at the same time I don’t want to lose the relationship we already have if something happens. I’m fearful. 

Advice I guess? Hopefully this wasn’t too all over the place.",08Jul2019,1
170,"Okay so I’m just going to jump right in, this may be long so I’m sorry about that but I would really appreciate any and all advice:)


So, I was in a relationship with someone who treated me amazingly until he started cheating and never stopped. We live an hour away from each other and I had gotten messages from two girls about a month apart asking if we were still together because he had spelt with them. When I called him about it the second time because I was dumb enough to forgive him the first time, he finally confessed and said not only did he sleep with those two girls but he flirted with many more and he said he didn’t feel guilty. Anyways about a month and a half ago (I think?) we just slowly got distanced and eventually we just assumed we were broken up.. now we’ve talk numerous times and he says he wants to try again and of course I do because I love him ( I know that sounds stupid and I constantly feel like that but feelings are feelings) but I feel he never respected me during our relationship and he had absolutely none for me now.. let me explain. 

When we together he was calling other girls cute and pretty and I’m not a controlling person in any way but that bothered me and after bringing it up multiple times he continued to and at that point it was no hope and I just “let it slide” even though I constantly worried about him cheating, then I found out he did:(  and now we’ve had multiple conversations all ending in the conclusion that we’re not talking to anyone else and we are going to try to eventually get back together but the other day I brought up the fact that him constantly showing off a bunch of female friends online (because he never once showed me off, my thought is probably because they’re prettier and our age difference is 2 1/2 years and he’s embarrassed of me..) anyways he said they’re just his friends and completely ignored the fact that I said it bothered me and other things I said letting out how I felt. He did it once again today and I’ve come to the conclusion that he has no respect for me. And for someone who’s in love with this horrible man, it hurts really really bad..

I should also add that he keeps asking me when we are going to make plans again because we live an hour away so it’s not as easy and I told him straight out that I suck at making plans like I feel weird asking people to do things with me and when someone asks “where do you wanna go” or “what do you want to do” I completely freeze and can’t think of anything, and he just said “okay let me know whenever” and all I could think is... um I just said I probably wouldn’t be able to think of plans and would appreciate it if he could think of something and just suggest it (I said it differently in the text) and I just am unsure what to do at this point... I don’t feel my heart can handle completely letting him go as I have depression and I am trying to heal from everything, but I really don’t feel like he cares/ has respect for me..

So I guess I’m just looking for options, opinions, and anyone able to give me advice on trying to fix this or trying to move on without completely cutting him off?

**sorry this is so long and I’m also sorry if some parts don’t make sense, I suck at trying to explain my problems lmao**

175,"So long story, I turn 29 on tuesday, thanks for reading if you do. I just recently got out of jail for a dwi that occurred last year. I was only there for a month after fighting it and ended up doing my sentence. My license is revoked for 18 months and then I have a breathalyzer for 18 months. So I came home and got a new apartment with my girlfriend, it started out rough, nothing but fighting for the first week and stressing me out and causing me to pack my things and move to my parents. They have been out of town and come back tomorrow. My family hates my girlfriend from all the stories I told them her freaking out in drunken rage and causing me to have bad anxiety and spiking my depression. Recently because of this I have been depressed and lonely and anxiety filled. My work is giving me time to get everything back in order. My girlfriend has apologized and I have seen her most of these past days. I feel happy when I'm in the apartment but i still have anxiety attacks that are down right debilitating. Now moving on to my parents, they are wonderful people, but unfortunatly my mother is a control freak and my father is a lawyer that doesnt know how to deal with anxiety and depression, I have tried to call for therapy. The biggest problem I'm having is that every time I've ever come home I end up getting kicked out over my mother being too controlling (demanding way to much, helicoptering, fighting for no reason) and my father has beaten me before and kicked me out over a silly Facebook post. Mind you I have had the best relationship with them since not living there. We can talk. Now they are about to come home, they are regular customers where I work and havnt heard of me not being there. Basically I have the choice of living with them, having my depression and anxiety spiral out of control to the point where I'm kicked out on the streets with nothing, or going back with my girlfriend and losing my family and work. I'm so terrified of being in my parents house and some how causing me to be in a worse situation then I'm already in. They tell me not to go back to her, saying history repeats itself, but if that's true then inevitably within a month I will be kicked out and in a worse spot than I already am. I wish I had someone that could give me an answer on what to do. I have been having more and more frequent panic attacks and I feel lower and lower being alone and screwing over the girl I love because i wanted to tell everyone my problems instead of dealing with them alone. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Parents and loss of their relationship eventually (or if I tell them I want to still live in my apartment and my girlfriend which would be an immediate lose of them and my work) or my girlfriend. It's just driving me deeper into depression. Idk what to do. Thank you for reading and hope I can get someone to talk too.",08Jul2019,1
176,"My friend (25F) and I (23F) decided to go to the gym together a while ago. The gym is near my place so she would just meet me at my place and we would go to the gym but their bathrooms only had 1 shower stall and they were gross so we decided to just shower at my place after our workouts. This seemed okay.  


Then I got a dog and the dog had severe separation anxiety so I couldn't go to the gym but I really wanted to so I asked my friend if she could go to the gym and then come over and watch my dog while I go to the gym and she said that was fine no problem and said that if we ever need someone to watch the dog just let her know and I thought wow that's so nice thank you. My boyfriend, my parents and I are going on a trip for 2 weeks so I asked if she could watch my dog for the 2 weeks and she can stay at my place.   


This is where things start to happen and before you say ""This is all your fault."" I know it is but now I need help to get out of it!  


My friend now doesn't leave my apartment until 4pm+ 3 days a week well after my workout. She just sits on her phone on my couch and doesn't leave until we haven't spoken for like 30 minutes. I told her that I wasn't going to the gym because i didn't feel well and she came over instead of going to the gym. I had to tell her to go to the gym. Since she is watching our dog for 2 weeks next week i gave her  the key to our place thinking she wouldn't abuse it. I was wrong. She doesn't even knock before she comes in she just walks right in. The apartment is all one room! What about my privacy. I told her the least she can do is knock before she comes in. As soon as we come back from holiday i'm taking back my key. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's been using my shower for months and doesn't even bring her own shampoo or anything she just uses ours. Whenever I am making something food wise for her she asks me to make some for her as well. I did these things at first for good hospitality but now she just acts like she lives here  and gets weirded out when I'm just in my jammies when she comes over. She even commented on me not wearing a bra and told me to put one on. This is my place!   


How do I set boundaries with her? My dog's separation anxiety is great now but he is  still a puppy so shouldn't be left alone for too long but she says she stays over so long because she wants our dog to get used to her. We owe her a lot for watching our dog and i'm not a confrontational person unless I'm mad so how do I go about doing this?   


TL;DR My friend doesn't leave my house for hours after we go to the gym and she is watching my dog for me while i'm on vacation so I gave her a key but now she is abusing it before we even leave the country and treating the place like she lives here and judging me in my own apartment.",08Jul2019,1
177,"Hi. I’m a 17 y/o girl who used to love science. I’ve read articles about how girls have equal interest in STEM until around my age and I always thought it was societal pressure and that I would always love STEM. Unfortunately I was wrong.

When I was around 13 I read tons of books about physics and would watch Veritasium and the Physics Girl and all types of engineering and science content. I would seek out new things going on in the scientific world and would pursue opportunities in Stem through my school. About a year ago, though, I went to a summer program to learn physics and calculus. I hated it. I didn’t like the people in my dorm (though I had some friends, i didnt fully participate in the social scene there), my bulimia got out of control, and I fell far behind very quickly. I was very shy and ashamed of not understanding the material so I never asked for help. I left early and went home. I am still ashamed of this and regret my decision.

Then again, I took college physics online this past school year. I again had so much trouble. I stayed up nights and nights trying to figure out problems and scoring 33s on quizzes. I crashed my car because I was blanking out about the course. I stayed up studying the night before for a quiz that day. I ended up with a 96, but I hated physics after that.

With calculus, i took Ap calc at my school which went well generally. I enjoyed the class, though I didn’t excel like I usually do in math classes and performed poorly compared to a new girl in my class. I ended up with a 100 in the class and a 4 on the AP exam.

My experiences in the classes, especially physics, has played a role in making me hate science and math and my passion for it has vanished. I want to rekindle it and I want to fix the problems in my own psychology that made me so sensitive to the point where I can’t handle these challenges at all. Maybe I’m not cut out for stem, but I hope I am.",08Jul2019,9
178,"\*\*Summary:\*\*After working for an organization for about 5 months I was terminated for “solicitation” and misusing company supplies. I was also accused of harassment. All of this happened because I referred my sister through the organization’s referral program.

**Preface**: I worked in a variety of social work jobs in college. Graduated college in 2017 and landed a part time job working with as an advisor for high-risk youth at a prestigious institution. After working there for a year, I landed the job I am posting about. My supervisor at this job had something against me, but I couldn't pinpoint it. I thought it was in my head up until this all went down.

I began working at my first full time professional job for a “Christian” nonprofit organization that focused on behavioral and mental health services. I was hired as a care coordinator, which allowed me to monitor and coordinate the care of at-risk youth, who were coming into our organization through a Washington State federally funded program (WISe).

Through our referral program, I had to sign a page stating that I understood the rules of the referral program, which basically stated that I would be receiving compensation if the person I referred received the job and then get further compensation if the person I referred worked at the organization for a certain amount of time. I read in our employee handbook that our organization had an “open-door” policy and based on my time with the organization and office culture felt comfortable talking with everyone at the organization, regardless of their hierarchy. I then devised a plan to get the word out about my sister and decided that it would be a great idea to share the referral letter with the program supervisors and lead care coordinators (basically experienced employees in the role that I was in).

I turned in the letter at about 12:30pm and received a call to go see HR at about 3:30pm. I did not think much of it, but when I got to the office, my supervisor, as well as our sole HR person, looked bothered. When I sat down, I could feel the uneasiness and they let me know that I was going to be written up for my actions. The HR representative let me know that she felt harassed because I had shared my referral letter with my colleagues. She had some of the referral letters that I had distributed in her hand and let me know that she took the liberty to take the letters out of the mailboxes of the people that I had shared them with. This took me aback and I swiftly apologized because I did not in any way mean to harass anyone. When I asked if I was going to be written up for harassment, my supervisor and HR person let me know that I was **not**going to be written up for harassment, but rather because I had used company supplies to distribute my referral letter. This surprised me more and I let them know that I did so because my actions were in agreeance with the employee manual and referral program rules; and was under the impression that the referral program was company business, but they were not having it and wrote me up anyway.

I was completely in shock after this happened and went straight to my office to write an apology email to all the people that I had given a letter to. The following day, I got a call to go to the HR office and again. I was greeted by my supervisor and HR rep and was given a letter. I was then told that I was going to be suspended for solicitation, which made my jaw drop. They followed that up with a question about why I had not CC’d them in the apology email, and I let them know that I had not CC’d them because I had apologized to them in person.

I was told that I would be suspended for a day and a half (I was called into the office on Wednesday and was told to go back at 11:30am on Friday). Right after this, my supervisor let me know that she wanted me to finish my paperwork and then head home when I was done.

The HR rep followed up with letting me know that if they decided to continue with my employment at the organization, I would be put in a work evaluation program to closely monitor my working capacities. Mind you, this is the first time that I had ever gotten in trouble in any job (professional or not), which made this situation more intimidating. I could not believe that this was happening to me.

I was then told again by the HR person that she felt harassed and that my actions were not acceptable. When I asked what solicitation meant, she refused to answer my question and told me that I could look it up on my own time, which infuriated me. My supervisor also chimed in and said that if I did not understand this situation then I did not understand boundaries, and this was a cause of concern because I could potentially cross boundaries with my clients. I let both of them know that I was being accused of some very serious things and I wanted to know what I was being accused of, which made them upset and prompted the HR person to tell me to turn in my keys and leave the premises.

I then gave the HR person my keys and let her know that my supervisor told me to finish my paperwork before I left and then proceeded to go to my office. The HR rep followed me to my office and refused to allow me on my computer to finish my paperwork and when I tried to leave my office, she proceeded to block the door way to not allow me to leave. At this time, an administrator had gotten to my office and proceeded to ask what was going on and that is when the HR person moved to get out of the way and I let the administrator know that I was told to leave the premises by the HR person, but was told by my supervisor to finish my paperwork.

The administrator told me that it would be best if I left the premises and I proceeded to gather my things and left. When I went back on Friday, I was handed a letter of termination by the program director and given a box with all of my personal belongings.

The letter stated that I was being terminated for soliciting, misusing company supplies, and for not leaving the premises when I was told to leave.

Is there anything that I can do? I feel like I was wrongfully terminated and was screwed over by two people (supervisor and HR rep), who potentially teamed up, to screw me over. What if these people have teamed up in the past to do this to others?",08Jul2019,0

I stood up walking to my car. I began to feel a fuzzy feeling in my abs and then my whole body. I began to sweat and I sat in my car and turned on the AC. I thought I was having a stroke or a seizure. texted my buddy and he came to see if I was okay. I went back to the bench drank some water and hit some fresh air. Slowly but surely I felt better.

Just got into a heated exchange with my friend about how much was spent, comments like awkward they spent more on the thank you gift then we did on the actual gift and mentions that their other kids got expensive jewellery for their baptisms. 

I’m floored, and embarrassed. How do I handle a situation where the gift receivers feel as though we did not spend enough for the gift (cheaped out)?

197,"I had been talking to this girl for a little while and we began to get closer (Let’s cal her girl A). I wasn’t attracted to her but apparently she really liked me, and one night she FaceTimed me with one of her friends(we’ll call her Girl B). That night I talked to both of them for like 6 hours and I became interested in her friend.

A few days later girl B snapped me saying I should date her friend and I said I don’t know if I actually like her. And we talked about that until our conversation switched focus onto her and I, and we began sending some sexual pictures and talking about  possibly having sex.

I was incredibly excited since the girl I started to become interested in had decided she liked me enough to have sex. And since I’m a 15 year old boy fucked up on hormones this was like a dream come true. 

And this excitement lasted for days, we would talk about when we were gonna meet up and what we were gonna do. And I started to like her more and more. I felt a connection with her from before we even spoke about sex, and that too was going to happen. Those were some of the most exciting days I’ve experienced. 

But it changed one day when she texted me saying that she felt terrible about how she betrayed her friend that likes me. Since I didn’t want to be a bad person I didn’t force her to stay with me or make her forget about her loyalty to her friends. So I said “you don’t have to be with me if you don’t want to betray your friend, but I do like you.” She seemed so grateful and asked for a day to think it through. 

The whole night I thought about that possibility that I could still be with her, but I knew deep down and I always knew deep down that the whole situation was to good to be true. The next morning she left me. 

That day I ignored my feelings and hung out with some of my friends. But at some point I started to think about the past few days and I started to get sad. Eventually I went home with two of my close friends and they comforted me while I cried for the first time since 6th grade. we stayed up all night talking about my problem and they related to me with their problems. And it helped.

The next morning another one of my friends said he was gonna text her to see what was going on. And reported to me that she still really likes me. And that she will try again when her friend isn’t in love with me. 

I’m not sure if she will come back to me. And if she does I’m not sure if I should go back to her. I’m mad that she didn’t think the situation through and just not talk to me in the first place, sparing my feelings. 

I can’t remember a time when I was this sad. I stopped working out which is my number one passion, I don’t seem to be very hungry anymore, and I don’t know when this will end.

Should I take her back if she wants in the future?

200,"My mother and I have always have close relationships with the people that come to work for us, but this case is special. About half a year ago a young and very shy man came to work (Let’s call him Tom) for us as a gardener. In such a short time he has become one of our best friends, he eats every meal with us, he helps my mother cook, they pick house decorations together, we go to the movies and shopping together, and he and I paint together.

 After a few months he started to also do housework so he just started to live with us (This is common where I’m from). Everything seemed perfect until we got closer to him and he confessed to us that he heard voices, had sudden mood drops and wanted to commit suicide. Sadly, I couldn’t help much because I was just in the process of moving to go to college, but my mother quickly started taking him to therapy sessions. Tom didn’t liked it, because he told us that his family had send him with one before, told him he was crazy and had to take medication that made him feel like a living zombie. This one turned out a lot better, he’s happy with her and started improving rapidly.

Sadly, this days aren’t being to great. He has turned more aggressive in the way he talks to/about his family, he’s been rejecting to hang out with my mum, he’s not answering my texts and to make it worse he often avoids eating (or eats virtually anything) because he wants to be skinnier. 

My mother and I always help the people that work for us, but most of the time that meant paying for things they couldn’t afford, like education, stuff for their children or medical things. This is something we’ve never faced before, I’m not there to help my mum and she doesn’t know what to do anymore. Can anybody suggest anything? We just want Tom to be alright and I want for my mum to feel good again too.

TLTR: My mother and I became best friends with our gardener, but he confessed to us that he hears voices, has mood drops and sometimes wants to commit suicide. My mother took him to therapy, things were going great, but now he’s being slightly agressive, antisocial and doesn’t want to eat anything because he wants to be skinnier.

204,"So i (17f) have been in the “talking stage” with a guy (19m) for nearly 11 months. I feel really stupid posting this but i’m at a loss because I’ve only really now realised how long it’s been and how he has never once talked about what “we” are or any conversation at all about a real relationship. i am pretty sure we aren’t in one. it’s just the same talking every day and i love it but it hurts that i cant call him mine. 

i’m wondering if someone with an outsiders perspective can tell me if i’m being a dumb naive dumbass because he is a little older. I’m wondering now if maybe he’s leading me on for some stuff but he doesn’t want to “commit” or be in a relationship w me. 

He lives far away enough that it took him a plane ride to see me once (he luckily managed to see me while coming to my area for a show) and when we met it was so amazing. we kissed a lot, walked around town for hours and just had so many laughs. 

it hurt me so bad to say goodbye to him. this all hurts me so much. i’ve cried every night since i met up with him. that’s how much i like this guy. 

but i’m kind of getting to a point where it hurts so much that it’s making me frustrated and making me not want to do it anymore.

this is where it takes a turn. another one of my coworkers who we will call drake i, knew about my thing i had with mikey. both mikey and i considered ourselves to be friends with drake, so it was a little awkward being around both of them at once. well, drake agreed to fish for answers as to what mikey's real feelings were towards me were. after chatting for around 10 minutes together, mikey asked to talk to me outside. he told me that he wasn't interested in anything more than ""friends,"" but he still wanted to be friends as i'm ""cute and funny and wonderful."" i am very disappointed since we did kiss and it really seemed like he was into me. should i stay friends with him, and maybe see what happens in the future? maybe he will change his mind? or should i just completely stop talking to him since we both clearly had different intentions in mind?

It took a year to even get back to some kind of normal. My boyfriend works full time and all the money he makes goes into his bank account that I have no access to. He does not give me money and I’m left with nothing everyday.

Am I wrong to ask for money? I’ll say this ...i am the least lazy person you’ll ever meet...I take care of the 3 kids and do everything else that’s needed....I don’t ask for help with anything house related and he doesn’t help me with the baby and def not the older boys (unless it’s playing outside) unless it’s dire emergency

208,"So the title sort of explains it but last year was mine (19M) and my best friend’s (19F) first year at college (university for non-Americans?) and after having known each other a while we discussed how we felt when we first met. At the time I was trying to move on since she was looking for someone else anyhow, however it’s been almost a year since we met and I still have feelings for her, now having really met her I moreso do. When we talked about it she said she thinks we’d work but didn’t want to risk the friendship. 

I don’t want to risk the friendship either, but I really think that this could work out for the better. 

Given that: A) we are both fairly new Christians and are at a relatively similar spiritual level
2) right now she isn’t in a relationship since her last person told her she needed to work on herself before she could be in a relationship
C) I would be perfectly happy if nothing happened and we just stayed friends, even though this seems like the perfect girl, I don’t care, I just want to protect her and see her happy, even if it means there’s always a part of me that regrets what didn’t come to pass 
4) based upon past interactions and previous conversations, and the atmosphere always being ambiguous at best

Should I let her know how I feel and see if she feels the same way? Should I let it be and see how things work out? Should I leave it alone and not risk anything at all? I’m just confused and looking for a bit of advice if you can help, thanks.  

P.S. I wouldn’t let anything change in the relationship we have if she rejected me, and she’s not the type of person to cut someone off just because they have feelings for her.

209,"I got my license later in life at 22. 2 years later, I had my first minor accident. I do not call it an accident but a setup by a scammer.

&amp;#x200B;

I took my mother to the post office and had a truck park over the line. My mother could not get into the vehicle due to it being too tight. I tried to back out and scratched a fender on the truck. My mom immediately forced me to admit to fault on the accident and we settled out of insurance for $500. I was vetoed to go to insurance because of the higher costs with a at fault on your record. The cost is highway robbery, it was a mark no bigger than a quarter and the guy just wanted money. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents take the guy's side and just say I was inexperienced driver. I however after the accident found a small dent on the door from where I believe the guy marked my door . It had the color of the guys truck on it. Thus he committed hit and run.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been 2 months and I still have anxiety about parking. I never want to go through that again. The car also has been in our garage as we are doing serious repairs to it. It was a used car and needed a lot of brake work along with tires and needed its transmission filter replaced.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother often brings this situation up. She said the guy was being honest and legit and not a scammer. My dad just says the new tires will help me make curves better (rubbing in my face about the situation).

I am very upset over the cost of the money we paid the guy. He should be paying me for the dent along with paying the scratch himself for setting me up and causing the wreck. My mother should never had made it my fault when it was not.

210,"Hi, sorry for the format I'm on mobile. 
I think this is my first post on Reddit, so that's a great introduction to me. 

So, while I am looking for advice I'm mostly screaming into the void because I've reached my breaking point and distracting myself with this post could potentially stop me from doing something stupid. 

Little intro, I live at home with my family. It is one of the most abusive households I've ever seen. For the longest time I thought the level of abuse I deal with on the daily was normal and every family deals with it too. I was about 15 when I realized that this isn't normal and that if the ministry was aware of exactly what I went through they would've separated me from my parents. And the abuse is ingrained into me so much that being forcibly removed from family is the worst outcome I could ever suffer, worse than death. 

But let's get into the meat of it. This has been the second time this week I've feared for my life at home. On July 3, I came home from my internship  and immediately I said something that pissed my father off and he started yelling at me, to the point I was very afraid that he was going to snap and potentially kill me. He had me pressed against the wall and I was trapped. I cried myself to sleep that night and went to work the next day like nothing happened. That's the cycle. The next few days were fine, and I've been actually happy. 

But today, July 7, my eldest brother decided to physically assault me. I'm stuck with a terrible dilemma of whether to report him or not. It's not the first time he's done it or even threatened to do it. But I'm very sick of living like this. The issue is that of i report him, ill get kicked out. I live in a city that's very expensive. I've been looking to move out since I was 18, I'm 21 now. And nothing. There are hardly any available places and if they are, they're shitholes that are way out of anyone's price range. Again with the abuse, I don't want to be separated from my family. 


Now, I want to report him because he deserves it. But, because I live in Canada there's no guarantee that crown would actually charge him. He's so sickly that they'd do anything to keep him out of the system. Man looks like a concentration survivor. He's actually dying. But he's very violent as well. And I feel like my story would seems very unbelievable to the police once they witness the state of him.

I just need to get out, but my internship does not pay. They are considering hiring me though. And I'm also going to school fulltime. I have no time, and no money. And even if I saved every penny and worked a dead end job I still couldn't afford to leave. It honestly seems the best option is to just end it. I would never, I've experienced the pain of losing someone like that. 

So tl;dr: I got assaulted my my brother and I can't decide on whether to report him or not.",08Jul2019,1
212,"Hello all. 22M. Instead of going to college/university I decided to start working. I work in a factory and have been there for 3+ years now. I make as much as I can in my position (about $19/hour) and I hate my job. 

I have suffered 2 injuries at work.
1. I was electrocuted and should have died. I now have PTSD and any flashes of light or any feeling of electricity going through me makes me have insane panic attacks. (About 2 years ago)
2. I threw my back out and am in constant pain now.  Have to go to physical therapy and I may have this pain forever. (Happened about 2 weeks ago)

I work 1st shift (7am-3:30pm) and if I want to move to a better position I will have to change back to 2nd shift (3pm-11:30pm) or 3rd shift (11pm-7:30am)

Music is my passion. I want to make metal music. I am currently forming a band and hopefully that takes off, but in all honesty making it big is not realistic. I know if I go to college/university it will be a complete waste of my time. There is nothing there that really interests me and it’s too expensive.

My brother moved to Chile (we are from the U.S.A.) and he says he’s the happiest he’s ever been. I feel I need to just leave, but I am currently living paycheck to paycheck, have started a relationship with an awesome woman, and have finally found members for my band. Also have plenty of friends in the area, and I have social anxiety so meeting new people is very hard for me. I don’t think a big move is right, but maybe I’m wrong. 

I’m looking for jobs in HR or literally anything that won’t destroy my body like my current job has been. I have been met with jobs that require experience, degrees, or just straight up don’t want me. I need a job to have money, I need money to live, but I don’t want to sacrifice my body and my happiness.

My parents are both extremely abusive and are extremely manipulative. They’ve both socially isolated me since I was a child and I don’t have any type of life skills at all.

I’m not allowed to see anyone who isn’t a family member. I wasn’t allowed to file for FASFA and I wasn’t allowed to apply to any colleges. I’m not allowed to learn how to drive, cook, do laundry, anything financial, and I’m not allowed to even learn how to put up my hair. I’m also not allowed to get a job. I’m not allowed to see my boyfriend or friends AT ALL. I’m not allowed to have my legal documents. I don’t even know my SSN. 

My parents don’t care that I’m an adult. They don’t care that I’m graduated out of high school. I’m still a child. 

My grandma has offered to let me move in with her since my boyfriend’s family can’t really support adding me into their home and because everyone is against it because of religious reasons. I’m staying with my grandma for the summer and I don’t know what will happen to me after it’s becomes August. 

My dad told me yesterday that the reason he won’t let me leave my house is because I’ll get kidnapped, raped, and killed. I could also get into a car crash and die. 

My mom told me yesterday too that I’m not moving in with my grandma under any circumstances and that I’m still her child and I have to do what she says. I’m not allowed to have free range over anything in my life. 

A lot of people have told me to go to the police and social services and tell them about the abuse and to get a restraining order against both of them. The thing is I’m too terrified to contact them myself, I’m weak I know, and I can’t really prove the abuse because it’s all verbal, emotional and mental. My parents will both charm their ways out of it too and make it seem like I have the problems. 

I cannot record the abuse on my phone because my dad doesn’t know I have one and because he’s the main abuser. My mom will rat me out if she finds out that I recorded it and it’ll all fall apart. Someone also said that I could use these rants and vents as way to prove it but I once read about someone who did that exact thing and it failed. 

Someone also once said that I have to go to court over this and that is something that I do not want to do at all. 

I’m too terrified to do anything. No one else will do anything because it has to be me who does this. Plus no one in my family wants to get involved because child abuse doesn’t exist. It’s all a part of growing up. 

I truly hate myself for being so scared and weak.  It could all go away with a simple phone call but I rather sit and suffer out of fear. Maybe I do deserve this because of it.",08Jul2019,2
215,"29/M Well lost my job and I could just move back in with my mom. I just can’t get myself to tell her I lost my job as I’ve been such a screwup my whole life and finally had a real job. I start a new job tomorrow that’s not as good. But I’ve already sold my tv and Xbox and still need more money to pay my car insurance and food. Anyways, I was thinking I wait until I get my first paycheck from my new job and just say I like it better?",08Jul2019,2
217,There’s this girl I wanna be friends with and well I don’t think she wants to be like close friends and well I wanna tell her but I don’t wanna be a clown I don’t know what to do,08Jul2019,1
219,"To give you some context, my parents are divorced. A while after, my dad moved back in with my grandparents.  I lived with my mom in another state for a couple of years after they got divorced, and I moved in with my dad and grandparents when I was 3-4. 

So, my grandparents are freaks. I've lived with them for about a decade now and I hate them. They constantly belittle me, call me names, make us do simple things for them, and use the fact that they parent my little sister and I as defense against this, when we have the courage to talk back when they scream at us. 

I think my grandpa's a pedophile/hebephile. He always stares at my chest, especially when I'm in a bathing suit. When we're walking together, just us two or not, he always make sure that I'm ahead of him, and I think he's looking at my butt a all whenever he does it. One time, my grandma was out of town, so he had to wake my sister and I up. He screamed up the stairs, whatever, we started getting ready for school. Then about 5 minutes later, he came up the stairs, (we don't have a door and share a room, it's an open space) he looked at us getting dressed. I immediately grabbed the nearest blanket to cover up, and he yelled at me for it. He's also demanding, and gets extremely mad when he doesn't get his way. He's also very racist. Once, my sister, my grandma, him and I were watching TV. Idk or remember what happened, but at one point he said ""And that why you never date black guys!"" and chuckled to himself.

My grandma is extremely overprotective and just, ugh. She constantly calls me a fat bitch, a worthless piece of shit, tells me no one will ever love me, calls my mom a slut, and just makes me feel so worthless, sometimes I've wanted to kill myself after her little yelling tangents about how I never do anything around the house or cook or clean, etc. Just today she yelled at us when my sister told her Cameron Boyce died because she thought he had overdosed on drugs. We told her how he actually died, she just screamed at us. She calls me ugly and that if I don't ""get off that damn phone you'll end up working at McDonald's"" and that I'm such a dumb slut I'll have 30 kids when I'm older. The lowest grade I've ever gotten was a B-. I could go on, but I don't want to bore you. 

As for my dad, he's perfectly fine. He's nice and probably one of the funniest people I've ever met.  And yes, he has a job.",08Jul2019,1
220,"I work in fast food basically and I’m applying for new places. Is it alright to just quit once I find a new job? Since it is fast food I feel like there’s ALWAYS someone else that can take my position (I’m cashier). My coworkers and manager don’t even like me that much, so if I were to go to give a 2 week notice things would probably not go well and they would probably be even more strict with me for no reason. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",08Jul2019,1
221,"My friend gotten upset that i wasnʻt sad about her brothers dog having to be put down, and she got mad and hung up on me because i wasnʻt looking at a photo of him. I just wasnʻt interested? The things i find sad she doesnʻt care about, i care about sea creatures and the ocean while she cares about land animals. I donʻt get upset when she doesnʻt want to look at jellyfish or sharks yet for her to yell at me and hang up because i wasnʻt sad about her brothers dog and didnʻt want to see a photo of it just seems outrageous? I get that people are extremely attached to their pets and stuff and iʻm that way with sea creatures and the ocean, i said that i felt bad for him so it wasnʻt like i was being a complete jerk. I just donʻt get why she over reacted, when it wasnʻt her dog and she never went around it",08Jul2019,1
222,"I was going to post in r/mommit but this seemed more appropriate. So the short version is: I have lots of ideas for blog content (mostly about kid activities, gift giving for kids, ridiculing outrageous products and trends in parenting, maybe some personal stuff) and a little bit of how I’d execute this. Thought of doing a shop eventually to go with it but that’s not as important. Basically I want to blog the way I’d want to see it more often; being honest about what sucks as a parent, finding practical and cheap things to enjoy, teaching your kids good skills and fun things. Is this a niche that could work out? Or is the internet over saturated with mom blogs already?

More info: I spent several years working in small toy stores, and with young kids in an after school program. I have my own kid now and stay home, so I get bored and have no more hobbies that I enjoy/have much time for, as well as no friends (recently moved). Really I want to be able to sink myself into something that feels like I get some connection and reactions from other people, as well as helping in little ways. I hate seeing recommendations for $50 kids clothes or lavish theme parties, telling moms to treat themselves with $200 jeans “that are so worth it”. But that’s just me. 

Thanks for any advice or tips, I just need some encouragement I guess!",08Jul2019,1
223,"I’m a 23 year old guy and I’m into women. Next month, I’ll start my junior year of college as a financing major. I’m quiet and lack confidence so I’ve never had a girlfriend or even been on a single date.

About me: I’m short, only about 5’8” with an average physique. I live with my parents. I attend college full time and paint houses part time. I don’t work for anybody, I started and own the painting business myself. I play guitar. I only have one friend, and we play guitar together. Also, I love basketball.

So obviously, I’m getting older. I really want a girl to share all of life’s ups and downs with. I don’t know if I’m dateable. What do you think? Is there a girl that could actually find me attractive? To this point I’ve never really put much effort into dating because I figured there’d be no interest in me. Do you think I’ll grow to regret that as I get older?",08Jul2019,1
224,"I work in political campaigns. More specifically, I organize activists into teams, train them, and deploy them into contested neighborhoods to advocate on behalf of my candidate. 

This is a large, visible operation involving hundreds of volunteers just in the geographical district I am in charge of. The volunteers are of all kinds, socioeconomic class, ethno-racial groups, age, gender, etc. 

I am thinking I should create a team or a series of teams, where I put exclusively young girls in, and I have trusted older ladies as their team managers. 

This is to minimize any chance of any of them feeling creeped out or uncomfortable, and offer an environment where they are guided by a strong older female figure. I also want to develop them into leaders of tomorrow, and I think having successful women guide them is the way to go. 

Segregation by gender, do you think that is sexism? overthinking? or just good planning?",08Jul2019,2
226,"I've been with my therapist for a little over three years now. I started with her due to my fathers illness, which I didn't know how to cope with- it was very overwhelming. It was a very rough few years, which really hit rock bottom when I lost him back in the fall. We've (therapist and I) always had a great relationship- she was very maternal and extremely concerned/caring, even to the point of breaking down in tears a few times after I divulged certain things. I could tell that she really cared- she was the first therapist I ever clicked with and stuck it out with. For the first year or so I was going weekly, sometimes even twice a week, but eventually started going infrequently as I saw the need. Over the last year I really only went maybe less than a dozen times. The thing is, she has a very niche speciality, which we very quickly disregarded and moved past- it just became (very expensive) talk therapy, but I was ok with that since it was what I needed then. I can't even remember the last time I went in- gotta' be at least four months ago-, but I sort of decided that session that I didn't need therapy anymore. I learned that the answers to all my problems were 100% within me and that nobody else could fix me but me. She knew that the last year in particular had been especially difficult and told me she'd give me as many free sessions as I needed until I was back on my feet. It was a very grand gesture and while I would have been in there daily, I didn't want to take advantage of it and just went in twice- also with dad in the final weeks of his life, I just didn't have the time. Then I went back once (the last time I went) after a hiatus of a couple of months. She knew I'd been out of work for a year or more and was struggling in a lot of ways. One day I get an e-mail from her saying I owed her $600- $400 for the two sessions before the hiatus and $200 for the one after I got back. Her rate is $200/hour, but I gotta' say I was seriously shocked to see this bill, especially after she'd made it explicitly clear that she'd see me pro bono until I got back on my feet. I'm not a confrontational type whatsoever, so just told her I'd pay her as soon as I got some work and made some money. I still haven't made any money, going on almost two years now, but have had instances where I've e-mailed her just venting and she hasn't replied once. She always used to reply with great insights and was generally quite helpful/calming, but since I haven't yet paid her she hasn't replied once. I'm kind of shocked and in disbelief as I never in a million years would have expected her of all people to behave in such a manner. I understand that I'm the asshole here for not having paid her yet, but she did offer her services for free after all. I've paid her countless thousands to date and genuinely believed we had a very special bond that transcended your average patient-therapist bond, but I guess it was all an act on her end. She was a special figure in my life, but I feel genuinely betrayed. Were I still genuinely in need or dependant on therapy as I was early on, I can't imagine how much this would have fucked me up... thankfully that last session I decided I wouldn't go back anymore as I realized it was up to me to fix me.",08Jul2019,1
227,"so heres the story, im 19 shes 19 and we have been together for 3 years now with a break in between. everything was good for abit and we had a strong bond but over time it just seemed to fade away. Tonight, she said she wanted to go to her moms with me and do stuff on our day off (Usually shopping, entertainment,etc) and I said to her ""I was hoping we could stay home and just relax"" and we end up getting into a huge dissagreement about how I play too much video games and I dont ever want to do anything with her and that i dont understand her. I dont know if im genuinly being an asshole for just trying to talk about it or what. I do love her atleast to my knowledge, but at the same time i dont feel like i should be someone im not if in the end im just not feeling like im me. I believe i should be able to have a say in what i do in my life. I just dont know if whether i actually have a problem with video games or if shes being unfair in the way shes acting. She also just walked out on me and she refuses to talk to me because i dont understand, she biked away in the rain literally. Im not really sure what to do at this point.",08Jul2019,2
228,"Currently I am 17 years old and quite honestly my parents are emotionally abusive. I have taken quite awhile to realize this and it truly cuts deep especially considering how much I love my dad. My mom is dead (died about 6 months ago) so I am living with my dad and step mom. They have been allowing my drug addict cousin to stay with us despite him being 20. He consistently lies and manipulates my younger siblings. My parents refuse to kick him out and it is seriously taking a toll on my mental health. 

I know it sounds like an edgy teen move, but I think it would be best if I moved out as soon as I turned 18 (in February next year). I am currently taking online summer classes and I will only have 5 classes once school starts, so I can work again. I do want to finish high school and go to college to get my bachelors in chemistry. I have 9 months of experience working at a pizza place and even got employee of the month. I also will have about 20+ hours of volunteer experience as the summer ends. 

I am in a serious relationship right now and he has been so supportive. He just turned 19 and honestly if I needed to I could live with him when I’m 18, but his house has its own set of issues. He is currently unemployed, but just got some interviews. I do not want to be forced to be financially dependent on him though. 

I am very serious about my current home taking a toll on my mental health. I am in therapy right now and it has done loads, but there is loads of issues in my current environment. 

I am really tied up to my dad right now. He owes me $1300 which he borrowed for a vacation (this money I was saving for college). He also gave me an old car (still needs some repairs). I don’t have my license yet, but I have a permit.

They say I don’t know what misery is (they know my mom was a drug addict and I was right in the middle of a lot of it) and they believe I am miserable here by choice. I am willing stick out 8 more months here, but I need to prepare.

How can I prepare? What can I do to avoid my parents trying to mess me up? If anyone could link videos or sites about money basics it would be fantastic (I have read a little Dave Ramsey, but I don’t know what expenses I will have). 
This is a long post, but I appreciate any and all feedback.",08Jul2019,1
229,"So its late at night like 11:00 and this girl I have been talking to says she is bored and asked me to give her something to do. This girl and I are constantly flirting with each other also whenever we see each other but we aren't dating or haven't gone on a date yet. 

We were both in bed because it was late, so when she asked this I was confused and didnt know how to respond. I told her to just fall asleep but she said ""Ew no thats not fun."" 

So if another time she tells me she is bored and asks for me to give her something to do what should I respond with? Idk if she is looking for something specific or not.",08Jul2019,2

However, I skipped a day of reading because I was so busy and had no time to read. The day after that I picked up the book again but I wasn’t nearly as intrigued with it as I was before.

233,"I'd like to start by mentioning that english is not my mother language, and that I'll probably end up mixing topics.

&amp;#x200B;

   As far as I can remember, I have never been an affective or demostrative kind of person. Not to an extreme, but I've been told many times that I'm ""cold"" (I want to mention that I'm from Argentina, a place where often people is referred to as ""extremely warm"" and... you know).I lost my father when I was 11 years old, in 2008. He had a heart attack, was hospitalized and after two weeks (two weeks where I never visited him, even though I loved him) he came back home. That same day, we had lunch, did a couple of chores at home, and he went to take a nap. He died that afternoon. I cant really describe it. I think about that day and those that followed, and it looks like I was in auto-pilot.

   This year, my mom died. She had breast cancer for like 4 years.

   She had her left breast removed first, and it was followed by 4-5 years of chemo therapy, to prevent it from expanding to other parts of her body. She remained cancer free while doing it.

   She was always positive, she was more worried about not being a problem for my two sisters and I than about her illness.

   Starting around october of past year, she started losing energy, and will. In my head I thought ""it's normal, she's been fighting death for years, you can't keep up a good spirit for ever"". It was getting a little worse with time.Small info: I entered Police Infantry academy on February 25 this year. I live there from sunday to friday, without cell phone, radio, tv, nothing. 

   One day coming  back home, my sister told me that mom had to do some studies with her oncologist, and results would be ready in 2 weeks.

   Two weeks after, again I'm coming back home. My sister gives me the news, the cancer had expanded to the liver, lungs, and adrenal gland. I instantly googled the symptoms, and they had been there for months without us knowing: yellowish eyes, low energy, and having less and less ability to move each day. I investigated and got to know that liver cancer was one of the fastest ones, so I accepted the fact that she was gonna die sooner than I expected.That day, I felt despair and a fear in my chest I never felt before.

   A couple weeks passed, every weekend I'd get home, I'd see some insanely fast progress in her illess. First, she needed a device to be able to walk, as she didnt have enough strenght to walk on her own. Next weekend she could not get up from the couch, nor walk even with the device. Next one, she spent her days in bed, eating and going to a ""bathroom"" device in her room. And the last one, when I came home (a thursday, festive day), she couldn't even use the bathroom, me and/or my sisters had to help her get up, do her thing, then back to the bed. That weekend, on sunday, she started feeling an immense pain. We called the ambulance, but we knew it was time. While we waited for it, my sister was preparing my mom's documents, while I held her hand trying to calm her. My aunt also arrived home. I asked her, while she was in pain, ""Are you calm?"". I now realize that I wasn't trying to console her, I was trying to console myself, the woman I know would have said ""yes, I am"", even though she knew she was about to die. But not this time, she just answered that she wanted the pain to go away, and to be able to sleep peacefully at least a bit.

   That morning she got hospitalized. Before we left, she wanted to be sure and told the three of us ""Please go on with your lives"", to which we all responded that we would, and that we loved her. We went home, and later I started my way back to the academy.   
   Monday morning, just a little after we woke up at 5 a.m, my instructor orders me to go downstairs. When I get to the entrance, I see my brother in law, with red, bright eyes, then I knew it was over...  


   Now, after all that writing, that is more of a vent for me than a context for all of you, here is the deal: Neither when my father died, nor when my mother died, I cried. Not when we couldn't wake up my dad, not when I saw my brother in law to give me the news, nor in any of the two funerals. I felt awful, yes. But nothing comes out.  
   Before my mom died, I used to think about that regarding my dad. I used to think that it might have been because, while we were close, we weren't as ""affectionate"" towards eachother, or maybe because I was too young? But I thought that I was gonna cry when mom died, for sure. Well it did not happen. It happened exactly like the first time, but being 10 years older.  
   I did cry over their deaths, but usually its a long time after that, and usually its because I'm going through a rough time, and it comes with it too, like missing someone, or feeling lonely, then I remember them and it gets worse.   
   Also when I had a girlfriend a few years ago, I did cry a lot over fights or problems, and our breakup, it kinda helped getting stuff off my chest along that.

  


   I dont believe in the ""a man cannot cry"" bullshit, that's not the reason. I honestly dont know why I am the way I am. But it scares me, it scares me that I, maybe, inconsciously supress those feelings and keep them all inside? I dont know if its wrong, if it doesnt do me any good or bad, but its something that more than once has kept my thought.

234,"I(F,22) loooooove to complain about my problems when I am stressed because it is like the first step to relax for me. I have to get it off my chest first, then I can start to think straight and fix things.


I only have 1 close friend and my boyfriend with whom I can talk about my personal life. I feel like my boyfriend (M, 22, 1 year, LDR) got bored of my complaints and doesn't want to listen anymore. It is not like I do it once a week but when I am stressed, which is often, I have to talk about it. I don't expect consolation or advice, just listening. 


I am aware that listening to someone complaining can be depressing. I was dumped (by friends) before because I show my negative feelings without hesitation and I think it is a healthy thing to do with close friend.


Last week was the worst week of my life. Gone through so much and still trying to get things done actually. I couldn't fully complain about everything because my boyfriend is studying for finals (and I feel like he doesn't want to listen to my complaints anymore) and I don't want to bother my best friend (F,22) anymore because she is going through tough stuff also. (also she is not my partner so I don't expect her to be fully present in my life)


My mental state is shit right now. I am sooooooo irritable, grumpy and angry. I am normally extremely calm. My mother asks me what did I do today and I go to my room and cry like crazy because I feel exhausted after answering 1 question. I don't want to interact with anyone, I cannot stand anyone or anything. I insult my family and yell at them which I NEVER do. I feel like a shitty person right now but I can't even have a normal conversation without getting angry. I feel like I have to get these feelings out somehow but I don't now how (since I cannot do it by talking). I cannot go to therapy.

235,"Upwards of a year ago, myself (17/m) and a close friend (18/m) came up with an idea for an invention that we really think could earn a patent and sell on the market. For several weeks, we both wrote entries in a journal describing the product, it’s components, and the development of our ideas for its features. Eventually, we tried to create our own prototype, but frankly we failed miserably because neither of us had any knowledge to build it. This must have been months ago, and our discouragement has led us to not touch the project since then.

I am still determined to make our ideas a reality, and I am wondering what actions we should take at this point to get on the right track.

240,"Hey guys, I need a little bit of help from you all. I’ve had a friend for a year now who’s been a fun guy to be around. At one point, I’d even considered him to be my best friend. I always hung out with him, almost daily, and we shared a lot of things with eachother. Anyways, I don’t want anything to do with him anymore. Going on for months now, he’s been overwhelmingly negative, manipulative, an asshole, and just a shitty person in general. I’ve only came to decide that I don’t want to have anything to do with him now, and that I want to completely isolate myself from him. The problem is, he hangs out with my friend group. These people are AMAZING to me, but they haven’t really spent as much time with him as I have, and they haven’t seen his colors that he’s displayed to me. 
I want to know what I can do to just hang out with my friend group without seeing the other guy. It’s hard to stay away from him because my friend group is really big, and we do everything together. I’ve let them know how pissed I am at him, but haven’t said anything about not wanting to be present with him long-term. I’m sorry about rambling on too much, but this is really serious to me and I don’t know what actions to take. I don’t care if they hang out with him, it’s just that I don’t want to miss out on anything.

243,"What would you do if your S/O sexually harassed your teenage daughter?

The question comes from personal experience. My mom is great, she’s smart, loving, and dedicated to her children and work...she’s also devoted to her bf. 

It all started when I turned 14. I didn’t notice the signs at first. He would ask me if I was the one who was yelling or “something,” at night. To which I answered no. Then he asked to look through my phone and to borrow my iPod with a camera. I didn’t answer him.

I was confused and wondered what was wrong with him. I thought he was maybe hallucinating or going through some type of mental issue. 

My mom went through my phone one morning going through my messages when she thought I was still asleep. 

She didn’t do anything. 

The next night he barged into my locker room while I was trying to sleep. He just opened the door and said he thought he heard me scream. I panicked and went into a breakdown. I locked and barricaded my room and stayed up the whole night. My mom asked if what he said was true about me having sex. I was a virgin. 

It went on for years. Him asking if I would have sex with him and telling everyone I was sleeping around. When I turned 19 they broke up...and then got back together. She wants him to move in again. For me to give him another chance. 

I told her I don’t want him in the house while I’m here. 

Am I wrong or selfish for standing in the way of her happiness?",08Jul2019,1
244,"Here’s some background... I am the mother of young children who regularly hangs out with a small group of other mothers of young children. I am also pregnant with my third and due at the end of this month. 

Last summer, I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks. I told the ladies in this group and they were of course supportive. Several months later, I became pregnant with my current pregnancy. 

A couple of weeks after I found out I was pregnant, one of the women in this group, “Alicia,” asked me if I had gone to the ob/gyn lately. I was caught off guard completely (and I had actually been to the doctor the day before), so I gave a quick and vague answer. Alicia had figured out that I was pregnant long before I wanted to tell anyone.  I confirmed it with her a couple of weeks later. 

Long story short, I bumped into Alicia at the doctors office a few weeks ago and found out she was 14 weeks pregnant. I asked her if she had told the other girls in our circle and she said she had, during a gathering we were all at two weeks prior. She said she was trying to be discreet and didn’t want to have everyone at the gathering find out. 

Here’s the thing — she had SEVERAL opportunities to tell me privately during those two weeks, and I truly believe that she told the other girls not to mention it around me.  I was pretty hurt and angry about the situation and didn’t know how to handle it.  Of course, at the moment I found out she was pregnant, I felt awkward and acted nice about it, but my hurt feelings didn’t start to fully register until after we talked. I also feel like she had snooped to find out about my pregnancy, and after a miscarriage too!  So I did the mature thing of continuing to hang out with the group but staying more guarded and distant around Alicia.  I hate confrontation and I always feel like an idiot when I confront my friends. My anxiety gets the best of me in those situations and my brain decides to shut down or disregard my feelings in place of appeasing the person who wronged me. 

Anyway, I now feel guilty for being distant from her, considering that she contacts me regularly and that we all still see each other. I just feel like it’s too late to confront her because then she’ll know that I had been angry with her and had intended on acting distant from her for several weeks now. I also don’t want this to affect my relationships with the other moms. Thoughts?",08Jul2019,1

247,"Hello! I made a Reddit account specifically to ask for input on how do deal with this problem. The problem: **I have a roommate that is a habitual contrarian**. **What is a contrarian? Someone who feels compelled to tell you why you are wrong about every statement you make, regardless of importance, expertise, experience, or appropriateness**. A habitual contrarian is essentially a more extreme version of that, the main difference being that they often don't offer anything factual, provable or constructive. I did some research on contrarians today and was surprised to see nearly all of the information I found was exactly like the situations I deal with on a daily basis with my roommate, and it's linked to self esteem, as I suspected. Let's call him **Allen**.  

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, the simple solution is to move out. I'm working on that, it's a matter of money. I'm going back to school to get my degree, and the first thing on my ""I can afford it now"" list is to get a nice new apartment all by myself. I have two roommates currently, and the other guy is the ideal roommate. Rent is way, WAY more affordable to me when I can split the cost. 

&amp;#x200B;

So to begin, I first realized that Allen had **some sort of personality issue** shortly after we became roommates. He replaced my old roommate, who had gotten into a serious relationship and moved out, and Allen and I had hung out enough times that I felt good about living with him. It was perfect timing, really. And it has been good, for the most part...until you make any kind of definitive statement, or even an off-hand remark. **This seems to trigger him to formulate an oppositional opinion regardless of his expertise or knowledge on the subject.** After living with him for just a couple of weeks, I felt comfortable enough to tell him about a really strange event that happened to me and a friend of mine. We both, in separate cars, saw a strange, orange semi-glowing object a long distance away in the sky. We both slowed down to view it, as it was pretty baffling, and then it sped off in the blink of an eye. Most of my friends reactions after telling them this story range from ""Wow, that's pretty cool"" to ""Were ya'll high?"" to ""Yeah, I've seen some strange stuff myself."" Allen's reaction?  He adamantly told me that it was an F-16 from behind pulling of some kind of specific maneuver and that F-16s ""buzz"" rooftops in that neighborhood ""all the time"".  I told him I know what an F-16 looks like and this thing traveled ungodly fast from a completely static position. I also told him I have spent alot of time in that area and have never seen an F-16, or any airplane for that matter. I've had many friends in that neighborhood and my mother had been living there for 5 years and I've never heard of that. He proceeded to escalate his tone, which is common in contrarians from what I've read, and even started getting angry. He told me that his father had to replace shingles on his house that an F-16 had blown off in that neighborhood, and that I don't know what an F-16 looks like from behind or how fast they can go. He even had an explanation as to why it was able to appear as if it gained so much speed in so little time, the maneuver I mentioned earlier. I myself, perhaps unwisely, began to get a little flustered. I am a male with healthy testosterone and I don't take kindly to being told what I saw when the other person didn't see it and is getting angry, and I'm also an artist who is very visual. I usually know what I'm looking at and know what a damned plane looks like, F-16 or not. I even hopped on Google to find an example of what he was describing and obviously found absolutely nothing. He continued to get mad until he called me stupid, which was a very low blow and totally uncalled for, especially since we didn't know each other for a very long time yet. This was the first time I considered that Allen had some kind of personality defect and not just a normal level of male testosterone that enjoys an intellectual challenge, like a lot of guys do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's another key example of his contrarianism. We talk about politics a lot, and we fundamentally agree on almost everything political. But I kept calling the the *United States of America* just *America*, and using the word ""*American*"" when referring to citizens. He stopped me and said that America can refer to South America and I need to be more specific and that Americans should be called U.S. citizens. I asked why does that matter if he knows what I'm talking about and he launched into some serious bullshit: he said that the term ""American"" has been inserted into the US lexicon in order to slowly globalize the United States. We argued about this for a while, and I questioned the success of this tactic since everyone thinks of the Untited States when they hear the word America anyways. Presidents and really smart people do it without batting an eye. In hindsight, I should have questioned his sources or where he heard about that in the first place since I was unable to find any information about it when I pondered on it later. And to top it off, he has referred to the USA as America and US citizens as Americans countless times since then. So it was totally and completely pointless. This is a perfect example of habitual contrarianism, just coming up with an alternative opinion on the spot without any reasoning. **The reason contrarians do this is to build up their own self esteem as they believe that people hold their own intelligence in very high regard, and being able to tell someone they are wrong is a leg up on them, and they feel dominant.** 

&amp;#x200B;

A more recent event: I've recently did a lot of work on my 2003 truck, mostly interior cosmetic stuff. I repainted the interior, which was a hell of a job involving removing parts and repainting them. I looked up some great videos on how to do it and followed their steps which included sanding the plastic down to take the sheen off, spraying it with adhesion promoter, and coating it with light coats of the right paint. I made the mistake of explaining the process to Allen the Contrarian and he told me that I didn't need the adhesion promoter, which is basically a primer. I said it was cheap and easy, and I wanted to unsure the paint would last, so I would do it. Big mistake, doing things the way an expert suggest. He got mad and told me that they repaint interiors all the time at this job and an argument ensued. I told him I don't care and I'll do it how I want. He worked at a place at the time where they manufacture crane operators for electric maintenance vehicles. They don't do interiors. Ever. How do I know this? A) Common sense B) My other roommate works there now and said they do absolutely nothing with the interior and don't even have the vehicle around since they just do metal manufacturing. 

&amp;#x200B;

An even more recent event: I was replacing my high-mount 3rd brake light on my truck, which is the light above your rear window. He asked ""Your triangle light?"" and I said ""No, my high-mount"". He said ""It used to be called triangle light but there was an issue with labeling and they had to pass a law calling it a high-mount light."" Total horseshit. **Anything to be right, being wrong is the equivalent of being the town drunkard moron.** I also think he vastly underestimates my intelligence and doesn't think I'll check any of his facts. I happened to be on my phone at the time and began looking it up on google. Found jack shit. As I told him I was googling it, he slunk out the back door for a cigarette. When he was done, he came back in the door and concluded his horseshit claim, I forgot what he said. He probably thought about it the whole time he was smoking that cigarette. I just told him ""Well, I didn't find anything on Google about it."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Every little claim or suggestion I make. Our other roommate suggested the CashApp to easily pay him for electricity. It's a wonderfully efficient app that I love. I hesitated to tell Allen the Contrarian about it knowing he would have an opposing view, and of course he did. ""I don't trust apps with my credit card information. Are they verified and trusted? No."" Okay, suit yourself. He's really lazy, so I knew in time he would come around when he realized he wouldn't have to run by an ATM, and of course that came to pass.  

&amp;#x200B;

What really gets me angry is when he acts like he knows anything about artwork or the worlds of artists. I don't have any specific examples, but you can probably imagine based on these other examples. It would be the equivalent of me telling him what computer specs are the best, since one of his hobbies are PC hardware.

&amp;#x200B;

Playing videogames with him is usually a pain in the ass, all the way up the sphincter. **Winning is the most important thing in the universe to him, and if his team didn't win, he always knew whose fault it was.** We would play Overwatch and would tell me everything I was doing was wrong, even when my [D.Va](https://D.Va) would get 80 eliminations and 1 death. ""That's because you are being a hero"" when anyone mentioned their great stats. But if his healer Zenyatta had a gold in anything, it's because everyone else was being shitty, which is debatable, but couldn't possibly always be the case. My favorite moment was when we were in a match and he was calling out the ""shitty DPS"" (to anyone who doesn't know, a DPS, or Damage Per Second, is a stat covered by characters that deal damage to opposing players) because he had a gold medal in damage as a healer character. A guy shut him down immediately, saying ""Dude, we're a minute in to our match. Calm down."" We ended up winning easily. In Borderlands, he's a loot ninja, and all good guns have to go through him first. We all had to call him out on it before he made any changes to his behavior, and we had to establish a system that ensured that we were all getting what we wanted, something most friends don't even have to discuss. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once, a long time ago when I was getting to know him, **he was bragging about his intelligence** and said he was kicked out of a debate class because he wouldn't start questioning the professor. I brought this up once when we were in a heated argument a long time ago later about his horseshit contrarianism, and he said that he was kicked out because someone said something about his mom and he hit him in the face. These are college aged adults we're talking about here and he wouldn't have forgotten that crucial detail.  **A bold faced lie to save face, and because I had made a really good point using evidence he had given me.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I've actually developed some good strategies and tips to deal with his contrarianism, which is actually a sign that you're dealing with one, coincidentally. I will list some that I found to be effective, but not nice. 

1. **Find their pattern of contrarian behavior and remember certain things they say, knowing it will likely come up again and also likely be a totally different opinion than the last one they expressed. Not always the case, but there's also the chance that whatever he said will be proven wrong in time and you can remind him of how certain he was.** 
2. **Don't take anything they say with any certainty. They express their opinions as fact and act very confident despite their expertise on the subject.** 
3. **Laugh at them with your friends. Maybe not the best advice, but it's likely this person has a reputation as a contrarian, and siding with your friends in a good laugh is the healthiest way I have found to deal with it for your own sake. Your contrarian friend also probably see's himself as much more intelligent as the rest of you fuck-knobs, so fuck'em.** 
4. **Fact check him. If it can be proven, ask him what his source is because you can't simply take his word for it because ""that's isn't smart."" This can backfire if he happens to be right, because he will shove it on your face and it will add to his problem of superiority.** 
5. **Just let him have it. I often just don't give a shit and don't care what he says. I have a theory that this can actually build his empty sense of superiority, which is a bad thing, but one can only have so much energy for this sort of thing. He can make you feel like a little man when he corrects every statement you make, but just remember that everyone he knows is probably aware of how he is.** 

&amp;#x200B;

So I could post more events, and will probably remember things that I forgot to mention, but I feel that this sums it up pretty well. I want to know if anyone has some good advice, maybe tell me what I'm doing wrong in the situation (nobody likes being told their wrong all the time, but maybe I should learn to just not care?), share your own experiences with a habitual contrarian, strategies, questions or thoughts. **The difficult thing is communication, and it sucks having to consider what you should and shouldn't say around someone when anyone else wouldn't require any such measures outside the realm of reason.** Allen has been overall a good friend, but he isn't a contributor to house duties, is messy, and tends to isolate himself socially, if any of those things help.

264,"So, long story short, my house was empty due to my father and I being away on vacation last week. My brother and his girlfriend ended up staying at the house a few nights (bro doesn't live with us), with her relatives (who we've never met and don't know at all) staying over two nights as well. First of all, I wasn't excited for them to stay there solely because I cleaned the whole house before we left to have a clean house when we return, then I learned about the cousins as well. Well, I braced myself for a somewhat messy space, but here's the issue....

&amp;#x200B;

1. Home was not to my cleanliness standards, I texted my bro saying it was messy and I had cleaned it before I left. There was a film of grease on all the counters and floor, with spots and general dirtiness on the floor, etc... not a big deal in the scheme of it all, but clean it up. Make it spotless.  If you use my stuff, fine. Just try to leave it how I left it... He said she had made sure it was how we left, which it was not. Sent me into an awkward situation.
2. The mail was collected, which we asked, however...my father believes guests had opened an important piece of mail (a check for a significant amount). My brother opened it? Sure, no problem! Guests we don't know? Now, that's an issue. We don't want to accuse though?
3. Well, I open my NEW computer to asking me if I want to login as me, or as a guest... never opened a guest account.  Leading me believe they helped themselves my personal computer.

Listen.... I love my brother's girlfriend and I trust her.  However.... this has left a bad taste in my mouth. Am I overreacting? She was upset that I told my brother that they left the house dirty, which made me feel like an asshole because in a way I guess I said she was dirty. She spent all day cleaning, yet it wasn't clean (to our standards at least.)

They’ve been pushing me non-stop to be an x-ray tech like my dad, and I gave in because I still needed a place to live, and I was only 4 credits away from finishing my associates degree too.

I drained my savings I was going to get for a new car and the first few months for my dorm all for classes I never wanted to take. I hate myself everyday for listening to them, I didn’t know what I was going to do yet and I was going to use this summer to figure it out but instead I’m spending it doing something somebody else wants me to do.

When I go to bed at night, I don’t want to wake up anymore. I feel like my dreams have been completely crushed. I feel like I was going to be so happy, only for my parents to take it all away from me. I don’t want to do this anymore.

270,"I’m 15, for the record. When I was little, about 5 years old, my parents divorced and I lived with my mom and visited my dad over the weekends and the summer. 

About 5 months ago I got into a bad argument with my dad that ultimately resulted in a situation where I wasn’t talking to my dad if he refused to change. I told him this and he refused to change, so i stopped talking to him. The specifics don’t really matter right now as it would take way to long to explain. Point is, i lost contact with my dad.

I don’t regret the decision, but that doesn’t make it better. It still hurts. I lost an entire chunk of my life that I will probably never get back. I don’t know how to deal with this. I shouldn’t be needing to deal with this at 15, but here we are.

273,"So over a year ago I went to a therapist to talk about my anxiety, and it went well and I have been back since those few months.

I don’t want to tell my parents because I know it’ll worry them and they’ll ask about it, but I have to to get it scheduled.

Me and my family leave on Saturday for 10 days and I don’t know if I can schedule it soon enough.

I keep having this fear that my therapist won’t believe me, and will say it’s just nothing (which it could be and I could be insane and what if it actually is nothing and I sound like a complainy teen)

I don’t know if that therapist I talked to is like an “anxiety specialist” or not so what if I go in and he’s like “I’m glad you spoke to me but you have the wrong person.” And I just waste his time

I have a huge problem with sharing my feelings and vocalising what I’m thinking and I may get misinterpreted.

TLDR; 3 friends and I rent a hotel room for a four day weekend. 2 of my friends, Martha and Addis, bicker to the point where it becomes a silent fight. Martha leaves the hotel room for the night, Addin went to go look for her, but she doesn't return to the hotel room until the following morning. She messaged me saying that she had her boyfriend pick her up that night and cried herself to sleep. She doesn't want to see anyone else but me, gave me a few trinkets to distribute to our two other friends. Addin thinks it's an apology gift, gave it back to me, and told me to relay a message that Martha should give it to him as a gift and in person. Martha says that she can't do friends, said bye, and left our group chats and unfriended us.

&amp;#x200B;

3 Friends and I got a hotel room for a four day weekend. The first day went well, but the next three days were the most difficult. During this weekend, there were many events we could've attended. We were all in line to buy our tickets for an event, but unfortunately it was already sold out. Now, the line we were on was also used to pick up exclusive tickets for a movie screening, but it was in a different booth than the one we originally went to. Martha and Addin, my lovely friends, needed to get their tickets for the movie screening since they signed up for it beforehand. Martha was able to successfully get their ticket, but Ace had some difficulties—the booth he was originally at wasn't able to give him their ticket. Martha was very adamant about Addin getting his ticket at the same booth he was in and Addin responded with a stern and somewhat angry voice (despite not being mad, it's just the way he talks) that there was a sign saying which booth you can get the exclusive tickets. For about five minutes, Martha kept asking why Addin was mad to which he responded that they weren't. They continued to bicker for a couple of minutes. This of course caused some tension and the walk back to the hotel between all four of us was very awkward. This happened on the second day.

&amp;#x200B;

On the third day, things were seemingly going well. We all attended a late night show and had a lot of fun. We left really late and were looking for something to eat considering all of us hadn't eaten since the morning. We found a nice street food cart and proceeded to buy hot dogs. As we were all walking back to our hotel in anticipation of eating our first meals, I jokingly said, ""You should wait until we get back to the hotel, we have some chips to go with these."" Martha agreed and stopped eating after taking a few bites. Addin on the other hand, kept eating. Martha noticed and told them to stop eating. Addin said that he didn't care and continued to eat since he was really hungry and hadn't eaten yet. Martha then said that he should be able to hold it in since she could handle not eating for a whole day. But, Addin can't do that and was used to eating meals throughout the day, so he responded again that he didn't care and proceeded to eat. Martha, just like in the second day, then proceeded to ask why he was mad. Addin continued to say that he wasn't really mad, just tired and hungry, but Martha kept pushing the subject of being mad. After a long silence, Martha was walking ahead of the group and constantly on her phone. Once we got back to the hotel, she took her hot dogs, put them in a bag, and left the hotel saying that she was going back to where the night show was being held at (there was an after-party). Eating dinner at the hotel room with just the three of us was very awkward. After it passed midnight, Martha still wasn't back and so Addin went back to look for her. We all waited until 2am and she still wasn't back. Addin waited for the whole party to clear out before coming back to the hotel room saying that she wasn't there. I concluded that she must've been texting her boyfriend while we were walking to come pick her up. I don't know if our two other friends messaged her, but I was really worried and sent her a text saying that I know she doesn't want to come back to the hotel room and hoped that she was at a safe place for the night. I didn't sleep well that night and waited until the morning (the last day of our weekend) to send another text hoping that she was fine and found a safe place to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

On the last day, she thankfully messaged back that she did indeed go back home with her boyfriend. She also cried all night before falling asleep. She did not know what to do from there, but she did not want to be in the same room as Addin and my other friend (I'm not sure if she meant me too, but I hope not). She did go back to the hotel room that morning briefly to gather her things and swiftly left after checking out. The three of us then left as well and lingered around the area to check things out. I then get a call from Martha saying that she lied and didn't leave—she also lingered the area and wanted to see me and just me. Addin and my other friend got the message when she was just in communication with me and waited for me to come back. Upon meeting her, she gave me a trinket and a few extras to give to Addin and my other friend. I hugged her before we went our separate ways. Once I got back to the others, I gave Martha's gift to Addin. He then proceeded to give it back to me and to tell her that she should give it to him in person and as a gift (I believe he thought it was some form of ""apology""). I relayed the message to Martha and she said that she's not okay anymore, can't do friends, and said bye. After a few hours, Martha still texts me albeit short messages, but I realized that she left our group chats and most likely unfriended us as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both of them are my friends, but I don't know how to be a middleman in this. Should I even be a middleman or leave them to their own devices? They have short quarrels like this all the time but it has never gotten this badly—I can only assume that this weekend gave it the last push.

279,"So for a bit of context, I'm 23yo and I just finished college (technically dropped out after four years but whatever). Now, it's always been my dreams to work in music so when I got an internship in music distribution, I was super happy. That was last summer. The internship lasted 6 months and when it ended, my boss asked me if I would like to stay. I obviously agreed, but here is the catch : they asked me to be freelance, decided I would work 32h/week for about 600€ (after taxes). 
The thing is, in France the minimum wage is about 900€ for 28h/week. So they're asking me to work more for less while paying my own job-related taxes and, incidentally, not giving me any responsibilities that might make the job worthwhile. There's also the thing where this month I got paid about ten days later than everybody else in the office for no reason.
I'm aware typing it that the obvious reply is ""yes, get the hell out of there"" but... people are really nice there and I don't want to fuck them over by leaving. Also I have little to no real job experience and I'm scared that I won't find another job, let alone in music/culture.
I was thinking I might go to the UK or Italy for a few months and find a small job there just to travel and live life while I'm young but idk if that's realistic, having a somewhat stable job (albeit under-paid) is better than being unemployed. 
So these are the pros and cons. What do you think?

283,"Alright, so I’m pretty unhappy in multiple facets of my life so I’m turning to the reddit community for some advice/venting.

I moved to a new town about 2 years ago now and haven’t been very happy since. I lived with my parents for 3 months in this new town while I found a job and immediately moved out afterwards (my mom drives me crazy). 

1.) I moved here knowing nobody. I took the first job I was offered. I have a biology degree and found quality assurance work at a pharmaceutical company. At first I thought the pay was decent until I discovered that the housing cost in this town is ridiculous. Knowing nobody, I found the most reasonable 1 bedroom I could find. It’s about 900 dollars a month with everything included. I also have the typical bills (car payment, car insurance, etc.) The job I have pays 35k before taxes/yr. I have been due for a raise, but they keep putting it off because we recently went through a huge recall of our products. They agree I do good work and am deserving of a promotion, but I haven’t seen an extra dime. On top of that I don’t even enjoy the work. I don’t feel like I’m helping the world in any way. I’ve tried finding part time work waiting tables but it’s extremely competitive here (tourist town). I’ve considered finding cheaper housing with roommates but it’s sketchy when I don’t actually know the person. I’ve started selling stuff on eBay to help bridge the gaps but it’s a slow process. Basically, I’m financially stressed.

2.) My social life has completely died. I basically have to import friends from my old town to find any kind of social life. They’ll visit for a day or two and then I’ll be alone for another month or so. Nobody at work is really my age. Most are married with kids. I get along with my coworkers but it’s hard to seek contact outside of work. I’ve considered joining a gym or other group to make friends, but my financial stress quickly dashes that plan. I spend most of my free time staring at my phone or going hiking alone. Even if I had friends here I’d probably resent them for making me spend money at social functions. 

3.) As I’m sure you’ve picked up on, my mental health is wack yo. The social isolation along with financial anxiety has done a number on my self confidence. I feel like my negative attitude is just snowballing into all aspects of my life. I’ve considered therapy, but again... financial stress. 

4.) I don’t even know if I want to be in this town anymore. I have nothing and nobody keeping me here. My parents are great, but I feel like I just use them as a safety net and they kind of do the same with me. I’m the youngest child and they’re well into their 60’s. I’m at a point where I don’t have enough money to stay here but I don’t really have enough money to leave. I have an old van that I’ve been fixing up for the past 4 years or so to eventually travel in and live out of. It’s to the point now where all the repairs and accessories I need require... get this... money. But I would save a lot on rent if I could do it. 

Anyway, I’ll take any advice I can get on any of these problems. I understand from an outsiders perspective I sound whiny. Thanks for reading!

285,"I've (25F) been living in Chicago for two years now. I had my own apartment right next to my undergraduate school. It was great and rent was cheap, for Chicago at least. Fast forward to this year, I realized I'm far from my graduate school and last summer was brutal for bills (AC sucks electricity). So, I moved in with a friend (29M). Until now the only other person I live with was my family and my ex. Both are extremely clean and orderly, as am I. I knew going into this that my roommate isn't. 

I get mad at him all the time. He leaves food on the floor. He doesn't listen to any of the rules we have. All of the stuff in the house is mine and he doesn't try to take care of it. He doesn't disciple his cat and it harasses or steals food from my cat. Worse is when it's 5am and he is talking at full volume.  Despite all that, I work with him on all these things. I don't just get mad and yell. We talk it over and agree on something and that works for the most part.

He forgets a lot. One week he cleans the kitchen, the next week I find a trail of chips to his room. I want to move out when our lease is up because I don't know if I can handle this throughout all of graduate school and work. I can't trust him to keep an eye on the cats or to clean the house. The thing I'm nervous about is loans.

I'm basically using them to live close to school. Otherwise I'd live more than 3 hours away. I still have loans from undergrad as well. Is it worth spending more money to live on my own and not go through the stress of living with my roommate? Or should I stay with a roommate for the next few years to cut on cost? I'm torn because I like to have my place a relaxing clean place but I feel at times it isn't. But living with a roommate, I have less of a financial burden. I've thought about moving and living with someone else but I don't know anyone else looking to live in Chicago. Also, not comfortable with a random roommate. 

Sorry, if this doesn't sound well thought-out. Ive been up so late because his cat won't stop messing with mine. So, I am now cranky and mad since my first day of work is tomorrow and I have no sleep.",08Jul2019,1

290,"I broke up with this girl, let’s call her X, 7 months ago. I recently found out that she had made an Instagram account, with a picture of me, and under the description she trashed me. 

I was only wit her for the short term investment. The only rewarding thing that came out of the relationship was her willingness to do sexually and emotionally satisfy me. The negative attributes of the relationship was that she had no social skills. She had trouble starting up and continuing conversations. She opened up a lot to me and had told me very-personal things about herself, and her last relationship. Her last ex dumped her the night he had taken her virginity, and left her outside alone. Also, about losing her friends, and not being able to openly talk to her family about her problems. She had a lot of issues to begin with, and seemed to really fall in love with me throughout our relationship. 

I’ve been with my ex (current gf) for 4 years, which beats out being in relationship with X for 7 months. So, when my ex came running back to me 6 months ago, I obviously had to take her back. I was in love with my gf, and not X, but X was in love with me. 

In the post it implied I was a manipulating sociopath who mentally and sexually abused her. At the end of a date she was willing to have sex with me. After we would have sex she would have to walk back alone. I couldn’t drive her back, because I had to wake up early for school the next morning. Whenever she didn’t want to have sex with me, I would be upset, because that was the best part of the relationship, but she would give in anyways, even if it was one sided. 

I did have some feelings for her, but that was before my ex (current gf) came back into the picture. So this claim of mental and sexual abuse is a lie. She wouldn’t even have evidence to show it either. 

It is not my fault she fell in love with me and I had no intentions of feeling the same way. I saw our relationship short term when I had to choose between her and my current gf. When I had the opportunity to go back to my ex, who I was actually in love with, of course I dumped X to go with the one I actually loved. 

I did feel a little bad that I dumped her the way her first ex did, which was sleeping with her, then dumping her, and letting her walk home alone. But after she made that fake account trying to call me out I don’t feel bad for her. I want to move on with my girlfriend, and I don’t want this thing to suddenly come up again  in the future. I dumped X and I have no remorse, and my gf thinks I shouldn’t feel bad either. I don’t think I deserve hate for breaking up with someone I don’t love. 

How do I get this post taken down? I had many people report it already, but it is still up for now.

So i will go on porn and expect to watch it and jerk off in 20  min and be over with it. NOPE. once i start and i get horny, i end up  binge watching porn. My habit is when i stumble on a pornstar that i  like i binge watch all her videos. I end up getting so horny that  everything like my morals, decision making skills, and goals go out the  window. I can have to do work or homework or study but once im in this  porn loophole its only porn for me. I will binge watch porn videos and  get horny and not jerk off. i try to avoid jerking off and just watch  porn to keep getting the high from the porn. it gets to the point that  it makes me wanna do weird things like go to stores and buy girl  underwear or skirts and try them on. I sometimes do these porn retreats  were I get so horny that i binge watch porn for multiple days on end.  this happens when i have no plans or work to do on a weekend for  example. I will watch porn all night and then go to bed without having  jerked off. Then i wake up go to a store, get some panties then wear  them under my pants and go about my day. so during school time if im  doing this i will wear thongs under my pants when i go to classes or  take exams. then i will even wear it to work if im still binging on  porn. however, as soon as i jerk off all these feelings of wanting to do  weird crazy pervy shit goes away. i throw out the panties i bought, and  regret having wasted hours to even days watchning porn and doing weird  things like buying and wearing girl underwear. this can be a weird kink  that the porn addiction has led me to chase to increase my high. i can  never watch porn now without having the urge to go to a nearby store and  buy panties to wear while watching porn. then after i jerk off and  regret what i did i realize i would never wanna wear panties on a daily  basis when im no horny. its only a urge i get when horny as fuck. but i  am not gay and dont like wearing girl clothes.",08Jul2019,1

Just an app to help each other to get better in general. (We are a bit broke, we can’t pay a monthly subscription :/ )


I know it’s really specific. At first I just thought about using google sheet, but I thought that maybe something like this could exist.

303,"Ok, I know what you're thinking, ""how do you ""accidentally"" lie?"" but, please! Let me explain haha.

So, I applied to this job listing for a barista position, not having any prior barista experience( unless you count making coffee for a few years during volunteer work). The post listed the experience/qualifications needed :  prefer barista experience, but not necessary, as they would train if they found the right person, excellent customer service and a great personality. Now, I do have customer service experience and I'd like to believe a pretty awesome work personality. At the end of the form, it asked to put in how much experience I had, and I put one year (more so for the customer service side). Well, I was emailed for an interview tomorrow, and was super excited. I was reading back the emails to my friend, and she pointed out how the manager mentioned they were ""super interested in my experience"" and said they probably thought I had been a real barista at some point. I'm super embarrassed and wondering if I should even go in for the interview, as it's at 8 am tomorrow( technically today), so there's no way to email back and explain the  miscommunication on my end. Do I still go, and explain or bluff my way through it, or what? thanks\~",08Jul2019,3
304,"My whole life, my parents have been
.... 

Well... 

Not very much like parents?

I feel like a debit card?  I feel that is the proper way to explain it. Or maybe just like the atm and they're the annoying debit card idk.

But my entire life they've been pawning my things and taking my money. When I was 16 I got a job because my parents wouldn't even be responsible enough to typically keep a roof over our head without getting an eviction notice every year, let alone to get me things I needed like clothes, school supplies, books, more food than just literally potatoes. At first it was fine, you know? I worked almost full time while still going to high school and...what did I have to show for it?

I went from an honor roll student in 2 AP classes to dropping both APs (because I fell asleep during a test and wrote gibberish) and having my grades fall in classes, something that NEVER happened before because I was working until 10 or 11 most nights a week and then early shifts on the weekend after getting off barely 8 hours before that. It was school from 7 to 3 then work from either 3:30 or 4 to 10 or 11 each night and then homework and dinner. Maybe sleep by 2 am? Then up again at 6. 

I was...tired. But all anyone did was belittle my experiences. My actual AP teacher said she didn't really care what I was going through and that I shouldn't have been in her class if my work and family life was too rough to handle along with the class. But hey, at least I had money right?

Nope. 

Most of the time, my parents would ask me for money. If they needed to pay something or they needed cigarettes or whatever, they came to me and if I didn't want to just fork it over they'd basically manipulate me emotionally until I did. It wasn't that bad back then. Slammed doors, the silent treatment, passive agressiveness, etc.. I had a place to lock my money up and one of them picked the lock and stole $20 from it. Broke the lock on it too. They paid me back for that, but the odds were strongly against that. Just the fact that it had been lock picked from me made me feel so violated. 

Flash forward to now when, all I'm going to say is I'm not a minor anymore but I'm barely above being a minor. Like, barely. I still consider myself as a kid, because how can I consider myself as an ""adult"" when I've not accomplished what others my age have so far. I can't drive and I do not have a car. I do not have health insurance (I used to have the free insurance but I suppose it expired). I don't really have anything. The only thing I have now is myself (what's left of me), my (so far) one year of college education, and a place to stay with my boyfriend away from my parents. 

But the thing is, my parents...they don't even have a home right now. I was staying there with them briefly because I previously had been staying with my boyfriend and they ""missed me"" and I missed them but I really missed my pets that I've had since I was a kid. I love my pets a lot. They make me really happy, and not much does. They missed their ATM that's what they fucking missed. 

But yeah, they got an eviction notice and well, my dad just ignored it. Didn't even go to the court date because he doesn't do anything. And what happened? Oh yeah, we got kicked out. They took money from me constantly leading up to the eviction. 

I have a computer. It is very nice. But I never have it. I need it for school this upcoming semester and it would be an immense thing to just make my life so much easier since I'm transferring universities. And honestly, it makes me happy because I can play games where you escape your life and be happy. But sadly this computer is always in the pawn shop  thanks to my parents. 

I saved up the money to get it back out. It was going to be my entire paycheck but I budgeted like hell in the weeks leading up to getting it out so that way I could spend the entire check and still have money for food, transportation, toiletries, and other costs etc... My check was barely enough but it was enough. So I thought. I had to ask my dad to come to the shop to show his ID because he put it in his name because the last time it was pawned they harassed me over the phone while I was at work in another state. 

Well he showed up but it ended up being more than I had with me because he didn't pay the interest fees on it. So I just basically had no choice but to leave. I wanted to give up but my boyfriend convinced me to keep trying and not let them win. So the next day I kept trying and my dad just absolutely refused, threatened to kill himself, let my pets free, etc... 

Then they called me back and said ""Look, you've got to help us. We need $150 blah blah."" 

I was like ""Are you fucking crazy?""

I had just given them $100 the other day when they tricked me by offering me a ride home from work and not 2 minutes after I got in the car he asked me for $100 and of course I refused but...he told me he believes he has cancer and that he was just going to die like trash and basically belittled me to the point where I was hyperventilating and wanted to jump out of the car while it was moving. It was traumatic...I was sobbing in the store getting the money out but I just wanted them to leave me alone. 

They wouldnt leave me alone and I had to give them ANOTHER 100. So basically, my entire paycheck....I didnt get any of. I barely have any money and I wasnt able to get my computer back. The only reason I did it was so they wouldnt keep threatening to kill themselves, so they wouldnt keep threatening to release my pets into the wild, and because since my computer is in my dads name I would never get it back ever if I didn't give them the money because he could just turn it over to them. 

I had an emotional mental breakdown and I basically did some dumb shit on social media. I made some pretty out there posts where my family members were like wtf and I also sent my grandfather a message because he's a piece of shit and knows that my parents are like this to me but he hasn't done anything to help me. They ask him for money all the time but he can actually afford to help them, and I cant. I know he should not have to help them, but he doesnt get that when he doesnt help them they do this shit to me and I can't advance in life when they do nothing but take from me. I told him I felt like my cousins have always had more favor from him yet they're not even actually related to him and they have stable lives out in a nice house in the country and they don't have to worry about anything. He would always take me there as a kid and in recent years too for my birthday and it made no sense to me because I absolutely hated going there because all it did was remind me of my life being not normal. In his response he just told me I am just like my dad and I'm just jealous and if I want them to stop taking money from me I need to stand up for myself. 
But I dont know what else i can do except say no repeatedly until my dad does 60 in a 30 and threatens to kill himself?

Then he and his wife or whatever just sent me links to homeless shelters and ""low income resources."" I'm going to a place to get bus tickets tomorrow because I need it to get to work now because I dont have money for fare this week. 

 I haven't even begun my life yet and it already feels so dismal. People around me tell me I should just cut them off, but I love my mom. I love my dad too, but at the same time they cause me so many problems, mostly my dad. My mom just gets influenced by him easy because she's been with him so long and probably just doesn't know how to get rid of him. 

I honestly feel so depressed...I can't get financial aid for college without dealing with them either. Because I'm still a dependent or whatever the fuck even though they take MY MONEY. The only thing that is keeping me going is starting school, if I get to start school. I have no other way to pay for it other than pell grant and possibly a student loan. I had scholarships at my other university but my commute was too far (I ride the bus and it was 2 hours) and it affected my school immensely. The only thing I want is to go to school and get the degree I know I should have because I know I am way too smart to work in the shitty job I have now that literally makes me hate my life 70% more than I already do. I am a shy, sensitive, person and I cried when a guy yelled at me for accidentally forgetting to give him a dollar of his change back (and no i wasn't PMSing, I'm literally like that 😕) I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. I want a job I don't mind doing, like my previous job at my old university where I handled sensitive info (so I cant talk much about it) but it was a desk job and I somehow aced the interview and landed it and it was amazing. I didnt really have to talk to anyone except my coworkers and boss and I had my work for each day and I could do it in my own order and the way I liked. I just want to go to school so I can get my degree and possibly get another similar job as a work study student there so I dont have to deal with customer service (which I'm just not good at and it makes me want to die.)

If my financial aid doesn't work out again because of verification...and I can't go to school... I don't know what I'll do. It would be a KO honestly like in super smash....I'd just feel no reason anymore. That's my one, last, single hope. 

I don't know what to do to be normal. I want normal I want stability I want serotonin. I'm so fucking depressed. 😞 I dont know how to cut ties with my parents financially...I dont know... I just want to be my own person and stop living this embarrassing ass life as an ATM that needs to be slammed a few times before it works you know?

If anyone has any kind of advice, like even just virtual hugs or cute pictures of Bulbasaur, I'll take it. 😔",08Jul2019,1
305,I am 18M from India. I recently found out that my really hot cousin(f) was sending nudes to another cousin of mine(M). Both are really good friends of mine and this comes as a shock to me. Now I found those nudes in my male cousin's laptop. I was horrified but was aroused by how my female hot cousin looked. So as any guy would do I masturbated to her. And then I copied those nudes to my phone. Yeah call me evil but she is so hot(thicc at the right places). I confronted my female cousin about those pics and she said he was blackmailing her for those pics. I don't know how much of this story is true although I think they had sex and he's threatening if she doesn't send him nudes he will tell everyone he'd sex with her. The situation is really fucked up. Now I have been masturbating to her since a month and feeling guilty afterwards. Need some advice,08Jul2019,2
306,"I’m a 33M and I met a girl off of Tinder whose profile said she was 19. Before meeting up she told me she was actually 17, and I was fine with it. I was glad she told me. When I was signing up for Tinder I used a junk email, and I wanted to meet girls around 22, so that’s what I put my age as. I didn’t tell her I was actually 33. We messaged back and forth for a couple days and we were both looking for the same thing. Nothing serious, just casual fun. She later revealed she was a virgin and just wanted to get it over with. I’ve hooked up with quite a few women in my life, but I’ve never taken someone’s vcard. Looking back I was pretty stoked on the idea of taking a girl’s virginity. It was something I’ve always wanted to do. So we agreed to meet up and we, you know, did it. She was a little hesistant at first but I convinced her it was the right thing. I thought we had an amazing time, but the next day she texted me asking me for my real age. Lol. Did it really matter at that point? We already had sex. If she had suspicions she should’ve just confronted me in person. Since when did age matter when it came to a one night stand? I mean, if I had told her my real age Im afraid she wouldn’t have done it with me. Well she stopped responding to my texts and a couple days later I got threatening voicemails from her mom. Calling me a predator and accusing me of taking advantage of a “child” and all that shit. Did i actually do something wrong? I honestly don’t see where I’ve gone wrong in this. We’re both grown individuals in this situation. We both knew what we were doing and it was consensual. If anything she took advantage of me, using me to lose her virginity.",08Jul2019,1
307,"Just some context before I delve into my insecure bullshit. I’ve never struggled with girls, just relationships. Since getting cheated on by my first gf, I had 2 other failed relationships. My last one sending me into a pit of depressing and hatred for myself. Currently, [21 M] have a steady job, just finished my AA degree, and a great girl who treats me like gold. I guess you could say things are going quite well for me at the moment. 

[2018] So I met this girl at my job through my friend (who worked with me at the time) and really was just trying to get my mind off of my ex. I wasn’t thinking much of it, I knew I didn’t want a relationship for a while. I made this very clear with her and she respected how I felt for a few months. Over time though I could tell she was developing real feelings for me and I tried my best to keep at the ‘let’s just see where this goes’ stage. To make a long story short because this isn’t the real issue at hand, her best friend came from out of state and she changed how she was acting so I kind of ghosted her. She tried multiple times to try and hang out and apologize but I cast her out.  We’re both Hispanic and our tempers are out of control, so we end it in a screaming match and blocking each other’s numbers. 

A little over a month goes by and I’m really just trying to focus on myself. Talking to a few different girls really getting comfortable with being alone again. Pride to the side, I really missed this girl and all the great times we had together, the sex, the dynamic of our relationship was so different than I’ve ever had with another girl. So my friends birthday was coming up and he wanted to invite me and the girl from my job because he didn’t want me to third wheel with his gf there and he didn’t have any other friends that were girls. We get through the night drinking and smoking, and I start flirting with her but I can tell something was off. By the end of the night we all go our separate ways before she jokingly suggests that I should unblock her number so we can talk. 

To give some insight on why Xanax bothers me so much, my mother was a very serious pill addict and had a number of episodes from when I was young. Caused a lot of resentment between me and her, and basically tore apart any semblance of a relationship with her. To this day, we can barely have a normal conversation.

She tells me she needs to clear the air before we even think about trying to get back to where we were. Which to this day, I respect her for. A lot of women wouldn’t have the courage to admit her faults. She tells me that she took Xanax and wound up having sex with her best friends ex while she was jail and woke up with a UTI. The more we spoke about it the sicker I got to my stomach. We meet the next day, and I make her rehash the entire encounter cause I’m a sadistic fuck and idk why I wanted to see her admit it. I regret that to this day. After telling me details I know she probably didn’t want to share I asked her one final question, “ Did he wear a condom?” With the most confidence I’ve ever heard her speak with she told me she looked at him and he just knew and put one on. Which I bought at the time.  Come to find out months later,  she lied and even hooked up with a girl. I slept with other people too don’t get me wrong, but the magnitude of what she did on top of lying to me about it had me conflicted for a while.

I eventually get over it (I try to convince myself) and we come back stronger than ever. We basically agree that we’re in a relationship because I never formally asked her out. And toward the end of the year her best friend goes on a rant online about it and he replies how great it was.  

[Present day] I don’t understand why something that happened a year ago still bothers me from time to time. She’s a great girl and I’ve really helped her grow as an individual, I have endless love for her as well. But moments after we’re done with sex, it will just pop up in my head. I look at her next to me some nights and there’s no one I’d rather be spending my prime years with. Then there’s other times where I wonder if I’ve just spent a year with this girl who loves me worlds more than I love her and one day I won’t have it anymore. I’ve treated girls bad in the past and I don’t want to make that mistake with her. 

To sum it up, I guess my issue is that I don’t want to lose her but I don’t know if I’ll be ok with this shit popping up in my head sometimes. It really fucks with my mood and my perception of her. Any type of advice would be very much appreciated.",08Jul2019,1

311," 

I'm currently a 23 year old male, 22 at the time of the arrest, and I have been tried and convicted by a Jury in court.

Back in mid February of 2018 I was on **Craigslist Casual Encounters** and I come across 3 different ads with the same phone number. At the time and for the past couple of years I was looking for a mutual **adult** partner for a night of companionship. Struggling to even find someone who wasn't a bot or even reply to me I came across this girl from the phone number with 3 ads. This person claimed she was an almost 14 year old girl looking to hang with someone that night. I don't buy it at first because I don't see 14 year old girls going on craigslist to look for a friend to hang out with So I text this ""girl"" back in fourth about what she likes, what she wanted to do if we were to hang out, and hows her school life. Now most people at this point don't even continue this conversation because they know it leads to where no 22 year old male should go, but a thought occurred to me. After talking this person I was certainly convinced this was a young teenage girl, and if this was indeed a young teenage girl seriously looking for a hook up on craigslist and casually chats with anyone who texts her then it felt like I had to do something about it. I begin thinking, this girl must be set on having sex with someone or is looking to get into drugs, a naive girl exposing her self to other men who may have other twisted desires who could take advantage of this girl. That was the conclusion of my thoughts and I didn't question it. I don't know what anime or manga or some happy ending friendship story motivated to bother trying to keep this girl in check but I knew one thing for sure. I've seen what happens when a young girl gets involved with the wrong crowd.

I use to date a girl in freshman year who I met by chance, a sweet beautiful girl with a charming smile. She had a bad history of abuse as a child, mother was a drinker and smoker and her dad from what I heard use to molest her and have sex with her when she was just a kid. She became a smoker and drinker at age 11 and would have nightmares of her dad raping her (saw it happening once). She was casual about her smoking habits and as her boyfriend I felt obligated to help her forget her past and move forward. We drifted away 2 weeks in a relationship. We kept in touch as ""friends"" but I think she was just using me as an outlet sometimes to satisfy her sexual urges. As far as drugs, tobacco, or alcohol I could offer none of that to her. Not because I didn't have access to any of that but because I had no interest in it and I had never done either of those.  
Fast forward after my High school Graduation and I hear news that her body was found on the side of a road. The story was that she died of a Heroin overdose and the people she was with at the time freaked out and left her on the road after failing to revive her.

After hearing the news and losing someone who I considered important I felt responsible in a way. I was apathetic at first because I thought ""well that's just what happens..."" but eventually I tell my self ""But what if I was more involved with her, what if I reached out and expressed my concerns or had arguments with her for the purpose of getting her in check"" I took it as a personal goal to better my self as a person to reach out and connect to people I care about. I could see a scenario where this 14 year old girl could start this same path. I was dead set to intervene and try to convince this girl to stay off craigslist.  
But I executed my plan horribly.....

My goal was to meet in person with this girl and have a face to face conversation about what could happen to her if she didn't stay off craigslist. I didn't tell her that that's what I wanted to do and that's where I make my mistake and where this becomes a mess.  
I offer a very casual date initially. Movies, dinner, or even just sitting on a couch to play mario kart. She kinda just brushes it off and suggests something else, rephrasing but I what I meant by asking ""Hang out?"" ""Cut loose?"". The whole idea I was getting is that we're both on **CRAIGSLIST CASUAL ENCOUNTERS** so we should just jump right into it, right....?  
I felt like I had no option, I had to tell that the was going to be sex involved or I might have not been able to meet with this person. I kept going back in fourth in my head thinking this isn't right and that I wasn't really going to do it, I need to do it because I just might end changing someones future if I do. ""But I can't just tell her to get off of craigslist through text...It wouldn't feel like it would have any meaning and she would just go on to the next guy who could have a drug or abuse history. **I'm someone who has never had a drink of alcohol and never used any sort of illegal substance or tobacco,** I trust my self to do this."" Determined I tell this girl that there will be sex and that we would have sex and that it would be ""passionate and firm"". She agrees, she calls me babe and she said she would shower and meet me somewhere close to her home. I take this time to take precautions and get any sexual desire that may dwell in me out of my system. I let one loose and afterwards take a long hot shower to help ease my mind. I start thinking this is too dangerous and I could get in trouble for meeting with a 14 year old, but ultimately I think about what happened to my friend and I'm set to see this through.

I show up to the location...

My memory gets a little hazy from this scene but from I what remember. I'm Sitting in my car enjoying some tunes when I notice a car with head lights closing in on me.  
It rams me on the rear end and a bunch of other cars pull up and it's just men and I think a dog, men with guns, but I don't remember if there were guns, but the feeling just felt like guns pointed at me, rifles, it just felt like rifles. I vaguely remember one of the men asking if I had a bomb in the trunk and I soundly respond no sir. I comply to their rules, I exit the car, hands in the air facing away from what feels like rifles and then two of them throw me on the ground scrape knees and my glasses. They tie me with a ziptie and they escort me to my towns public safety department. I use every ounce of my mental strength to stay zen in this tense moment for me and I think about what I fool I was. It never once occurred to me that a cop was on the other side of these text messages, and they had me perfectly set up to arrest and charge me with a 2nd degree felony of online solicitation of a 13 year old.

I could feel my self losing my breath and my mind almost collapses, this was new to me, I didn't know what to do. I had never been arrested before. I couldn't handle having my hands tied and restricted. I almost panicked, but in a quick frenzy I meditated and realized that the ziptie was actually loose. A little nudge and I was able to slip my hands out from each other. The panic left immediately and I tell my self. ""Everything's going to be ok....""  
I asked the cops to retie after we arrived at the destination.

A setup'd polygraph test here  
A week in Jail  
A year later  
One trial  
Guilty and convicted

My mother has been by my side through all of this and my family has shown the love and support. Some friends have rejected me and some have read the news and seen my name in the media, spread the rumors and raised the awareness of my status of what I did without hearing my story.

My current situation these days is that me and my mother have appealed my case and have been court assigned a lawyer.  
I missed a court day to hear the status of the appeal and I now have a warrant for my arrest for failure to arrive.  
My assigned lawyer did NOT send me any notice of this court date, I never even got a notice that I had a new lawyer until after my previous lawyer told me ""Hey buddy, you have a warrant"" I have phone logs and records with no text messages from this lawyer, no voice mail, no calls, never sent a letter in the mail like I would previously get from my lawyers who were assigned to my case, and when I call his office to sort out this situation his secretary answers and tells me ""He won't speak with you, not until you turn your self in, so you need to do that asap""

I'm scared, I don't know how to handle this and I feel mistreated but I feel so powerless. I've tried complying in the past but every time I speak it feels like I hurt my case more and more. Nobody in the jury believed me, my friends reject me, only my closest's family support but it feels like its not enough. I've been through a lot and sacrificed too much just to sustain where I am right now. I've had to given up some dreams but I still more that I want to live up to someday. Ultimately I want be apart of a community and play video games with others.

312,"I work in the dairy side of the grocery store and I get usually 4 hour shifts closing by myself most of the time. The issue is that they pile stuff on me to do during the limited amount of time and I can only get some of it done plus the essentials. The issue is that I don’t have time to face the whole department and I don’t want to risk staying overtime because higher management will look at our department hours and notice why there’s so much over time.

  My manager the other day had to be sent home early because she racked up 17 hours over her 40 hour work week. So they got a cashier to cover her shift and work longer to help us. 

 My manager tends to over order compared to the last one and it puts a strain on us cause we have a lot of back stock and it’s hard to be organized.

I’m scared that I’m gonna be fired for not being competent enough because my manager is ordering too much stuff. 

My manager constantly ask us to come in early and spams our phones when she needs help. So 4-8 shifts turn into 2-8 shifts 50% of the time and rarely last well into 10.

She only sings in her “head voice” and the pitch is always a little too high and makes me uncomfortable. She was in a child group for a little while but left due to the amount of practice it required. Every once in a while she will send me recordings of her voice and I have no idea how to respond, especially since the recordings are unprompted. Listening to them is almost like nails on a blackboard for me. I feel awful, but I really don’t know what to do. If she were asking for constructive critique I would give it, but the times I have gently suggested the need for more vocal range she just shoots it down. I’m guessing she wants validation but I’m not even sure how to lie about it. Ignoring it definitely makes her feel awful and it shows. I really don’t know what to do when she does this.",08Jul2019,1

My family loves and supports me.  I have a few close friends who care about me. I love myself. I love life. 
I want to be able to understand what I need. I'm in a new city. Just moved into my first apartment. I meet people but i don't like them. I don't like the people I'm friendly with. I don't like them because  I don't know how to connect with them. I want to be able to feel something. After 6 months i haven't met anyone i care about. I feel like there's something wrong with me.  I try to talk to whoever i can but nothing seems substantial. 
I try to be engaging and learn about people and their interests and goals. There's been no one who wants to engage with ne. Maybe that's the wrong approach to meet people. I feel like there's something I'm missing. 
There's no one i can turn to for answers and that scares me. I never knew what it meant to be independent.  I wish i could just cry and let out this tension. I haven't cried in years. 
""men don't cry.""
How can i complain? I've had such a blessed life. 
I don't know how to deal with this emotional pressure. What am I supposed to do with it?

317,"I met my best friend over a year ago in college. Back in late April of this year, she started dating a guy who goes to the same college, but across the state at a different campus (Vancouver, Washington). She’s been living in our college town this summer and goes to visit him every weekend, a 12-hour round trip drive. She recently told me that she got an apartment with him in Vancouver and is planning to transfer to the Vancouver campus next semester. I love her to death and I’ve been critical of some of the other men she’s been with in the past, but I’m worried she’s moving too fast with this guy. I haven’t even had the chance to meet him yet. I don’t know how to bring it up to her without sounding selfish or like I don’t want them to be together, but I’m genuinely worried she’ll get her heart broken and be stuck in a town three hours away from her home, and 6 hours away from our original campus. I’m going to visit her this week. What’s the best way to bring up to her that I’m worried she’s moving too fast without sounding selfish?",08Jul2019,1
319,"His ex faked her death (she had cancer).

I moved with him from another country and after a year she called and he left to see her. I never felt comfortable. Then he started talking with another ex. I decided to go back to my country.

He begged I moved back. He stopped talking with the ex who faked her death because she protested that he had a new relationship. Two years latter he is still talking with his exs. I asked him to block one of them, he did it. On May the ex who faked her death came back, she said she dreamt with him and if I'm OK with them getting back in touch. I was NEVER ok with this.

He still has nudes and videos of them naked. I can see he checked them as soon as she wrote to him. Confronted him , he says he is not blocking her and that he may need her help one day. He has a thing on his hand and she studied medicine.

I asked why he checked her nudes, he said she asked him the photos. He gets too confrontational and says she is just a friend and she may need her help someday. He is not blocking her. I'm not comfortable with them talking. He always lies and says she is the one who texts him, I cam see he texts first. He always texts at night around 11-12pm or when I'm not with him and erases the conversations because I get mad, even if they are innocent conversations.

I want to leave, I feel guilty, maybe I am overreacting. Maybe I'm imposing him to stop communicating with her, I know I don't have the right, but I feel like he is not respecting me or our relationship. I tell him that I read from the situation that he prefers her, he says that if he wanted to be with her he would be with her and not me.

He says that since I won't drop the issue, he changed his mind and is no longer asking me to marry him. I just want to know if he really loves or cares about me. Am I being ungrateful? He has paid for me to live with him and my college, he buys special treats for me. I feel like I am playing the victim and maybe I'm not?

320,"Honestly, I don’t know how I ended up in this position. Perhaps it’s because I’m the only girl of our friend group or because I’m insanely gullible, but I hate it. I ask them to stop every time, point out they’re being mean, but it’s relentless.

I know all of them truly love me and appreciate me as a friend, but the “teasing” becomes too much a lot. They would constantly guilt me into thinking I said something offensive or I said the n-word, especially when we get high. An outside friend was over and witnessed it one day and told them it wasn’t funny, but now everyone even people outside of the friend group is “in on the joke” that brings me to tears at times because sometimes they make it seem too real. That’s just one example. Another is one where they single me out a lot. And really, they’re all harmless jokes, but they drag it on and really dig  their claws in and just keep going until I’m actually hurt. My boyfriend specifically, anytime these jokes start, he goes all in. It feels like he has a goal to make me cry. I call them out every time. Ask them to stop. But I think they think that’s part of the joke. No matter how many times I tell them they’re being mean or ask them to stop, it doesn’t. I even paid attention to when they do it to our other friends and it’s usually two comments before they move on. Idk if it’s like children where your reaction makes them do things more because it’s funny, but it’s really getting to a point it’s hard to cope with. I don’t want to hang out with them sometimes because of it. Ik I didn’t do a good job explaining, but it’s really bad. I have too awful of a memory to just tell you situations and all that, but I always remember how I feel. I just want to know how to cope with this weird form of bullying. I don’t want to confront them, it’d make things too weird and just isn’t worth trying to do as I already openly try to let them know I don’t like it and that it’s not funny. Literally telling my boyfriend in private that I hated it and that I wanted it to stop, but it doesn’t. So I just really want to know how to cope with it.

323,"So, for the friends I have as a 17yo male in high school: I have very few really good friends, I’ve never really had a large pool of friends to begin with. But I have a really toxic friend and I don’t know what to do about it. Among many things, he acts as if he cannot possibly be worse than me at anything, always putting me down. The easiest example to use is that we were talking about how our Christmas break went, and I mentioned that my cousin, who I’m fairly close to, is getting married. He instantly snapped back with a tone that said “well, that’s nothing,” and boasted about how many of his siblings were also engaged. The worst it has been was after we got back our ACT scores, which is kind of a big deal, and I got a 33 (out of 36) and he shrugged it off by saying I was just good at test taking. This genuinely pissed me off. He constantly does things like this, he gets especially bad when we play video games, and I win multiple times in a row. You can almost see the salt on his face in those moments.  The reason we really became friends is just because of mutual interests, no sort of sentiment what so ever.

The reason this is hard for me is that I go to a boarding school, and I see him every day we are there. I will admit, he is fine most of the time, but the toxicity is hard to deal with and the constant contact I have with him is not helping the situation. 

Now the second query, I find it really hard to make friends. I think I’ve figured out why, but I have no way to fix it in sight. I see people as potential friends, but I never do anything to help the relationship because I don’t want to be annoying or weird to the point of ruining it before it started. I just don’t know how to deal with this double edged blade. 

And to tie the two together, I think the reason I’m good friends with the first guy is because he isn’t a valuable friend, so I don’t see a risk of losing him because there isn’t much to lose.

P.S.: Sorry for bad format, I’m on mobile. And thanks to all the advice.",08Jul2019,3
326,"Hi all! I am looking for some self help books about anger management that would appeal to my father.

He has openly said to me that he wants to work on his anger problems because 1) he noticed he gets very angry over things he thinks he shouldn't be and 2) he has recently been diagnosed with high blood pressure and has reached incredibly dangerous levels due to his anger.

He asked me about a pill that would make him ""chill out"" and is looking into CBD as an option. He takes a high blood pressure medication but he says it does not help him when he is angry. I suggested therapy and he considered that it could be helpful but doesn't think he's ""that bad"" to the point where he ""needs it."" He didn't ask for a self help book, but I think if I gave it to him that he would use it and it could help him.

\-52yrs old, male, white, retired military (USA) and currently working 2 jobs, grew up in/out of foster care and abuse but will NOT talk about details (I don't know if I want a book to trigger him when he isn't seeing a mental health professional)

\-lives with wife (50), and two sons (16 &amp; 7)

\-self reported anger about traffic, politics, annoying sounds, public disturbances (ex: loud music), defiant teenage son, and not getting left alone enough

I messaged my boyf (only known for 4months) saying I did something, saying I saw something that I shouldn’t have and that things are not good right now or have been at all really. I could go into detail, but that would turn into a rant. Later when we called I couldn’t bring myself to physically say the words to him. I’ve done a lot of shitty things I can’t verbally express to the people I care about: stealing drugs from family members, self sabotaging in certain ways, self harming. He says it’s important to have have trust and since I hold the information so it’s up to me. I’m constantly evasive, constantly vague. He says he should know whatever it is I did because he cares about me and doesn’t want anything bad to happen to me, and that I should know I can tell him things. I just kind of, stayed silent, and when I did speak I didn’t make sense and I could feel the frustration.

328,"So this girl I met in Feb told me she liked me a few days after we met. I told her she seemed nice enough though my feelings don't move that quickly, we would need to be friends for a while first; but that I could promise her I wouldn't be talking to other girls in the meantime. She said the same about guys.

So we get closer and basically come to depend on each other a good bit. Neither of us seems disinterested at any point, had a couple arguments but moved on easily. Finally I say sure let's get serious.

I have OCD. A week ago Saturday I had a flare-up of symptoms triggered by me doing something I had been trying to avoid doing, leading me into a spiral of self-doubt. Normally I would have stayed a bit quieter and let it pass before talking to her again but she had been out of town and I really wanted to talk. Sure enough, she says something that I end up going in circles over in my head. I spam her most of the day with little response, intermittently realizing what reality actually is and sending a message like, ""please don't judge me for today I am having a pretty hard time with my OCD.""

The next day she called and I apologized again and she said it's fine chill nothing's changed.

As this past week went on I realized I was the only one starting any convos, even though they were usually pretty normal once they started. She canceled seeing me Monday; when she used the same excuse and canceled Friday, I asked if she really even wanted to see me. She said she did but it was weird. I said, ""if you still like me let's hang out. If you're not sure, I gotta move on.""

We haven't talked in 3 days now. I hate giving an ultimatum and I probably wouldn't have if I wasn't so mad. I know the reasonable thing to do would probably have been to just stop texting for a bit and let her come back if she was going to.

Now I'm afraid I ruined anything that could have happened by overreacting. I'm debating sending this text: ""I didn't mean it to be an ultimatum. It came out like that because I was mad. If it's weird for you then whatever, it is what it is. Friends?"" and seeing if I can't just restart the whole thing from scratch by giving her space.

But, my friend(18F) is completely addicted to the internet. She spends most her time on her phone or playing games. She has a bunch of online friends that she spends a lot of time talking to. Now i play some games online and I'll play with them too on occasion and some of them are alright, if a little awkward and weird, but many are just downright creepy. She is a bit naive and isnt as careful as she can be and she has a personality that leads these guys to think she wants them. This whole part of her online persona really weirds me out but isnt the heart of the problem. Her habit is really unhealthy for her. She stays in our apartment all day and spends most of the night awake watching a screen. She eats crap and doesnt excercise and also hasnt gotten a job since she moved here about a month and a half ago. Me and my other roommate(19M) have gotten pretty stressed since we've been helping her addiction since she moved here and she doesnt have any savings so we have been paying all the bills and buying her groceries. Most of which being junk food that we dont have since we're both health-nuts who try hard to better ourselves and personally ive been trying to get out of her same habits.

331,"Alright. I need some advice about what to do with my life. 

I'm a guy in my mid 20s and I'm currently in a funk. I'm not sure what to do about work, my social life or anything right now. 

So for a little background information. I just moved back in with my parents. I had been living on my own out of state for a couple of years but financially things got tough and I had to move back in with my parents. My goal is to move out of state somewhere again after I get a job and start saving up some money. Unfortunately I've only lived in 2 cities and I dont want to continue living in either of them so I'm not sure where to go. 

That is the beginning of my problems. I dont know where to move to and I dont know what to do for work. 

The work part is the more pressing issue. I have been out of work for a few months and I'm having a hard time finding a job but part of it is because I'm very particular on where I'm applying. And I cant get over that. I didnt go to college so I feel like I'm already struggling in comparison to others. But the problem is nothing sounds like it will be good for me. Something I've always struggled with is finding the drive to do things. I dont feel like I'm lazy because when I'm doing something I put all my effort in to it. And when I'm working I'm there every day and working hard all day, but now that I'm out of work and I think about going to work somewhere I just feel really unmotivated. And I think part of that is I feel like my options and my potential are limited by not having a college degree. I also struggle because I have absolutely no idea what I want to do for a job. I couldn't even tell you what my dream job would be. So it's hard to find something I want to go do. And going back to school isnt an option because I cant afford it and I really hated school. Both high school and the year of college I did. 

As a result of not working I've just been at home a lot. I really struggle with talking to people. I didnt have many friends growing up and I only really dated one girl so I dont really know how to talk to girls or people and try and make friends. And the idea of going somewhere to try and mingle does not sound appealing. I've tried tinder and stuff but nothing has come of it and I'm just not sure how to get over this. 

I have hobbies but for the most part they take place at the house so I cant really meet people doing them. And even if I could I'm not sure I would want to. I enjoy going for walks but I just want to put my headphones in. I dont want to talk to someone on the street. I want friends I can do things with but I have a hard time connecting with people so I just prefer to not try. 

I don't know how to get myself thinking and feeling a different way. I just need some kind of advice to get out of a funk. 

I left a lot of stuff vague on purpose but I would be happy to discuss more detail in a PM. Any advice would be just wonderful.

I'm a female in my 20s.

As a child, my older brother has on a few occasions forced me to kiss him or touch his privates. Due to some recent events, he has suggested he has done more to me that I dont remember happening.. but I also don't remember the majority of my childhood.

I try not to think about any childhood memories, because most of them are generally bad. These thoughts have been festering for around 5 years now and I haven't told anyone about what was done to me. My mother is abusive and my father was constantly working to support us (family of 6), so he wasn't home often.

We're all adults now and I almost feel like it's too late to do anything about it. I also don't want my parents to think it's a lie. My older brother has a daughter and I feel like I'll ruin his life with this information.


My primary question is.. Should I actually come out about it?

Some back story.
I’m 20 years old. I have been in a relationship with a girl I’ve known since we were in the 7th grade. We have been together now for 2.5 years. 

We are from Texas and in the past years probably really starting in the end of 2018 all around the time I got this really great job at a call center. Making about $17 an hour which is great for my age In my opinion.  I loved the money but hated the work. Every day I would dread going to work. But would be incredibly happy leaving at the end of the day or getting my check. I would spend time with my girlfriend and be happy. Only getting in a sad miserable slump ever so often. Now it is around March of 2019 and my gf’s parents are talking about moving to their dream area in Florida. Her dad gets transferred within his job and her mother begins working from home. They move. My gf finished her semester in community college and I keep keep working. My gf and I are supposed to leave a few weeks after her semester. I keep putting off notifying my employer about my two weeks notice. Until it’s very close to when we leave. I then quit via email to my supervisor on 5/12/2019 (Mother’s Day) I then spend a week in Texas packing all of my things and begin the move to Florida with her and her parents and older sister. I am great full for her parents as they like me and are basically supporting me while I look for a job. ( a side note I have now left my recently divorced parents back in Texas where I was living with my mother) I am now living in Florida with a few hundred dollars to my name and struggling to find a job that will pay me well in my area. My parents offer to send me money but I denied it as it is a huge hit to me personally in my pride I guess. Now I find that I am constantly depressed and can’t quit thinking about “how I made a mistake” yet I hated my job  or how I wish I still lived in Texas yet it was getting increasingly harder to live with my mom as her mood was terrible all of the time not to mention her recent stokes a few months before me leaving. I don’t want this to sound bad because I do have a good situation with people who care about me but now I feel more sad then ever. More lost than I ever have. I feel as I am taking a huge step back in life when I already had absolutely no clue as to what I want to do in the first place. I feel as if I might have made a mistake and I’m not sure what to do. I appreciate any advise ahead of time. Sorry for the incredibly long post that probably has many grammatical errors.",08Jul2019,1
340,"I’m just over 30 years old. I’m unemployed, considerably obese, basically alcoholic, literally live in my mom’s basement, have no romantic prospects (and all of my past girlfriends are now extremely successful), and my best friend and really my only close friend in the state is most likely going to prison for a felony. I don’t know if this is the right place to post this since I’m not entirely sure there’s any advice that I haven’t already tried but thought I’d ask.

I’m just going to do bullet points since god knows if anyone cares.

1. Have had depression since I was about 13, have been in therapy (on and off) since 18 and on medication the whole time

2. College was the only time I was happy in my life. After graduation, Planned to take a year off to prepare for law school admissions test (the law market had just collapsed so this was actually a good idea and when I did finally go I got a very good scholarship—inconceivable if I had applied right away, one good thing to come out of this). 

3. Girlfriend of the time, who I’m still basically in love with (even though we’ve been broken up for a very long time), shattered my pride and confidence in doing well in college by calling me lazy for taking the time off even though she didn’t do shit in college (nearly failed out). Still haven’t recovered.

3. Broke up with this girl about a year after this due thinking I could get my confidence back but haven’t in spite of everything I’ve done. She’s now, in no small part due to her rich dad in her field, extremely successful and will be better off than me no matter what. My other past girlfriends are: doctors at elite hospitals (2), one professor, one other high level medical professional. Worst is a girl I dated somewhat briefly in law school who is making well into the six figures even though I did better than her in law school (law is kinda strange because firms start their salaries so high, I was never given a chance in spite of my better resume)

4. By comparison, I’m unemployed even though I went to and did fairly well at a quite highly ranked law school. I live in my mom’s basement and the stress has led to increasing alcoholism over the last 6 or so years. Earlier this year I took a month off from drinking and didn’t improve so I gave up.

5. Two years ago, after working just about the worst kind of lawyer job possible (document review on a contract basis), I decided to take the money I had from working during law school (and living with my mom) to pursue a masters in a high demand legal field overseas. The much lower tuition meant I could basically cover living just off the difference.

6. Just prior to leaving I had a serious injury, which takes about 9-12 months to recover. Douchebag professor used this to basically single me out for being behind on work (which I told him I would be but would try to make it up before the exams). I ultimately had to push most of my exams to this year, but I nearly failed one of his courses (I believe because one of his subordinates gave me shit and I basically told her off).

7. I am now having to take the exams next month and, because the school didn’t inform me I’d be tested on this year’s rather than last year’s materials, I spent much of the year (and hundreds of hours) studying the wrong material. I used up so much energy I’m completely exhausted and when I try to study I just can’-I get basically panic attacks. 

8. I’ve hated being a lawyer and thought maybe if I did some volunteer work it could help me feel better. I’ve hated this just as much and get basically no satisfaction from helping people, even though they’d be on their own anyways. 

9. My immediate family are all extremely successful and with my time at home I’ve helped raised my very young niece and nephew, whom I love dearly. 

10. All of my high school friends live near me but I never see them because we’ve grown apart and can’t get along anymore. My best friend in my state recently got arrested for a felony and is very possibly going to prison for at least a year. I’ve reconnected with a few other friends but they’ve all scattered so I can’t see them more than maybe three times a year.

11. I’m not suicidal, I just think this sucks and feel like such a worthless loser. Probably the part that makes me saddest is the realization my nephew and niece will one day realize what a fucking loser I am and I’ll stop being cool uncle [TheHoundsVengeance].

Tl;dr: I’m basically the stereotype of a loser (70 pounds overweight, unemployed, live in my moms basement, more or less alcoholic, no career or love prospects). I’ve tried everything I can (volunteer, time with family/friends, career change, doing things that used to make me happy) and it hasn’t helped.

341,"My landlord is going through a divorce. Alright, I can be understanding. She kicked him out and is organizing things in the house. 

Her rules? Give her son the tv when he is home (I don’t like that she’s teaching him instant gratification, but it’s not my place). Clean my dishes after use, so no dirty dishes that she can see, keep the smell of my room down (my roommates room stinks 24/7 so that rule was put in place), and split bathroom duties with the roommate. I can’t have people over overnight and until recently I couldn’t have anyone overall. 

Alright. I can do that. 

I am supposed to get Netflix included. I am supposed to have certain sections of the fridge that is solely for my food. I am supposed to have a section for my shoes in the shoe closet (she doesn’t like people wearing shoes inside other then slippers and I grew up with that so whatever). 

Her husband moved out and changed the Netflix password, I asked her about it (hoping she’d either get Netflix herself, or lower my rent) I got told, deal with it or move out i don’t need more drama I’m going through a divorce 

She moved all my shoes to a higher spot without asking because she is organizing the house. Fine by me, but she didn’t tell me she’d be moving my things too, didn’t talked to me, just moved it. 

She completely took over all my room in the fridge. I told her I was starting to diet and was getting ready to use it, but when I came to her about it, that I didn’t like her in my space I got told “you don’t even use it” . 

She wants me off the tv when her son is home, so usually (unless they’re gone) use the tv at night. Now she’s telling me that I “shouldn’t be on the tv that much anyway” and that she doesn’t want me using the tv for extended periods of time.

342,"Not too long of a post.

I am male, 24 years old.

We met through friends, clicked instantly, and it was really great getting to know her and talk to her every day. I’m considered a really good looking guy, and am often the center of friend hangouts because I mask my pretty severe social anxiety well enough that no one notices. My anxiety leads me to, despite having female attention, feel really shitty about myself and feel not good enough. I’ve had several really bad experiences of crushing on girls that never went anywhere and messed with me pretty bad. But...For the first time it felt like a girl was texting ME first because she wanted to talk to me for me and not my looks, willing to text at length all day long. She also initiated physical contact first, and was very clearly telegraphing interest. When she said she had a huge crush on me a few days later, it floored me.

But I messed up really bad. I got impatient, and felt offended when she blew me off for work (which she was NOT lying about). I then let the convo die down over a week, but immediately regretted it. I never said anythig mean or nasty, the conversation just died and I stopped answering. When I apologized for how I acted (I had a parent dealing with cancer and my emotions got the best of me, I really wasn’t thinking clearly) she basically told me it’s better we stay friends, but then immediately cut me off. Stopped all contact and ended my friend group.

A month later I wanted to apologize, because I basically destroyed our friend group. At first she said I didn’t do anything wrong, but then downplayed how we were talking and flirting with each other like it never happened. And not even a few texts later she said “what do you expect, me to like you after you stopped talking to me?”. She basically crushed me, and was clearly trying to hurt me. She then told my best friend that “we (me and her) could he friends but nothing will ever come of it”. (She also likes his pictures that I’m in to this day). 

To end the apology convo she told me she was flattered I was thinking about her but she had absolutely no interest at all, and all I could give back was a pretty defeated “ok”.

It’s been a few months now (around 2-3) and the group is showing signs of getting back together, really soon. Sooner than I’m ready for if I’m honest. I feel really embarrassed and ashamed and like this person who would once text me every day asking me how I was doing hates me with all of her being and wants to erase me from her life. I feel like I bruised her ego really badly, and made her feel bad about herself for liking me and she lashed out.

How do I handle this sort of thing? Do I politely decline an invite out and let my best friend go on his own? Do I act like nothing happened and be cordial? Could this be fixed? Help would be nice right about now.

Tldr; girl who I almost dated now hates me, but I’m most likely gonna see her again. What do I do?",08Jul2019,1

346,"I’ve struggled for a long time emotionally due to my relationship with my dad and the stress that it brings. He is an active addict, and although I already have little contact with him, I still have him on social media and talk to him occasionally, as well as have young siblings who are minors and still in contact with him. Pretty much any interaction with him, whether directly or indirectly, is very emotionally triggering and painful for me. I doubt he knows this either, because I’ve never really told him (I’m pretty non-confrontational as I’d rather not induce more stress/conflict, plus, I think I somewhat fear damaging what relationship we do have by bringing up anything that could cause him pain/trigger him)

However, I really think I’ve reached a breaking point. I feel like I can’t take it anymore. I don’t even know if what little I’ve said here is enough to ask for advice, but I guess I’m looking for any kind of insight from anyone who either is an addict or has an addict parent or loved one, or who has gone through anything similar. 

Is it worth it to let him know how much fucking pain he causes me? How I fear that he’s now ruining my siblings lives and setting them up for failure? That I don’t understand why he can’t just make one good decision to turn his life around and seek help.

I don’t know. My fear in confronting him is that I will end up triggering him. I don’t want to cause him to use, or fall deeper into depression and possibly even hurt himself (I am one of the only positive relationships in his life anymore). If that’s the case, is it better to just cut contact to save myself the pain? I don’t know what to do. I struggle between doing what is best for my sanity and continuing to try and be there for him, but I’m clearly not equipped to handle that, anyway.",08Jul2019,1
347,"Hello all,

Ok so I've been going to the same gym for about 3 years now without a single issue. Today started off normal just like any other day. I was doing chest flys on cable and my gym buddy (both of us are guys) came up to me and started talking to me, he was standing on my right and I was kind of standing with my body turned towards him as I was speaking to him during my resting period inbetween sets.

So I'm talking to my buddy and out of nowhere some guy comes from my left side (more behind me actually) and starts yelling and at first I didn't realize what was going on. So I look at him and he starts yelling things like ""You think you're better than me"" and ""I heard you talking about me"" or something like that. I've never met this person in my life. My buddy and I both turn around to look behind us because we think he's talking to someone behind us and he goes ""yeah you with the red hat"" (me). 

So I approach him and I'm like I did not say a single thing about you, what did I say? And he's like ""You tell me what you said"" and he's like furious. Like this guy is absolutely fuming. I'm like no for real I did not say anything about you and so he just motions with his hand like forget it, puts his headphones back in and gets back to his set. 

My gym buddy is looking at me like what the fuck just happened, I ask my buddy did I say something about him or even point in his direction because I'm im disbelief. Another friend who was there but was a bit further away and seen it all was like ignore him, he had headphones in, how could he even hear you if you even said anything about him. 

So I'm just feeling incredibly uncomfortable right now and even a little unsafe going to my gym. It is a 24 hours gym but staff leave at 4 on the weekends so nobody was there. I'm considering talking to the manager tomorrow about it and explaiming I feel unsafe, since I've been coming here for years, we're on a first name basis and she's very nice to me. I am a VERY non-confrontational person and this experience literally left my shaking. Despite being non-confrontational I ran straight up to him to see what the fuck he was saying so I'm very proud of myself. 

Do you guys think I should speak to management and risk this becoming a huge issue possibly requiring a gym change or should I let it go and if he approaches again then tell management? I swear I did not say a single thing about him, I've never even seen him in my life. Everyone there was basically staring at us, it was horrific. 

Thank you",08Jul2019,1
348,"The gist of the whole thing is I that I felt kind of awkward and weird, and I just don’t usually don’t well with groups of people that i don’t know. So anyways, one of my friends invited me to his house, and we’re about to play beer pong and just drink at his house.

I don’t really drink but I smoke weed, and just hit it with some with the other 2 people that were there (out of 5). And I turned down a drink which I felt bad about, and i have also never played the bong game before so I didn’t know some of the intricate rules, and they had to tell me, and that was embarrassing.

Also I should add that I’m not a part of the original circle group and everybody else have been childhood friends. I’ve known only one guy for about 1 year or so. I made a couple jokes, and got some laughs a few times but I just felt really awkward, but idk if it’s from the weed and I’m just magnifying everything.

We played basketball beforehand and everything went fine there, as I’m decent at it but how do I shake the feeling that things were just a little weird and awkward. I just wish I could be as carefree and not give a fuck like some people.",08Jul2019,1

I’ve just graduated high school and started going out with a girl I’ve liked since the beginning of junior high. I have a very close knit group of 10 friends who I consider family. Before I started going out with her she was in a lengthy relationship with one of my closer friends inside of this circle.

356,"To be honest, this breakup has been a long time coming. We've been together for almost 3 years, but we've been in a long-distance relationship for almost a year now and it just isn't working out. We've talked about this for months, and we even decided and followed through with concrete actions to make it better, but nothing has worked. We were just growing apart. I've been waiting for a better time to have that talk because he's been so down lately and it was just his birthday a few weeks ago. We actually decided to discuss our relationship on July 30 after giving the concrete actions some time to work/not work, so I have been waiting for that chance to be honest.

Today, he opened up to me that he's been feeling miserable about a lot of things. And he also told me that he's recently been thinking that he might want kids someday after all (note that I'm decidedly child-free, and so was he. In fact, I always bring up potential kids within the first few dates so as not to waste other people's time). This was definitely a lot for me to take in, but I decided not to kick him while he's down so I bit my tongue about this being an absolute deal-breaker for me. I just told him it's his decision to make, and I won't have him make that decision based on what I want because that wouldn't be fair to either of us and would only ever lead to guilt/resentment down the line.

Anyway, like I said, I didn't want to kick him while he's down so I said nothing about how I've been feeling, but **he chose to bring it up**. He said that we shouldn't wait to discuss our relationship and just have that talk today. I don't really want to lie to him about wanting to stay together, but I would also feel like such an asshole if I break up with him today while he's been feeling really terrible.

I feel like I’m pretty scared to do this, it feels so big, even though on paper, it isn’t. Shouldn’t it come naturally? I don’t feel pretty enough, or even normal enough for stuff like this. Sometimes, I just wish I wouldn’t have to go through all this and just like a regular job, end of story.. I have so many dreams but they seem to me like they never do actually fit. Is it that I don’t believe in myself or I’m actually self aware? When I look at my self in the camera I see a little kid, unattractive, small, irrelevant, abnormal even. I know this is so hard and if anyone told me that about themselves I would sush them! Who talks like that? I also feel like I’m not honest enough to do this job. I see actors who can freely be themselves, I wish I could be like that. I feel like a child all the god damn time. It’s tiring and discouraging.

Should I just quit all this and travel and figure myself out? Because right now, I can’t even approach real, let alone do it and experience it.

359,"My parents moved overseas to their home country 6 months ago leaving me (23F) in another country. It was never really spoken about that they were planning on moving back there until the day the movers came and everything was being packed up.  I decided to stay where I am due to having lived her most of my life, plus my boyfriend lives here, my job is here and I have friends here. If I moved with them I would be starting my life over completely.  


Anyway, I live with my boyfriend now and everything has been working out so far. My parents were never really fond of my boyfriend. I'm not exactly sure why but they never really gave him a chance in my opinion. He has been out of work for a couple of months now which has left me paying the rent and all the bills. It doesn't bother me too much, it's just stressful being responsible for the finances, especially considering this is the first time I have lived on my own.  


I speak to my parents once a week and every time I talk to them on the phone they fish for information on my boyfriend to see whether he has a job yet. As it's only a week between calls, usually the answer is no, he is yet to find something. That's usually when they start telling me I should move there with them and start fresh or just take a break to compose myself and think about my future. They want me to continue my studies (as do I) but at the moment I don't have the time to continue studies with my workload and schedule.   


Last week I had a rough week dealing with a lot of bills and rent coming in at once as they usually do and was left with very little money until my next paycheck. I was upset and decided to call my parents which I think was my first mistake. They told me I need to get out of this country and go to them, take a holiday and get away from my boyfriend so he can find a job and work, and potentially find us a new place to stay in. At that point I was tired, stressed and sick of hearing the same thing from my parents so at the time I said I would stay with them for 3 months (the duration of a visa) and then go back to my boyfriend.  


Shortly after my boyfriend and I discussed this, neither of us were really happy about the idea. He supports me with whatever I want to do, and he told me if this is something I need to do for myself then I should go. But it wasn't long after that I quickly decided against staying with my parents. I would lose my job here, and there's no guarantee that my boyfriend would 1. find a job and save enough money in 3 months &amp; 2. find a house in 3 months that we both could live in. As well as that it would put him into the same situation I am in now where he would be the only one working and I would have to be looking for work.   


I miss my parents and I want to keep studying and feel less depressed and in my daily life, but I don't think I can just leave my boyfriend for 3 months in hopes he finds work and then come back to being out of a job myself. If I went to live with my parents for a while I believe that they would try to convince me to stay there with them and not go back to where I am now. Since I changed my mind about going to stay with them, my parents haven't spoken to me. The last thing they said to me was that my boyfriend is manipulating my decision (which isn't true) and then told me to ""have a nice life"". Do I leave them alone for a while or do I try to speak with them?   


I'm sorry for rambling and probably not making sense but I'm really not sure what to do.

362,"So I’m entering my sophomore year of college, and I just really want to be more successful with getting dates. I live off campus, at home and unsurprisingly the only two girls I was talking to were commuters as well. 

I haven’t had a real actual relationship and that’s kind of bugging me too. The one girl who I was mainly talking to and seeing, I thought was my gf, but things kind of fizzled out, but I got to experience a lot of coupley things so that’s cool.

I’m kind of your standard shy dude, in terms of I just I usually don’t approach girls unless there’s an excuse, I might sit next to them, try to talk to them, play a little starring game, but I don’t think I’ve ever really just straightforwardly asked anybody out.

I’m wondering if I should start being a little more not necessarily careless, but proactive with my approach to dating, in terms of just talking to more girls and being more upfront and showing my interest more. I’ll usually try to be slick or something, but as an example.

I might start a new class, talk to a girl, talk about whatever, we don’t necessarily hit it off exactly but you can tell there’s just a level of mutual friendliness. Would it be desperate to ask for there social media’s or anything like that if let’s say this was the first or second time talking? 

What I’m kind of getting at is that would it be a good idea to start “shooting more shots,” be more outwardly flirty, and just overall more straightforward? The problem with this, is that I could just get rejected more, and I might come off as too strong or something.

Something that I read here on reddit, was a study that said women basically are more likely to regret sex, and men are more likely to regret not pursuing sex or asking them out, or whatever. This got me thinking that if I’m just a little more touchy, flirty, straightforward, and outward, then I’d have more success, because the idea is that more girls will just kind of hopefully give me a chance, and end up liking me, vs I what I usually do know is I don’t entertain making above unless there are CLEAR obvious signs where the girl initiates, which I’m learning that most woman don’t do.

Sorry for the long post but essentially I’m asking if I do a lot more initiation, in terms of asking out, making moves, just approaching girls, etc. I don’t really know, so what do you guys think?",08Jul2019,1

The issue here is my mom is super super paranoid and close minded, she would never accept me talking to some internet guy. She was hidden in the stairs and heard everything I said and the she just stood in front of me and said “who are you talking to”?

At first I said I wasn’t talking (I didn’t know she was there), after I confessed I was talking to a friend of me (not an internet one)

She didn’t believe me and started yelling me claiming that I was lying. She said “from what I ve heard I feel like I don’t even know you” She said that is issue is ultra serious.

After I insisted I was talking to this friend, she just said “stop talking! I dont wanna see you” so i am here in my room worried of what will await me tomorrow

Please help me, any advice on how to handle this? How can I calm dow my mom? I wasn’t doing anything serious or “bad” I know it is just her paranoia,  I believe that I may be in serious trouble due to something that is not that serious.

Additionally we both live in Switzerland, so healthcare is not completely free but at least affordable.  


 I don't know what to do anymore, I would be grateful if anyone could give me at least some advice.",08Jul2019,1
376,"This is my first ever Reddit post - please be kind!

I have been renting a small 2-bedroom house directly from a private landlord for about 2 years now. I chose to rent this house for 3 reasons; 1) It is close to work; 2) It is close to my sister (we offer each other a very good support network as the rest of our family live hours away); 3) It is pet-friendly (finding pet-friendly rented property in my city is near-impossible).

I had a bit of a rough year last year, and my personal/financial circumstances changed. Therefore, I had a sub-tenant move in to the second bedroom for a bit of extra income, i.e. she pays me a fixed fee for the room, and I still pay the overall rent to the landlord, plus all the bills. She is a great housemate, and we get on well for the most part. The agreement she signed upon move-in is on a month-to-month basis, i.e. she only needs to give me a month's notice should she wish to move out, and vice versa. The furnishings/kitchen stuff/TV etc. are all mine so she basically just moved in with her clothes and personal belongings. I am still the primary tenant on the lease and coordinate all repairs/issues to the landlord.

My boyfriend and I have been talking about moving in together for a couple of months now. He currently lives with family, so we are not bound to a timeline as to when we have to find somewhere, but we have both agreed we'd like to take the next step and try out living together within the next few months. Originally, we had talked about finding a new place altogether, and moving out of my current house, mostly so we weren't forcing out my sub-tenant due to circumstances beyond her control.

However, we are facing a few issues. We have not yet been able to find ANY houses that allow pets. I have probably sent enquiries to around 20 houses in the city so far, and all of them have said the same thing. We are also struggling to find properties anywhere close to where I am living now, i.e. close to my sister, and close to my work.

Therefore, it seems more practical to speak with my sub-tenant and ask her to find another place (as she is not bound by a pet/furnishings/etc.) and there are LOTS of places available in our city for those without pets. I am aware this is a selfish decision on my part and I want to make this as easy for her as possible. How do I approach this with her, and what can I do in order to inconvenience her as little as possible?

Thank you in advance!",08Jul2019,2

380,"I (29M) am a typical young urban professional living in a major city. I grew up upper middle class, but then my mother died shortly before I graduated university, and then the family business went under and my dad (60M) is practically bankrupt.

I've been helping him financially - here and there at first, but more so in the past year. I make decent money, but I'm not a banker or a management consultant that makes a truckload of money, and I live in a city with a high cost of living. He lives in my hometown, where the cost of living is substantially lower.

He's currently building a business with an incoming investment - which would honestly solve everything financially - but the money's been delayed for some time (I'm not holding my breath). He also recently developed a chronic illness that requires quite a bit of medical care.

Here's the situation with my job:

\- My current job lets me work remotely. Essentially, I can move back to my hometown while getting paid the same amount, and get more bang for my buck. My dad and I can live together, for example, and we'd save on rent.

\- But I was recently offered a new job at a reputable company. I would make slightly more money on a monthly basis, but when you factor in things like bonuses and benefits, I would make about 40% more. Money aside, it's an opportunity that would work wonders for my career. But the catch is that I won't be able to move back to my hometown.

Earlier today, i hear from one of our mutual friends that she told them, that i hit her, which i did not.

I have talked to my best friend about it, and my phycologist, but i am affraid that she hasnt been loyal to me.

A few hours ago, overheard her and one of her friends talking about her cheating on me, i think that she's only teasing me, but im not sure whats true or false anymore. It's reached the point where i feel that i need to setup a taperecorder, which i did in our bedroom just a few minutes ago. 

Im scared for what will happen to our relationship, i love my future wife, and i have an adopted son, who's in college.

386,"okay so I have this amazing best friend. Recently, I’ve noticed she would be “copying” me a bit.

 For example, I was giving advice to a friend in a group chat since they were having relationship problems. At the time, nobody saw my message except my best friend who I will call “Reggie.” She agreed with my advice. Some time later when everybody is active, she repeats MY EXACT ADVICE and everybody is agreeing with her. They even complimented her on her “great advice.” She never mentioned me, not once. However, I didn’t say anything, perhaps it was nothing? 

Another time,  I noticed something was up with my friend (which nobody else has noticed). She wasn’t texting as much as usual even though she was active a lot online. I was aware she recently had some relationship problems so I was worried. I told everyone and they all agreed. Reggie doesn’t reply. All of a sudden, “reggie” messages my friend asking “are you feeling okay? Ur not texting much.” 

Okay. That’s great that she’s checking up on my friend, but why couldn’t she tell everyone that she was going to message her? It seems like Reggie is the one noticing everything “wrong” and taking credit for it. Even though I was the one who noticed it first? I was going to ask my friend if something was wrong but she did it before me. 

Not to mention, was also VERY persistent on claiming my friend wasn’t okay. When my friend said she was “fine,” Reggie said “ur not fine, wots wrong?” My friend persists she was alright. Reggie says, “u sure? Cuz pretty sure you’re not.”  It was like Reggie was the one who worried about my friend the most, well, at least in my friend’s eyes. I just wish she knew everyone cared about her, but it’s kinda too late to tell her now I think.

 I was a bit angered, but my friend is more important than someone taking credit for my ideas. As long as my friend is okay, I guess I could deal with it in the most part.

Sorry if some things didn’t make much sense. I kinda typed everything in the heat of the moment. 

I feel like I’m a stuck up, terrible person for believing Reggie was taking credit for my ideas, even getting mad. Maybe she was just worried, but I’m still suspicious lol. So far, I never said anything to her. I just kept quiet since getting angry wasn’t going to fix anything. Any ideas?",08Jul2019,1

An is a fellow redddit member actually, when I first met him (btw im female An is male), and he told me he was a fellow redditor I was actually pumped, it was the first person at thix new school that has talked to me about reddit. He was actually kinda funny at first and he seemed like the type of person you'd get along with really well no matter the gender. BUT that act  that he put up for because I was the new kid didnt even last an hour. He started making racist comments like mocking others accents ( Mainly he mocks the Filipino accent because his ""ah-ma"" as we call it -maid- has that accent"". I then changed my whole perspective of him and realized why everyone was warning me about him, i should've avoided him and his toxic-ness but, well, you only want what you can't have. And dont get the wron idea I dont have a crush on him i only wanted to be friends.

He has been really rude to me calling me a horse and e.t.c which isnt even an insult honestly, but its really irritating because even when I ignore him, he chooses to persuade whatever insuly he's thrown at me. He made fun of me for not having a maid at home (which since i was already ashamed of myself i dint mention it was because of money i said it was because i could do things on my own, reason why is because the one time i told him money was an issue he just told me ""then get some"" which then i told him ""thats not how that works"" he just said haha you're poor, so fuck it im not telling him money is an issue.)

394," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'eh that lads just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she stared at me and quickly grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in this night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her wiping the table , she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit.

Few months ago we went on totally innocent drink. I pointed out her scar and said to her ""cool scar, how did you managed to cut yourself there?"". I dont remember her reply but half an hour later she starts crying and tells me that thats her suicide attempt from few years ago. I felt like shit.

After that, she opened up. Her father beat her up while mom watched and did nothing. Then she told me that her boyfriend has anger issues and hits her from time to time. She is so deep into that, that she finds it normal. I broke down crying when she told me I would hit her after some time. Then she finished it with ""don't worry, thats normal"". 

She told me once that she is hungry. Then we stopped talking about that. We stopped on a gas station few minutes later to get some gas and when I went inside to pay for it, I bought chocolate for her. She started crying because never ever someone did that for her and her words were ""thats nicest thing someone ever did for me"". Because I bought a fucking chocolate for her when she said she is hungry. When we talked about sex, she said that something is sex for enjoyment and something is sex that she is obligated to have because that's normal. Oh, and once I meantioned rape. Her reply was ""I don't want to talk about it"". I started crying. I'm mad on people who did this to her. She doesn't need much to be happiest person ever. I have tears in my eyes writing this. 

She is so deply in that, that she still thinks that she will have better future with him than me.

I first got in contact in march, saying I am free to work from june to september while I'm home. 
I was given a tour around and then told I've got the job and to see them in June. 
June rolls around and I've heard nothing, so I send them an email and ask what's going on. They say I need an interview for formalities so we arrange one for that week. Pass the interview fine and they tell me my details have been passed onto recruitment and I'll be able to start immediately after they've processed my details. 
Two weeks later I get an email from recruitment asking if I can pop in and fill out some forms (forms I'd already filled out in march) and show ID. They also ask for 4 references which I've struggled to get due to 2 of my previous workplaces don't exist in the form I worked in (they were concessions within a department store that doesn't exist anymore)  and them only wanting company emails (so now I'm feeling guilty as if they're trying to tell me I'm making my previously jobs up! They won't accept my old managers contact details.) 
So now it's July and I contacted them last week asking what is going on. They want me to fill out a form that I've already filled out and they're still waiting on a reply from my references- two have replied and they likely won't get replies from the other two I've said. And then I get told that even if this happens I won't be able to start until 22nd July because of something happening in the company. 

Anyway the point of this post is to ask- is it even worth it anymore? 
The main point of me wanting this job is to earn money for university, yet I've already lost two months of work probably about £2000.

She dropped a massive bombshell telling me how she slept with somebody else just a week after we broke up. I was absolutely heartbroken and gutted aswell as angry and decided from there that I never wanted to get back with her and that it was probably right we split up.

I just got my first job recently, which is slowly letting me build up a savings, but mom and I have a mounting problem on our hands.

&amp;#x200B;

Although it's always been just the two of us, we've never really gotten along. She's always been very bitter, and tends to push people away when their relationship doesn't involve money. She's been working as a babysitter for the last 9 years, and is damn good at it, but there are two problems with the job. The first is, of course, that it doesn't pay much. The second is that the company she is on call for (as in, they give her jobs at hotels etc when parents need babysitters) charges a massive commission, about 1/3 of the pay she normally gets. We could live just fine without that commission.

&amp;#x200B;

We haven't been able to pay this commission for a couple months now, and we owe the company a couple thousand dollars. We also budget our collective money very carefully, and are only just barely able to afford our rents, utilities, insurance, food and gas, leaving nothing for emergencies, taxes, or entertainment.  


We both live in an expensive state in the USA, and I need to stay here for college, but is there a cheap way to move her out-of-state to a less expensive place to live? Due to personal reasons, I am not willing to move back in with her.

412," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",08Jul2019,0

414,"Hello there, I'll get right in to it. It's 1 hour until noon. My grandmother and I are in the living room, we returned home from the grocery store an hour ago and she's just had a snack. We're in pretty high moods, having had a productive morning, having our dinner already ready for later. I know we're going to have a free afternoon and as I'm leaving her this Wednesday (to see my other grandparents for a bit before going back home to my mum for the semester) I'm trying to think of things she could need help with. I know a new toilet brush is needed so I very gently and politely (because I did expect this response, I don't even know why) ask her whether she'd like to go get it (together so she could pick whichever one she wants) later in the afternoon. It's a bus ride and she's pretty introverted/ tiered so I'm thinking it might be good to get it out of the way while I'm still here. The response I get is pretty heated. It's in a different language to English plus I don't remember exact wording but the tone is pretty antagonistic/ raised. At that point I can feel my adrenaline pumping (I'm very sensitive to tone, gets me right in fight/ flight mode), I know this is the point where I usually fuck up (aka get defensive and possibly even raise my tone too) so I go cold, say she doesn't need to shout (though gently, and I'm pretty proud of that given my history and emotion at the moment) and leave the room to ponder my mistakes somewhere else.

This kind of thing happens often. 

Basically I don't understand whether I'm doing something wrong here. Obviously I feel like I'm being attacked, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the situation, it's happened before. 

If I am not however, and if indeed I'm not unknowingly doing something against my gran, I was wondering whether anyone knows of ways to deal with this kind of unfounded (methinks) irritation the most productive way? Aka without burning bridges.

I could just not answer and let it slide, I know that would lead to her leaving it alone and we'd probably go right back to what we were doing before... but ignoring it doesn't feel right. I know that if I'm doing something wrong and even if I may be reluctant/ embarrassed initially, at the end of the day I DO want to know I'm doing something wrong. Not to forget, it doesn't feel fair, and if I was to stifle / keep stifling this, I fear my growing resentment would evolve into something stronger.
I keep doing this and it's not proving fruitful.
On the other hand, since I'm so scared of being shouted at, maybe I should expose myself to it , so I become desensitized? 

Another way is speak out completely truthfully, say I'm not going to accept this treatment. Not being rewarded for your efforts is one thing, but being punished for them and by a person who you already feel not respect but love sympathy/ love for, I don't accept that. I'd rather not be here, work my summer, spend time with my brothers, date around, be with other side of the family... Somewhere else.
I have never tried this approach. I don't think it would go down well, I think it would leave our relationship a wreckage. I wouldn't be surprised if she wanted me fine for good and I do feel responsibility for her, in addition to the sympathy/ attachment, however weakened it may be currently getting.

Third way I can see, do what I do. Not address the root, her apparently growing resentment of me and my growing resentment of her, and just address a branch if the problem, her shouting/ antagonistic tone/ loosing her temper. Address it, quickly and politely, and walk away (if I didn't I don't have confidence I'd be able to NOT go into alternative 2 territory, especially since she wouldn't take what I say without answering, probably with an ad hominem attack).
This has these advantages : that I'd be able to say something of what I think/ feel. I'd be able to keep my dignity. I wouldn't loose my temper and make the situation dramatic.
I'd be able to go be by myself and calm down a little bit.
 Disadvantages : ( apart from the obvious, thatmaybe this ""branch"" that I find offensive / unfai from her, maybe it's not a big deal and I should get over it) she would think that I'm sulking whereever I go, that I'm expecting an apology or whatever. If she wouldn't think it, she would definitely say I am. I know 20 minutes later she'd go wherever I am and say something like : do you want dinner or are you going to keep sulking? She'd say it in a pretty mean/ cold way thus shoving me right back into my freaked out fighting/ flighting self. Not to forget it just makes it look like a petulant git.

Obviously she has other issues, depressed (grandad died 2 years ago and she's still not over it), lonely... also possibly slowly getting dementia, since she's forgetting many things, putting words in my mouth and quickly forgetting things she's just said. Her childhood wasn't easy, she's easily defensive plus I feel we both have narcissistic qualities. I don't think I can solve these for her, I don't live here for one, I'm too emotionally stupid two and three, sometimes there's just not getting through to her.

I too have my problems, I'm too sensitive OBVIOUSLY. Even if her action wouldn't be objectively okay, neither is my reaction ( At this point my hands were shaking so much I had to put my tea down, not to mention id probably start stuttering if I talked too much) . I also have problems with gratitude it seems, since I should be happy I'm getting a dinner. That I  have a grandmother. That I have great memories here.
Another problem is the already mentioned resentment. I don't know if it's growing, I don't think there is more of it than before, but it's there, and with it a temper to lose.

If anyone's reading still, first of all, you must be really bored, second of all, am I doing something wrong, apart from the obvious over dramatisation? Is my grandmother really doing anything wrong? Is there something that I could do that I'm missing out on? Maybe you think option 3 isn't the one I should be going with, instead with 1 or 2? In short, can you give me any advice?",08Jul2019,1

Now her and her boyfriend are buying a smaller house with a much bigger property, and she told me there wouldn’t be enough room for my girlfriend and I to live in the new place. So it looks like it’s time for me to move out.



I’m a college student, I currently work two jobs, and my girlfriend would be moving in with me (also a full time student).
We figure that an apartment would be our best bet, but neither of us have gotten our own place before.



So what’s the best way to go about searching? I just googled “apartments for rent near me”, and the top post was Zillow. Is that the best way to go about this?



I have about 4 months to move out, how much money do you think I should have saved before getting a place?



Both of us being full time students, we’re obviously concerned about price. Do you have any advice on how to make moving out more affordable?



How do I make sure I’m not taken advantage of when it comes to signing a contract?

421,"Hey,

Can’t believe I’m posting this. I‘m a 21 year old student who lives with her parents in my home town. I was heavily bullied in school so I only have one friend from that time. We kinda grew apart though. I know many people from Uni who I talk to often but they’re really busy and go to their home towns during semester breaks. Somehow we don’t get to meet often, they like me a lot but live far away and I wouldn’t know what we could do in our free time. It feels as if I don’t have much in common with them. Which is probably wrong, I just never really got to know them. I have another group of friends who I only see to drink. I drink daily at home because of my loneliness (it’s wrong, I know, I’m trying to change). Tbh I think they’re a group I should avoid if I ever want to stop. 

I used to be very shy, shaking at the checkout. This has improved a lot but I still don’t have many social skills. I don’t think I have anything interesting to say that would benefit others. I don’t know how to make friends in my home town. It’s a bit inconvenient if all your friends (from uni) live two hours away, study and work part time. I‘m really desperate for advice so please share it with me. I can’t bear this loneliness anymore.

She kept adding us, more specifically him and stalking/harassing him over social media, through his phone etc etc threatening him and just being crazy and all. Sent fake pictures of her in blood or “dying” have her friends and family talk to him or use fake accounts and numbers all that shit to make his life hell. 

We told him to change his social media and set everything to private, that worked for a while. Told him to change numbers but he said that’s too much of a hassle. That girl has got to the point where she’ll even text my BF’s mom to see how the friend is doing so what are some legal things we can do? 

Told friend of ours to collect evidence and such. It’s been half a year and that psycho is still going at him, she would be nice then be super mean and shitty to hurt him enough that he gets anxieties and stuff.

Friend found out and warned the first dude, so that dude ditched her. Now she’s with the other.

429,"Hello everyone, I'm having a bit of a problem and I need some help.

For some context: I met this guy (19) at church back in June, we'll call him spider, he's pretty nice and seems very respectful.

Now here's my problem: I'm a 16 year old girl, never had a relationship before, never really had any crushes on people before too. However me and spider had gotten along a lot over this past month, just with little different things, our family's are super alike and we seem to have a lot in common judging by our conversations.

This past 4th of July however, seem to make my family and neighbors think that he likes me, he drove out of his way to see the fireworks with me. I disagreed and told them that he had some other friends there (we did say hi to one) and so he had a reason to come. He also invited me over to his place to watch the bohemian rhapsody movie because I had never seen it before, we talk everyday and now they really do think he likes me.

Now this past sunday we found out he has a son, I was surprised at first because with everything I know so far he was the last person I expected to have a son, it didn't bother me much though because my own mom was a teen mom. This baby is like young, I wanna say anywhere from 7 months to 1 years old, I guess they tried to fight for the baby but the mother wasn't allowing it and so they didn't win the court case(?) I told my sister last night and she said that was a BIG red flag, and said to not catch feelings and I told her that our relationship isn't like that. But I can't lie, I do think I have a tiny crush on him, but after finding everything out, I don't know what to do. A 16yr old and 19yr old are different, and now he might have a past relationship he's still connected to, if he wants to be in that baby's life that's fine, it's none of my business. I do think he's a little old for me, if I was an adult it would be different but I turned 16 this past January, he turned 19 this past June, and figured maybe I should wait.

But now everything is way more complicated, I don't mind being just friends, this is just very new to me and I appreciate everybody who's willing to help. Thank you.",08Jul2019,2

444,"Context: I am a 24 y/o female who already has a BA in psychology.

So yesterday, my dad starts asking me when I will go to grad school and what I will do with the rest of my life. This was right after I got done telling him that my buddy and I are looking for publishers for the book of short stories we put together. I thought I made it clear that I wanted to try to pursue writing, it’s been a passion of mine since high school, but he seems to be under the impression that it’s just a hobby. He’s not the only one asking though. Everyone in my family is subtlety pushing for me to go to grad school so that I can at least get a masters.

There are a few more reasons why I don’t want to go to grad school. One, I can’t afford to go and I don’t want to get into debt. I got lucky with undergrad since my stepdad worked at a university so I basically got out without any debt (thank god). Two, I didn’t even want to go to college in the first place. While I am grateful I got a free ride, I really wish I waited a few years before going to college since I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life back then. I knew I wanted to write but I would have never heard the end of it if I had gotten an English degree; psychology was the compromise (my mom wanted me to be a scientist). Three, I don’t want to continue studying psychology. I was interested enough to study psychology for school and at one point I wanted to be a doctor. But the more I learned about what the job would require and what I would be dealing with on a daily basis, the more I realized it wasn’t for me. By the time I graduated, I knew I was likely never getting a job in my field (which I wouldn’t have gotten anyways due to lack of experience and my degree was basically worthless). Four, I would only be going to please everyone at this point. I already have the college degree they wanted me to have. Why do they want more from me? Isn’t college enough for them?

Right now I just want a decent day job to keep me afloat while I work on my writing projects for publishing. I don’t mind at all that I will only be making $13 an hour for a few years, I want to work on my passion so that one day I can live off of it. How to I tell everyone that I don’t want to go back to school without completely pissing them off?",08Jul2019,3
445,"I'm 19y/o, male, 183cm tall, skinny. I'm an engineering college freshman and I just moved into the city.

I'm really skinny and unfit. I never played any serious sport in my life, but I really, really want to play a sport BADLY, especially a team sport. It's my dream to play in teams competitively, not as a career, since I'm an engineering student, but at least as a hobby.

But here's the problem... hockey teams and basketball teams say that I'm too old to begin.., but they are both sports I like.

I can practice at home or join junior teams until I can become good enough for teams of my age, do I do that?

&amp;#x200B;

My goals are to:

1. Have a strong and good-looking body
2. Play a team sport (if not possible, even a 1man sport is fine...)
3. Enjoy the cheers of a large audience (popular sports)
4. Enjoy the social respect that success in a sport can bring (also easier in the more popular sports?)
5. Have fun by playing a sport I love
6. Become good at it in the next 5 years.
7. Play it as a hobby, not TOO serious. Invest no more than 2h a day.

&amp;#x200B;

Does my desire to play it as a hobby and play in a team conflict each other? Can i play in a team while keeping my academic studies in the main focus?

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm starting to think that I will have to compromise. Maybe I can't accomplish all those points?

Sports I like( and know of): Hockey, baseball, basketball, judo..

I dont like soccer.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried judo and baseball, the weekly training sessions don't overlap. But I can't really commit to both at the same time, so I start skipping judo classes. i think I need to commit 100% to one.. What do you think?

I love baseball so much, but it is very, very unpopular in my country. There are maybe 3 small teams in my country, I am in one of them for a month. The training is fine, but I feel like the effort won't be appreciated by anyone, so it's not really pushing me to train my body or become better at it.

Judo is harder, the coach is great. I can see myself going somwehere within 1-2 years, but its a 1man sport.. There is no camaraderie and I'm always in that small, gloomy gym. I can do it, but if there's a chance for team sports, i'd choose them.

&amp;#x200B;

My first choice is baseball, it's most fun but unpopular.

Second choice is basketball. It's super popular, ergo super compettive, so its a bit freightening and ppl say I'm too old.

Finally judo, some say im even old for judo, but fuck them.

I was just after advice on how to feel comfortable coming home since I come home always feeling more stressed then when I’m at work or at University.

So a little bit of context, My Mum left state a few months ago with my younger Brother and Sister a few months and made a lot of accusations against my Dad that are obviously false, the way the court is preceding it is growing more evident that soon my 11 Year Old Brother and my 7 year old Sister will be coming home soon and my Mum won’t be coming with them leaving it up to me (20m), my sister who is 22 and my Dad to raise them.

I am very excited and nervous to have them home obviously, I miss them like crazy as it’s been months apart and I’ve dreamed of seeing them again and especially since we have been denied contact but a part of me wonders how I can cope with that level of responsibility.

I am the main cleaner of the house, since my Mum left a few months ago in February I have been the one to Vacuum, Clean the Bathrooms, do the laundry etc in fact id say I do nearly most of it besides dishes which is shared between me and my sister I have also been the one to take control of all bills I do try to pay some of them secretly but nearly all  of the time my Dad pays them, I just mostly manage them. These responsibilities are something I have never done before until February this year so a lot of it is a learning process for me.

I just recently started University again, and coming home is always so stressful as I always feel like there is something I should be cleaning or doing around the house rather then studying and soon with two young siblings added I’ll suddenly have to provide for them as well as working and learning a brand new job and balancing University and believe me I want to do it a part of me worries that I won’t be able to cope and not be able to provide the best life for them, it’s gonna be challenging and them growing up without a Mum as well they’ll need a lot of emotional support which I’m excited to provide but nervous.

457,"Hey everyone this is my first post on reddit and on r/advice so here is my long story (TL:DR at the end)...

&amp;#x200B;

i'm an 18 year old male currently finishing my last year of high school so its kinda been rough these past few months as i'll be sitting the HSC in September this year. It's currently the school holidays but not really as we have to prepare for the trial exams coming up next month. But i already feel as if i have lost my spark. 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the HSC, stress has been a main factor to everything, often compounding on every ""bad"" thing that happens or occurs around me leading me down the path of depression. This doesn't help with parents who have high expectations and me also being not the very academically smart person i should be. I would give anything to be studious enough to receive the marks my parents want and to succeed in every possible aspect of life but i am tired with this just constant studying even though i barely study at all as indicated by my recent physics exam (where i managed to receive an abysmal score of 20%).  

&amp;#x200B;

This was obviously my fault as this was the first time i have ever received a mark as low as this even though i hate physics (i am forced to do it and i can't drop it without affecting my HSC) but usually i score at least above 50%. I'm not going to lie but after this i just went home and cried as i just couldn't do it anymore as i felt everything just added up and i couldn't carry this weight anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

As always every issue has an origin and in my opinion i think this stemmed from my parents being too over bearing i.e not allowing me to socialise with friends and getting my drivers license, i just want some freedom like every kid my age...don't get me wrong i have friends its just my parents control every aspect of my life leaving me feeling out of control and not putting effort into everything i do as i just have no motivation...essentially i am just a puppet acting out my parents wishes...albeit very poorly. I am also very socially awkward which also doesn't help.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to occupy myself with hobbies such as working on my dad's cool project cars, designing/constructing electrical gadgets, fixing random things and reverse engineering things when i'm bored. But these few months i lost all motivation and just feel alone as not any of my close friends have similar hobbies. I honestly feel out of place everywhere i go and i don't know what to do. I honestly can't believe i got through 5 years of high school without feeling the way i'm feeling now...no wonder people say that i've changed i wish i could be the same person i was a few years ago not caring what others think and just generally enjoying life. i feel as if i lost that part of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok i know this sounds stupid, lame or whatever but I came to this realisation after i fell in love with a girl i have known for awhile but she played hard to get and honestly left me feeling worse than ever before as i felt like i had nothing redeemable about me like qualities that someone would desire... And before everyone says ""girls aren't everything"" well i honestly just wanted some sort of relationship with a girl as i rarely interact with girls and it would be awesome to share feelings and just talk without feeling disconnected. This also stems from the fact that i have no support systems and no one to talk to about the way i feel.

&amp;#x200B;

I often hear other people parents who are more approachable as in they treat their kids as friends and interact with them as adults such as teaching them lessons about life and whatever other thing parents say to their kids. Don't get me wrong my parents love me and are there for me no matter what its just that they don't approach me asking ""how's your day"" or ""how was school"" and just generally don't ask me or help me with what teenagers go through and just keep me in the dark with all my bottled up emotions. As a result adding to the feeling of being alone.

&amp;#x200B;

So if anyone has any ideas and advice on what to do as i honestly don't know, it would be much appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!!! :)

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR

I feel lost and alone in my journey as an 18 year old teenager/adult as i have no freedom with overbearing parents (who just want the best for me resulting in high expectations) resulting in my social awkwardness and just generally being a mess mentally and emotionally as i have no one to share or talk about my feelings with. Resulting in me feeling depressed as i feel as if i have lost my self.",08Jul2019,1
458,"I hate airports, they trigger my anxiety like nothing else, but airport security is the worst. Last year i flew for the first time in 5 years, and i got searched randomly and i had a panic attack while she was searching me and my bag. It was the most awful experience i’ve ever had, the whole time i had to try my hardest to keep myself together and not show it too much, although i know it was very noticeable. I literally stood there physically shaking while she searched me.  

What am i scared of? I am scared that the guards will notice how nervous i am and think i have heroin up my ass or something, i mean why would i be nervous? That must look very suspicious. And i am scared of the panic attack / intense anxiety feelings itself because i can’t handle them and i don’t know how it will effect me this time. If i start going trough the security, i can’t just walk away, i have to stay and go trough with it.  

When this happened last year, i was in a much better place in my life and right now i am struggling a lot more with my anxiety, and i am going to fly to Greece tomorrow with my mom (we are going on a mother daughter trip) and i am freaking out right now. I don’t have any medication or anything i could take. I am thinking about having a drink before that, which i know is a really bad thing to do, but i would never do that in any other situation because i know how bad that can get, and i don’t see any other choice here. I would just have one drink, which won’t take away the anxiety but it will probably stop me from having a panic attack and make me feel calmer. We have Whisky at home and i’ve talked to my mom and she thinks it is okey for me to have a drink in a situation like this, however my dad is not supportive of the idea.

459,"Long rant is long, but basically I need a bit of advice on how to shut my mother up about med school.

So, a little back story first.

When I was in high school, I was determined to be a doctor. Reaalllllyyyy wanted it. I'm smart, but not quite that smart, so  I couldn't get into med school straight out of high school. Instead, I did another degree first, did honours year, got the grades to apply. I had an agreement with my parents that I'd give it two gos, then give up, because applying to med school is hella expensive.

First time round, no luck. Second time round, got to interviews. Never told anyone the outcome of the interview, but my silence led everyone to believe I hadn't gotten in.

Thing is, I did. But by that stage I'd been working as a nurse for two years, and saw what doctors went through, and decided 'Hell no!'. I wasn't gonna put myself through all that. So I dropped it, found another career path I was much happy with, started doing my Masters.

But the other night my mom and I both got a little tipsy and the subject of med school came up, and she was ranting about how unfair it was that I didn't get in and blaming it on rich immigrants and regional students (who get 'bonus points') and to shut her up, I let it slip that I'd been accepted, but turned it down.

Initially, she was upset with me for not telling her. I told her that the reason I'd never told anyone was that I didn't want to go through all the questions and disappointed relatives when I said I'd turned it down (and face my father, who paid for all the test/prep/etc) and explained to her why that was no longer my dream. She seemed ok, and agreed not to tell anyone unless it came up (Such as ""Oh, didn't essence-of-insanity want to be a doctor?"").

About an hour ago, she came into my room, sat down next to me, and said ""I'm going to start telling the family you turned down med school. You've got a lot of really smart cousins and you need to hold your own against them.""

What.

The.

Eff.

Seriously, she can't see anything wrong with that statement. Because being a full-time shift worker whilst also studying a Masters full time isn't impressive enough, she thinks that turning down med school is the pinnacle of my career. I pointed this out to her, and she just stormed out and stopped speaking to me, but I know the matter's not done. She's also made it very clear that she is not, in fact, ok with me not going.

471,"My mom has a history of being abusive towards me, both physically and mentally. She uses manipulation to try to make me feel sorry for her after she has either physically attacked me, or abused me verbally. 

Last night she dumped a crapload of chores on me. I have a history of depressive waves, where I just lie down and wish I didn’t exist.  When I’m in one, I don’t want to move, at all. When she was out of the room, I punched my pillow. Somehow she heard it, ran into my room and slapped me in the face while I was still lying down. I went to get up but she grabbed my face and tried to hold my head down. I pushed her off, she grabbed my phone and says that it is because of my phone that I act like this. She stormed out. I spent the night crying. 

In the middle of the night she came in acting all nice, while at the same time saying how it was all my fault and that she deserved an apology. I told her that, no, if anyone deserved an apology it was me. She asked me why I was being so aggressive, I said that she was the one being agresssive, and pointed out the fact that she had literally attacked me. She said that she ‘only did it because I tried to hit her’. Bullshit, I was lying down and holding my phone. When I pointed that out, she said that she was trying to grab my phone. Again, bullshit, she only tried to grab my phone after she attacked me. She also went on to say that I “Insulted” her by by punching the pillow, I said that done that once she was out of the room. She said that she was still in the room. Again, bullshit, I remember hearing her running from across the house and slamming the door open. She then wrote all this off by saying that “I was trying to rewrite reality”. 

I am literally fuming with rage right now, as this once woman threatened to drop me off at my drug addict father’s house because I lied about having broken a plate when I was 7 years old. I’m 16, I won’t have to stay in the house for much longer, so I don’t want to get the authorities involved. What do I do about her, how do I stop her from getting to me?",08Jul2019,2
472,"Most of the advices given here are total bullshit and unrealistic.

If a girl post that she is molested, then you guys be like

&gt;Call the police
#you guys really think that this didn't came into her mind? You know what she's asking for? She's not asking for any kind of revenge. She just want to know the ways she can overcome that thing. Because this impacted her brain much more than her body.

&gt; Ok fine. Talk to someone then. Or get a therapy.
# really? Like it's natural to talk about problems. If she had someone to which she can share this, she would have done this before posting. And therapy? Really? I know it helps but not in the way you think. Therapy helps you to FORGET about that incident. Not make you overcome that. And if suddenly the flashbacks of that incident comes, she'll be stressed again. To overcome this incident, she needs to make more friends and be alert next time. I commented that make some new friends. Be alert next time. And don't trust people right away. What you guys did? Downvoted. Like your fucking advices are very fucking good! Your advices doesn't apply irl. If you want to test then ask those who've posted on this sub and actually got therapy and unrealistic shut you said. Hardly 5% of people do this. What you guys are doing is just giving her temporary solutions. You need to teach that girl about life. Not about how to forget that incident. That way she'll avoid such further incidents. I wrote a long comment explaining step-by-step process to overcome this thought like first go out. Then talk with strangers like in a mart or at stores. Read local news. Make some friends. Go out with them. But don't trust them easily on everything they say. 


What happens when someone says that he don't like their parents and stuff

&gt; Leave alone. Get yourself a job. 
# the shit you said? You think that a guy, who were staying at home , depressed , will suddenly become a charming boy, with a good earning, and will have someone to talks to, will make best friends in just a couple of days? You living in real world or what? I commented on such post that try to avoid your parents. That's the best way you can live a happy life. Don't argue. Just accept the fault, even if it's not yours. What will happen? They will forgive you. Don't make this an ego issue. Nobody will get to know that you've accepted your fault. And btw they've taken care of your since you were born. This is the least you can do. But don't avoid too much. If they ask you. Be polite and reply with a meaningful message. Just avoid meaningless convos that can take wrong turns.

What ya guys did? Downvoted! Like your advice were easy to implement in real life without great efforts.

473,"I am a female\[25F\] and I have been sharing my flat with a lady\[30F\] for the past one and a half years. This lady is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen and since I am a lesbian I was naturally attracted to her. Towards the beginning of our friendship, I have often found myself on the verge of asking her for a kiss on the mouth, but I was able to restrain myself at the last moment. All day long, I would dream of her well toned physique, her flawless face and her sweet smell.

Gradually, I started repressing these feelings by working more than usual. I was scared that I would end up causing her some discomfort which would ruin our friendship forever. Things went along quite smoothly. In fact, her presence around me impacted me in a positive way. I excelled at work and earned a promotion too.

My roommate played squash in her college days and has the physique of an athlete. She is atleast five inches taller and thirty pounds heavier than me. She habitually mocked me for being ""skinny"" and physically weak. I brushed of these jibes quite sportingly until yesterday.

I had had a difficult day at work yesterday and her taunts got to me. She boasted about how she expected to defeat me easily in a wrestling match. I felt so humiliated that I offered her a bet that she wouldn't. She replied that she was ready to bet me ""anything"".

Surprisingly, I won the wrestling game and my friend was positively exhausted at the end of it. She admitted defeat but I was intent on claiming my bet. All the physical contact with her might have excited me because I went on to give her a few oil-checks and bottom slaps as soon as she was lying on her stomach. She pleaded with me to let her go but I went on give her one more of those disgusting anal probes before eventually releasing her. She remarked that she would think twice before challenging me in the future. **I am ashamed of the way I have behaved.** It is true that I did not take of her clothes, but I understand that my actions might be considered sexual harassment or even rape. I apologised to her several times but she merely lauughed it off.She complained of bit of soreness in her bottom. I offered to take her to the doctor and confess immediately but she felt that was unnecessary.

I know I have behaved like an animal. My roommate might suffer from lifelong trauma. The worst bit is that she hasn't moved out yet. Should I report myself to the police? I am distraught.",08Jul2019,1

I have a question that I hope is just fairly simple. I am a freelance artist that posts under the name Pancode and pancodemakes. About 90% of my art is signed under that username as well. I discovered today that there is another artist under the name Pancode, who is an EDM producer with an established following and is recognizable in their genre. I would hate to step on their brand and confuse their fans, but at the same time, I have been known as Pancode also for some time now and even people at my University know me as Pancode, as that is the username I've used since 2015 for LoL and for my art. Should I change my username from Pancode to something else as to respect the music artist? Or should I keep mine?

Let's call my wife Sarah. I've been with Sarah for about 15 years. I'm 30 and she's 30. Super fucking long time, right? We've been dating for an eternity but only recently got married about five years ago. We have no kids but we plan on having some in about a year. Well...she wants to have them, I'm not into the idea at all. I tell her I'm just worried because maybe i won't be a good father, but truth is i don't want to be with her anymore, or have kids, or go to family events, or plan days off together, or envision a future where I'm changing diapers or going to school events or saving money for a family road trip or...anything. I don't want it. I really really don't.

I had these thoughts for years. Before i thought i was just afraid of getting older and acting ""adult"", but now i know i just don't want to follow some script and be tied down to something. 

One thing i do want to say is my wife as a person is awesome though. She's funny, kind, super sweet, and basically an ideal image of what a loving supporting wife should be. None of this has anything to do with her, she didn't do anything wrong. It's all me. She's great but i just... Can't play the part she wants me to play, i guess.

The thing that kills me is we are already 30. If i break it off she'd have to start over at 30. And she has zero idea of how i really feel so this would hit her like a ton of bricks.

I feel like for any other guy, being with Sarah would be like hitting the jackpot. I keep telling myself I'm stupid and why throw away the best thing that ever happened to me, but the train just keeps moving faster and faster.

I had planned to get out of the military in May of 2020. My problem is getting a job on the outside that won't hurt me worse. 

Before speaking with my surgeon recently, I had plans to persue a career in high voltage as a power lineman. My surgeon is strongly recommending against this, saying my elbow will only get worse and I will most likely have a ""bum"" elbow by my late 30's or 40's. He is suggesting no lifting over 15-20 pounds on a permanent basis. 

I guess my question is, now that my plans have literally shattered in front of me, what jobs should I look at persuing? I like to do things with my hands. I also would really like a job that would allow for good feelings of accomplishment at the end of the day. Obviously pay would also be a factor, because some day when I have kids I want them to grow up better than I did. I am hoping that money won't be a problem.

481,"This is going to be a long one, sorry in advance.


I grew up in a home where abuse was something I saw and went through daily. My father would hit me and my mom and call us names, after 16 years of marriage (I was then 12) my mom left the house as my father's abuse towards her was getting to a life threatening situation (throwing very heavy stuff at her, coming into my bedroom and wanting to slit her throat whilst my mom was sleeping next to me,..).

The judge, I still don't understand why, gave my father custody of us (me 12/ brothers, 14 and 8) for a year. A year long we barely had food, clothes, electricity, water,... he didn't let me go to school sometimes and would beat me up when I couldn't make dinner. He smashed my head against a concrete wall multiple times because 'I was a whore just like my mom'. It was an awful year.

I never spoke to anyone about it and after that horror year, I acted out on school, when I hit age 16 I stopped being a little bitch and started to act normal.
My grades were good, I had good friends, a great relationship with my mom and had to see my father once every two weekends (judge decided).

In my last year of high school, I had a teacher who hated me from the bottom of her heart and failed me (based on my internships, which she couldn't but she's the teacher) so I quit school.

From ages 18 to 23 I'd developped and was deep into an eating disorder, leaving me skin and bones.
I was going an adult school to get my diploma but I got so weak that I had to drop out, I got a job I hated after but also had to quit and then.. nothing.

So I thought 'I'm 23 now and think I'm over the eating disorder' but no, it turned on me. And how.

I started eating sooo much and got overweight, ashamed of it I stopped going out and lost friends.

I didn't leave the house for 2 years, litterly.

2018 was over and my new years resolution was to get my shit together, I was excited and nerveous.

I started having pains in my middle but I was too ashamed to go to ly doctor because he hadn't seen me for years and 'I got fat now so I won't go'.

I cried and didn't sleep more than 2 hrs in those 3 days full of pain, I started throwing up and couldn't move, I felt like something inside of me was going to burst, I thought I was dying.
Eventually, on the evening of the 3th day, I went to the ER but they didn't find what's wrong.
They told me they'd give my results to a gyno professor so that should've been a clue but wasn't at the time.

I got a call the next day to tell me I have a tumor and emergency surgery is needed, so I went and was scared but I couldn't even cry because my mom was crying her eyes out and I had to be strong for her.

It waw benign, rare and they don't know if it'd come back but I have to go in 'when you're in a lot of pain again'.

I got out of the hospital, said I'm going to stop eating like shit, go out more and find a job.

I stopped eating a lot of crap, I still enjoyed all foods but I dropped 15kg (still have 10 to go but no worries).
Got out more and actually was happy.
Got a job 3months later (couldn't get one earlier because of the stitches) but had to quit 2 months later because it was too heavy and caused pain on my wounds.

Since I've quit I feel so lost, I apply to many many many jobs daily yet no one gets back to me.
I am sooo bored and sick of the television, I'm tired aml the time and don't know what to do.

Since saturday I've been eating a lot of crap too, which makes me feel bloated and like a piece of shit.

I feel like I'm slipping away into my old bad habits again and I don't know what to do.
I don't want to become so miserable again, I just want a job and purpose in life and just enjoy it.

What can I do? I'm desperate for any advice.",08Jul2019,0
482,"Hey, so, a little bit of backstory first (English isnt my first language so bear with me)

I'm a french dude, 3 Years ago I got accepted in this new private video game school that teach both Game design and Game art, made friends along the way, yadda yadda

&amp;#x200B;

Soon during the first year, me and my new friends noticed one of the ""most talented"" girl in our promotion was using other artist's work as her own (tracing her own stuff on it and all) and of course she was getting good grades, good reviews on her homework froom the art teacher, etc

Started to piss us off a lot, next to ""her"" wor, our art wasn't as good, we were still learning. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of year 1, we decided to go tell our Art Teacher that she was obviously ""cheating"", and he calmly told us that he knew but didnt wanted to make her sad. The FUCK? 

Again, this is supposed to be a formation to help us becoming good artists to start working in the game industry.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, go year 2, she's doing her shit again, we keep on looking for the originals and slowly build up a folder full of ""her art"" and  the original work. 

The school was having its second anniversary, and the director started doing ""Open house day"" (Idk how to translate that) to show our work to people (potential futur employer and all). On the wall, a LOT of her traced work was being used to promote the school, and how fast we were learning.

We decided to go see the director with the folder full of evidence, and he got instantly mad. 

Not at her, but at us, for exposing her. Apparently he knew all along too. Nothing changed.

&amp;#x200B;

Year 3 is a bit weird, we have a personnal project to do (video game, book, etc) along side a 6 months internship. 

She found an internship pretty quick, working with a cool concept artist who worked with some famous game companies. 

We're currently at the end of our third year, and we just learn that she's being hired to work with the artist's team. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is some example of her ""work"" along side the original art.

[https://imgur.com/a/LSqcMjd](https://imgur.com/a/LSqcMjd)

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to talk about this to someone, either the original artists, or her new boss. But I'm afraid they will just accept it. She'll probably get her degree with excellent reviews and everything.

Is that normal? Is the reaction of both my teacher and director normal? Is that something that a lot of artist in the industry do?? I'm so confused",08Jul2019,25
483,"I’ll try to touch on just the important details here but I need to crowd source advice on what to do. 

One of my best friends is getting married this upcoming weekend and I’m standing in the wedding. They have been together for 5 years. Every single person that knows them thinks the wedding is a mistake because they don’t get along. I live across the country so we don’t hang out together, bc of this I haven’t seen their issues first hand so I’ve stayed out of it. 

At the bachelor party a few weeks ago he let it slip that he’s been dating another girl for over a year and that he thinks he loves her. This was news for all of us and is the first time I’ve voiced my concern for the wedding and said he has to get out now. 

He said he was going to make it right but has done nothing. He claims he’s broken it off with the girl friend but we’re all 99% sure that isn’t true. He also claims that he came clean to his fiancé but when he told me about it he said he told her “he had been talking to another girl but that’s over now”. Omitting the part where he said he’s in love with her and told the girlfriend that he already called off the wedding. 

The other day I told him I won’t stand up or attend the wedding. That I loved him but he’s making a huge a mistake and that this is what I would expect him to do if I was making a huge life changing mistake. 

Yesterday he asked me to reconsider, saying he doesn’t know how we could stay friends if I don’t come. Saying “what am I going to tell -name omitted- when you don’t show up?”.  

At this point I don’t want to lose one of my best friends. But I don’t trust that he’s told her the truth and I feel like he now wants me there to cover up his lie.

 When we met she had a 6 month old daughter, I stepped up and did my best to be a step dad . I did very well actually better than I ever though I would Because she favored me over her mom some times and it was just crazy to me how attached to me she was I loved being a dad it was great. 

  We  have been broken up now for 1 full month, we have been on and off in the past and this is a record for me I don't want to go back to her she will ruin my happiness I finally have , All we will do is argue about who she hooked up with during the break up and its just not healthy I'm better this way but her ""dad"" text me(I know her dad doesn't text long ass stuff and these text where long so there just no way it was him)  stating that his daughter has finally calmed down and agrees to let me see her daughter again and that she misses me and has been saying how bad she wants to see her dad and how I'm shit for not taking 10 mins out of my day to call her.

Anyway. Last Saturday night my boyfriend and my friends and I got drunk and decided to go out, to the bar I work at. I was way drunker than I realized. Everything was fine until my best friend told me she needed to use the bathroom, and I took her in through the employee entrance to use the employee bathroom. A manager saw me and told me I needed to leave, now, so I did. 


Apparently this upset drunk me and I started to think I was going to get fired. My boyfriend and I got into a huge fight and are still together, but I can tell he’s hurt. I’ve already apologized obviously. 


In addition to possibly losing my job, I had a wicked hangover and am still feeling depressed today, and a little nauseous.

498,"I am on summer break from uni and it’s 6 AM I’ve been at the hospital for a couple hours now. My dad and mom were fighting and in defense, my dad pushed my mom off him and she fell and hit her head. I deescalated the situation as much as I can. This isn’t the first time they’ve had a fight but it’s definitely the first time she’s ever gotten hurt physically. My dad says he’s been protecting her from selling herself because she has no other source of income (she got fired from her job). The last time she called the cops on him she was hysterical. I don’t know who to believe because my mom has a history of mental illness: depression, bi-polar disorder, and just recently since 2016 a very hardcore gambling addiction. She constantly lies about things and I believe my dad because he tells the truth but I could never ever let him lay a hand on her ever again. We’ve tried having my mom go to rehab but they treated her like a dog, we found another one but it costs way more than we can afford because of the hole in our life’s savings. I don’t know what to do or where to go. My mom’s side of the family basically alienated her, and I really don’t want to involve my dad’s side. I love and care for both of them, I don’t know what to do. My dad is just trying to hold my family together, he has kept us afloat all this time. My mom just keeps going to the casino for hours on end especially now that she doesn’t have a job. I don’t know how to stop her, she tells me she wants to stop then goes back anyway. This isn’t the first time I’ve dealt with someone plagued by addiction but everyone’s story and mind are different. I don’t know what to do anymore. I was going to take her to a motel but she went back on her word of never wanting to come back and says she’s okay with sleeping in the guest room. I don’t know how to deal with this anymore. It’s just been a really long last 3 years. . . 

We were just released from the hospital it was just a tiny laceration on her head they said she will be fine. It’s now 7 AM, and I took her back to the house. She’s sleeping, but I am concerned she may have a concussion so I am going to check in every couple of hours. My dad let her use his insurance because she doesn’t have insurance. He said if he goes to jail he goes to jail— I cannot let him go to jail he is the only one keeping us afloat. Like I said this isn’t the first time my mom has called the cops on him and lying to the cops making him out to be a very dangerous man I watched as they entered our old house guns drawn to pull him out of the house but all he was doing was sleeping. I know my mom isn’t in the right but my dad had no right to push her he could have stopped her from attacking him without having to push her to the ground. Right? I don’t know anymore. My dad is sleeping because he has work in the morning. I had my little brother watch our dad and ask him the story of what happened because I woke up to the commotion. Their stories seem to match up until they walk through the door at 3-4ish AM when theyre screaming and fighting about how she sold her phone and wedding ring to gamble. She was very close to selling herself just to play. Her addiction is bad and I don’t know how to help. I need advice on what to do for my mom’s addiction, my parents marriage (even though its not my place I know this relationship isn’t healthy), my financial situation (I don’t know how I’m going to pay for college anymore FAFSA knows how much my parents make but they dont know that my mom got fired and my dad has been struggling to pay off the debts she racked up; compared to other kids at my school I am not worthy of a scholarship.)

499,"Okay so, a bit of backstory. I recently separated and divorced my now ex-husband after several years of emotional/sexual abuse. Needless to say, I've got a lot of baggage. I'm currently living with my mom and stepdad to try and get better, but despite medication, my mental health is taking a backslide and the doctor and my psychiatrist are both struggling to find new ways to help me. They've both suggested that I get a service dog. My mom was okay with the idea if it helped me, but my stepdad was not. Here's where the backstory comes in.

&amp;#x200B;

He loves dogs. Almost more than people. But several years ago, he had a little dog who got cancer and he was doing everything he could, shelling out thousands of dollars to try and keep him alive, and it didn't work. He was shattered, and swore he'd never get another dog because of how much it hurt. I don't blame him one bit, and I don't want his mental health affected because I need a service dog.

&amp;#x200B;

However, mine is backsliding badly. I've been told I more than qualify for one, but my stepdad doesn't seem to understand my need for one. He's so set on ""No dogs"" he can't see past it. Is there any way that I can explain to him that this dog wouldn't be so much a pet, but a way to help me with my trauma? It'd be with me 24/7 and not just roaming around the house wanting to be played with or petted. Not to say I won't love the dog and treat it like my own child, but I'm not sure how to go about this and I don't want to cause any tension with my stepdad. I love him as much as my bio dad and I just want us all to be happy without compromising anything. Any advice? Should I just give up the idea of a service dog? Should I talk with him about it more and try to explain? How would I do that? Help, please!",08Jul2019,2
500,"I’ve always wanted to have a dog but for the longest time my parents refused it because they thought I wasn’t responsible enough. Lately they accepted as long as I signed all the papers being his legal owner and took care of him (walks, food, education, etc.)

They gave me a list of demands to comply to. It has to be a male, young, small &amp; have short hair. I started looking for possibilities in adoption websites and found a couple of options. I reached out to some owners to see if they were still available 

While I was doing that, my dad noticed that I was choosing dogs with undefined breed. He said I couldn’t have those dogs because I wouldn’t know their temperament / need for activity. We live in an apartment so that was important because we can’t have a garden for him to run around and be happy.

The problem is that with all these demands it’s impossible to get a dog through adoption. There’s very few dogs with a select breed and most of them aren’t small sized. And from the small sized dogs they’re mostly adults which my parents also don’t want.

I really don’t want to give money to someone who’s just breeding purebred dogs without a care when there’s so many good dogs out there that need a home. But I also can’t deny my family’s requests and I do see that they just don’t want to get stuck with a dog that brings them problems since truly I’m the one who wants him

Is there another solution for getting a dog? Would it be wrong of me to buy a dog that has a manageable breed or should I just not get any dog at all?

508,"First time posting. I (48F) semi/professionally worked with victims of childhood (sexual) abuse and it felt so odd to me that I recognized so much feelings and behavioral patterns that led back to that trauma, whilst not having a recollection.

I have had several monogamous relationships in my adult life, and it led to being used and betrayed. Always same type, wearing a different pair of pants. I learned it had to with my n/father. My mother escaped into death two decades ago.

Approaching 40 I chose to be in a relationship with a childhood friend, a slightly autistic man, who is not sexual and who I felt at ease with. I admit it was an escape from the dynamics I usually got into.

Quickly a son was born, who is now 6y old, and the relationship with his father ended when the boy was 2. Having a baby it became too difficult to cater to the specific wishes of an autistic man, and it became clear to me that again I had picked a dynamic in which I was invisible. Besides (this is important in the story) the sex was awful, it felt as if he just took it. He basically masturbated with my body there.

Recently a woman told me that the way she was touched as a child , a hug, a cuddle, it was never for \_her\_. It felt as if something was \*taken\* form her, never given to her. It immediately triggered all the same feelings again. It dawned on me that this is what it must have been like for me too. Not sexual abuse, but this.

Since then I notice that when the father of my child hugs and cuddles our son, it is also from this 'taking a hug' perspective. Very recently (yesterday) I realized what my son is going through is similar to my childhood. It is not \_sexual\_ abuse, but it isn't right, it feels off.

Obviously my ex hasn't any clue about what he is doing. Reading other people's feelings is hard for him, and as crazy as it may sound, he still is a kind man. But that doesn't mean that this behavior isn't hurtful. I don't want to be touched by him. But he still touches (hugs, cuddles) our son. All in front of me, it is not sexual. But it is 'taking' affection. Not giving. Does anyone have any clue what I am talking about? This is all recent discovery for me.

I am in the midst of starting up therapy again. I closed it a while ago but will proceed with professional help. What I am looking for is validation, perhaps recognition. I have carefully talked about friends with this, and on other subreddits , but I feel my story doesn't count or something. People keep telling me that he is not doing anything wrong. At the same time I feel that this very weird, nondescript, behavior has ruined so much in my life.

And now my son's childhood is happening. Which makes a solution extremely needed.

Can you shed a light on this perhaps. Re-direct me to reading material? Youtube link? Anything.",08Jul2019,1
509,"I'm a pretty nasty guy. I'm harsh on people, and I tend towards backbiting, even if only in my head. I tend to resent doing favors for people, even when I volunteered to do it. My temper can be short when handling someone making a mistake. This has always been a thing with me, and I largely didn't give a fuck, because it only stressed relationships with strangers, and I could just charm them. But lately my personal relationships have been suffering, as people I care about are tired of dealing with my shit and I don't feel as though I should have to schmooze them. (Stupid, I know.)

On the other hand, I do have some traits I value, like being aggressive and cynical/skeptical. I have good instincts in pressure situations and a generally cool head regarding situations - I only flare up interpersonally. I see these characteristics  as being linked to the ones I don't like, which is why I'm making this post. 

I can think of very few kind people in my life. The ones I can think of seem false at best and stupid at worst, and when the people who are close to me act this way (praise me, etc.) I just see it as, ""What do they need from me?"" 

I've seen some examples in fiction of characters that seemed like wholesome, lovable types who were patient with people and optimistic about things, without being naive or hapless for it. That's what I want. I'd like to keep the traits I think will keep me successful, and replace the traits that are straining me and make me walk around with a resting bitch face.

511,"Hey, so...i don't want to sound like a crazy person or anything, or be one of those girls who accuses her boyfriend of cheating at the drop of a hat, but i do think he is. With my mom.

Here's what happened. A few weeks ago, i was visiting her for her birthday. I had him drive me since my car was in the shop. I introduced him and they talked for a bit, just introductory stuff. She asked about his grades, his job, family, you know. The car ride back home, he seemed so preoccupied. He barely spoke a word to me, he asked a few questions about mom. He seemed particularly interested in asking where my dad was and the divorce. But, other then that, nothing.

Now, my mom is recently divorced and single. She is pretty, but i really hope she wouldn't be doing this. And my bf, he's kind of a horn dog. He's always groping me and trying to get me in bed, like, every hour of the day. . Over time, since then, he's had less interest in our intimate time together. He's spent a lot of time on his phone. He won't let me see what he's doing or anything.

There was a couple times, we'd be driving and he'd mention ""Hey, since we're in town, wanna drop by your mom's?"". For no reason.

This morning, he finally got his hair cut. (He's had, kind of, long hair. But, after a few weeks of pushing him, i got him to cut it into a more respectable style. For his upcoming job interview). We were in the area and decided to visit her again. She seemed happy to see us. We talked for a long time, at least over an hour. One thing she said was about his haircut, she just pointed it out and it looks different, i explained it to her and she said ""Oh, well you look very handsome that way"".

When we left, i had to beg him to leave. I kept trying to remind him about somewhere we had to be that afternoon. But he got annoyed ""I'm in the middle of a conversation. Stop being pushy."". And we walked out the door, mom told him ""Oh, she's always been pushy,"" then nshe told an embarrassing story from when i was a kid.

Now, the last crucial piece of evidence that set this whole thing in motion. I had already went and got in his car. But i noticed he didn't follow me. I looked back and he's hugging her. That's not all, his hands were kind of low. Like, on her lower back. It got me to thinking and it made feel start to worry that he's cheating on me with her.

But i just don't have that high of a libido. I hope he's not doing this too me.

But, i don't want to sound like a crazy person and accuse him right off the bat. I mean, they seem awfully chummy. Am i justified for thinking this? Or am i just being overprotective?

526,"I worked in Produce for a grocery store. I ended up talking with the produce manager and scanning coordinator (\*who was helping us re-write that week's schedule\*) and we were talking about how I liked Produce. While it wasn't very mentally challenging, it was extremely physically challenging. I am not that strong, and while I could *do* it, it was very strenuous and causing me to dislike my job. I told my manager, ""I can't do the work that you expect me to do. I can lift the 50 lb bags of potatoes and onions, but it takes me longer than you. I'm afraid that I won't be in the shape that I need to be in to be a good worker in this department. I'm very replaceable in this fact, you deserve a worker who can do this better, and they're readily out there."" So my manager was like, ""Alright, well this will probably be your last schedule in Produce then. I only control that, and I can't say whether or not you can go into another department. If we don't have an opening, then you'll probably just have to leave &lt;store name&gt;."" I was alright with that and stated such. 

&amp;#x200B;

The day after, I was also working. My manager was not, and the Cashier manager came to me near the end of my shift and this was our conversation. (\*Important\*)

&amp;#x200B;

""So the lifting was too much for you?""

""No, but I suppose I'm just not used to lifting in general that much. Those potatoes and onions are quite heavy.""

""Well, by the way, every department has lifting. It's the same everywhere. Even Cashiers have to lift beer and water cases.""

*I nodded, and didn't want to tell her that lifting gigantic bags of potatoes and onions were the only thing I had a problem with, so beer and water were nothing compared to that, because she was the manager and knew what was best for me.*

""Maybe grocery just isn't for you?""

""Perhaps not, I did like the cleaning aspect of here a lot.""

""Well, there are tons of custodial jobs around here. You could easily find one of those.""

""Alright. That makes sense.""

""Would you mind signing a letter then, saying that you're fine with voluntarily resigning from your job after your 30 days is up?""

""Sure.""

However, an hour into my shift, the produce manager was talking to me.

&amp;#x200B;

""So why didn't you want to be a cashier?""

""What?""

""Well, we offered you the position and you said no.""

""I was never offered the position to say no to.""

""Didn't &lt;Cashier Manager&gt; offer it to you?""

""No.""

""Alright, hold on a second.""

I called back, and said that I would take the job. The store manager told me that the cashier manager would call me and tell me my schedule when they know it.

1) Was she having a bad day?

2) Did she want someone else to fill the Cashier spot?

3) Does she not like me?

4) Did the store manager confirm my story, and Dawn is going to call me in a way of the store manager saying, ""We know what you did?""

529,"Im just going to cut to the chase. Im a terrible human. Im abusive towards my brother who is one year younger, both physically and mentally. Ive been trying to stop the physical abuse and its been working but the other one isn’t at its best. As soon as i became three years old my mother dumped me to stay with my father. He wasn’t best at parenting. He was abusive here and there but mostly mentally. Im currently 13-16 years old. Ive tried committing suicide plentiful of times. Mostly just with pills. My mother and her new husband (recently) was going to buy a gorgeous farm house and told me i could have pet goats. Though when we were at the dinner table i was a bit in the blues. Though my step dad just made fun of me and so did my mother saying things like “aw your depressed because your goatless” “cut with the fucking act” and such. My mother verbally abuses me and when i talk back she slaps me. Am i the problem for this? My dad usually does the same. I tried living with a older cousin but one of her kids got angry on how i could be wasting their money so I decided to just come back to my fathers. I don’t know what to do next nor do i really care but i just want help honestly. I’m currently on anti-depressants but my mother continues mocking me and telling me that im just using it for attention. I tried finding comfort by staying at my sisters house here and there but when i do she usually just leaves me for her friends or significant other. After i tried killing myself and wanted to see her my mom called her on her phone (we were in the car and my mother has a bluetooth thing so everyone can hear what the person on the phone says) my mom explained to her on what was happening and mentioned that i wanted to see her if thats ok. Though my sister had other plans she just wanted to wait for her boyfriend till he got off of work to spend time together so i just left it at that. This is the point of my shit of a life. I cant feel love for anyone or anything nor sympathy, so many loved ones have just died out of no where and i dont even know what to do anymore. I told my mother about my suicidal thoughts and other feelings but she just laughed at me and mentioned that i was a joke. At this point i cant give a shit anymore.

Background info: I come from a Chinese family. I don't know if its because I'm Asian, but as far I can tell this doesn't happen to any of my Caucasian friends but similar things happen to my Asian friends. I'm 14 btw

Recently my parents have gotten into a controlling state. Just 10 minutes ago, my father was digging through my wallet and my bag and found my 250 dollar worth of savings I plan to use as money to buy a pair of Klipsch T5. I was able to say its my own savings as he's been asking me for my savings recently. Luckily I have an excuse in hand. Tomorrow, I have an outdoor cooking class and I put my utensils in a zip-lock bag. I find that pretty fine as most of my classmates do the same. No. My father insists on using a plastic bag. I'm currently undergoing a audio and gaming phase. I've spent nearly a hundred on gaming perephials like mice and mousepads. While that's OK for hardcore gamers, the previous time I asked for a gaming mouse he told me that I can use a regular mouse to play, which I did but I want to upgrade my quality of playing. I think that's pretty common. Many 14 yo boys play games, right? On to the audio. I'm the span of 1 year, I've bought, sold and traded over 300 dollars worth of consumer audio headsets, like your Sony Bluetooth or Samsung galaxy buds etc thanks to a trading/buy-and-sell platform in my country. And now I'm looking into Klipsch T5, which I've saved more than 250 bucks for it. Issue is, I've been putting 6 months of savings into that fund, and my father just found it after going through my wallet. Its not like I can buy anything with the money now. At any point he can just ask for my savings cuz he knows where its all kept.

Maybe it's cuz my father comes from a poor family. He doesn't believe in indulgences and keeps everything to the bare minimal as much as he can. My mom is pretty chill. She understands about indulgences but it feels like my life is in a cage here. It feels like my parents are trying to dictate my life and any move I take could trigger a bomb. I've come clean about some of my habits before. There was one time where I told them I was buying figurines, but my father sold them all to his colleagues. I just want to live my own life, be responsible for the money he gives me weekly. Is there anything wrong? I know what my parents reaction will be. They will say its redundant, they will ask if my friends have this or that, and they will want my money, and say if I want anything I should ask them. But they won't allow me. Happened to me way too many times already.

TL;DR my parents especially my dad has been quite controlling lately and he knows my stash of money to buy earphones. At any point he can just ask me to hand the money over and if I've spent it, I can't think of the explosive consequences. Idk how to face this, help",08Jul2019,1

I recently got into a relationship with this lovely girl, weve been dating for nearly a month, its my first girlfriend (Im 20M) and Ive experienced people cheating around me a couple times, the closest being my uncle, and a friend.

But yesterday he slept at her house but I know theres nothing there for me to be jealous about but my mind likes to imagine things there arent there, and I get jealous.

I told her about me being jealous about him and I fully trust her but she keeps saying that I dont trust her. And its not that I dont, its that I get like anxious and its the worst feeling

540,"This is not advice for myself, but for a friend I met online.

&amp;#x200B;

It was just a few hours ago when I met this friend. He was trying to scam me on Skype by using a fake identity, but it was obvious and I saw through all of it. I thought he was that typical Indian microsoft support scammer so I trolled him by trying to waste his time, but after the hostilities settled down, we became honest with each other and it is revealed that he in reality lives in Nigeria, which I had never thought of, and he does not like his job as a scammer, and is seeking a more legitimate job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried asking him if there are other legitimate or better jobs she can look out for in his hometown , but it seems that   
 according to him the government in Nigeria is not doing too much of a good job providing jobs for its citizens. IIRC he has a mother who is suffering from a gastric ulcer, and he has no choice but to work as a scammer in order to pay for his mother's medical bills. He also told me that his family has considered sending him out of the country to work overseas, and with sufficient income he can bring the rest of his family with him.

&amp;#x200B;

He has told me that he has a  friend working at a restaurant in Japan who recommended him to work there, but according to my own knowledge Japan does not really have a welcoming immigration policy compared to other countries, and it is very possible that he may face discrimination there, so I helping him look for options in the EU, which should have a more welcoming immigration policy, and should be a better option than Japan considering the costs of transportation and convenience.

&amp;#x200B;

He has prior work experience, but only as a manager in a gaming network , which involves ""playing games for customers and paying customers who won their tickets"" . 

&amp;#x200B;

My knowledge on immigration policy in the EU is limited as I do not live there. I am seeking advice on these matters:

Which country in the EU has a welcoming immigration package?

What jobs can a Nigerian citizen look for in the EU without prior work experience?

Which country in the EU is more welcoming and accepting of Nigerian immigrants?

Via what means of transportation is affordable to travel to the EU from Nigeria?

How difficult is it for Nigerian citizens to immigrate to the EU or apply for a work visa?

In case my friend wants to settle down in the EU, how difficult is it to bring his family to live with him in the EU?

Are there any subsidies that local governments can provide for Nigerian citizens with work visas to pay for medical bills of their family overseas?",08Jul2019,3

550,"I, 27M, work 40 hours per week as a software developer at a great company (great benefits, good work life balance, good for my career, etc.). I have a wife, 26, who is a stay-at-home mom with our son, 3, and baby daughter (3 months). My wife loves being a stay-at-home mom. Life is good for all of us right now. 

I had 4 weeks of paid paternity leave (I split it between now and 3 months ago when my daughter was born), plus I’m taking some vacation. So I’ve been spending time with my family the past couple of weeks. It has been challenging at times but also extremely fun, very rewarding, very valuable to me. I love hanging out with my family.

So it made me think - is there any way I can spend *more* time with my family and *less* time working? I know it sounds ridiculous and millennial and complaining. I’m not trying to complain, our life is really good. It just made me think how nice it would be if I could spend more time with family and less time working. I’d like to hear any strategies people have used to attain this goal. Some ideas we’ve had:

* my wife and I each work part-time jobs. This would likely be difficult, we probably couldn’t make as much income as I do now. Plus we likely wouldn’t get benefits. 
* my wife works while I try stay-at-home dadding. My wife would consider this, but this doesn’t solve the problem at hand, it really just transitions it to my wife. Plus, most importantly, my wife likes being a stay-at-home mom, so I don’t want to take that away from her.
* get a full-remote job. This doesn’t solve the problem for me either because I can’t really multitask. If I’m working at home, I would need a separate office to focus, which then defeats the purpose. 

Anyone else feel the same? And/or does anyone have some interesting strategies / life hacks to get closer with family and spend less time working? I would also consider minimalizing our lifestyle in order to accommodate this lifestyle (e.g., to live with less income), but overall I still need benefits (e.g., health insurance) and save for retirement.

Early in the relationship he always chat with a girl while we are on a date and refuse to show me their chat. I know I abuse his privacy by looking at their chat but what I found really broke my heart until now. There was a period when he was sick and I took care of him (buy his medicine, clean him, feed him) and he chat the girl "" I want you beside me"". Later I confronted him about it and he said that ""I feel like I was caught cheating"". He said he will cut their relationship but he neveelr blocked her and always replied to her message even tough it is just platonic replies. I eventually blocked her from his account.

And, he often lies to me and the reason is he is afraid I am sad of angry if I know the truth. I already told him that I rather be angry once when I know the truth and appreciate his honesty than being lied to. But he still often lied to me. I caught him more than a couple times lying to me. And now I feel I can't differentiate wether he is lying or telling the truth. And my brain sometimes automatically think he is lying to me.

Then I feel like I always want him to do what exactly what I want and I snapped and get angry at him or being passive agressive everytime he doesnr do what I want. For example,he always drive his motorcycle too fast (and sometimes I perceived it as not save) and we actually get into an accident because of that and I suffer more injury than him.

There are several reasons and incidences that lead me to believe my mother in law either doesn’t really like me or wants to change me in some sort of way. Here are a few examples of her interactions with me: 

-she’s come over several times unannounced (we live in a beautiful apartment that’s actually her basement. Don’t judge) 
-she has sent over food for SO because he looks like he doesn’t eat (her words. Not mine). 
- when she comes over she greets my dog. Only asks about my dog over the phone when talking to SO. then asks about me afterwards. 
-told me i need to sweep my entry way. I ignored her. She then raised her voice and said “DO YOU HEAR ME?” Like I’m a 12 yo. I’m 30. 
-She makes comments about my ripped jeans. Asks me why I’m going to work like that 
- she thought that me wearing Bermuda shorts to work meant that guys would gawk at me and SO wouldn’t be there to save me. 
- keeps saying “you don’t like me” whenever she can throw it in the convo. 
- doesn’t like that i don’t come to visit her often (she’s literally upstairs). 
- told SO that he needs more muscles ...Like me -__- 
- told SO that all the food he eats is going to me. (I’m gaining weight and had a complex about it but now i feel pretty good about my weight gain). 
- doesn’t like my tattoos 
-is very passive aggressive

Eventually the RCMP were called and they discovered the remains and removed them. 
The owner still claims that it was leakage from the tenants freezer and not remains, even though the RCMP gave confirmed it is human

I got and fixed up an old used bike on wednesday and stored it next to our door from the back entrance. It wasnt locked since the bike still had some issues and i thought of buying a lock after i got back. Went out of town on friday and came back sunday evening to find my bike gone. None of my roommates had realised what had happened since they mostly use the front door.

Problem is, my roommates bike (which he keeps outside) is also gone. Contacted the landlord to see if he knows anything, but told us he knows nothing and advises us to talk to the people living downstairs and ""depending on how they respond, contact the police"".

I wouldn't normally jump to conclusions, especially if it was only the bike outside, but the one inside is missing too and basically only the ones living here access the back door. They had guests around friday midnight and were out back hanging out before I left in the morning.

I'm not sure how I should approach the people living downstairs and how I should start the conversation. I doubt they would confess or make an attempt to do something, but it's worth trying at least.

565,"A year ago, a friend of mine wanted to organize a trip out of town.  I'll call him Chuck.  Chuck booked the hotel almost a year in advance with a discount rate.  Because it was a discounted rate, it is not possible to cancel.  At the time, he booked three rooms as he thought six of us were going.  A few months ago, one of our friends needed to back out for a personal reason.  No problem.  We still needed three rooms because one of my friends going, ""Andrea"", wanted her own room.  (She's the only girl.)  In fact, she started seeing a guy since the booking and asked if he could join us.  No problem.

We are leaving this Wednesday.  Today I was contacted by Andrea who said she does not think she'll be able to go.

I can understand that something came up, but now we have a problem: A hotel room that cannot be cancelled.

It would be unfair to the four of us who are still going to need to pay more for the rooms.  It would seem fair to me that if Andrea was cancelling at the last minute, she would still need to pay for the extra room.  The issue, though, is that she is the type of person who would say she doesn't owe for something she didn't use.

This is complicated by the fact that it would really screw up the math on what was owed for the room.  Since she was going to have her own room, she would need to pay double what everyone else did.  That's about $400.  Her boyfriend is unlikely to pay for anything either, as he was never even part of the plan in the first place.  It isn't fair to Chuck to need to pay extra when he was told the room would be used.  I also don't want Andrea to be resentful about having to pay $400.

I really don't want this to become a rift between my friends.  I need some advice about what to do.

571,"Okay. So I’m 21. I have babysat a child for like 3 years now. He’s 4. His biological mom lost custody of him. His biological “ex best friend” has had permanent guardianship of him since he was 1. The thing is his adopted mom is no Bette than his biological mom. I keep him most days. He’s with me more than with his mom. I provide everything for him and don’t get paid for it. Which I don’t mind but it’s not cheap raising a child. I still live with family but I have a full time job. I would move out but thought it’d be better to save up a little bit then move out when I’m comfortable. I just love this child and he is out there so much. I want to fight for custody of him and adopt him. Since his mom didn’t adopt him and just has permanent guardianship, I would think it’d be easier.

572,"I (F17) work a summer job at my high school. My coworker (M17) has been constantly mocking me and making comments (none of which are sexual, but just kinda mean/annoying)

Here’s some of the things he’s done:
1. He mocked my simple suggestion, that would have made the job a whole lot easier
-Then he called me sassy when I responded sarcastically, “I’ve missed you, [his name]”

2. Almost anytime I say something, he says “did I ask??” or “I didn’t ask but okay??”
I remarked that I never knew about a room in the school and he said “yeah, I didn’t ask but okay”

3. He spent 10 minutes trying to argue with me that my favorite nut isn’t a walnut

4. He gives me shit for not taking the elevator down one floor
-It’s much slower to wait for the elevator and take it down than just walking down the stairs

5. He came into the room I was cleaning and said “surprised to see you working”
-The kicker is that he had been basically doing nothing the whole time I was working

6. We get a lunch break at 11:30 until 12:00. Since it was Friday, I stayed an 20 extra minutes. My coworker did not start working until 1:20, which means he took an almost two hour break 

7.  He wrote me little notes that said “I hate being forced to talk to you when my phone battery is low”, “You annoy me” and then he had the audacity to write another note that said “can I borrow your phone charger”

8. To top it off, more than once he has taken his dirty, water-filled rag and whipped it at me so I was covered in icky hydrogen-peroxide water. 

I apologize for this being so long, but the things he has done is endless....
I’m not sure how to respond to all of this. I’ve tried ignoring him, but he’s relentless and this all has been going on for a few weeks now. 

Should I tell my boss? I’m afraid that if I get my coworker in trouble, he’ll just be even more rude to me and I don’t want that.",08Jul2019,1
574,"I am male and three years ago,I had to do a school change - i wanted to try a new start into school. I had problems getting people closer and being friends with them (I am a person who likes to talk about anything they have on their mind - Sarcastic aswell) and last year they tormented me. They were constantly trying to make fun of me as much as possible,and yet they literally dont understand any boundaries,even if it involves finally being at a breaking point.

This year was a pain,but i finally managed to get friends in my class and so much changed,yet so much just also stayed. Boys from my class are making less fun of me,yet because the new school year arises they start hitting me hard again - making fun of me until i finally defend myself - yet they still go on. Probably because everybody knows that because the school year is about to end,they slowly cant be warned by teachers and so on. The ""bullying"" is starting again and i SO want to desperately am trying to not let that happen - Ive already learned too much in my life over doing xyz having xyz consequences. Ive already suffered enough - This shit is what changed me so much. I was no longer happy and always optimistic. These douchebags literally tried everything in their disposal to ruin me because I was an ""outsider"". 

We held a small competition in the class under the boys - everyone of the boys was allowed to join in a competitive game - the person with the most points in the end wins in the game. This was hosted in the school library,we were allowed to do what we wanted to do in that hour (however playing computer games in our school is banned,yet so many still try to do it) so i decided to join in. If theres something i love doing, then its playing competitive computer games. I had played the game before a lot that we were playing in that small competition. I was *destroying* everyone with very little deaths and insane amounts of kills. However,almost 2 minutes after game start,the guy who liked to annoy me the most decided to ban me from the entire competition. I couldnt join with an alternate account,it was a school account ban from the host.

Keep in mind,that because i played it for SO long,i was really GOOD at it. I knew so much more compared to all of them.

The reason for the ban?

Cheating.

I got so fed up,i went straight to the guy with almost no face distance and said as loud as possible ""You are a pathetic loser who cant deal with anything in your life - I hope you literally *get bullied to death in your new school next year""*. I was completely done and went home.

I dont know what to do. The year is about to end,and one of us is changing class to another class in the school,and two of us are going to a lower level of the school system (Someone and the guy,the guy was on really good but he intentionally - hes going to a school with less stress and less graduation) and two of us are changing language meaning they get shoved into another class-theres only 3 boys left,me,A friend of mine and a neutral person.

I feel like literally just throwing him off a ledge or something - Im trying hard to calm down,yet at the same time,the amount of toxicity these guys have is insane.

&amp;#x200B;

Should i wait until they are gone and just hope for better students or just do something else while possible? Summer break starts in a few weeks.

Im very sorry if im breaking any type of harassment rule - but i just dont know anymore.

Please give me advice.",08Jul2019,1

576,".  I was a laboratory scientist working in pharmaceuticals for  two years after college ( this was  16 years ago).  My sister passed away and I adopted and raised her two children  and decided to have three biological children.  I was busy raising the children ,coaching sports, leading Girl Scout Troops  , all while working one or two small contract jobs a year ( about ten jobs total over 14 years).  For example, one time I worked for an off broadway show with 50 actors for  six months , another year I worked for a start up tech firm for four months testing their equipment and getting them financial backers  , and yet another time I helped build a science team for a public school .  It’s all been contract work and I’ve had No long term gigs or stable employment as the children were my main focus for over a decade. .  .  All of our children are either in college or high school as of this year .   My husband makes enough money to live on ; but I want to have an interesting career for myself!!.   In general how would you handle a resume with such a weird work history at my age ? Strong interpersonal skills, precise communication ,  and organizational skills are my forte.  If you are a hiring manager how do I explain this professionally to someone?  What skills would you want to see in today’s work force from someone with such a spotty / weird work history.   I “ could” go back to school to work on a graduate degree but I think right now I need real world experience in my field.  Lastly, Do I flat out say in an interview I was home raising five children ?   
    I’m super healthy and fit   I could easily work another 40  years happily.   I’m mainly interested in biological science work either in the field , or in Human Resources  ( I love working with people ).    .  I want to spend the next forty years focusing on work that is important to me , with a focus on biodiversity conservancy and/ or environmental conservancy in Northeast Ohio  .   If you have gone back to work after raising a family could you please tell me your story or any advice at all; even if it’s completely outside the box! Thank you so much !",08Jul2019,2
577,"I'm going to be 22 soon, with little to no direction. Right now working as data entry in Hungary for low wage that I can't really save. Standing before going to collage, which my Mom (since father left us) wants, but not me. 

As I have seen, read and have thought, I do not really see the worth of a paper which wastes like 3-4 years of my time and getting into huge debt. 
Plus Hungarian education is very low quality.
Of course, I will leave this country as I can't see my future here.

As far as I know, the valuable thing about collage ONLY the connections I could get. I am bit introverted, so I see it less likely for myself to go to collage. 

If I could, I would do some courses(which doesn't takes too much of a time) which gives me valuable skill/s but wouldn't want it to take more than 2 years, it could be courses, trade school or smh like that. I need possibilities or any paths to take. 

That's why I'm here, asking for advice.

Little bit about circumstances;

Family (immediate and father's side of family) is narcissistic and toxic, so there is the additional motivation for me to get away.
Father left us(with all the money, even sold the house), therefore no one will help me, so I must get out this myself. 

I think as I'm and y'all too, have been just drifting with the waves of circumstances and doing what others told you. Go to this school go there, bla bla bla. This scheme has been going on since the early/mid 20th century. Go to school, go to collage, get a job, get married, get a family, grow old, and die. 

This is not life. You are not happy! This is a scheme for the government to stay in power and let the mass, the little man, stay on a conveyor belt, in a modern slavery.
A rat race. If you go in, it's very hard to come out. I always reminded of this: Make a choice which you will NOT regret. We make choices everyday, it may be consciously or unconsciously, we make a choice.  I am too, stand before a choice, as you do.
As I have decided and actually writing this post and not playing is a choice. 
You getting drunk is a choice. 
You not exercising is a choice.
Spending time with friends or family is a choice.
Holing yourself up in your room is a choice.
Getting a side hustle and getting financially independent or closer to it is a choice.

Life is too short, only to be unhappy and later regret 
Life is the consequences of your choices made today. It could lead you anywhere. 
You might be love doing something but if you can't get financially independent and free, it might not bring you the happiness you need. 
I know I don't care about power, I want to be happy and free. To be free, you need money as a tool to do what you want. 

Right now I stand where I know what I don't want to do or be. Like I know I don't want to be holed up in an office and be miserable, hoping for the work shift to end and just get rest.
This is how you get old. By not enjoying life and wait for the clock to move. Living paycheck to paycheck, working for someone else's dream, while You (or me) staying a cog which could be replaced anytime.

I have read and thought a lot about financial independence, and the way for to be living like that you need to have passive income. An income which does not require your presence or time(that much). Such as business, stocks even Real Estate(basically investing). 
So MONEY works for YOU, and not YOU working for MONEY.
Your most valuable thing you have is time. So don't waste it.

Right now I was thinking to exchange my time for money but also not to do work which would make me miserable(such as office work and coding, as I have been in front of computer my whole life) and later invest it.

About myself a some things;

My social skill is alright, but I don't really like to put up that fake smile and that facade, plus had some bad share of people for me to not like people in general, (also been betrayed couple of times). I also know that sales skill is very important today, so I could work on that.

579,"Possible TMI in here, sorry. I’m an 19 year old female and my boyfriend is an 19 year old male. He is my first relationship and I love him very much. He was my first everything and I have always been able to see a future with him. Recently some behavior he has begun to show is making me very uncomfortable. I want to talk to him about it but I also know that he doesn’t handle confrontation well. I’ll start with the sexist part. He started out just being kinda pushy about sexual things. Anytime he wanted sex he would basically just tell me that we are going to have sex and if I wasn’t in the mood he would keep bothering me about it. If I got firm about it and just said no then he would either tell me to stop being such a prude and tell me that I need to just say yes more often or give me the silent treatment for hours. If I wanted sex and he wasn’t in the mood he’d make a big deal about it and tell me I want it too much or call me a “horny bastard” even if all I did was mention that I was in the mood. Recently he’s decided that he wants to try new things in bed. I’m fine with this and we told each other what we each wanted to try. If one didn’t want to do something we agreed not to be too pushy about it. He basically ignored everything I wanted to try. He then started telling my he wants to try anal. I’m generally a pretty open minded person but this is something that I don’t want at all and I told him this. He keeps pushing it on me and when I tell him I’m uncomfortable with it he gets mad and tells me that I need to be more open minded to what he wants. He even started making jokes that he’s just gonna do it anyway. I said yes to everything else he wanted to try except that and he was still mad. I tried to make a point by saying he wouldn’t want butt stuff done to him so why should I want it either. He freaked out and went on and on about how that’s gay and he would never even consider it. I then said “See how uncomfortable it makes you? That’s how uncomfortable it makes me. I do not want to do it so why should I have to?” He looked me right in the eye and said “Because you have your roll in this relationship.” I got pissed and he just kept repeating that it’s different because apparently my roll as the woman is to do that even if I don’t want to.  There have been other comments he’s made that came across pretty sexist too but this post is already long and I have more to talk about. Now onto the racism. For context, we are both mixed. I am half white, half Mexican and he is half white, half black. He makes racist “jokes” all the time but none of them are funny and all of them sound like something your weird conservative uncle would post on Facebook. Most of his jokes are directed at Asians but the only race he seems to not joke about is white people. He makes dog eating jokes about Asians, terrorist jokes about Muslims, he make illegal immigrant jokes about Latinos (including me), and he often refers to black people by using the n word with the hard r. I was shocked when he started doing all that because he had never done any of that in the beginning of our relationship. I tried to confront him about it all and he just said I was overreacting. Recently a lot of his “jokes” have been directed at me and the fact that I’m half Mexican. I’ve always identified as a Latina and felt that that was what fit me best considering how mixed Latinos can be. Nobody has ever really questioned that when they look at me but he thinks that I’m too light skinned to call myself a Latina. He’s always making jokes about me just being a white girl and that I’m not Mexican enough. I can’t change my skin tone and my skin tone doesn’t change the fact that half of my family is from Mexico. He even went as far as to tell me to “Stop acting so Mexican” and “You’re not Mexican enough to be speaking Spanish” that pissed me off and he couldn’t understand why. I pointed out that if someone told him that he wasn’t enough of one of his halves he would be upset. He told me it’s different and that I sound like a “typical Mexican” by saying that. I’m so confused because he only recently started acting like this. We’ve been so happy for so long and all of this new behavior caught me off guard. I fell in love with a guy who was kind, loving, and supportive to me. He has been my boyfriend and my best friend rolled up into one person for our entire relationship and now it sounds like a stranger talking through him sometimes. There was no warning signs that he’s be like this, it just started out of the blue. I still love him and I just want him so stop acting like this and be himself again. I’m scared that if I leave him I’ll be all alone. I have no friends and don’t have a good relationship with my family. He also has abandonment issues and I know if I ended the relationship his mental health could suffer. Please someone help I don’t know what to do.",08Jul2019,0

581," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'eh that lads just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she stared at me and quickly grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in this night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her wiping the table , she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit. The blonde walked towards me to  say bye on her way out smiling and the brunette was out before her holding her head a bit looking tipsy but the blonde seemed fine .

582,"I need advice because I dont know it am handling the situation well or making it worse. So my MIL is mentally ill (bi-polar schizophrenic) and I am very understanding that she is actually a wonderful person but her illness causes her to act and say rude or crazy things. I have known my fiance since we were children so I have known her for a long time and we have always gotten along well.
She goes through episodes that last for weeks and usually lead up to some dramatic event and then she is hopisitlized forced to take her medication and then she is back to her normal happy self for awhile. Once when my fiance and I lived with her she went through an episode and fixated on me and my behavior for weeks. She was suspicious of me all the time for absolutely no reason and this lead to her trying to attack me calling me a whore accusing me of cheating etc. I was 18. Luckily my fiance was there to keep her away from me and we moved out immediately. He knows she is ill and that is hard for me and I know it is hard for him as well especially since he grew up with her and her alone (no father, no siblings) long story short we decided it was best for us to move far away and we did we moved to Washingtion. She never apologized for this btw. 

Well of course she is still in his life and its been about 2 years since this happened and she is in town this week. She is very Manic and making me on edge with her rude behavior (thank the LORD she's not staying with us). I am not rude however I simply dodge her calls. I NEVER answer unless I am with my fiance and he can pick it up. I do not hang out with her alone although she asks. I feel like she is catching onto the fact that I don't want to talk to her or be alone with her. She drives me crazy. But she came into town and bought my fiance so many things that we needed for our new home including a pots and pans set, a couch and a vacuum. I tried telling him although I really appreciate it I truly do I feel uncomfortable with her buying us so many things when I dont even want to talk to her...
Yesterday I walked out of my apartment she was just sitting there on the steps waiting for me. I dont know what to do I don't want to be rude and I do love her I just am uncomfortable around her when she acts like that because I have seen her freak out many many times over small things. I dont even like to say anything when she is around because she will challenge everything I say because she thinks she is right 100%of the time about EVERYTHING. I know this is part of her illness but I can't help the way I feel.

587,"So, a little background: in my school they have plays every year. I have been in every single play since I’ve had the chance to(3 years or about 10 plays). My best friends started to join around last year and it was really fun! The plays are run by students moms because I goto a private school.

So last year, when my friends joined, I was really happy but now I’m not sure. I’ve loved singing and acting since I was little but I’m starting to dislike it. My friends are getting bigger parts than me even though I’ve been there longer. I wouldn’t say I’m bad at acting, and I’m a pretty decent singer. This is my last year I can do it and  I’m not sure I can go through with it. All the parts goto the children of the directors and it’s just slowly shattering my confidence. I used to love singing! I would always sing! Now I hate singing, I feel like everyone is ruining it for me. I’m auditioning for a play in a couple hours and even though I’m the oldest auditioning, I’m still scared I’m not going to get any part. I just need some advice I guess. Should I stop participating or what?

Sorry this is bad writing. I just quickly wrote down what I felt and I feel like it’s all rambling. Also, when I go some of my “friends” act like they don’t know me, just because they got better parts.

588,"Hello everyone, I currently work as a schedule writer/HR assistant for $11/hr. I really love my job, especially since I am majoring in HR management in my state's university. Anyway, I might be able to get another job (still an HR assistant) but for $13-$14/hr which is great! The commute time is what I'm struggling with. My current $11/hr job is about less than 10 minutes away from my house and the $13-$14/hr job is anywhere from 30-45 minutes away from my house (depends on traffic). What should I do? Thank you!

Notes: I'm currently 20 years old and I have 2 years left to finish my BA, also both jobs are part-time.

595,"Little bit of backstory- When I was younger (~14-15), I was enduring what many suspected was an eating disorder. I’m noting ‘suspecting’, because although my school counsellor was fairly certain, I was never formally diagnosed by a doctor/therapist. I used to restrict my meals to relatively extreme lengths, in order to lose weight- despite being naturally thin/underweight. I never saw myself as anything more than how many lbs I was, how much I ate that day, etcetc- you get the picture. -there will also be a tl,dr at the bottom! Sorry for the long read.


Now, I’d like to consider myself in a much better mindset. I’ve put on a bit of weight, and I’m considered pretty ‘normal’, and a healthy BMI. Although I do sometimes struggle with an unhealthy mindset, I’m happy to say I’m in a much better place to rationalise my thoughts and to essentially just deal with it.


However, my family has started to become more and more obsessive over weight- be it their own, or everyone else’s. My father used to be very overweight (not obese- but pretty close), and ended up losing nearly half of his weight to prevent any health problems. Needless to say, he’s put on quite a bit since, but is in the process of losing it again. My father is very rational, and he’s being really responsible and relatively quiet with what he’s doing. Everyone is very supportive of him, and he’s very inspiring.


My (narcissist) mother on the other hand is extremely vocal, and complains but makes no effort to make a change. She’s not fat/unhealthy in the slightest- just a bit pudgy, like a lot of us. However, she’s now making multiple, very loud comments about how she’s so fat and ugly, and how she looks like a whale, etcetc. Every time I try and tell her she’s none of those things, she just shuts me down, or complains more. My grandmother (her mother) is the same. She’s an amazing woman, but sometimes lacks some self-awareness. She’ll constantly berate herself, literally ‘jokingly’ yell at herself in the mirror about how she’s so fat and ugly. Again, I tell her every time she’s not (she’s built the same way as my Mam), and how she’s wonderful the way she is- she just needs to focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle- yet she ignores me.


Now, these things in itself don’t really affect me too much- they’re not directed at me, or involve me at all, so why should they?


However, sometimes their comments get a little too personal for my liking. For example, I had a hospital scan a couple days ago, that required my height/weight. My gran decided to enquire about my weight the day after, after a rant about how she needs to lose a stone in a week. After I told her how heavy I was (~125lbs), she physically gasped, and decided to go on a tirade about how they must have weighed me incorrectly, and how she doesn’t weigh that much more than me. I’m nearly a solid foot taller than her (she’s ~4’10, I’m 5’8). This alone made me upset, as I was somewhat proud of my weight before her saying all this.


Another example would have been when my mam got home from work, and I said hello to her in my bra and underwear when she got upstairs. She noticed I had some stretch marks in between my legs (they’re very new- only appeared during the past month, and I’m lowkey really insecure of them), and decided to point with her entire arm to my legs, and exclaimed (really loudly) ‘what are those scratches between your legs?ew, what are they?’ I just tried to shrug it off, and haven’t said anything to her about them since. I’m too embarrassed to wear anything short anymore, it was honestly the final straw.


But anyways, back to the main question. Is this a normal thing to occur in a family, and would it be normal to be offended by these things? I’m having a really hard time separating my rational and seemingly ‘disordered’ thoughts from everything going on.


Tl, dr- my family has started seriously obsessing over weight. I used to suffer with a presumed eating disorder, and I’m having a hard time dealing with their comments on my weight- and if being offended is a result of my disordered or rational thinking.",08Jul2019,1

600,"Worked at a place in Tennessee as a minor (15 years old). I won’t name it, but I enjoyed working there, except for the manager. There’s a whole story about how I left (because of the manager) that I’ve posted earlier on. 

Basically, TN law prohibits 14/15 y/o from working more than 3 hours a day, 18 hours a week, and before 7am or after 7pm. All of these rules and others were broken during my employment there (along with 2 other teens there). 

I’ve had work weeks that were 32 hours at the most, I’ve worked until 11pm on a school night before, and I’ve also definitely worked more than 3 hours on a school day. There was one teenager who worked for 40 hours one week (granted he had a terrible home life).

I’m usually not the kind for revenge (although I would love to see that manager go down in flames), but this definitely affected me negatively. I was up really late some night trying to do homework and projects. I’m an honors student, so one can only imagine how tough testing week was for me (it was also then that I was scheduled to work double shifts on Saturday and Sunday). What should I do?

602,"A little back story: I'm 26 years old and I've been with my partner for 7 years. We have a daughter who's 4. Ever since our daughter was 1, I've been asking for another child because I want our daughter to be closer of age with her siblings, so they could enjoy similar things and play together, but I always got excuses like, ""The economy is bad, rn"" or ""We don't have the money for that, yet."" 

It made me so mad, that every time we had sex, I would think about it. ""Well, he's not gonna finish. He's gonna pull out, so whats the point?"" I lost interest in sex, fast and I only had it, when he would ask or when I was intoxicated, but other than that, it just seemed to time consuming. I'd much rather play video games or sew a few dresses. What can I say? It doesn't excite me anymore. The thought of it sounds like a chore. 

****
A few months ago, he thought it would be a grand idea to take me to a sex shop to bring excitement into bed again, so he bought me a viberator and it did get him more sex here and there, but every time I found myself alone, I'd handle my business by myself, so I didn't really need sex.. I never really hid it, since he knew about it, but one day, it disappeared and I haven't been able to find it. 
I asked him where it went and he smiled. I asked him why he hid it and he claimed it wasn't hiding, I just wasn't looking and it wouldn't have disappeared, if I had sex more often with him. 
I feel like I should buy myself a toy and hid it from him because I don't want to have sex for my toy. Like, ""Hey, thanks for finally having sex with me again, here's your reward,"" NO THANKS!! 
 I feel like sex shouldn't be a constant thing. I wouldn't mind having sex, if he would just impregnate me, but thats not gonna happens anytime soon, and I'm tired of teasing my body into thinking I'm going to get some and have him just pull out. It makes me feel used and I'd rather choose my toy, any day.

&amp;#x200B;

Before i start thank you for reading this it means a lot to me. I've had a such hard life, i know most of the people had this also. My family is very poor and i started working at jobs 8 years old and still working right now. I'm 26 years old. I know i'm getting into too much detail but i have to.  I've always worked. Didnt live my childhood. Always beaten up by parents. 

Finally by myself got into university all by alone. No financial support and anything. Most of the time i slept on the streets.  Finally found myself a job. Mornings i go to university and on the nights i was working. Didnt have any social life, relationships and such. Final year of the university lost half of my friends in terror attack, including my house mate(best friend). And i'm at the beginning again. Alone. Finished the university and moved to another city. I was working so hard at my job became a software development manager. Financially everything is going good. But everything else, i don't know where to start. All i missing now is literally love and cant find it. I didnt know anything about girls and feeling i'm going to die alone. All i want is love because i never felt it since i'm a child. I approached 3-4 girls in 2 years but failed all of them. All of them sees me as their friend. And i'm feeling hopeless. Most of the time i'm feeling suicidal, because i was never happy.

610,"Some backstory, this girl used to be a high school friend of mine and she moved in with me after asking to do so, I solely agreed because I knew it would have been nice not to be alone and for her to get a different start in life (she had a lot going on and she decided to leave her home state to move in with me, I’m military so she moved in with me to my new duty station).

The day she left though, she was merely going for a weekend to go to a concert, leaving behind a mess in my kitchen, living room, and her own bedroom; everything was essentially trashed. She didn’t clean up after herself during a two day period where I was drugged up from getting my wisdom teeth removed, and she claimed her parents refused to let her go back because they paid $300 for a Lyft from my apartment to the airport.

I was the one solely paying for rent and she was a horrible roommate. She molested a coworker of hers, she spent my money without asking, vomited on her blanket and the mattress I bought her, refused to clean up after she made a mess because of a drunken night.

I told her she needed to come to get her belongings because this was my property and her items reeked of sweat, crap, and vomit, and then she called the cops on me trying to tell them that I was “withholding her belongings”, intending to accuse me of theft even though she had abandoned everything, which I explained to her via text I wasn’t going to keep them in my house, and I moved all of her items to a storage unit and I’m waiting for her to come pick it up but she’s intentionally ignoring my text messages.

I have all the text message exchanges and receipts, I have evidence she hasn’t held up her end of the portion. She took a suitcase that belonged to a friend of mine and hasn’t returned it to us, and she also hasn’t paid me for the storage unit, or for a pair of headsets she broke while in my house.

I don’t want to continue paying for the storage unit when I have other finances, including paying for my newborn baby’s caretakers and I don’t know what I can do in order to get her to remove everything from here. I’m in Kansas, she’s in California. Any advice? Thanks in advance.",08Jul2019,1

A part of me wants to be nice, get good grades, succeed, get married at 26 to my “dream girl” and raise a family with a 9 to 5 job. But another part of me says that I can’t. 

It’s weird, I see two worlds every day. At school I see kids with the biggest problems on their mind being their crush not responding to them.

A few weeks ago, I met a very famous person on a dating app.  Yes, truly.  This is someone that I have known of, but never in a million years thought I'd have the opportunity to meet, let alone go out with...so it never even crossed my mind.  When we matched on this app, I assumed they were a catfish, but decided to go along with it, because why not.  If anything seemed weird, I could always just turn around and leave.  We set up a time to meet for a quick hello because I was in the neighborhood and lo and behold, it was really this person.  I tried not to show any shock, but for the first few mins, I was a little flustered on the inside.  We took a walk around the neighborhood just chatting and it calmed my nerves.  We hit it off very well.  So well that we ended up going to their place in the neighborhood (amazing, of course), and had a great time just talking, etc...We didn't talk about their work AT ALL.   Not even a mention.  I did not spend the night, but left my number in the dating app, assuming I would be forgotten about the next day.  The next morning, they sent their number and we've been texting occasionally ever since.  This person has been away for the holiday (4TH), but will return this week.  We've discussed meeting after they return, but no solid plan yet.

I know this isn't typical.  I've only told 4 people, and all 4 mouths drop when I tell them this story.  I don't want to tell too many people in my life, because these types of things can bring the worst out of people (jealousy, rumors, etc). I'm still having trouble believing it myself lol.  

The advice I'm looking for:  I'm not famous and I don't make a ton of money.  Since this person is famous and makes so much more money than I do, how do I go about this without scaring them?  When do I bring up their work? We haven't spent much time together, but I do like them and look forward to getting to know them.  I don't want them to think I'm in this for the money or fame.  I have no desire to be famous at all.  I'm thinking of taking them out for coffee or drinks/food and paying for it all, to send the message that I'm not in this for their money.  I plan to message them soon to set up a time to meet, but I'm unsure of where to go/what to offer as far as a date.  This is all so much lol...any general advice?

Then I realized that it was the first time I’ve done that in a while.

When I was younger, I read a lot. I mean A LOT. However, these days I tend to quickly skim through the whole thing or take time to read maybe the first two paragraphs and give up, because I... just can’t do it for some reason. It’s like my brain is pulling me back.

This has been on my mind for a while now, and I’ve been slightly worried for my comprehension abilities. I’ve noticed that I’ve been unable to focus more and more on small details of a writing, because I’m skimming through everything so quickly.

A bit about the reading habits of my younger days- I absorbed everything like a sponge, and while I did not read every sentence (but DEFINITELY did take more time to read in a more detailed manner) I remembered nearly everything. I just remembered, but I also remembered some parts of the book as ‘pictures’, if you get what I’m saying? I have certain paragraphs that will stay on my mind as whole, albeit a little... blotchy.

622,"My older brother is in his late twenties, significantly overweight, was recently laid off (an has a history of being fired from his previous jobs for consistently being late) has depression and ADHD (which he is taking medication for). He has moved back into my parents basement for the 2nd time a few years ago. He frequently does not take care of his personal hygiene for long periods of time, and his living quarters are something out of a hoarders home.  

He leaves piles of trash, empty food boxes, utensils, cat food cans, in growing towers. Even with constant harassing he almost never cleans, and it is generally left to my mother, me, or my younger brother to clean out the place for him (to which he he’ll get angry about, saying he was going to do it, though he’s been saying that for a month) 

He is quite lazy, coming up with any excuse under the sun to not do the simplest of chores. When he does do them, they are done poorly, and generally have to be redone, which he takes as “what’s the point?” And not “guess i should do more” 

His eating habits are bad. Even though my mother still cooks/brings home at least 2 square meals a day, and we have plenty of healthy options, he will eat uncooked frozen meals, or make a box meal made for 4 people and eat it all himself, even when we point out to him that its not healthy and he should pace himself. 

His sleeping habits, admittedly tied in part to his depression, are completely out of wack. He’ll be awake for 30+ hours then sleep for 12. He is always sleeping far to much or far too little and has no semblance of cycle. 

I could fill a book but i feel i’ve painted enough of a picture. 

Let me also say that my brother is one of the smartest people i know, that he is hilarious, and can be very kind and emotionally supportive when it really matters, and i love him unconditionally, more that i can exspress. But it is very clear he doesn’t love himself, and that’s where all of these problems stem from. He acts very proud most of the time, not acknowledging or getting very offended whenever you bring any of his faults up, but he struggles deeply with self esteem.

 Its heartbreaking to see my brother this way. My family is very supportive of him, monetarily as well as emotionally, spending quality time with him. Our family loves to play games together and we do so nearly every day, i play video games and chat on discord with him daily.  But that doesn’t mean we don’t try and address the elephant in the room, the big problem with this stagnation. 

I understand he was seeing a counselor at some point but I’m not sure it was effective, or how long it went on. What can i do to help my brother?

TLDR: my brother is a “deadbeat” that doesn’t love himself. How do i help him?",08Jul2019,1
623,"So I've heard SSRIs reduce libido for some people, but obviously you need a prescription for them and they have other side effects. Right now, I'm really driven to do well in work and school, and I dont want to lose that. I also work out and I dont want to lose my drive to do that or muscle mass I've gained. Are there otc medications or supplements or even herbs or something I can take to kill sex drive without affecting any of that?

624,"Hello all. I am currently sixteen and a half. I have no money saved (spare about 50), a car that my parents bought and could possibly (likely) get sold soon. I do not have a job but I am looking. I have ""bills"" to pay. Namely gas for the car that could get sold soon, and school fee's. I go to college next year and there are a number of fees. However I don't need to pay tuition because I'm going through a high school program which covers tuition. I have to pay for parking (and/or bus fair), books, general supplies, and fee's associated with class activities (like certain products used in chemistry classes). I am currently looking at about 500$-700$ every year. Times that by 2 for the my entire time spent there and you get 1000-1400$. Gas is very expensive right now, almost 4$ per gallon. And I have a truck... A truck that I drive almost an hour and a half every day... My gas bill is sexier than a herpes sore on a truck stop hooker. 

Once I get a job I will set up a budget for gas, school, saving, etc. I hope to get the most hours possible for someone my age. I'm also fishing for under the table work. I.e. Manual labor for neighbors, walking dogs, driving friends around, helping friends parents, maybe getting a semi unofficial job with a friend (My friend works for his dad and I've known them since middle school so I'm hoping they can get me work). Saving for a ""new"" car (maybe a motorcycle because they are cheap and get good miles), an apartment, emergency fund, general insurance, necessities, and the unknown. It racks up to god knows how much. I've come up with several figures. At this point I've recognized that I need to save as much as humanly possible because I don't have anybody to fall back on. Or if I do they aren't financially stable either.

My reasons for leaving (or getting kicked out) come in plenitude. Mainly my parents are abusive, I don't deal with physical abuse anymore but that doesn't mean staying is good for my mental state either. Not going to get into it too much but I'm constantly tracked, monitored, and ""worried"" about. Essentially snooped on. Yet I'm also a disappointment who will end up in jail or dead if I do anything but what they tell me. And if I did do what they told me, I'm sure I would just fuck it up. In short, they are going to kick me out or I am going to leave once I'm 18. And they will likely sell my car by then.

I'm also looking at a 1,700$ medical bill, they are making me pay for due to it ""being my fault"". It was a suicide attempt that didn't go as planned... obviously. So the worst case scenario is:

School: 1,400$

Medical: 1,700$

Apartment (Three months rent+Security+etc): 3.500$ (I have no clue if this is accurate, I did three months rent added security for 1,000, and threw on an extra 400 for the unknown)

Car/Transportation: (Zero clue on this, it heavily depends on when my car gets sold, if I can afford a bike or cheap car by then, etc.) Let's just throw 1,500$ into the mix (Bikes are relatively cheap as I recall)

Emergency fund: 2,500$

Necessities: 1,000$ (This is gas, food, water, electricity, phone, etc.)

Adjust for things I'm too dumb to remember or plan for: 1,750$

Total: 13,350$

This does not include insurance, or things I have to pay for now such as food and gas. They may also make me pay rent once I do get a job, I don't know how much that will cost. I understand that my figure is very rough and doesn't account for nearly enough, but it's all I've got for now.

So any ideas, advice, or help would be appreciated. Adjust the figure I made, tips on how to save, ideas on how to fix this fucked up situation my dumb-ass got into. Thank you in advance for reading my severely rushed post.

626,I’ve finally accepted that I will never find a girl who will love me or be attracted to me again. I’ve tried so hard since my wife left me to find someone else but after two years I have given up. When I’m out girls look at my like I’m not even a guy just a non entity. I guess I’ve accepted I’m ugly short and have nothing to offer a girl. I’m trying to figure out what I should do with my life now that I will be alone for the rest of my life. I know people say it will happen when your not looking or you can’t say forever but I truly know there’s no one for me. I’m thinking about learning to play a instrument or start a business or something that I can dedicate my whole life to. It’s bad when your family doesn’t understand and keeps asking the same questions but I’m too ashamed to answer them with the truth. Being alone sucks and not having someone to share life’s little moments with is very hard for me. I do think about ending my suffering but I thought why not try something else first and see if I can find some type of happiness or just something to fill the void of these thoughts. Maybe it’s meant to be like this so I don’t pass my bad genes on kind of like natural selection I guess. I honestly don’t know what to do at this point. It’s bad to say but even a accidental touch of let’s say a cashier or some type of customer service girl is the high light of my life at this point. It’s really hard not having any type of touch other than my dog which is great but it’s not a person. Maybe nothing will help and I will take the easy way out. That actually keeps me going knowing I can exit this life anytime I want. I’ll keep going until I lose the will to get out of bed or take care of myself or my dog.,08Jul2019,1

631,"I need some advice, my coworker (technically my manager) at my workplace has a crush on me. 
It was simple and kinda funny at first, him being awkward and shy..
But it’s become something else the last 2 months. He’s started getting nosey about my plans after I leave work. Messaging me after I leave asking “wow you rushed out of here, got plans or sm?”
He’s also taken to creating these plans in his head that involve me, when in reality I never agreed to anything. Example from a couple weeks ago; We had a conversation while at work about Halloween, and I suggested he go as Rick from Rick and Morty. He replied with “As long as you go as Morty.” I laughed and said I’d start working on my prepubescent boy voice. 
He brings it up randomly at work the other day, saying, “Just so you know, if we don’t do Halloween together I’m going to be really upset”
And when I tried to explain to him I didn’t understand what he meant, and that I hadn’t really made plans with him, he got extremely defensive and started trying to argue about what I said before...
Huge red flags to me. Everything he’s done is kind of stacking up into one awkward situation. 
I really just want to be friends with him, and enjoy what would be a great friendship (we have a lot of the same interests) but he’s getting a little out of hand with his “innocent” crush. 

I want to let him down nicely, and explain I’m not comfortable with his attitude towards me lately and he needs to lay off..but I don’t want a ruined friendship with another man because of unrequited feelings.  (This is the second time at the same job this has happened)

644,"This is a throwaway account, since my friends are on reddit &amp; know my username. Hi all, so I did something, which in retrospect, seems extremely stupid. I'm a young PhD student in Economics from a moderately well known college in my field. My college has organised a seminar series, where we get to interact with the top minds of our field. A few months ago, I noticed a flaw in the strategy in a very well cited paper in my field. When I went to meet today's presenter (who's an extremely well known researcher, and someone whose work I hold in very high regards), I brought up that particular paper, and its flaw, while discussing my own work, where I tried to use a similar strategy but it didn't quite work out. The presenter already  knows the author of the paper pretty well, since they work in the same field. While discussing, I stupidly metioned that this particular well known piece of work is not published yet, and perhaps this flaw could be a reason for that.
The moment it came out of my mouth, I realised that I probably shouldn't be criticising someone's work (as in, comment on publishing) but it was too late to change what I said! The presenter, of course was very professional with me, but I realised later that this interaction could hurt my chances of getting published, once I finish my work. Academia is a pretty tightly knit community, and this presenter is in some really high places!

I'm afraid I've done something that I can't really undo (the session's over and presenter is from another country, so she's left), and I'm scared!

I was always one of the best on the team, and my passion for the game was unmatched by anyone. Recently though, specifically in my 8th grade year, I've felt unmotivated to go to practices, dreadful of going to games, and just stressed in general. I've always been told I'm a good player, but I've been hitting so much poor form lately, and it's wearing away at my mental state. Half of my relatives are from South America, so they love the sport as well. Whenever they come visit they say they love watching me play, and how good I am, and if I go there, I love to just casually play and mess around. I'm honestly not in love with this game anymore, and while I know it's something I enjoy, it just stressed me out so much. Not to mention I have younger brothers, so quitting now while they don't would make me feel terrible. I have no idea what to do. I want to quit, but I feel that if I do, my family, my relatives from South America, and just everyone would look at me in a different, more negative light. I have so many good memories of the sport, but those feel like theyll never come back.

651,"Ok, basically I’ve been running competitively for about a year now. It started when I did my school cross country and placed higher than I thought I would. After running with the school for a season, I decided to try out for states (Australian btw). I made it and went to the Australian Junior Cross Country Championships. Unfortunately, I had to pull out of the main race due to stitches that I was getting before (I was listed as the fourth fastest in WA so a big let down). As track season rolled around, I again ran for my school and placed first in the schools competition. Club athletics season started, and I was super excited to improve and attempt to run some elite times (for the runners reading this I was looking for a 4:00 1500m as a 15yo male). My season started off great and finished great, only just missing my goal times for my main two events, the 1500m and 3000m. 

A few months ago, school cross country started again, and I was loving it. Over the last few weeks however, things have taken a turn for the worst, my training started going to shit, then my races followed. I was getting beaten by people I wasn’t getting beaten by before. To top it all off, I got sick and was unable to train for two weeks straight. I have been unable to find the motivation to leave the house for runs and often stay in my room for a lot of the day (I’m on holidays). 

Originally, my goal was to try and hopefully run for a college in the US, but now I don’t even want to run for my school.

652,"I'm 34f and most of my life have gone back and forth about having children. I'm marrying my SO (27m) in September, and we seem to be discussing it a lot lately. 

In my young 20s, knowing *everything*, I knew I wanted three kids. In my mid twenties: zero. Late twenties and lots of lame dating misadventures later, I realized I might not find a partner to procreate with.  Planning on being single for life, I thought perhaps I could adopt after stabilizing my career, if I still wanted to raise kids. That took any biological pressure off me, though any appeal parenthood has had for me has always been about raising children, not child bearing.

When I met my SO, I told him from the beginning I was more interested in caring for kids that are already in the world and in need of loving families, versus risking my health with a geriatric pregnancy and potentially passing on hereditary traits that are difficult to live with. He was always on board with any way we might create a family of our own, but we never questioned that we would have kids. Until the last month or so...

The longer we have been together, the more I enjoy Just Us. I don't know that I want to share my attention, or lose his. I cringe at the cost of raising kids, the nightmare public school system (or making the choice to give up my career to home school). We recently learned about ourselves that we love to travel, and realistically, that would go away, too.

I know women are having healthy pregnancies and delivering healthy babies well into their 40s now. But I also know the risks begin to climb for mother and child after 34. At 35, you're considered a geriatric pregnancy, and many preconceived notions are out the window. Essentially, the sooner the better if SO wants a biological baby (and that kind of pressure freaks me out because we both agree we aren't prepared yet.) 

I think I'd be a good mom. I think I'd make the sacrifices necessary and adore my children. I know I'd prioritize raising them and teaching them to be good people. But I'm afraid I'd lose myself in the process, and I don't want that.

So advice or input from both sides of the fence would be greatly appreciated, since I'm sure I'm not thinking of most angles.

TLDR: I don't know which I'd regret more- not having kids and feeling the loss of that experience, or having them and giving up life as I know it and possibly my sense of self. When or how did you make your decision about whether to start a family?",08Jul2019,2

654,"Back in January, I booked an Airbnb for a beach trip in late August. The house can sleep 18 people, and at the time I booked it, 10 people were already confirmed. It shouldn't be hard to wrangle eight people to join in with eight months of notice, right? 

I sent out an email to 20 people with a quick description of the property, a link to the listing, trip dates, and price. Only a few people responded, and the others didn't bother replying. Since then, it has been like pulling teeth to get people to commit and give me a straight Yes or No. A few people have even admitted, ""I can't commit to things!"" or ""I don't know my summer plans yet!"" From my perspective, that's the point of planning something so far in advance. You put this on your calendar, then make plans around the trip, not wait around until a better option comes up. 

There are only five spots left in the house, but I'm becoming increasingly frustrated because they have had seven months to give a definitive Yes or No answer. It makes planning the whole ordeal even harder than it needs to be. And, on a personal level, it makes me feel like they don't value my friendship, or don't want to spend time with me. 

There are about 10 people left on the maybe list, and I've texted them multiple times over the past few weeks and months to get a clear answer. We asked that everyone get back to us by yesterday at the latest, so we can move forward with the planning, but that obviously didn't happen. At this point, what should I do?",08Jul2019,1

I really want to work for the company and I have wanted this job for a while, but things aren’t going so well.  I feel like i have received really poor training, I like my trainer a lot it’s just they have a bad program for training. Almost no repetition and a lot of info thrown at you on the floor after doing computer work that barely tells you how what and when to do tasks. I mess up a lot and I feel that others are getting frustrated which I understand, but it’s not my fault the training is so half ass.  I know I can do it eventually but need some advice to make things better in the beginning. Thanks",08Jul2019,1

657,"I'm the protective security officer involved in this shooting: https://www.newsweek.com/man-stabs-mother-grandmother-social-security-office-shot-dead-guard-1015444

Tomorrow is the 1 year anniversary of the incident and I have not publicly spoke with anyone in the media about it. They news got it all wrong.  There was no argument or anything that broke out, he just started stabbing them out of nowhere without saying a word.  I fired one shot to his torso.  I wasn't firing to kill, I was firing to stop him from killing.  
Ever since the incident it has drastically changed my life.  I've been diagnosed with PTSD, have to see a therapist, and have to take multiple medications. It's effected my personal life with my wife, family, and friends.

  I work on a government contract but am not a federal employee.  I worked for a company that bids on the government contract.  I've been on the contract 10 years and have been through 4 different companies in that time.  Thankfully when a new company takes over the contract the have to offer us our job.  

The company I was with during the incident told me to take as much time off as needed and they would pay me.  Me, having never been involved in something like this before took just a week off.  I felt fine as everything is done was justified and clear cut.  

After a few weeks I started having severe neck pain and headaches.   I went to the doctor and they said it was stress related and referred me to a therapist where I was diagnosed as having PTSD.  I was told to take 6 weeks off.  The company back tracked on paying me for time off and put me on workers comp.  This cause me to lose about $1800 in pay over those 6 weeks.  

During this time the company lost the contract to another company.  I went and met with the owner of my current company about helping me out so I wouldn't have problems paying my bills and such.  He told me he'd see what he could do and get back with me.  He never spoke to me again.  The new company let it be known to me if I wasn't back on duty by the time they took over the contract I would lose my position where I worked at.    

The new company has been taking money that's supposed to used for my health and welfare and supposed to be putting it in a 401 account.   So far they have taken out about $5,000 and only put about $1400 in the account.   I have medical bills that need to be paid but can't access that money and all attempts to contact the company about this I have never had a reply from HR. 

I've had to be careful what I say at work as people are worried about my mental stability and report any little thing I say like if I'm stressed or made nervous by someone, or anything like that. 

I've reached out to people at the department of Homeland security federal protective services about issues with the new company and my PTSD.  I wanted some procedures and policy put in place to help anyone else that this had happened to.   As far as I know this has never happened before in a federal building so there was no precedent for this.  

So far, almost a year later , nobody from the company or the government has reached out to check on me other than when they are worried I'm a liability.  

There is much more to all this.  The way we are contracted instead of working directly for the government.  Each contract although federal is done on a state by state basis.  So each state is run by a different company that has different policies and procedures so there is no uniformity across the country. There has been improper training, unfair pay, racism, etc... 

We are in a union, but I have reached out to the union and filed complaints with no response.  The union has never once contacted me to check on me after the incident.  I've reached out to the international president about the incident with no response.  

My company, the government, and the union have abandoned me.  I saved two lived and my entire life has been flipped upside down and I have nothing to show for except financial and mental struggles.  I'm still working and still do my job to the best of my ability, but I've been trying to find a new job which is hard in a small town in Mississippi to make decent money with little education. 

I want to tell my story now.  I want people to know what's going on and how I and others have been treated. I want things to change.  I'm not looking for recognition or attention, I just want my story to be heard so that it can help others in the future and maybe bring about change about how us officers are treated in general and after incidents like this.

I've reached out to the Joe Rogan experience podcast and to 60 minutes and have gotten no response from either.  I don't know how to get this story out there and call out the lack of government help.  I think that's why we are contracted so nobody has to be responsible for us other than workers comp and they do the bare minimum necessary. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest but also wanted ask if anyone knew of any resources I could reach out to, to help bring about change for people in my situation.",08Jul2019,2

I've been at the same job for about 7 years now. I honestly feel underpaid for my skills, and have not had any significant challenging work in 1+ years and it's really getting to me as I can't concentrate on shitty admin stuff.

For some background, it is a small company but owned by a larger company, and for the past 8 months or so they (parent company) have been stepping in more, to cut costs, etc. Even 2 long time employees were laid off a few months ago. 

In April I had to take FMLA and disability, to try to take care of myself (dealing with addiction). Also the past month or so, my husband has taken disability to try to get his life on track (chronic pain) and needs my assistance with pretty much everything. Now with my job, there is nothing preventing me from doing my work remotely, and since my supervisor was giving me a super hard time about it, I submitted an official request to work remote over a week ago, and they are ""considering it"". Especially since he was in the hospital 4 days a few weeks ago, and I let her know I'd tell her when we're back home but she was hassling me multiple times a day. At this time I was working between home and the hospital. He's only rated 80% VA disabled so I can't apply as a caretaker. 

On top of that my supervisor is saying she is talking to HR about setting up ""reporting and attendance"" guidelines I have to sign. I've been a great employee since I've started, and this just feels like awfully coincidental timing after my leave.

I am also miserable in general. My work sucks, I ask for more to do but they don't have enough billable work apparently, I have to do all shopping/cooking/cleaning/etc. ( I love my husband but its alot).

At this time I'd love to get a new job but I dont see how feasible it is without quitting my job, and being up a creek financially with my husband's work situation so tenuous (I'm worried they might fire him). I'm just lost and depressed, and dont know what to do. Not sure if I can get advice here but have no idea what else to do.

TLDR: my work is giving me nothing to do, making me depressed, I'm worried they might punish me or stigmatize me for my past alcohol issues (Ive been sober 4 months), dont have a safety net to quit now, and I'm overwhelmed at home trying to help with my disabled husband.",08Jul2019,1
665,"My gf just broke up with me Friday. Her reasons were that while everything was great she didn't see a future with me and something was missing. It was civil and then we ended up talking for about four hours. I forget exactly how we got on the topic but I started to get deep with her, more so than I did while we were dating, and she said ""it felt like I went from 2d to 3d"" or something like that. I told her I was afraid of being open because I thought she wouldn't like those parts of me. We stayed on the phone talking for a while more and neither of us wanted to hang up. The next day I called her just to say that despite being broken up she can still call me and count on me as a friend (we were friends for about four years and dated for a little over a year and a half) . She extended the offer and the last contact we had was a drunk text she sent me Saturday night.

I've done some soul searching and I want to try again. This time I want her to see the real me, flaws and all.

We have been looking into upgrading our TV. We currently have a pretty nice, although obsolete, 9 year old model. It has nothing wrong with it, it's just definitely showing its age for what we need. 

My wife said that if we get a new one, we could just give her our old one. Any time we upgrade something, she quite often will get our older model. That usually means she sells her original one. And since we live relatively close, she is frequently needing some sort of yard or house help, with nothing given in return. Last year, she asked us and her other child, to build her a deck. After it was built, I asked her about an old, non-running Jeep she had. She had never driven it, and it definitely needed quite a lot of work. I asked if I could just have it, since it had been sitting for almost 3 years, to which she rejected the idea because she was going to get it running, or sell it. She sold it, to a scrap yard for a whopping $300.

674,"  

I don't know if this should be on here or if this is too much but, I need advice. If this should be posted on another subreddit let me know. I'm pretty new to this. 

FYI: I talk about rape so, if that triggers you this your warning. 

When I grew up, my mother was physically, emotionally, and mostly sexually abusive.  She would scream and threaten my half sister (connected through dad's side; my mother is her step-mother) and although I was almost never physically abused by her, I was raped by her several times between the ages of about (I don't remember exactly when it started but the first distinct memory of an incident I have is around) 6ish? to 12. After 12, I was ""becoming a women"" so, she stopped.

Just to give you a highlight reel of some of the other things she did to me was: 

`text my friends through my phone to sabotage my friendships,` 

`stalk me while at school (she would literally sit in the car in the parking lot and watch)`

`scream and cry to me for hours,`

`force me to bathe her, cook for her, and take care of her` 

`keep me up awake all night by repeatedly screaming in my ear,` 

`threaten to kill me and people I care about (one time while brandishing a kitchen and multiples time while driving),` 

`Force herself into my room and pin me down without warning`

`kicking me out on the street without shoes causing me to have burns on the bottom of my feet for weeks`  

Basically, she was one evil bitch. 

In middle school, I talked to a school counselor who was really nice and had to contact social services since I complained my mother threatening to kill herself (Never told her the really bad stuff; I was too scared) When my mother found out, she was furious. She threatened me, saying that if I told anyone, especially the social worker, she would kill me then herself and we would spend eternity in heaven together (to be fair, this was not the first time she raised this threat). So I didn't tell the social services about anything.

A few months after that I decided that no one was going to help me but, me so I worked hard at school. I went from sub-par grades to straight A's. I worked my ass off so, I could get a scholarship and get away from my mother. When I was in 10th grade I moved in with my dad and didn't have to see my mother as much. Now, as a 19, I'm at an amazing university (one of the best in the US) and I think, fairly well adjusted considering my history.

I don't talk to my mother at all now but, I know through relatives that she is dying of cancer.  It's stage 4 and the medicines that stop it have stopped working so, the doctors say she has anywhere from 6 months to 2 years to live. When I first heard I was relived and honestly thought the cancer was a sort of karmic punishment from the universe, but now I wonder about my safety and the people around her. 

First off, after she got cancer, she threatened me, that she would try to kill me and herself if the treatments didn't work. They aren't working

Secondly, I worry about my sister. My mother was always more focused on me than my sister but, I wonder if she would use her to hurt me, like she did in the past.

Thirdly, about other children she may have and/or is molesting. I never knew of any other kids that she assaulted besides me but, I always wondered if she would or had found another kid to take advantage of. If there's some kid out there who is getting hurt right now by her, I would never forgive myself, but she's so weak (according to relatives who have seen her) she can barely get out of bed; let alone groom a kid to take advantage of.

But I still wonder if I should go to the police. If I go to the police then, I have to tell everyone my story. I tried telling my father once and he just didn't believe the rape thing. I don't blame people for not believing my story; honestly, if I was their shoes, I'm not sure if I would believe me either. What mother rapes her kid, right?

So even if I take legal action, I don't think it would hold up in court. After all, it's my word vs. hers and who is going to believe me? Plus when I was interviewed by the social services, I didn't tell them anything. 

Even if they do believe me, it would still devastate my family, who is already upset about the more PG stuff she did to me that I told them about, and force me to expose a side of myself that I have never shown anyone to everyone. 

Not to mention, If her threat about killing me then herself (which I believe is a pretty empty threat) is true, then I would be putting my life on the line.

Plus she is going to die relatively soon and then everyone will be safe anyways. 

But even if there is a .0001% chance of a child being hurt by her now, isn't it my duty to stand up and stop it?

Should I talk to the police? Should I tell my family? Should I just keep ignoring it? I don't know what to do, but it's eating away at my soul. 

TL;DR my mom raped me when I was a kid and has stage 4 cancer. Should I take legal action against her?",08Jul2019,1
675,"Hi,

I'm 18, and recently, my dad has really been testing my patience. He keeps making empty promises and accusing me of things that aren't true. 

In October, he was supposed to fly out to visit me at college. He didn't do that. I had to ask him what time his flight was getting in in order to learn that he was going to be a no show. He didn't bother to tell me on his own.

In December, I returned home to packed boxes. He almost moved houses while I was away and never bothered to tell me about it. Then, when I expressed that I was a bit upset that I didn't know, he went off on me, accusing me of lying. He said that he did tell me, and I just decided not to believe it.

In March, I asked him if, when he drove down to get me, by best friend could ride with him to visit, since she can't afford a flight. He said yes, and helped us plan the whole thing out. At the beginning of May, he said that he was never going to drive down and that the whole thing had been a joke. That was awful to explain to Kat. 

This week, I'm going to LA to visit my aunt. At the beginning of June, he had a fight with her and pulled out of his promise to cover my plane ticket (the store I worked at closed down while I was away and I haven't been able to find a new job). So I had to figure that out on my own. My college friends are going with me and had already gotten their tickets, so I couldn't just cancel the trip.

My friends from college are visiting me at home right now before the three of us fly to LA tomorrow. Last week, he offered to take the three of us out to eat somewhere and get me a new phone, because mine has been dying way too fast, and I can't be stuck in LA with a dead phone and an aunt that he refuses to speak to. Today, the day we were supposed to do all of this, he backed out. I had to ask what time he was going to pick us up to learn that it was all off.

When I asked what the hell I was supposed to do about my phone, he told me that I should have told him about it sooner. I've been pestering him to take me to get this one repaired or replaced since I got home at the beginning of June.

I completely understand that sometimes plans change, and sometimes money gets tight. It happens to everyone, and I would never judge somebody over that. But he's making promises that he breaks without even telling me that he broke them. It's effecting me and my friends, and I feel like I can't trust what he says anymore. I love my dad to pieces. He's not a bad person, but he can't keep doing this to me.

677,"I just finished my first year of uni in Scotland with good grades. I'm on holiday now and have been having a think about university and my future.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background - I'm 18, started studying Business Management at uni last year because it was the 'normal' thing to do after leaving school. The course is ok but I didn't really enjoy the uni lifestyle. I found it hard to make friends in the new city. I'm a bit of an introverted and independent person. I spent most of my time working UberEats and running my business. Next year I'll be living with a friend and his friends - they all smoke weed all the time and encourage me to do it with them but I don't really want to spend all my time stoned so I'm not sure how much I will enjoy my living situation next year.  


I love working for myself. I've got multiple income streams including an eBay store which I'm currently expanding even more at the minute. The money I made last year from working part-time worked out to be just below the average of a Business Graduate. And that was from working and studying a full-time course at the same time. I'm wanting to grow my business even more but I won't have the time if I continue into second year.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty certain that I don't want a 9-5, I prefer the freedom of working for myself and the satisfaction of my business growing which results in making more money for myself rather than someone else. I certainly don't need a degree for my business but it would be useful if I ever decide to get a different job (which is unlikely if all goes well).

All this has made me consider dropping out of uni because I'm worried I'm wasting my time on something I don't enjoy but at the same time, I'm worried that if my business ventures don't work out, I'd find it hard to find a job without a degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another factor preventing me from dropping out is parents, They are always going on at me to get good grades at university. They don't seem to understand that there are other options. They're actually not supportive of my business - at times they say I need to focus on university more. My bedroom is full of inventory and my mum gets annoyed that it's all there. She says it stresses her out. I think I'll have a hard time explaining to my parents if I drop out and continue with my own path.

679,"I previously had three dogs, but recently one passed away. Now I have two dogs. They are all house trained. One of the two dogs (female dog) suddenly is pooping in the house. My family has linked this behavior to the trauma/separation anxiety of the recent passing of the other dog that used to be in our family. She only started doing this after the other dog passed away. She has pooped in her dog bed, on the porch, and in the car. She wasn’t doing this before. She also doesn’t poop during dog walks. This has been going on for weeks and it’s showing no signs of stopping. How do I get her re-trained? How do I get her to stop doing this?",08Jul2019,1
681,"She was the one that got away. I know a lot of advice I’m probably gonna get might not be applicable since I’m not gonna write the full story here. You won’t know all the ins and outs as to why 12 years later I still miss her. But if you do decide to try to respond to this or offer any type of advice, thank you 🙏🏼 

But she was (and probably still is) the love of my life. I thought I was going to marry her. I think about her all the time. I check her Facebook all the time just to see that she’s doing well. And I can’t stop. I still have dreams about her often. Maybe even more so lately.

And since her and I broke up, I’ve had plenty of relationships, one night stands, partied. Finished college, Moved cities, gotten and lost jobs. Made new friends. Made money, accomplished goals and reached life milestones. I’ve learned to live life without her. But like today, there are many days where I wake up from a dream about her. And it is the strangest feeling.

She messaged me a couple months ago, to see how I was doing. She quickly broke down on me as if we were still together. Airing out the tough things she’s been dealing with. Her father was in bad health when we were together. He had a life threatening surgery, and survived. He is due for the same life threatening surgery again. She needed an open ear about that among other things, and she came to me. Despite having her boyfriend who she’s been with since her and I broke up, she came to me.

I found it so strange that she messaged me to air that out. Why not her boyfriend?

At the end of the convo I proposed that we grab coffee sometime next time I’m in town. I didn’t put too much pressure on it, and the convo definitely lent itself to that type of proposition. It seemed like she wanted to but she mentioned her boyfriend wouldn’t like it. But she seemed interested.

Part of me believes that it has nothing to do with her boyfriend. I think she’s afraid to see me. I can feel that in our interaction. But the uncertainty kills me.

Part of me believes things with her and her boyfriend aren’t well. I have nothing to base this off of, I just get the feeling.

There is a tension I can feel throughout the years. Things are over, but there is this strange tension. She won’t see me, but she will see other ex-boyfriends. She won’t follow me on Instagram despite being ok with being connected via Facebook (she pops up on my “people you may know” list, so I can only assume I pop up on hers as well. She won’t meet for coffee, but will message me about the issues that are enveloping her at the moment.

Again, I know I’m hardly getting into details. But, any advice to get her out of my head? Is there a real life Lacuna, Inc I can goto? Im tired of living in this repetitive state of longing. I’ve lived my life and will continue to do so, but I always have that underlying desire for her.

Or do I confess to her that I still love her after all this time, when I get the chance, if it ever arrives?",08Jul2019,0
682,"My ex tried to reconnect with me after 4 years last night. I can already see where it's headed. I'm just not sure how I feel about her having a kid now. It's worth noting Ive never fell in love with someone as I did with her, she's the ""one that got away"" if you will. So the whole kid thing kinda hurts a bit, considering we'd always talk about our future, and it kinda feels like that should be my kid in another life. 

My question is do I just get over the fact she has a kid and things will never be how I planned/wanted, or do i need to just dodge this bullet entirely. I want to save myself pain but I also don't want to miss out on an opportunity for happiness with the love of my life. Is it childish this kid thing is affecting me so much? Am I wrong for feeling this way? Would you let a kid be the sole factor for not giving it a shot?

688,"Sorry in advace for the extremely long post.

I (male 16yr) have two younger brothers (12yr and 10yr). I think our family has a pretty strong relationship, as we always have meals together, go on hikes together, see movies, go to the city occasionally, and other acitvities like bowling, golf, or the pool. However, my youngest brother suffers from ADHD, and unfortunetly he tends to misbehave a lot. When he and 12yr hang out, it usually results in a fight, with 10yr instigating a majority of the time. When 12yr wants some alone time, 10yr will get bored and end up bothering him, causing more trouble. We've given him a couple dozen acitvities he can do on his own, but eventually he ends up going back to bother his brother anyways. This especially happens when I have to babysit. How can we stop this from happening? I'll be in another room, and they'll end up arguing to the point where they start hitting each other. Sometimes it happens so quickly I can't stop it before the damage is done. The therapist wants them to work it out by themselves (I can only intervene when they get violent), however I've never seen them resolve a conflict without it leading to some sort of violence. My parents have punished him sometimes, but most of the time they yell at him and that's it. Being the child I want to trust them, but I sometimes question if there is more we can do. 10yr doesn't like being in trouble, and never really accepts responsibility for his actions. I've tried explaining that he really should listen to what Mom and Dad are saying, but he responds to me with ""I don't care"".

10yr seems to get annoyed a lot about fairness. Common things he says ""Why did (person) get to do this"" or ""Why do I have to do this when (person) didn't do it"" or ""(person) never gets in trouble for it"". The ""person"" I refer to is usually 12yr, but sometimes others too. We keep on reminding him not to worry about others, and my father has threatened to punish him, although he hasn't really followed through. My thought is that they have gotten so tired of punishing him they've given up, which I can understand. However, I also don't see the situation resolved. Is there any more effective way to get out point across to him?

What made me write this post was a conversation   I had with him today. I teach at a music camp, and my brother goes there for lessons. I was teaching him with another counselor and student in the room, and he was acting up more than usual (playing random noises, not paying attention, calling other counselor names). When I spoke to him afterwards about it he said he was  getting distracted by the other people. I was getting hints of it before, and looking back on it now I definetly should have moved him to a different room for a 1 on 1. But that wasn't the main point. I told him he should behave because he was embarrassing myself and him. That ticked him off, and says that I don't care about him, and I only care about his and my reputation. I tried explaining that I and the rest of the family do care for him, however he refuses to believe me. He's said this before a couple times, however it always ends with me saying ""we do"" and that's it. What bothers me is that I do believe our family does a lot to care for him. I play with him every other day, and we always try to give him attention. I'm wondering if he gets this idea because he is always blamed for arguments between him and 10yr. Most of the times it is his fault, but we make the point that 12yr could have handled it better as well. When we come up with an acitivity that we want to do for the day (whether it be bowling, hiking, etc.), he gets upset, so when we ask him what he wants to do its always ""I know you guys don't want to do it"" and it usually ends there. 

I'm lost. We've been going to therapists for over a year, and nothing has changed. My mom has gotten very upset because she feels responsible for his actions (me and my brother never had these issues growing up). She just wants someone to tell her there was nothing she could do to prevent 10yr actions. 12yr doesn't feel too happy either because he always gets bothered by 10yr. My main questions were how do we convey the fact that we really do care about 10yr, since whenever we try to help him he refuses it. How do we stop him from bothering 12yr so often? I understand brothers fight, but the amount they do I'm sure isn't healthy. How can we get him to stop caring about what others do as well?",08Jul2019,1
689,"Some back story. I went to college out of high school for Pre-vet. After a little bit I decided and discovered a few things about myself, but the biggest thing being I seriously suck at science. So that being said I decided a medical field may not be the best fit for me. So I jumped around a lot trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I thought maybe I’d do architecture, but I wouldn’t consider myself a super creative or techy person. 

After my first semester I decided I was going to take a break from school to think about what I wanted to do. I was considering Natural Resources Management, but again, I suck at science. But I know I have to get some type of degree because my parents think I won’t amount to anything if I don’t have a degree. 

So I am currently enrolled to major in Spanish with a Business minor, because I figure if anything I can use Spanish in some way. The issue comes in because when I originally left college, I wanted to become a licensed real estate agent. I still want to do that, it’s just about the only thing I really want to do, but my family thinks if I do that, I won’t be successful enough, and I know they’ll be disappointed. 

I don’t want to pay 80,000 dollars to get a degree I’m not going to use, when the thing I actually want to do costs about 500 bucks. 
My mom doesn’t know I’m enrolled for Spanish, because I’ve changed my mind so much and every time I tell her I’ve changed it she yells at me. (I live with my mom) I don’t know how to tell her I don’t think the college route is necessary for me, I’m so worried she’ll yell at me and tell me I need to get a degree.

Now in my mid-20s, I almost wish I did go through that phase because I don’t feel like I’ve really lived...not that I’m about to turn to drugs, but I’m starting to understand why people may do them in the first place. 

On top of that, I  feel stuck in my job and hate the monotony of a 9-5....in the past year, my anxiety about work has just gotten increasingly worse to the point where there’s a knot in my stomach and lump in my throat just thinking about it.  I feel like I’m wasting my time and don’t get to truly live. (Although yes, I know that jobs are a necessary evil)

Overall, I just don’t see any way out of this extreme boredom, and it’s starting to take a toll on my mental health (embarrassingly, I’m actually crying while writing this because I can barely take it anymore). I feel like I need to pack up and move across the country or something, but I don’t have the money to do so at this point —though I’m trying to save up for a move eventually. 

I don’t know what to do, I’ve taken classes that interest me and spend time with friends, but that isn’t enough. I need to make some sort of major change soon though, because I’m reaching my breaking point.

Here are the facts:
 I've never had a girlfriend or even kissed a girl to be completely honest with you so I don't know at all what I'm doing, I wish I did that when I was younger just so I don't make a fool out of myself. 

My school's weird, there isn't many people, most of which are socially awkward or annoying so I don't have many friends to choose from. 

My school doesn't support sports which I'd love to do, but since i haven't had the incentive I'm not really good at them.

I'm just about to take my drivers test in a few days.

I used to be really awkward and dorky but I've gotten much more confident and talkative after sophomore year, I've even changed a lot since the end of junior year.

I don't have many hobbies, or even an idea of what I want to do with my life. I make youtube videos and that's been fun but other than that I haven't really tried anything.

To elaborate, all of my childhood consisted of verbal/emotional abuse and as I got older to my current age, it has pretty much subsided. 

However, there have been a couple major issues that gave me really bad flashbacks which led to anxiety attacks and uncontrollable crying within the last four years - one of them occurring just last night. 

I have noticed that yelling or door slamming are things that make me get shaky, withdrawn and angry to the point where my heart beats really fast sometimes with an adrenaline kick and I near the point of fly or fight mode. And if it gets too bad for me to handle, I just completely shut down and cry for hours or get violent (I’ve never hit anyone though). 

I never really knew what to call it, I just thought it was me being sensitive but a friend is concerned I may have post-traumatic stress related issues and after last night, I am considering it. I was uncontrollably crying for about 5-6 hours and was shaky for maybe an hour or so because it brought me back to those years of hell I endured as a kid. 

I cannot go to my parents and ask for help, because if my suffering isn’t concrete then it isn’t real to them. Even if it was, it wouldn’t matter to them because I don’t work and I am ‘privileged’. My friends are very immature and are bad at helping when it comes to things like this and I don’t even want to talk to anyone about it.

This being said, this was my first real long lasting relationship. It was the first time I was with someone I could start to envision a future with. Months into the relationship, we've been doing extremely well, with no significant friction or arguments on record. Seemingly out of nowhere, I noticed a change in tone in the way she talked to me over the phone, though the way she acted in person didn't change. This went on for about a week.

I knew something was up, and we arranged a time to sit down and talk. I told her how my feelings had only grown, but she said the whole relationship status thing was causing her stress. She said she felt bad she couldn't keep up with how much I was putting into the relationship. (This never bothered me, and I told her that)

She assured me that she still wanted me in her life, and was still attracted to me romantically, but was now struggling with the commitment of a defined relationship. This reasoning was confusing and left me unsatisfied, and without any real feedback or solid reason in my mind where I went wrong.

I can't focus at work, I've been struggling to sleep, I have no desire to eat, and feel constant emotional distress, exponentially more powerful when I'm left alone.

She still wants to see me occasionally as friends, but I haven't yet as this hurts me way too much. She says if she ever feels ready for a relationship again and I'm single she'd come back. I'm scared of giving an ultimatum, as losing her permanently doesn't sound great either.

702," 

So, once the summer ends I’ll be starting my senior year of high school, which means making last second decisions on what I want to do with my life and where I want to go to college. So far, the general consensus (at least on my parents’ end) is that I’ll attend a state university that’s pretty easy to get into and live at home for four years. The tuition is pretty good too (at least as good as you get in the USA), so that means as long as everything went well with classes, I could leave college with little to no student debt. 

The main reason my parents want me to stay at home is because of my ADD. My dad and my mother’s brother both have ADD as well, and both of them went off to college to live by themselves, and both of them dropped out because, despite being pretty smart people, they couldn’t manage the responsibilities of living on their own. Luckily, both of them managed to land good, stable jobs. Unfortunately, I don’t think that would be possible without a college degree nowadays. And because of that, my parents don’t want to risk the same thing happening to me, because on top of horrendous college debt, it would be hard for me to find employment. 

But I guess what kinda bums me out is that is the plan for my sister (who’s just entering high school) is totally different, my parents think she’ll stay in state, but go to a different, a little more exclusive, university and stay on campus all four years there. And while I know I’m not super smart, I do know that my grades and test scores would be enough to get me in to the same university. It’s a bigger name than the school that I’m probably going to end up at, but both universities have almost the same requirements grade and test wise to get in. The tuition difference is not so similar though, with yearly tuition at the more exclusive school being almost three times that of the less exclusive one. 

And let me just say, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the less exclusive college. Honestly, I’d probably be getting the same quality of education from either school. And I’m very grateful for the financial support my parents have been able to provide me, and my thought is that because my parents only have enough money saved up to pay off the tuition debt from the smaller school (they haven’t been specifically saving based on the tuition from that school, that’s just how much they managed to accumulate), I would pay the remainder of the debt overtime (which is the plan for my sister, as she has about the same saved up as me). 

What I’m trying to say is I really want to go live on my own for college to get that experience of living in a dorm, being independent for the first time, etc. But with my ADD, I don’t know if it’s worth risking the same thing that happened to my dad and my uncle AND dealing with shitty student debt on top of that, if I have the option to live at home for college and not deal with very much debt.",08Jul2019,1

I’m not judging the USA and there culture, I understand that it’s part of there history and in there constitution and that it is a country that fights for freedom, that sends there men to die to fight against the evil of communism and facism, 
I respect all of that but I can’t deny how I feel and I don’t have anyone to speak to about it.

How can I alleviate my fears? I don’t want to bother my wife with this, she works hard and is dealing with this new job and moving and starting anew, she loved in Kansas for 20 years many years ago and by all accounts enjoyed it. I really just don’t want to bother her with my worries when I could ask some internet strangers who could help me.

I feel like I have two options, I can either 

1- ‘get strapped up’ and just go with the culture, I can do that even though I wouldn’t want too, I could sign up to a gun range and work on my grouping and magazine change and prepare myself for any close quarter combat that may happen, because it could since everyone is armed and we’re only humans and we do crazy things sometimes. I wouldn’t tell my wife about any of my fears and just pass it off as a lad who remembers his army training and knows how to hand a weapon, I would have to play a little blasé and gung-ho to pull this off but I can do that.

2- I bring my fears with me, I don’t engage with the firearms culture and if asked I would express my dislike for it, if I had an opportunity to vote against it I would and admit to it to our friends, I would also tell my wife. 

I feel like option two has just so many risks attached to it, I risk worrying my wife when she already had enough to worry about, I risk alienating myself in my new home by being a ‘foreigner’ plodding over with his ‘ideal views’ and judgments. And worst of all my biggest fear, is that I would risk leaving myself and my wife vulnerable at risk of being attacked by someone with a firearm and there would be nothing I could do: because I know what real life is, I know what firearms do to a human body, I know how precious life is, I know how dangerous they are, and I love a good Bruce Willis film as much as the next man, but that’s just a film and we are in real life and real life is very fragile.

I’m not a vegan, I don’t hug trees on weekends, I don’t support Donald Trump or the Brexit movement here in the UK, I’m just a regular guy whose a bit scared and needs a little help.

708,"No idea where to turn or what direction to go in at this point, wanted to see if there was the potential for a way out. I (26M) have made so many mistakes and poor decisions up until this point. I feel like I've learned but I'm wondering if it's too late to make everything right. 

Setbacks:
1. Exited the hospital after surgery for a collapsed lung. (4th time, nearly died from surgery)
2. Helped my Ex through school but she left me the day before she graduated than moved back home.
3. Health problems caused me to drop out of college for a 3rd time. Getting admitted now is almost impossible.

I won't sit here and make excuses about school or work, I know I could have applied myself more. My health has been holding me back a bit but that still isn't enough to keep me from total success. I want to attend school but I don't have the options financially. My parents have been helping me out a great deal, they have been phenomenal with my problems. 

I just want to stop being a burden and help them as well. I just want to know, what steps should I take to get a life? I'm 26 and haven't accomplished anything, I'm tired of being a disappointment. I'll do anything for another chance of getting my psychology degree or law degree so I can move forward with more schooling, our family has never had a doctor before. I want to be the first.

Sorry if the story was vague or boring, I just want to know where I should go from here.",08Jul2019,1

I have a healthy social life, and a girlfriend. My grades have been consistently 75-80. I balance soccer, my friends, and school and still have extra time to myself.

I have always had parental controls on all my devices (computer, laptop, tablet, phone) ever since I got them. My dad said he would remove them when I turned 18. I always use my phone in bed to talk to my friends, watch netflix, etc. My dad has caught me at least 4 or 5 times. He recently made me put my phone in my parents room every night before bed. Because of this, I found an old phone in my basement and used that every night. He found that phone too, and got EXTREMELY upset. He said he would never be able to trust me again, and just grounded me for a month or two (my entire summer break). He even hinted at the fact he might stop supporting me in my journey to go pro.

I just finished up an argument with my dad about how I don't want to stay at his apartment where he works (this apartment is temporary, designed for 1 person to live in and is 500 km away from where our ""main home"" is) for the rest of the summer. I offered a compromise, thanks to reddit and stayed with him for 10 days and said that I would go back home and keep track of what's going on in the ""main home"". I'd keep my step-mom company, as she is taking care of 5 kids under the age of 10 and could also use some help.

Now... I love being alone. Don't get me wrong, I do have friends and my social life is sorta good... I just enjoy being alone. Going for walks/runs, the gym, the movies, studies. I love doing it all alone.

I was excited to do a lot of alone stuff this summer and I made a plan. The gym 3 days a week, run 2 days a week and read up on some things whenever I could. I also applied for some summer jobs but they all turned me down, which I am not upset about btw, as I came to a conclusion that I'd rather relax this summer.

I have an okay+ relationship with my parents and me preferring to be alone makes them think I don't love them sometimes. I turn down doing stuff with my family quite often but I still love them more than anything. 

I am done with the 10 days I spent with my dad and brother upstate. I was headed home and told my mom that I'd stop by her place in a few days. 

The few days had passed and I went to see a movie with a friend (rare occurence lol and Spider-Man Far From Home is my new favorite movie).

I'm really going off-topic now sorry....

What I'm getting at here is...

My mom wants me and my brother to stay at her place for the next 3 weeks, limiting what I can do alone, completely counteracting my plans and planning stuff without giving room for me to potentially say no thanks (it's not like I *have* to go along with everything my parents plan. I have done enough of that throughout my life).

**How do I tell my mom that I would prefer to stay at my dad's place, with my step-mom as dad is working upstate and have some alone time?**

I will of course come by and spend a few nights with her, help her with groceries and such.

716,"First things first let me tell exactly what happened. 

Today when I returned from the gym my father asked me to come and talk to him, he was drunk and concerned that I keep talking on the phone late at nights and that I haven't had a girlfriend in a while, he basically believes that I am gay and he is homophobic(not sure if this term holds in us but it is used in Europe to describe someone basically hating on the lgbtq+ community). 

Context on my father, he is an alcoholic for about 10 years, he used to be agresive towards me for my entire childhood both physically and verbally and he still to this day retain this aproach with my mom.

I tried to explain that it is not his business who I talk to since I am 21 already and that he is acting just illogically, he started screaming and throwing stuff left and right and from there I just snapped and told him that he is a drunk, an alcoholic  and I am going to call the police if he starts getting physical and hitting me or my mother. He kept screaming and just went to his room and kept arguing with the walls for an hour or so. 

He seemed to be calm now but I've had enough, every time I come home from university something like this happens and it's just super toxic for me. I can't be myself home, I am afraid to bring someone home because he might act like a total jerk toward friends. I just want to be at peace. 
Being home just brings up huge anxiety waves and I feel like I am hopeless around him. 

I have thought about moving with my grandmother until I get a job and start earning money to save for rent or necessities. I have also a scholarship from which I saved some, it's not a lot but enough to have my dorm rent paid for an year.

The next couple of days were a bit awkward but still a bit flirty, and (after a few glasses of vino) I texted him and basically proposed a friends with benefits situation. I’ve not long got out of a relationship (which he knows) and I just want a bit of fun, nothing serious. I basically handed it to him on a plate. 

He responded by saying he was seeing someone long distance and he wasn’t sure where it was going, and if it wasn’t for this other girl then it would be a different answer. I thought it was a bit of an odd reply really. 

Since then I’ve tried dressing provocatively to get his attention, smiling at him and making eye contact, wearing the same dress from the night to jog his memory, and I can see him looking and taking an interest but there hasn’t been that flirtiness or any reciprocation.

719," My boyfriend and I found this awesome two bedroom apartment in our hometown really close to both of our family this past May of 2019. We make good money, but needed just a bit more income in order to get approved. So, we decided to invite another couple to move in with us.. which happened to be close friends with my boyfriend. We were really good at talking about everyone's boundaries before we moved in together.. but did not even come to my mind that my roommate could get herself knocked up. (thought she was on birth control, but actively stopped taking it months ago which i just found out along with the pregnancy) Everything was going great... until we found out just last week she is 2 months pregnant, and plans to keep the baby. (We are only 19) Our lease is not up until May 2020, So that would mean around 3 months living with a newborn. My boyfriend and I REFUSE to live with a baby that is not ours considering if we wanted to live with a baby we would have one, and I am also currently in college studying for a competitive, and challenging program that will require my full attention, and the thought of also listening to a crying, or upset baby makes me cringe. Since all of us are on the lease we can not technically kick them out. At first my boyfriend and I were going to move out (but the roommate who is pregnant will not let us leave without paying the rest of the lease which will be around 1,500) I get they are in their right to do this, but I feel it is really unfair to us considering we would have to leave early and find another place sooner then we expected AND be out 1,500 just because they decided (even though they live with other people) that they want to start a family. As our other alternative would be to stay and live with them and the baby which is very upsetting to us, and would not fit with our crazy lifestyle. We have decided to counter back with 2 options that we believe would work for parties. 1) My boyfriend and I take over the lease, and they can leave without paying us anything as long as they are out before the baby is born 2) We leave, but they take the lease over and we do not pay them the remainder of the rent so that we would be able to have enough funds to find a decent place in the time span we have. (or else we r literally going to be living with my parents) I feel like though it will be a big problem considering they don't want to leave.. and won't let us leave without paying them 1,500..

723,"Title pretty much sums it up. I've been at my new job for a few months now. This job and company were a goal for me and were what inspired me to stop working a dead end job and really try to build a career for myself. I had to take out of pocket classes to even be able to apply.

I am thrilled to be apart of this company, however I feel like I am really struggling with almost every aspect of it. 

-communication- instead of in person, everything is through email or a messaging service. I'm fine on the messaging service but really struggle with the emails. I take so long to write them and I'm not used to the professional lingo, (like when someone says something snooty but its professional and is only snooty if you read between the lines)

-coworkers- out of 250+ members I know maybe a dozen. And most of our interaction is very brief. I dont know who I'm talking to through email 99% of the time. 

-the way I do my job- to compare the change it's like if I was a salesman at a dealership, and now this new job has me traveling to private airshow selling private jets. The freedom is ridiculous, I'm not used to having so much freedom and frequently question myself if whatever I'm doing is allowed. ( I'll ask myself, do I need to clock out to stop at a gas station to use the restroom?) Usually I just ask myself if I could you justify this to my boss if they asked? And the answer is typically yes. But it doesnt illiminate the worry. 

-everything is behind the scenes- I have no idea what could be being said about me or my performance or even who could be saying it. The complaints I've gotten weren't told to me directly. It wasnt like my boss called me directly and said ""this complaint was made, tell me your side"" instead a coworker who is a step above me but still a coworker casually mentions it in conversation. Since I dont see coworkers I have no idea if anyone else has similar issues or how they handle it. 

-interactions with people- with a similar comparison. I used to only interact with my coworkers and the people I was helping. Now I interact with everyone I see throughout the day. It's not that big of a deal, but I'm no social butterfly and have trouble with how I handle myself. Recently I had a woman (I dont work for, but my company comes into her buisiness) ask me why I didnt do something trivial. I explained simply that I didnt have time, then she asked why, and it was an awkward explanation of I have other work to do and could only stay for this length of time, followed by well I'll just call your company and request that you stay longer. With me trying to explain that it doesnt work like that and her asking ""what her staff can do to support me, so that this gets done"" after almost ten minutes of this back and forth, I asked if her staff would be able to handle the task. I could tell she did not like that answer and I'm fully expecting a complaint. However I'm pretty sure that my boss would agree with me. 

Which brings me to a new problem. 

My 90 day review is coming up. I dont think I've ever had a company do a 90day and I'm a bit worried I may be fired. I know for a fact that my work itself is top notch. But I've recieved several small complaints and some that were so generalized that no one could even point a finger at me specifically (just wanted to complain). Also recently I made a complaint about on of the businesses that I go to. I followed my chain of command for the complaint and it blew up. Huge. Like 20 people are now on this email that I sent to one person. And it's become way bigger than I expected and I'm really worried that i may be labeled as a trouble maker. But what was happeneing was incredibly unethical and immoral and the complaint needed to be made. Unfortunately someone i work with got called into it and essentially called out, and now I'm being called out because the buisiness that I complained about was the same buisiness that made the very generalized complaint. 

I have had minor disagreements with a coworker that were handled (sort of) through email. A coworker sent several snooty emails complaining about several things that were super small and really stupid and after her doing it a couple of times I had someone with a lot of professional email experience sit down with me and help me write a response that likely wasnt taken well by my coworker but was very professional and to the point. (It essentially said no one is complaining but you, and the points you are making can easily be argued, this is petty) 

I just feel so discouraged. And not having any coworkers around to talk to makes it harder. I feel like if I saw coworkers more it would greatly help with almost all of my problems. But that's not an option. 

I have bad days and I just try to remind myself that this is what I wanted, and that it just takes time to get used to a job. But the thought of quitting still comes to mind. Its like a give up quit. Not I hate the job quit. 

I've never taken this long to adjust to a job. Usually within a month I know exactly what's going on and how to handle it and what to do. At three months I'm still lost and worried.

On top of all of this, I'm still recovering from depression after some major life events, and I see the depression peaking its head out through my day to day, and it of course effects who I am and how I act. As well I'm right in the midst of summer break from reentering college as an adult and I worry that I bit too much off. It's only going to get harder from here and I need to get a grip on everything before it gets harder. 

I just feel so overwhelmed.
I could really use some advice.

724,"I found out about three ago that my wife cheated on me when we were dating in a long distance relationship. When I found out we were already married a few months but, had I known when we were dating I would have broken up with her on the spot. I'm not religious or anything but, cheating would be as close to a ""sin"" as I could think. It had always been one of my core beliefs that it was wrong in any circumstance. However, marriage is for life and you don't go into marriage with the option to divorce if shit doesn't work out.

I actually found out when she was inpatient on a psych ward for PTSD following a sexual trauma . The guy that raped her was the guy she cheated on me with. I didn't get a chance to really ""address"" the cheating because I was being a supportive husband about the sexual trauma. I don't know how long the relationship was or how many times they had sex or if they were dating at the same time we were. And now I'm frustrated that I don't have these answers to these questions and other questions.

Now we married, have a kid together and have a GREAT life. However, things like songs about cheating or tv shows and movies about cheating make me feel uncomfortable especially if she is there. This all came up because I mentioned something about her history of cheating when some guy from HS messaged her on FB messenger (self disclosed by her because I'm on contract in another country for 6 months) and so she deleted all of her social media to demonstrate her commitment.

I'm torn and confused. One, because I have worked with sexual assault victims as a victims advocate and I know that there was ABSOLUTELY NO situation where it was right for her to go through what she did. Two, I remember when she told me about some random guy (rapist) hitting on her. After she told me about the interaction I told her to block him because she gave him her social media info because she thought ""he just wanted to be friends. I honestly feel that she thought that was true. I knew from the jump he was trying to get with her. Three, the fact that the time window might have called into question whether my son was mine (he is).

I work in healthcare with a background in mental health so for me I have just been combatting these thoughts with focusing on what I have now and how great it is (which it truly is; we are going to have a great life. But the issue lies in the fact that about a year ago I brought it up, she cried, I felt bad, and so I said I was over it when I wasn't.Â 

Now she says I need to just get over or talk to someone because she doesn’t want to talk about it and keep bringing up the past. She doesn't want to talk about it because she feels like I'm going to attack her verbally and put her on trial (which I kinda want to about the cheating). But for her I don't think she wants to re-live the ""relationship”because it might mean answering question about the cheating but it also means reliving the trauma (which she wrote out a detailed description about the rape so I know about it).

I suggested marriage counseling but, she doesn't want anyone to know. hence the throw away account. I don't feel like ""I got closure"" (which makes me sound like a dick). What should I do?

725,"I am getting the run-around from Planet Fitness while attempting to cancel my membership. First it was I could cancel at any time with a phone call. That tuned out not to be the case.

726," My fiancé got super drunk last night. Him and his brother were talking/arguing over a fight they had a few years ago. He was very drunk, crying, so I said it was time to go home. When we reached our home I insisted I will take our baby daughter out of the car as he could barely walk anymore, with me pushing him out of the way. He slapped me lightly which angered me. When we got inside the house our dog made a mess everywhere. He started cleaning it but I insisted I take over because he had stepped on it, all over his feet. He immediately said “let me do it or ill hit you” me being angry and annoyed about him being stupidly drunk, i said “do it!” Then so he did. He slapped me hard in the face. Then I grabbed my daughter and went to the bedroom. He came in and I begged him to sleep downstairs because he might trample our 9 month old daughter and he punched my bottom really hard that I cried in pain. I tried to leave the house, I really wanted to leave but my daughter was crying so hard from exhaustion as it was already 1am. So we ended up sleeping in the cold basement. 

In the beginning of the relationship, I would say I was the abusive one because I would always argue with him going out with his friends. I was a teenager and he was my first real boyfriend. I would hit him when I’m angry which I know, was never okay. However, I only hit him out of frustration. Also I didn’t think I could inflict pain as I am only 4’11 and he is 6’4. But my point was, I hit him before and now it’s karma for me?

We always argue about the stupidest things. And I know that we don’t get along because we are always having little arguments everyday. When he gets drunk, which is like every week. Most times he just passes out. But sometimes, he could get violent and start calling me names or grabbing me by my shirt. 

We’ve been together for 11 years. Since we were 16 years old. We are getting married next month, big wedding and very expensive! I dont know what to do. He is a very loving when sober and a very good father to our daughter. He just txted me saying he didnt know what he did last night and that if I could forgive him. It was the first time that I was scared of him and I was so scared of him he might accidentally hit our daughter.",08Jul2019,4

She is what I and many other would call thick. She is by no stretch of the word fat. Over the last year or so I have found myself less and less attracted to her physically. She is still beautiful and hasn’t gained weight or anything but I find myself wanting someone with a flat stomach and a hard body. I feel like the worst boyfriend ever for even typing this on my laptop. I have become ungrateful and I’m hating myself for it. I live on a college campus and I see all these women I’d rather be having sex with than my own. I hate myself for it. I want my girlfriend to lose weight. What do I do? Do I keep all this inside my head and deal with it? Do I break up with her and let her find someone more grateful than me? Do I suggest we become a lot healthier? Just kind lost, feeling like an ungrateful pig.",08Jul2019,0
728,"Hello everyone, much thanks for checking out my question. For you to understand my dilemma, you'll need a lot of context. I've never been so self-conscious of my body until this year, my last year of high school. I never cared for how I looked until now. I'm an 18M American who has not been so blessed in terms of physical features. I'm currently 5'7 and 200 pounds. It's obvious that I'm overweight, but I'm still on a weight loss regiment(lost over 40 already over the course of 3-4 months). I know that being 5'7 isn't that short, especially considering Indian men don't grow too tall, but it's definitely a problem in the US where the average is 5'9. I feel like a midget at my gym where many men and women tower over me. However, I don't feel like this at Indian functions where I'm usually taller than 70% of men. So, you're wondering what the hell is the problem then? Well, my dad is the complete opposite. He's 6'2, 250 lbs, Size 12 Shoes, huge hands, deep voice, etc. Meanwhile, I wear a Size 10 Shoe, small hands and kind of a high pitch voice. I just don't understand how he's my father. How did I end up with the physical traits of my 5'2 mother? I mean, people literally say that my face looks exactly like my mom! I understand that I'm much shorter because of my mom, but I think I should be at least 5'10. For context, my mother's side isn't that tall, except for my maternal grandfather that was well over 6 foot. My maternal uncles and cousins are all below 5'10. On the other side, my paternal uncle(over 6ft) and cousins are quite tall. Whenever I bring up my fears to my dad, he reminds me that men grow until 25 and that he was only 5'9 when he finished high school(not sure if he remembered that correctly). Is there a chance that I could grow at least a few more inches and maybe grow larger hands and feet? If not, how do I learn to love my features?

731,"Hey everyone! I hope someone out there can relate. 

If I really think about it, what I truly want to do, more than anything else, is lay down somewhere comfortable, high, just chilling. It's the life force of all my effort. Anytime I build momentum, I'm almost overwhelmed by the feeling to relax, not do anything for days. Complete lethargy, contemplating life in details. I've felt this way for as long as I can remember. 

But there is a clashing that occurs, when my ambition shows up to play. And I tell myself, if I just push through, I'll become fully ambitious, or atleast develop an itch to consistently want to do more. For the past 3 months, I've been working 55-60 hrs a week between my 9-5 and coaching. I go to the gym 4-6 days a week, cook my own food, flip stuff online when I can, try to sharpen my drawing skills overnight. Prior to that I was in school full time and working 30-35 hrs a week, and I still feel lazy. 

Granted theres people out there doing 3 times as much, but that's my point. How do I become that? Which also begs the original question: fight on or just accept who I am?

It seriously set me off and I called him a wife beater, I told him that I don’t associate with people who do that. I told my mother in law that if he doesn’t get help she needs to leave. She wouldn’t call the police but she has organised marriage counselling. I told the father in law that he needs to pick up the phone to the doctors and get help for his anger issues, which he 100% has. My wife has told me plenty of stories of times he would “lose his temper”. It’s just never happened with me on the scene. The thing is that I have completely cut of contact between him and my four year old daughter.

i skate mongo, which if you don’t know it’s basically goofy-footed and it’s the wrong way — but that’s not entirely my fault. when i was little, i could skate the right way, but my brother skated mongo and was upset that i learned so quickly, so he told me to skate mongo and i always thought that was the right way. my friends always sorta poke fun at me because i do. so up until this point i’ve completely stopped skateboarding, but some is from depression and lack of motivation — which is my fault.

anyway, i somehow built up the courage to go to the park today, and i made sure i woke up early so i could be the only one there for a while. but i was too late. 

i get there and there are about seven-ish people there. and i’m like o shit. 

i was about to start but a kid came up to me, looked about my age at least in his teens and asked if i skate much, i said sorta (there aren’t a lot of parks near where i normally live. my parents are separated so i spend 6 weeks with my dad in a different state) and he said okay and rode off. as soon as he left my hands started shaking so bad and i felt like my heart was gonna rip out of my chest.

i’m confident in myself as a person, i like the way i am. but it’s so difficult and scary to go up in front of people and do what you do. it’s also so scary when someone talks to me that i don’t know, and there’s always a stranger who will try and help, but i can’t help but feel like they’re mocking me and i get so tensed up. it’s like going and singing in front of an auditorium full of people, for me at least. 

i eventually just left after a couple of minutes because i couldn’t bring myself to do anything and i was just so upset. i tried to listen to music to calm down, but it didn’t work.

747,"Should I message an ex, who I still love, but who still needs to find his own self confidence?

My boyfriend and I broke up about 4 weeks ago. It was the third time we broke up in a year (although the first time it has lasted more than a day). The first time because he called me a slut and untrustworthy as he found out how many people I had slept with before we had met. The second time was because I had been out with my two girlfriends for the first time in a year, and he accused me of sleeping with someone else and wanted constant messages to know what I was doing. The third time was because he was starting to irrationally angry and was scaring me. 

The third breakup has been bad as we were alone in another country and he threatened to kill himself. He then attempted suicide and I handled it completely wrong and called his sister who flew over, even though he had specifically said not to call her. I just was not able or good enough to handle it on my own. 

I had wanted some time to think, but he continued to message me even though I had asked for space. By that time we had both run out of money, and after a week of being split I decided I wanted to go home as I was overwhelmed and lonely. His sister wanted him to come to where she lived, (in another country aswell so he would still have been traveling), but he wanted to stay in the original country. 

I haven't wanted to block him as I read that if someone was holding a gun to their head you should stay around until they are over you. He is in a bad place mentally and I wanted to be there for him, but I have let him down again and couldn't offer him the support he needed. I have now completely blocked him after he sent me photos of the girls he has slept with since we met, their underwear, and the sext messages they had sent each other. 

The thing is I miss him terribly. He was a good person, he just had an incredibly low self image and no respect for himself. He didn't see what a funny, clever, attractive person he was, and refused to see it. He thinks we broke up because his dick was too small. (Which it absolutely was not!!) I didn't have the self confidence to bolster his self esteem, and I let him down. I just want to be able to be his support though. 

I want to message him, as I never really thought we would never see each other again. I still want to be with him, I'm just worried that I'm not going to be good enough.

Is there something I can do or say to start smoothing things over, and so we can get back to being friends again? And hopefully in the future when we are both in a good place get back together? Or is that an incredibly selfish thing to do and should I just leave him to heal?",08Jul2019,2

I am a 18 year old dude about to go off to college. I have my whole life ahead of me, a bright future. The only problem is, everyone seems to be excited about it except me. I don’t know what to say or do, I just tell everyone I would like to enjoy my last summer as a kid and spend it as a kid. My mom tries to talk to me about college all the time but I never want to, and I think it really destroys her and she thinks I don’t want to go. I don’t feel anything about going, I’m not anxious, I’m not excited. It’s indifference. Just another part of life many people go through. 

Then I realized, I don’t feel motivated to do anything other than lazily play video games. I hang out with the few friends I have right now (I left fake friendships at high school) sometimes, but not too often. I used to really enjoy film and filmmaking, but I lost interest and motivation even though I wanted it to become my career some day. I don’t have really any hobbies, (I just bought a bass guitar and started to play so I have that). I just sit around and stare off into space. I lack motivation to do things I want to do, such as exercising and reading. 

I feel really lost because I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to. My mom gets really defensive and I don’t feel comfortable talking to her and I don’t feel comfortable enough to talk to my dad. I don’t want to burden my friends with my problems and my siblings are way too young to talk too. 

I am at a really exciting point in my life and I feel nothing. How can I rekindle excitement and find my path?

756,"I'm currently at a community college and on probation/dismissal for the third time here, and it's been a rocky road for the past couple years for me. When I came to this CC I was an Honors engineering student involved in top research at a major university, but my abusive parents convinced me to come back, go to CC, and apply to an in-state school, so I did because I love them and I was dumb. However, being here living with them has been a hellish experience, and I've spiraled into depression with substandard grades which have landed me in my current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

The last email I got from the community college was before last semester and essentially said that they'd let me try one more time, but only because a counselor there vouched for me. I failed again, and now am in the midst of retrying, but honestly it doesn't look good. My parents are about ready to wash their hands of me and kick me out, so I've been looking at other community colleges away from home, but each of them seems to have the same policy about accepting students on probation/dismissal from other schools (that they don't). 

&amp;#x200B;

So now my options seem grim, and I'm not really sure what the next step is. I'm meeting with school counselors this week at the local CC to see what my options are, but I guess I'm looking for any other advice from folks on here that are willing to pitch in some ideas, since I'm kinda just a number there. If I leave the area and get away from my parents, I guess I'll never be allowed back at a college again because I can never get off dismissal from my CC, but if I stay in this area (which I really can't afford to do) I'd have to work full time to even scrape by, leaving my insufficient time to actually renew my GPA...

761,"First, I can't even believe that I am creating this post, and I can't believe that I am feeling this hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

I am getting married next summer, and of course we are so excited! Within a month or so of being engaged, we've booked our venue, set a date, taken our engagement pics, booked a photographer and I said yes to my dress. I'm the oldest sibling in my family, with one younger brother (who is getting married next month).

My parents have graciously decided to give us some money for our wedding, which they have done for my brother as well. For a little context, we are a super tight-knit family, my parents, little brother and I are all practically best friends and it's always been that way. We're really lucky as conflict doesn't arise often between us, and I feel like as my brother and I become adults we just get closer to our parents.  We tell each other everything, love spending time together, support each other through everything, all of it. 

I went dress shopping twice before deciding on my dress. The first time I went, I took my mom (just us two) and it was great, though I didn't find the one that time. We arranged to go to some different shops later on, but I also decided to take my future mother in-law to the same shop I went to with mom just a week or so after going for the first time (I'm really close to my MIL, and she has only boys so I thought it would be fun to include her in some of the girly stuff). It was just my MIL and me, and it was so fun, and though I was 100% not expecting to that day, I found my dress. I called my mom, knowing I had to tell her, knowing she would probably be a little sad she wasn't there but knowing she would be excited for me. Right? 

Well, not really. When I called my mom, I told her everything about the dress. It was amazing, and it ended up being a one-of-a-kind sort of thing (the dress was being discontinued, and so this exact one was the last one the shop had, and it was highly sought-after, and deeply discounted, so if I wanted that dress, I had to act fast or risk not getting it) which I also explained to mom. I really thought and honestly expected her to most of all share her excitement with me (because she always has) but she shocked me. After I told her about the dress, she just kind of sounded short and was saying things like ""I'm going to shed tears over the fact I'm not there"" and ""that's great that you think that's your dress, but don't cut yourself short on the experience to shop more"" and ""it's your decision, do what you want."" Just so unlike her, and for the first time in our relationship, she broke my heart.

After hanging up with her, I was pretty shocked, saddened, and embarrassed. I could tell my MIL felt awkward because she was there and not my mom (which I assured her was likely not the reason my mom said that to me, I know that much is for sure). It was horrible. I FaceTimed my mom back as we had talked about during that phone call so she could see the dress ""in person."" She seemed to lighten up a little over the phone that time, but she was still so ""off"" for lack of a better term. 

Of course, it was the dress of my dreams, and I couldn't see myself getting married without it regardless of the conversation I had with my mom, so I bought it that day (my parents offered to buy my dress, and so they were the ones who helped me pay the deposit on it that day). The excitement of the dress kind of shadowed the horrific feeling I had about my mom's reaction for a few days, until it started wearing off, and it absolutely tore me apart. 

I planned to say something to my mom about it the next weekend when I'd see her again, but the opportunity didn't arise because of a bridal shower I was helping to throw for my brother's fiance. Most of the women in my family hadn't seen me since I bought my dress, so of course they wanted to talk about it and see pics and whatnot at this gathering, but I told them I'd show them another time/etc.. Then one of them asked my mom what she thought about it, and she looked at them and said ""... I haven't seen it yet."" Then my aunt seemed a little shocked and was like ""oh, you weren't there?"" and my mom just says ""nope."" 

I'm normally pretty good at holding in my emotions and of course I wanted to explode right then and there but the day was not about me (thank god) so I just pretended not to hear it. So of course when I get home that night to my fiance I just break down. Honestly, I haven't felt this hurt from anyone in my family, ever.

 I've also just noticed in the past few days some differences between the amount of excitement she's had between my brother and I's engagements/wedding planning, and she seems to express more about my brothers (ex. posting about their engagement but not about ours, lighting up more when she talks about their wedding over ours, etc.). I'm not jealous because I am over the moon excited about my brother's wedding, just plain hurt that she isn't acting more supportive/excited as I expected.

I am planning to talk to my mom about this, just not sure if I should wait until I see her in person next (a couple of weeks) or over the phone. I'm at a loss here, I never ever imagined that anything like this would happen, and I'm astonished at how crushed I feel.

Any advice is so appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : My mom and I have always been really close, but she reacted horribly when I found my wedding dress without her there. She made comments about it that hurt me super bad twice now, and I haven't had the chance to talk to her.

I received a full tuition scholarship from the university, as well as a $1000 scholarship from the Fine Arts college and a $2000 scholarship from the state. So, I'm not doing too badly for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

For 5 semesters I was a Fine Arts major. I really enjoyed it but my personality and what I want out of my life as an adult did not align with the career path of this degree. I decided, at first, to add on an A&amp;S degree as a double major to my Fine Arts degree. I realized I would not be able to graduate with both degrees on time. My parents told me to choose one, and I chose A&amp;S and planned to drop my Fine Arts degree to a minor.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not ""technically"" dropped the Fine Arts degree, as I really didn't think much of it. I figured I would drop it at some point in the fall semester and be done with it. However, I was emailed today that I was awarded an additional $1500 scholarship from Fine Arts for this academic year. The stipulation? I must still be enrolled in a Fine Arts degree program. I am taking 3 classes in Fine Arts this fall for my A&amp;S degree (and one for scholarship requirement from the first Fine Arts scholarship), but other than that I have no affiliation with Fine Arts.

  
My question: Would it be unethical to accept the scholarship for the fall semester, then drop the degree in the spring and forfeit the money for that semester? I would receive $750 instead of $1500, but its still $750 I wouldn't have. I don't know whether that is something ""ethical"" of me to do, or if I should just forfeit the scholarship entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Got offered a scholarship for a major I'm about to drop, but haven't yet. Would it be unethical to take part of the scholarship, drop the degree in the spring, and forfeit the rest?",08Jul2019,1
763,"Alright, here's a bit of backstory.

My grandma (my dad's side) has depression (as said in title). 

For a while, she took her antidepressants and was prayed for and supported by the whole family, and we were okay for a while.

But around the end of last year, my grandma stopped taking her antidepressants, and told the family she was even more depressed.

We still supported her then, but noticed she threw out her antidepressants. This is when my mom started picking up BS vibes.

Bit after that, and my grandma told the family that she wasn't getting enough love and attention and was going to be more depressed than ever. Everyone helped her with her depression then, calling her every now and then.

A while after. My grandma is emphasizing her depression, not taking anything perscribed to her, and is calling the family and telling everyone about her depression.

This has been going on for a long time, and I'm afraid she's playing with everyone's emotions to get attention.

Mom is tired of her crap, so am I, but the rest of the family believes it. What do I do, is the depression actually real? What can I do to help everyone else realize how narcissistic she really is, if it isn't?

Please help, I don't know what to do.",08Jul2019,1

766,"Background info, 
These things are for my first relationship I'm currently in my second relationship so I've never had to deal with this problem before. I'm very much over the ex. I've already thrown out 90% of what I had left of him pictures letters romantic things, the things I'm conflicted about are gifts that were given to me for Christmas and my birthday. 

I was going through my closet and making a bag for Goodwill when I found a couple of items that were given to me by my ex-boyfriend. A lot of them I have no problem throwing out but there are few that I'm not so sure about, a t-shirt and a stuffed toy. The problem is I still like these items they don't hold any emotional connection to him, in that they were romantic gifts (they weren't) they're just things that I like that were given to me by someone who is no longer in my life. at the same time I feel weird keeping them just because of who gave them to me. I'm in a new relationship now and I feel like if I wore that t-shirt it would feel wrong. I like the shirt because it's a band that I still like but I feel like I just can't wear it because of where it came from I also don't want it sitting in my closet for the forever. I also don't want to make my current partner uncomfortable if I keep these things. 

Should I just throw everything away even if I still like the items because it's weird to keep things from an ex or keep the ones that I like because they are just things and it doesn't really matter where they came from.",08Jul2019,1

The thing is, I really want to make a good first impression but I wouldn't say I'm good at this. I'm a huge introvert and people from my future class seem very outgoing. I'm just scared no one will give me a chance to open up because it takes a little time for me to do so. Any advice please?",08Jul2019,1
769,"As an adult, just wanted to ask if anyone finds their parents incredibly overbearing sometimes but then you're unsure as to wether you're just exaggerating because they're just trying to give you love? 

For background, I'm 28, one of three kids and my parents divorced 20 years ago. My mom has never remarried and is happily single and just works a lot (she loves her job). We usually don't live in the same city, although we have been this summer. 

My mom is really really nice and giving, she loves buying me food and wants to make sure I'm ok. Sometimes though, I find her to be kind of pushy and maybe controlling and I can't tell if I'm just being being a brat. For example, she sends me messages to make sure that I'm doing ok, she buys me groceries, offers to pay for my yoga classes...but then it extends to her ""suggesting"" to me to do things, like I should do more exercise and that I need to relax and not work all the time, and becomes pushy if I disagree with her advice (perhaps under the assumption that she knows whats best for me). 

When I was about to leave to go overseas a couple months ago, she kept sending me messages asking me if I had found a backpack, if I had booked accommodation, if I had packed, if I went to the doctor, all this stuff that I don't need anyone to check up on me for because I'm an adult and have been independent for 10 years. I don't know how to explain this properly but basically she likes asking me about a bunch of little details in my life and then likes commenting on wether I should do it differently. 

I also find that she really wants me to share things with her and open up to her even if I don't feel like it. We were very close when I was a teenager and I used to tell her everything, but now I keep certain things to myself because I feel like she wouldn't understand and also why would I want to tell her everything? I think she feels that she is privy to all the details in my life because I am her daughter, and this is exactly the attitude that I struggle with. We have discussed this recently and she says that I have this perception of her which isn't true, while I claim that she still sees me as a teenager who isn't capable of doing everything on her own. I swear she still sees me as being an irresponsible and unbalanced 18 year old with mood swings. 

I feel so confined in how she is with me sometimes but I just really don't know if Im making this up, or if this is normal or not. Does anyone else experience this with their parent or mother? It's so fkn frustrating.",08Jul2019,1
770,"I started a new job earlier this year and also began the year with the intention of applying to part-time grad school at night, so I could keep the job. I ended up applying and got a significant scholarship which unfortunately is only offered for full-time day students, but I want to take advantage of it. Therefore I would like to quit my existing job, and will be seeking part-time jobs to supplement while attending school. 

I have always given the standard 2 weeks when quitting a job, and I have a lot of respect for my current employer. It's a small private company with great people. I feel awful quitting but there is no way geographically or logistically I could continue with them while attending the school. I truly feel horrible but unfortunately I need to make the decision that best fits me, I know how selfish this sounds.

How early should I give notice of leaving the position? How should I frame it up (i.e. should I be honest about the details? Should I keep details to a minimum? Any advice on how to quit a job same year I started it)?

771,"There was an end of year drinks thing with the staff and students in our department. Not a lot of people came, probably 2 dozen total. My lecturer and her boyfriend of 8 or 9 years were amongst the people who came with us. There was a talk after that we were all attending so no one actually drank, I think the only people who did stuck to 1/8 vodka or rum and the rest coke, and I saw him with a glass of coke so not sure if he drank alcohol or not, but I kept catching him looking at me and then when I looked back he'd look away.

Me, the lecturer's boyfriend and one other guy on the course were the only smokers in the group. We only had 15 or so minutes before we were meant to head over to the talk so I went out for a cigarette. Lecturer's boyfriend followed me. He asked for a cig and a light so I gave him it.

He started talking to me, asked me about the course, stuff like that. I tried to ask him stuff about himself, small talk asking what he did for a living and how he liked the town the uni is in (they both had to relocate for her to work here). Everything seemed totally normal but then out of nowhere he kissed me and then he actually started touching me, putting his hands on my waist and then my butt and didn't let go until I pushed him away, at which point he went back inside, but not until after he pushed his business card into the pocket on my shirt and winked at me.

IDK why he did any of that. I certainly didn't encourage or ask him to, and I 1000% wasn't flirting because I am a lesbian. I cannot stress enough how small the chances were that I was flirting. I don't hide my sexuality and even mentioned it indoors maybe 10 minutes before this (a different lecturer was trying for small talk so she asked me if I had a boyfriend and I laughed and told her).

My lecturer has been with this guy for 8 or 9 years. There was no CCTV. I am her student for the next 2 years. I have no proof, aside from a text I sent to a friend straight after it happened. Frankly, IDK if it's my place to tell her. I feel like he should be the one to tell her, but I also know that he won't tell her. She deserves better than this guy but I don't want to break up my lecturer's relationship.

I'm her student for 2 more years, regardless of what I do here. IDK either of them very well and I have no idea what the nature of their relationship is. They could have an open relationship or they could have a hall pass or she could be heavily in denial and wanting to pretend it's not happening which means she won't thank me for it.

What do I do? I could really use some advice.",08Jul2019,2
773,"Hey everyone, I am looking to see if I should take action on this certain situation. My ex had posted many fake reviews of themselves ( about 7 ) to get a job promotion. They work at a fast food restaurant. The reviews can be seen online and my ex poses as a costumer in all of them. 

It is obvious reading through them that they were posted by the same person. I can tell easily by the spelling mistakes and the style of writing it is my ex and their name is in all of them. I confronted my ex about this before, but they denied it. They are my ex for a reason because they are very dishonest.

778,"My grandmother got into a retirement home recently and I always had a good relationship with her. She was always there for me and I visited her very often. In the last few months, she got severe dementia and mental health issues. Now she's in a retirement home and overall she's extremely confused. She doesn't realize that she's ill, actually she thinks my parents are taking her hostage or something. She accuses us of a lot of things, like stealing her money, she feels assaulted by the retirement home staff, she gets very aggressive and every time I visit her she basically begs me to take her home with me because she doesn't want to stay at the retirement home.

Right now I'm visiting her twice a week for 45-60 minutes each, but it's so so hard. She's not grateful, she tells me to come more often, sometimes she even talks of killing herself. I'm very sensitive and after visiting her I don't find motivation for doing anything. I basically just curl up in my bed and read something or browse my phone. It's really been dragging me down lately :/
Her behaviour isn't her fault, it's just dementia and the confusion that comes with it. Still, it's super hurtful.

Any tips for handling the situation better? Should I visit her less? I'd probably feel guilty about that. She got major health problems (physical ones as well) and according to the doctors she doesn't have a lot of time anymore. Any tips regarding topics to talk about? When I tell her about my upcoming events, she just says 'Yeah you do that instead of visiting me?' and doesn't really want to hear about my plans.",08Jul2019,1
779,"So basically, I work in a department where it’s just me and two others. We work 12 hour shifts and are confined to a small control room all night. So, suffice it to say, it’s a good idea to keep a positive relationship with said coworkers. 

The coworker in question is relatively new. He’s maybe been hired in for about 3 months and has already missed roughly 3 weeks for reasons I can’t explain. Typically, this would be grounds for termination, however he still works there, so I’m guessing he’s cleared it with HR. 

Almost immediately after his first day, him and I strike up a good conversation about baseball, and just like that, the ice was broken. He then tells me that his son just turned 16 and he let him borrow the car for the night and asks me for a ride home. I oblige, given that his house isn’t too far out of the way for my commute. 

It was my surprise that he asked me again the following night and again the night after that. Our work weeks last 3 1/2 days. Out of those 3 1/2 days, I’d say he’s asking me for a ride 2-3 days a week. Sometimes he drives, others he relies on me. 

Never a mention of gas money, an acknowledgment of me helping him out, an explanation to why he’s in constant need of a ride, or even so much as a thank you. It’s become almost routine. I don’t want to tell him no, because of how closely we have to work together. I don’t want to ask him what the deal is, because I don’t want to put him on the spot and force him to reveal something he doesn’t want to. 

But I’m tired of giving him a free ride home when all I want to after working 12 hours is go straight home and sleep. 


TLDR; My coworker started relying on me for a ride home and I’m getting tired of it.",08Jul2019,2

782,"Posted this on another sub but I just want more advice for this. 

It’s never been extremely difficult for me to talk to girls, however it has been hard for me at times. Recently with girls i’ve just had confidence issues. For example, last night at a party, this girl i had been talking to for a while (important to note I do not see a relationship with her as we are on a trip together with lots of kids my age and we don’t live close to each other in the US) talked for a solid hour and it went really well, then it was time for her to leave when he friends wanted to leave and we said goodbye and it felt like we were on good terms. 

Today she hasn’t really been that responsive at all and when I asked her if she wanted to get coffee today or tomorrow she said she’s super busy this week and his been kind of ignoring me since I asked. I’m just confused as I was under the impression we had a great time last night and when I texted her last night she said she had fun. I definitely could be over thinking it as I tend to do that a lot but i’ve just felt down from that today and this has really messed with my confidence. 

I’m not sure what it is, it could be past relationships with girls that have really fucked me up mentally, or something else. I just need advice on how I can be more confident.",08Jul2019,1
783,"Recently on the forth of july, I was invited to a bbq my family and some other family I didn't know at the time was hosting. I was pretty hesitant to go since I don't really like parties or social events and only attend if I have too; but this time I made the mistake of going and boy do I regret it. It was going good until my mom came up to me to tell me that I should go and talk to my siblings and the other family that was there. Again, I hesitate but I go up to my older brother and talk with him a bit about how my job is going and how his kids are. Then this lady who later on I found out had a daughter my age and single (she actually mentioned that) comes up to me and starts talking to me. She asks me about my job and asks me if I have a girlfriend. I tell her about my job and that I don't have a girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

This is were things start going south for me pretty quickly. She then makes it pretty apparent that her and my mom are trying to set me and her daughter up on a date. I am not ok with this. I pull my mom to the side and ask her what the fuck is wrong with her and why she would embarrass me then she tells me something I think I've always suspected but never really cared to ask. They say that its weird for me to be 23 about to turn 24 and never have had a girlfriend and that she and the rest of our family and friends suspect I might be gay. This normally would not bother me. I never really cared about what others think of me, but I do care what my family thinks of me. I've worked very hard to be someone. I have a really good career and volunteer as a animal rights activist on my spare time. Yes, I am 23 about to turn 24 in next month and I have never had a girlfriend or have had sex. Yes I live alone and I don't have any close personal friends. Yes I don't go out and don't like to socialize; and even thought I love animals I don't have any pets.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since this happened I can't help but think about that shit. For the longest time I've tried my hardest to make my parents proud of me, but it seems that my older brother who in his youth couldn't even manage to stay out of Juvenal hall and is 30 and smokes weed like hes 17 every day and they seem to care more about him then me. All they've ever done is wondered if there is something wrong with me. I make more money as a robotics engineer then my father ever will have being a shitty plumber and my mother does nothing but watch day time tv and drink wine at home. And they are worried about me? I just want to know why this bothers me so much. And for the record; No I am not gay (nothing wrong with being gay) I just am not good with interpersonal relationships and I really don't care for them and rather be alone and focus on my work.

She has been abusive to me, my pets, and my family my entire life and has been a jobless druggie through all of it.
2) What I need advice on: after she got out of jail she kept acting the same and things between her and I got physical, so my mother made her live somewhere else (at the other house my grandma owned when my grandpa was alive, we are not rich, it’s just paid off we only have to pay utility and tax bills on it) my sister invited some of her friends to live there. Let’s call them; Liz, Mary, David, Jill, and Jill’s boyfriend. There is also the mental lunatic Christine one door down in the house over. A few months ago someone keyed and put sugar in Liz’s car, she thinks it was my sister. So she put sugar and pieces of pipe (?) cord all over my sisters house to “make it look like she did it” and called the police. The police said “this is stupid” and went in their way. A few weeks later, every time Liz or Jill cook anything, my sister gets very sleepy, once she “lost three days” to this. Nothing comes up on a toxicology report, so she is released from the hospital. But had a handprint bruise on her arm, the doctor said was weird and recommended her go to a shelter. At one point, She claims that Jill’s boyfriend tried to make her drink a bunch of “tea” which she pretended to drink, then showed her a picture of a girl sleeping, naked, and told her that he “fucks her while she sleeps” then afterwards she calls the police and hides at a hospital again. She noticed after that incident she is now unable to call the police, the 911 number will not go through on her phone. It just gives a “errrgk errrgk errrgk” tone as if the number never existed. She claims. then a week later, she hears the breaker box go off, one by one, for no apparent reason, it’s inside the house, and when I lived there is something was over-doing the breaker -which was common- they would ALL go off at once. She claims they’re recording her or have an app to monitor her on her phones, because Liz got herself and my sister both a phone, and sometimes my sister will see random pictures of her on Liz’s phone, front pictures as if taken from the phone camera. She will also text my mom things via messenger or thru iMessage, things like “hey mom I’m going to the hospital again” and when she looks back at it later it says, “ hey mom do you have any weed i ran out and I’m going back to the hospital” every time she goes to the hospital they drug test her blood. and she is always clean. Someone also drilled a huge screw through her breaker box. I say someone because I think this is all a ploy to come to my house because she expects everyone to live on their hands and knees for her. So now the crazy wench is at my house. And this morning she texts me “are you trying to open the door? If it’s you say so” etc etc because the knob was jiggling. I think she let the one of the cats out and doesn’t want to be blamed. She also let my dog outside with me specifically telling her to not touch a single animal. Then she goes and “plays” with the 4week old kittens. My mom isn’t there because of course she decides to go to her cousins in all of this hell. Leaving me to deal with it.

I live in a small town with my wife who makes pretty good money that I don't technically need to work. But do I currently work as a part-time ($11/hour) ABA line therapist for children with autism for the past 4 months. When I first started my job I was enthusiastic about it especially since I had spent about a year and a half after completing my Masters to finally find a job in the Psychology field. However, I think i have come to the realization that this field is not for me. I'm not sure that I am seeing progress with my clients to the point where the burnout to progress ratio is like 10:1 in favor of burn-out. It's hard work, i get that and i knew it wasn't going to be easy but I think I'm the type of person who has difficulty in keeping objectivity especially working with such clientele and even though I shouldn't I find myself taking things personal that my clients say or do or when they aren't making progress. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically as of right now these are the  2 options that I think i have.

**Option 1 aka my current track**\-- Get my BCBA (Board Certified Behavior Analyst) basically free. My state has a program that will pay for a group of individuals to take the necessary coursework needed. I do have some of the coursework required and would only need 3-4 classes I believe. And the other part of that is the company i work for will allow me to have ""free"" Supervised hours ( need 2,000). However, i will have to give them 2 years of work in return. HOWEVER, the day i started with the company was basically the deadline to submit the application for the free coursework so now i have to wait another 10 months to put in an application. So at this point im basically looking at another 2.5 years before i can get my BCBA. Prospective 55-60k salary. 

PROS - **Free** School, Free Supervised Hours, Free work Experience, 55-60k Job lined up

CONS- Mental Health/Burn Out, Not sure I will be good at it

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 2 aka what i want to do**\-- Go back to school for a computer science/engineering degree. Since I already have a bachelors, majority of my pre-req's should be completed and i could just hop into the program itself  which should only take 2 years. While going to school I can get a job at my wife's company as a year-round intern making an extra $5.00 then I'm making right now. They will also hire me on once my degree is earned for 60k+. However, I haven't done the math completely because I dont know what credits they will accept...but I would be looking at 20-25k to go back to school. Which is too much time and money spent in my wife's eyes especially since I  just spent about 17k 2.5 years ago to get my Masters which hasn't really gotten my anywhere. I love computers, I have built my own and at this point in time would much rather stare at a computer screen for 8-10 hours a day over listening to tantruming kids scream in my ear.

PROS- Paid Internship, 60k+ Job lined up, Passionate about computers, no screaming kids

I can't work, some days I can barely move or manage to wake up. I have 4 siblings, 1 older and 3 younger. My older sibling is 2 years my senior and lives with our parents as well. 2 of my younger siblings (twins) will be in their senior year of highschool this coming year, and the youngest sibling will still be in middle school.

My father was (and still is,) an alcoholic with a possible NPD. My mother was never like that, never abused us, and often stopped my father from doing things that would have hurt me or my siblings [(mostly me, due to being the scapegoat.)](https://www.outofthestorm.website/dysfunctional-family-roles) She did, however, enable him for years, up until the past three. I also have a very unique relationship with my parents to where I'm the only child they'll really listen to and take advice from. The trade-off is taking the abuse. I'm the only one who can handle it so I'm glad it's me, but that's changing.

My father has been about a month sober and he's talking about divorce - great! Their relationship isn't healthy for anyone. The complications lie in the split between us kids. The twins will end up staying with my dad for multiple reasons, my oldest sibling will come with me. My youngest sibling?

I have no idea where they'll go. I was talking with them just last night about it and no matter what they choose, they're going to go through a nightmare. The abuse I've had to handle from my dad is starting to be pushed onto them and we can both see it. My mother also hasn't been great to them and ends up snapping a lot, and I have to step in when I see it happening.

If my sibling chooses to live with my dad, they're going to experience the same kind of abuse I did all throughout their high school. If they choose to live with my mom, they'll be in a state where their sexual abuser is, most likely living close by. I'm conflicted. I realize I have a key role in their ability to survive through high school.

What should I do? No matter what, my heart and home will always be open to them, especially after I move out by myself. I care about them more than anything, but if I stay, my dad won't help me take care of my medical needs and I'll most likely end up dying. If I go, their support system is on the other side of the US.

792,"Ok, quick warning. This whole post is gonna be like something straight outta r/notliketheothergirls, except Im a male. It will make you cringe and roll your eyes. Yes, I am aware of how toxic this all is.

Ok so basically, as shameful as it is to admit, I've had a problem for the past couple of years where I have to be TOTALLY unique. it's mostly to do with music but it's also fashion choices. Lemme give some examples.

So I love hip hop, I think its great. I used to enjoy it even more before it became what everybody listens to. For some reason everybody else liking what I liked felt... weird. Another thing was nirvana. I heard in utero for the first time and oh my god, I loved it more than words could express. But now I was a fan, I started noticing people wearing nirvana tshirts EVERYWHERE. The usual ""I bet shes only heard smells like teen spirit"" mentality kicked in and bang, I couldnt listen to nirvana happily anymore.

So with the fashion stuff...
I used to be, and still am, suuuuuuuuper into fashion. I love it, I don't care if it's expensive, it makes me feel good and helps me express myself. One thing I do which is ""my thing"" is dying my hair a lot. I started noticing a lot of guys on instagram with dyed hair and bang, it felt ruined somehow. Then everybody around me started doing it and idk why but it just pissed me off so much to the point where I stopped doing it.

I just wanna listen to music again without thinking ""yeah, I'm a special snowflake"". I'm aware how utterly dumb and petty this is but thats why I want to change.

Any advice?",08Jul2019,0

So my bf and I moved here after I got a job offer and my friend who works in the same field as me then followed us and moved in with us.

So she basically turned out to not be a nice person at all. She is immature, loud, she constantly made little mean digs at me while living with us, she got weirdly possessive of our neighbours, she would never invite me to things she was doing here, I caught her lying to her family and others about loads of little things. Last straw was her inviting a bunch of people from our work together round and not bothering to even tell me, and when I told her next time a heads up would be good she didn’t see the issue.

It takes me a week to write 5 pages of the comic and when I'm writing I just switch off and start doing something else or go and type the story for another comic repeating the same process. 

So now I have two different stories but I'm still stuck on chapter one in both of them with no sign that I might turn either into a finished product.

There’s this cute patient that I’ve met on a couple occasions in the office, and we’ve gotten along pretty good! We went to the same university, and she seems wicked cool. I’ve had the urge to ask her out, but in my position, you simply can’t do that straight forward. It can possibly open up a can of worms if she takes it the wrong way. 

She has freshly graduated from college, and I threw out the idea that a friend of mine who worked in the field she’s looking into could possibly help her with an email or a person that could possibly get her a job, and I would let her know what he said if I saw her at her next appointment. I figured that it could possibly open a door by that small chance of her giving me her number to let her know what my friend says, but that didn’t happen.

I do IB (International Baccalaureate) and I do not have time for a part-time job. The reason why I mention this is because I need to point out that I cannot support myself financially. If I told my parents that I am an atheist, they would ignore my existence and won't give a damn about my future meaning that they would not pay for my school tuition fees. I know them and I know this will happen. Also another reason on why I cannot get a part-time job is because I am an expat living in a country with a language I cannot speak.

What I’m asking is, is it because of me that he’s losing his erection?

810,"When I applied for this management job, I was told that the company generally doesnt allow people to work from home routinely. 

Now that I've been here a month, I've learned that many people, including my boss and other teams, work from home a few times a month ""as needed."" (E.g., when they have doctor appointments) Other people in the company such as engineers work from home more often than not. 

My employees, however, are expected to come in every day, even when they are just working half days. I cant figure out why because the work they do can absolutely be done from home. 

The second part is that when I asked about the policy, my boss said I could work from home on occasion, but reminded me that the company policy is that you shouldnt (even though many seem to do it, including her). I dont feel it will look good to my employees if I take advantage of the exception they aren't afforded. But, it'd it make my work-life balance much easier if I did! My commutes are over an hour on a crowded bus each way and its killin me.

1) how much can I advocate for my team to work remotely once a week, when my boss already told me they cant? When can I bring it up again, if at all?

2) am I a bad boss if I occasionally work from home while telling them they can't?
This feels very classist and I can't figure out what the reason could be for my team not to be granted the same benefit that so many in the org have. They are incredibly trustworthy and hardworking.

Now, to be fair to her, she is struggling financially, &amp; has done so since my late father put her in debt many years ago. Thing is, I’m now coming into my own &amp; I want to have financial independence. I have a job, but it pays below minimum wage (I plan to leave it soon &amp; get a better paying one). 

Whenever I tell my mother that she can’t borrow money from me, or I mention the rent is too high, she goes on a tirade on how hard up she is &amp; how she has bills to pay. She’s now wanting me to pay my share of the vet bills, which I’d be happy to do, if the rent wasn’t so damn high. I have been able to put away £200 a month for four months despite all this.

813,"so i just graduated college this may and im really lucky to have found a great, very high paying job in my field. i have been working jobs to support myself and my family since i was 14, and have always given my parents a share of my earnings, most of the time without them even asking, as we are immigrants struggling to make ends meet. ever since my high paying internship and my acceptance into this job, my parents (dad specifically) have been demanding more and more money (think: thousands at a time) from me. my dad decided to also make me pay for a luxury resort vaca for me and my family, where we are currently staying for a week. this is our first vacation ever in a hotel so i had high expectations. 

i have dropped over 5k on this vacation, all from my savings acc supposed to go to my student loans. my parents have been especially awful to me, and my younger sister (age 16) has been as well. my dad has physically abused me since i was a child, and i thought he'd chill out a bit on vaca but didn't. he gave me a black eye on the first day but thats another story... my mom is verbally abusive and has also been relentless on this vacation. 

so basically me and my sister got into a small argument that ended up blowing up. 
i took A TAMPON from her that i desperately needed even tho i asked and she said no. i understand respecting someones posessions but like... i wasnt trynna bleed thru my bikini lmao. i also know she was especially pissed bc my parents dont trust her and she really has no privacy and is still living at home since shes in hs, so me violating her wishes must have been upsetting for her. BUT i think that with all i do for her and my family, i have the right to take a god damn tampon when im bleeding and not need to ask. she has been super nasty and blowing it out of proportion. ofc my parents are fueling the fire and pitting us against each other even more by obviously taking sides, displaying favoritism in front of the other sibling, etc (ex - my sister misplaced my headphones and my mom accused me of doing it as revenge, and swore up and down that she saw me do it even tho i was at the beach all day... and they ended up being under her pillow). 

i'd like to give a side note about my younger sister too, bc she has some awful personality traits. for one shes a pathological liar and loves attention. my parents have only ever physically abused me, and have never laid a finger on her. however i found out not too long ago from multiple sources that shes TOLD A LOT OF !!MY!! PHYSICAL ABUSE STORIES WITH /HERSELF/ AS THE VICTIM, even tho the stuff happened to me and she would often just be watching or i tell her the story of what happened to me. when i found out about this i was really hurt, but i kept it to myself and i never told her i knew. 

anyways, me and her are actually pretty close, but after this fight blew up we havent talked in four days, which is the longest fight we've ever had. we follow eachothers finstas, and for the past few days she ended up posting awful things about me (saying she wants to cut me off, calling me an entitled bitch with no personality, stubborn, a thief [over a mf tampon!!]).... and i saw all of it because she never hid it from me. not sure whether she wanted me to see it or not but i ended up blocking her bc i was really upset. shes also hid my stuff and later admitted to it in front of my parents, where she knows i cant say anything and they'd take her side and accuse me of overreacting.

SO, idk if im blowing this out of proportion or not, but i cancelled my sisters subscriptions that i pay for to things like netflix and spotify and blocked her on all socials. if a bitch wants to cut me off, she sure as hell isnt gonna mooch off my netflix!! anyways, my question is, am i in the wrong for this? should i let our relationship go down the drain since she said those things about me? also i kind of brushed aside her lying about my abuse and making it her story, but its making me mad again and i keep thinking about it even tho it was a few months ago. BUT shes the only person in my family i'm remotely close to and i dont want to lose an ally. i thought about just sucking it up and apologizing for taking the stupid tampon since im the older sibling, but im scared she'll reject my apology and hurt me even more or my parents will try to interfere. thoughts/advice???? also sorry i feel like this post is all over the place lol",08Jul2019,0

For a while, she took her antidepressants and was prayed for and supported by the whole family, and we were okay for a while.

But around the end of last year, my grandma stopped taking her antidepressants, and told the family she was even more depressed.

We still supported her then, but noticed she threw out her antidepressants. This is when my mom started picking up BS vibes.

Bit after that, and my grandma told the family that she wasn't getting enough love and attention and was going to be more depressed than ever. Everyone helped her with her depression then, calling her every now and then.

A while after. My grandma is emphasizing her depression, not taking anything perscribed to her, and is calling the family and telling everyone about her depression.

This has been going on for a long time, and I'm afraid she's playing with everyone's emotions to get attention.

Mom is tired of her crap, so am I, but the rest of the family believes it. What do I do, is the depression actually real? What can I do to help everyone else realize how narcissistic she really is, if it isn't?

Here where I live you gotta study 6 semesters to get the chance to get the bachelors. When you study for more than 6 semesters you gotta pay for it. (1 semester is about a month of average salary here in Prague)

Here’s the question. If you were working as a trainee (basically an intern) in a company for 1/3 of average salary for working part time (20 hours a week) and get the chance to start working there full time for an average salary would you take the job if it would mean that youd have to take one more semester at the university and sacrifice one month of salary for it?

824,"Bartender here. I left my last job because they made me pay a tab that was left “open” but it was actually a fault of the computer and it my own because I distinctly remember cashing it out. I know it wasn’t my mistake because an hour later the same exact issue happened with my coworker but my boss voided the bill because they’re friends leaving me responsible to pay $50 but she didn’t have to pay $20 even tho the issue both times came from the computer and not an error on either of our parts. I quit without leaving notice because I was pissed. Now I’m worried about what to say to my next manager when I start applying elsewhere. Should I just leave out this job from my resume?

826,"Male, going to be a 22yo in November. I just completed an A.S. in Theatre and might be going for a B.A. in Drama. Got really good grades: 3.85 GPA and ended up getting a $25,000 scholarship to this school. School on paper offered 85ish transferrable credits from my degree. I go to the school to make my schedule and they say that, ""it's school policy that we can only take 64 max credits from a two-year institution,"" despite them saying differently on paper in the mail months ago. *Okay*. So that means I'd have to attend for a minimum of *two years* in compared to one. 

On top of that, the school is insisting I would also have to take out a bank loan of roughly $5,000 a semester to attend because financial aid doesn't cover the rest. I have decent financial aid because of my living situation. It doesn't help that now I would be staying double the amount of time because of this flash news of 64 credits transferring. I'd also be taking out roughly $12,000 a semester in loans to attend. *Nice.* 

I attempted to appeal the scholarship to get the 5 grand I'd need to cover the rest of the bill. Staff (after two weeks) have yet to get back to me on it, despite my counsellor insisting it'd take about a week and she'd be contacting me directly about what they have to say. I sent her an email asking about the status. *No response.*

At this point I feel like I'm about to walk into a big scam. I just finished 4 years completing my A.S. (even though I could've finished in 3, I hesitated to take the next step because I'm truly afraid of all this money loaning). I'm also feeling very done with school and starting to want to pursue a career in theatre production and film production. I've been going to school for these things for six years now (between my film academy and my A.S. degree) and have gone through *a lot.* If I am going to pursue something outside of school, I honestly don't know where to start and how to tackle my life. I'm honestly very lost on what my next step should be and if going to school is worth it anymore. I feel like I have learned very valuable skills in my time and I could easily self-produce. I just don't know how to tackle it anymore.

828,"A few months ago I (20F) got an internship at a company, and have been working there since. My department is kind of small, we’re only like 20 people, and almost all of them are above age 50; except for one guy, who’s 30. 

Naturally we started hanging out at work, and even started texting outside of it. He is a really sweet guy, who definitely feels more like a 25 year old rather than a 30 year old. We became good friends, and i think it was a little obvious that we liked each other. People at work started teasing us and said that they thought that something was going on between us two, even though both of us denied it multiple times (for obvious reasons).

A few days ago, some of us from work went out for drinks, and then somehow I ended up alone with him at a bar. We were both super drunk, and it didn’t take long before he started kissing me. I kissed him back. We never did anything other than making out that evening.

The day after we’re texting as usual, and he brings up what happened the day before. He wanted to make sure that i was okay with it, that I didn’t have any regrets about it or whatnot. I told him that I didn’t, and he said the same. 

Today at work was the first time i’ve seen him since it happened. It was a tiny bit awkward between us, but I guess that’s just because we have no idea how to act around each other anymore. We haven’t spoken about it since the day after, but I have noticed him trying harder to be around me more often, or talk to me more, etc. I am 100% sure that he wants to date me, so I guess it’s up to me to decide. And I am not really sure how i feel.

Taking this incredibly long backstory into consideration, my question is; do you think that this is something worth giving a shot? Or is it already doomed because of the age gap? I am leaving the company for uni this fall, so that wouldn’t be an issue. I am more concerned about how the age gap would affect us.

&amp;#x200B;

So I had recently applied to a job and was offered the position (woohoo!) But the HR department had gotten back to me a couple of weeks after the hire to inform me that when they had verified my education degree a different degree had come up. The degree I have listed is Integrative Biology, which is apparently not my actual degree which I had discovered was Zoology. This position requires a science/biology related degree. What happened was during my senior year while studying Zoology the dept of Zoology sent out a mass email stating that they were changing the dept of Zoology to integrative biology. Additionally, when I had taken a class post graduation my major no longer read ""Zoology"" it had been  changed to integrative biology. This led me to understand my degree was now considered integrative biology. I reached out to MSU after HR contacted me and they stated that while the dept. had changed, they still honored my degree as Zoology and adjusted my major to Integrative Biology after graduation since I had satisfied the requirements of a Zoology degree. I explained what had happened to HR and sent screen shots of my major change. I'm wondering if I should be worried about them rescinding the job offer because of this??  There is a two course difference between the degrees of Integrative Biology and Zoology and I have taken 1 of those 2 classes already. Kinda freaking out.

At sunnybrook hospital, they are undergoing clinical trials for treating OCD using a relatively new technique known as focused ultrasound. I'm no scientist but I do know that they destroy some part of your brain that they think is responsible for OCD.

&amp;#x200B;

OCD has been very debilitating.  I cant get basic tasks done because my ocd interferes with them. Imagine studying or reading and then thinking about some random situation like, for example, getting into a confrontation with a coworker. Instead of focusing on the task at hand, you concentrate on that thought that might linger for hours. To make matters worse, these thoughts feel real, causing an anxiety attack. For example, today I was studying and then an intrusive thought popped up. The thought was about getting into a confrontation with someone who accuses me of littering. In response, I get up and start arguing back literally. Then when the thought gets worse, I imagine myself actually fighting, but I don't necesarily throw fists in the air. I make jerking movements or clench my fist because it feels as though I am addressing that thought. I just started taking medication and it has helped a lot, but im looking for something more effective.

843,"I'm an Incel myself (I'm 16 years old by the way) so I joined a incel forum to meet other people with the same problems as me and who could understand me. 
I befriended this one guy who's 22 years old and has never had sex, gone on a date, kissed a girl or even any experience with girls at all. 
He always complains and talks about how it's VITAL to lose your virginity in highschool because it's easier to build relationships with people because you seen them everyday and teenage girls are much more hornier than adult women and are dumber so therefore it's easier to seduce them for sex. I 100% agree with him. However I don't know how to talk to girls nor am I funny or anything so I'm stuck as a virigin and I'll likely be an Incel for the rest of my life. 

One thing that incels always do is blame women for their lack of sex but honestly that's something I don't agree on. It doesn't even make any sense to me. 
Because women, like all humans, expect things back as well. Us incels have NOTHING to offer them.
We're not funny, not charismatic, have no clue on how to talk to girls, we aren't intelligent or masculine, no CONFIDENCE or self esteem, no talent etc. There's no reason for girls to date and give us sex. Humans want the things that are desirable and valuable.  Incels aren't attractive. We have NOTHING going for us. There's nothing interesting about us. We don't even know how to create chemistry with girls through conversations at all. NOTHING!

Something that incels dont try to do is fuck ugly unattractive women to fulfill their empty sex life. And why is that? Because we incels are mostly men and we want sexy beautiful women. We would reject a ugly FAt one lady if she were to make a move on us. 

So that's why i don't understand why other incels like me blame women for not getting laid. I would never blame girls for my lack of sex. It's my fucking fault and always will be. I don't know what to do or where to start. I also get envious and very angry at teenagers my age who have sex. When I see a couple making out in the hallways in my highschool I pick fights with the guy and I often win. This one time I broke this boys nose in front of his girlfriend because she was a gorgeous girl that I can only ever DREAM of being with.  But I try not to fight to much or I'll get into more serious consequences so I do other stuff like steal boys phones and break it by stomping on it and flush it down the toilet but I only target boys with hot girlfriends. I fucking envy them so much... I hate them....

But back to the topic of the title, said incel I'm friends with has started to talk about how he plans to rape women in his college and other places. he says how he wants to drug them or kidnap them for sex so he can lose his virginity. He really has me worried about him and the women around him. Is there anything I can do or say to change his mind? If that doesnt work than will informing someone be nessesary? I don't want to get him in trouble. I really care about him. I've been friends with him for a while and he's always understood me.",08Jul2019,0

&amp;#x200B;

so... about that date.

&amp;#x200B;

it was set for 7pm. I got on the train and rode it for 20 minutes, trying not to overthink it as I sat right next to the window in the same spot I had sat when I was on my way to my first tinder date a few months back (which, I had a panic attack right before meeting the guy, and though by the end of the night I felt better, he ghosted me eventually), but that's a different story. so anyways. I get off the train and walk a block or two to the restaurant, which ironically, was the same restaurant chain the guy who wrote the letter had his 16th birthday at.

I get to the restaurant, walk up the stairs, turn the corner, and make my way to the two hostesses standing at the lectern talking. one of them shows me to the table and as soon as I see him sitting there, he sees me walking over. we say each others names as if they were hellos, and in that moment I knew I was about to have a really memorable night with my old best friend. we sit there talking for at least half an hour without even looking at the menus, laughing instantaneously within the first 30 seconds and just sharing as much as possible about our lives in more recent months. there was no hesitation ever as to what to say or what not to say, and thats something I really missed about the way our friendship used to go.

we order our food and continue to talk, laugh, question. we get our food and still the conversation doesn't stop. it was so great because I felt like I could go on forever and not feel drained, you know?

but in all of this time talking, I didn't bring up the letter. I didnt feel like I had to, and part of me didnt want to either.

soon after we left the restaurant, we found ourselves sitting at whole foods eating dessert. as we sat by the window we talked more specifically about middle school, and as I mentioned how his old friend came into the store I work at the other day, he mentioned how he wrote that same guy a letter.

ah, so now I guess is an ok time where I could bring it up, I thought.

he went on to say how he had put a $20 bill in it and thought the guy had definitely lost it or thrown it away by accident. and as I just listened, I guess in the way I was looking at him like ""yeah so r u gonna ask me about mine"" sorta face, he was like: ""what... ?""

&amp;#x200B;

""well, you know I kept mine right.. and I read it a few days ago.""

""really ?""

""yeah of course. do you remember what you wrote?""

""no I dont think I do, I just remember I got really sad one day and just started writing.""

&amp;#x200B;

""well... I brought it if you want to read it hahaha.""

""no thanks. ahahaha""

&amp;#x200B;

and so, that was that. I showed him my reaction pics of me crying as soon as I read it and I guess he just didnt want to keep talking about something he had written four years ago with the intention of never questioning again.

it didnt stop us from enjoying our dessert or continuing to sit by the window and talk for another hour. we hugged and went our separate ways. in that moment I felt such a strong sense of closure. one which up until that point I dont know if ive ever felt in my life. like, if I were to never see him ever again for what ever reason, I wouldn't mind. I felt up to date with what was going on in his life, and the life he was about to begin to pursue. it was one of the best nights I've had in so long, and the letter no longer mattered. he was so grateful that had I texted him in the first place, and I was so happy to just feel myself again, and that in his space. he hasn't changed literally at all since I first met him. he's grown, sure, and his hobbies have become more reflective of who he is. in general, he sounds happier now with what he's doing with his life, but still, I dont think I could ever see myself in a romantic relationship with him.

&amp;#x200B;

part of me feels like, if anything, both of us will grow old alone. not because we're horrible, pathetic people, but I just have this weird feeling that I can picture all too well. that neither of us need another person to feel complete, no matter how beautiful love is and how indescribable the feeling of being in love is. its strange, I know, and im not saying this with underlying asexual notions or as someone whos ""never felt love"", because ive shared intimate moments with people and felt things in the realms of ""magical"" before. I love people. I love colours. I love music. I love sharing stories. I love listening. but when something so complex is so easy to visualize, it makes you wonder . . .",08Jul2019,1608

He's vegetarian but I think it's a combination of lifestyle and loving situation that's lead him to rely on take aways which has lead to the weight.

853,"Hi! I (17F) have a younger brother who is mentally disabled. He’s 10, but cognitively around the age of 3. Because of this he’s still in the stages of instilling behaviours.

I babysit him often. Sometimes I feel like I even contribute to helping raise him. Recently, he’s begun playing with his penis, or masturbating. Can’t tell because I look away immediately.

I figured the best way for me to go about it was to wait until he wasn’t doing the deed and try to communicate the importance of privacy and safety. Sentences like “only do this in your room, okay?” And “private’s are for mommy and [name].” That is what feels right to me because it would feel so wrong to shame him for it, but my mom [50F] is very different.

She’s what I call “liberal within her circumstances.” She grew up very conservative. She’s open minded and understanding about some things to an extent,  but sexuality is not one of those things. Whenever he did this she would get very upset at him and tell him to stop. 

I think he’s confused. I don’t blame him, he doesn’t have the capacity to understand what’s right and what isn’t right now. So is it wrong of me to take on that role when I’m babysitting him? If I should leave all the parenting to my mom, how do I respond to further incidents regarding this?

856,"I'm using a throwaway account and this is also my first time posting on reddit so bare with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in a relationship for almost three years now and while we have struggled, we've also changed and gotten better. We both come from abusive pasts; my mom was a drug addict and neglected me at a young age while his father was an abusive alcoholic. Understandably, this has left marks on our adulthood, and we both strived to become better people with each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

This past year, however, has been rough. I've been living with him for about a year now; we commute to University together, we both hold separate jobs, and we even got a dog together. Being with him has been pretty serious but this year has made me seriously doubt the healthiness of our relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we argue, he'll often shut down, saying things like ""I'm done,"" or ""I have nothing to say,"" or he'll just blank out and retreat. Then he'll ignore me, which is something difficult for me. Sometimes he stormed out or slams something to make a loud noise; left without telling me where he's going; he'll ignore me and go straight to video games, youtube, or TV shows; or if I'm upset and try to leave the room, he'll block the door and get in my face. He's been verbal, too, has told me to ""f\*ck off"" or that I'm being annoying often when I'm most vulnerable. It's taken a terrible toll on my mental health where I even stopped going to the gym, eating healthy, small appetite, and noticed I'm getting visibly depressed. I've noticed, too, that if I try to recall a fight where he did something terrible, I completely blank out. It's as if the memory is completely blurry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever he fights with his mom, he'll go apologize to her not even ten minutes later. He's always very respectful and open to his mom, so whenever they argue, he always apologizes to her shortly after. I remember admiring him for his respect for his mom but then it DAWNED ON ME THAT HE DOESN'T EVER DO THAT TO ME! If we fight I either have to apologize first to lower his defenses or wait a day if I felt like he should apologize first.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week we had an awful fight where it accumulated to him telling me to ""f\*ck off"" and I said gladly, took my keys, and left. I snapped. Again I have a hard time remembering what led up to the fight, but I do remember that when I was trying to be honest with him about how I felt, he gets very defensive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I came back from my drive and told him that he only treats me right when we are happy, and then when we fight, he treats me like I'm his mortal enemy. I even brought up how respectfully he treats his mom when they fight compared to me. When I told him this, he was **speechless**. I told him that he never treats me with respect and love when we argue and that he fights with me like I'm dirt, and I've been telling him this exact statement all year. He often replies with ""I'll get better, but with my past it will take time."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt that I've been very patient. Coming from abuse, it's hard to break the cycle of what was done unto you, but I finally snapped and told him that this needs to stop now or I'm leaving for the sake of my own health. After a very reluctant conversation, he agreed to show more unconditional love rather than what he called ""tough love."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now, things are normal again, I'm feeling much better and I noticed it in my face. I started making the bed again, I did laundry, I smile more at work and when I volunteer --I have energy and am starting to feel like my normal self. I was getting on the computer when I typed in facebook and it automatically logged onto his. I decided I'd go through his messages. Before any jumps on me for this, we mutually agreed to this being open with each other. However, I stumbled on messages of his best friend saying I was narcissistic and controlling about our last fight because I asked my boyfriend to show me unconditional love. I also saw messages of my boyfriend saying he wants to leave me. His best friend is also a good friend of mine, especially before I was dating my current partner. I was shocked. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took a serious look at myself and tried to reflect on what happened but never did I feel controlling. I felt very much powerless in fact. I understand that what my partner told his friend was very one-sided. But to see him talk about me as this narcissistic, controlling person that would make him miserable for his life was heartbreaking. His friend even asked him if I pay for anything, saying that if our relationship was controlling that I must make him pay for everything. And to see messages of him wanting to leave me... well that hurts like hell. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this seems like an emotional rant but I'm at a loss. I guess I'm just looking for advice. Am I in a bad relationship? Should I finally just leave? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; 

Had bad fight with boyfriend, his friend thinks I'm controlling but I feel that i'm in a toxic relationship. Advice is hugely appreciated.",08Jul2019,1
857,"Hello everyone!

About two weeks ago, my housemate had a friend of his moved in, who's a girl. At this time I thought they were together, or something.

Anyways, my friend goes away for a week. So I'm left with this girl for the week, we know each other, and we get along well. Anyways, you know, first night we start watching a movie. And we're both testing each other a bit, brushing legs when moving etc etc, and got a bit closer, snugglier, and introduced a blanket. I left it there for the night after a couple of of movies.
Anyways, she sends me a text when we go to bed saying she's keen for another movie sesh the next night. Also, texts me during the day telling me how she's looking forward to watching the show.
So the next night we cook dinner, and she's talking to me about my housemate who she's complaining about a bit. Then gives me a look, and says that you know we're not actually together, and gives me this spill. My friend wants her to leave within the month as her stay in only temporary.

But she's like, I don't want to move I like it here, and says she wants my friend to move out, or something.

At this point I'm mind blown, I thought they knew where they stood and all that. I want her to stay, cause she's awesome.

Anyways, we get onto binge watching more TV. And we're snuggled all up on the couch, and we're still kind of testing the waters a bit, and it starts to get a bit more heated and we're gearing up to fuck, and I kind of just stopped it and just snuggled up to her. I don't want to make it awkward at this point when the housemate returns the next day.

She's made it clear, she doesn't care about him, and wants to mess around. My housemate is an idiot, doesn't understand what he's got and just wants the sex.
She knows it, he knows.

There's talk of my housemate moving away soon.

Anyways, I want to play my card or a card. But I've got no idea what I should do, should I wait until she knows she's staying or going? Should I try encourage the situation so my housemate goes and she stays? Or encourage the situation so she goes, and he stays.
She's unreal, my housemate is annoying, he's always complaining about everything. Telling me he wants this girl to leave soon.",08Jul2019,1
858,"We are a little rocky for other reasons ( DB) Prior to our relationship, I had a very conservative sex life. 
I had, however, one FWB who I have expressed to my boyf I had feelings for. To me it was a lot more than a fwb. But my fiancé can’t help but feel as though this guy is laughing at him for ‘ paying for what he got for free ‘. He has mentioned it 3 times in our 1.3 year relationship but it just hurts so badly to hear and makes me feel really, really cheap.
He apologises each time but today it made me cry as we are already rocky. He’s slept with a few more people than me but they were in committed relationships. Is this always going to be in the back of his mind? How can I help? Should I call quits? He’s 31 I’m 27.

861,"I don't really know what to do... This girl online(18F) that I met from a game 4 years ago, I don't know if I should wait and see if she changes or maybe I just never knew who she was? She's a girl I have always found weird, eccentric, low empathy, self interested, just very complicated. A lot of ppl agrees that she's weird. But IRL from what she told me, she seems to be doing fine in real life with friends. We dated for 2 years untill she dumped me 2 months ago. I always argued with her.. and it's weird because I'm an easy to get along with person online.. shes just often confusing or maybe I have Asperger's and just not enough details and misleads me. But we had a lot of good memories together since 2015. She said she lost all feelings towards me, and just to be friends, and it made sense because I was horrible and needy. And one day she told me she met a guy online in a 3 year old avatar, and said she wants to only love him from now on. The guy turns out be a 21 year old from the Phillipines and studying electrical engineering, I'm a failure compared to him , I'm a 20 yr old dropout. Few days in and she already wants to date him, saying nobody else matters except him now, very obsessed and into him, just like how she was in the beginning of our relationship. One month in, shes already said she's planning to save up to visit him. she said he's perfect and I can feel that she loves him and they both like anime. He helped her with math too. She just left me ever since, completely stopped caring about me and wants nothing to do with me, because I spread negative energy and I'm miserable. Like she just lost  all interest about me that it hurts. Then these 2 months I have only been self-deprecating to her by continuously apologizing and persistent on being friends, because I just known her too long, and she knows everything..I told her everything..my embarrassing memories, my full name, how I'm lonely IRL+, she didn't care at all and never offers any sympathy to me whenever I show her how hurted I am even after everything we been through. I honestly feel that she's crazy or has a personality disorder and wish I never get close to her, she has depression too. We are kinda friends now, but she never tells me about her life anymore or anything. i always start the convo. 2 days ago, I agreed to borrow her my steam accounts so she can play with him like we used to, what made my head spin was her thinking it was fine to let him log into my main account that's the high level acc, instead of him using the acc with lesser games. They just want to play one game anyways. Guys I just feel sick. Should I wait? Because she really was a good friend and we had a lot of good memories for years. I used to be someone she tells everything to but that feels like a long time ago. Or should I cut her off? I feel that this is risky.. I would forever feel paranoid if she's going to be up to something. Like what if I get famous or well known one day, and she writes a post humiliating me. It's less likely to happen if I kept her as a friend.",08Jul2019,1
863,"Okay so a little bit of backstory here. In middle school I started identifying as a lesbian. Identifying as a lesbian shaped a lot of my personality. During high school I dated two guys (but never experienced any kind of sexual attraction) and decided that I must be bi/asexual. As of right now, I’ve been dating this one guy for over a year. I love his personality, his sense of humor, just everything about him. Except for one thing, his gender. I wish my boyfriend was my girlfriend. I hate myself for being with a guy every single day. Every day I feel more and more like a lesbian. I don’t want to leave my boyfriend because of how difficult his life would become without me in it, but I also hate being with him because he’s a guy. I think that I still love him but I’m not sure anymore. I’m terrified of change and I honestly don’t think I’ll ever find someone better than him. Some days I find myself wishing he would come out a trans so I could have a girlfriend without loosing him. 

What should I do? Should I stay with him even though I know in my heart that I’m not attracted to his gender? Or should I leave in hopes that I’ll find someone better who’s the right gender for me?",08Jul2019,2
864,"So basically I’m just trying to figure out whether I should take the job or not. I’m a student studying diplomacy (bachelors degree) currently going to start 5th semester. 

Here where I live you gotta study 6 semesters to get the chance to get the bachelors. When you study for more than 6 semesters you gotta pay for it. (1 semester is about a month of average salary here in Prague)

Here’s the question. If you were working as a trainee (basically an intern: release manager in an international company) in a company for 1/3 of average salary for working part time (20 hours a week) and get the chance to start working there full time for an average salary would you take the job if it would mean that youd have to take one more semester at the university and sacrifice one month of salary for it? I like the job tho.. 

And if you’re still not sure what would you advise me then I’m gonna add one more thing. I can keep working there as an intern.

865,"I have been at this job for roughly 4 months. My probation period ends in September 18. The money is good and I’m good at my job, but I feel anxious at work and even more so now my coworker has been fired. She was fired on the spot for being “forgetful” and questioning my boss (making polite, reasonable suggestions). This is supremely unfair and untrue, but he has had something against her from the start I think. 

My boss bullies my coworkers and me. I’ve been unhappy at my job for a while. I have to give four weeks notice before I quit, but I’m scared if I do so I’ll just get fired on the spot anyway. I can survive until the end of the year (I’ll be living on $50 a week after rent is paid) after which time I will be ending my lease and going home to my parents for a period of time.

866,"Hi everyone. I'm a college student working a part-time job. I don't need to work (my dad pays my tuition and expenses), but I am trying to improve myself and make some extra money. I don't want to disclose the job or company that I work for, but it pays more than anything else I could be doing at the moment.

I messaged my boss about needing a slight schedule change, and I quickly received a call from my him telling me (in short) that I haven't been performing well. The schedule change was minor and I gave warning months in advance that my days would have to shift every few weeks due to classes. I don't think that I was lied to about my performance.

I've kept my availability very open, but I don't get called in often. I don't need to work and have been taking extra workload in classes, so I haven't been pushing for more hours.

I'm going to meet with my boss in two days to discuss my options, but I get the feeling that I'm actually facing an inevitable termination and am being given a chance to save face and quit so that they don't have to worry about the usual repercussions of firing someone.

The truth is, I'm really not very good at my job. I think that I can improve with some effort, but I'm not sure if it'll be satisfactory or even adequate. I suffer from a number of mental conditions (Asperger's, ADD, Bipolar disorder, and chronic depression, all diagnosed) that make focusing and communicating difficult for me. I'm not getting treated for any of them right now. I haven't told my boss about this, I'm not sure if it's even a good idea.

Should I just go through the motions of the meeting, and quit? Should I try to hold onto my job and risk getting the boot?

This goes without saying, but my pride is hurt pretty badly right now and I was wondering if someone could give me some additional advice on how to deal with that. Thanks.",08Jul2019,2
867,"For the past few weeks I've just felt so defeated.

In February, I broke up with May (my girlfriend at the time, not her real name) because the relationship was just getting too much for me - I have depression, and I felt like I was responsible for so much anxiety in her life, and it was spilling over into mine and just overwhelming me. So I broke up with her, thinking it was the compassionate thing to do to help both of us be our best selves. We had some other lifestyle differences which contributed too; for example she drinks/does drugs, whereas I'm teetotal and won't touch drugs again because of past experiences. I felt horrible for a few days. A week later I confessed to her that I thought I had made a mistake, but she said it was really for the best that we split. I soon began the process of healing.

One morning in late May, I sat down for my daily meditation and was just bombarded with images and thoughts of May. About how much I'd hurt her, about how she cried when I told her it was for the best, wondering if she's okay now. I managed to finish the session, knowing these thoughts would pass but I was a little bit shook by the whole experience. On my way home from college that day, I was waiting on a bench for my train and as I stood up to get on I saw her familiar face walk right past me. I'm not sure if she saw me, but for that whole journey home I was bombarded again by the feelings I had immediately following the breakup. I'm certain that the experience during meditation had an impact on this too.

Yet, I continued on. I knew this would pass - just like any lingering feelings before it. I tried to move on. In fact, I even managed to let go for long enough that I started to fall for someone else. Here was another girl that really liked me, that bonded with me over shared interests - or so I thought. After a while I made my move and asked her to be my girlfriend. But she didn’t see me that way, she said. Now I had two girls to get over.

Less than a week after this, I was on the same bench waiting for my train. First, the girl by whom I had been rejected walked onto the platform. I pretended not to see her - I was still wounded by the events of the week before. Then, off of the same train as before, May walked right past me again. I just felt so fucking crushed in that moment.

I confided in some close friends who still knew May about what I was feeling. One told me that he understood that I’m suffering, but that ultimately I just have to get over it. The other told me she has a new boyfriend and is much happier now. The second piece of information makes the first so much harder. I had been thinking about texting her again and asking her to try again, but that was the one thing I was holding on to, my one chance.

This isn’t the only thing that’s been upsetting me, but it’s probably the most dominant. I can’t get over this. I’m in so much pain. I hadn’t even thought about suicide for 2 years, and here I am, trying so hard to pull myself back up, to bring myself back to a state where I can be functional again. I want her back more than anything right now, and I don’t know if I should text her and at least get some closure or leave it and deal with my emotions myself.

870,"My fiancée is part of a close friend group. When we met she was in a FWB situation with one of them. Pretty straightforward: 2 single friends comfortable with each other having sex to scratch that itch. I don’t care about the relationship, we’ve all been there.  What makes me uncomfortable is that when her and I met, it was no big deal for her to go back to being friends with him. She expected that I’d be cool with it and hang out and be friends with him. I’m not really ok with it because I find those situations awkward especially when it was so recent, he was the last guy she was sleeping with before she met me.  My opinion is that when you decide to have sex with someone your friends with you run the risk of that relationship changing in some way.  I intentionally put distance between anyone in my past when we met because I felt like it was right to close those chapters. She’s been perfectly understanding and has distanced herself from him because she knew I was uncomfortable with the situation. To be clear, this isn’t rooted in jealousy (ok maybe a very small amount), we are very much in love and she’s not going to cheat.  I just feel awkward drinking beer and chillin’ with the guy who was banging my fiancée literally days before we met. I don’t expect her to be friends with girls that I’ve hooked up with.

871,"My brother is super depressed and I want to help.

He was bordering on suicidal last year (openly talking about it as an option on reddit with strangers, making a bunch of little self-directed suicide ""jokes"" i.e. calls for help, etc). 

Luckily, I was able to get him to commit to talking to someone. 

We went to a psychologist together at first, then he went alone for a few months. 

Now he has stopped going because he is relatively stable and has identified several external reasons to live in his life (his responsibility to his wife and 2 kids, etc). 

That being said he is still really unhappy with his situation overall. 

He is stuck in a low level super market job with a wife and 2 kids. He is making ends meet because he got a few promotions at the supermarket and is the manager of something or other, he has confided in me that he is only happy and only finds life worth living FOR HIMSELF when he is either in nature OR writing. That's it. Maybe spending time with family but even that is more about fulfilling an obligation and not living for himself. 

He's doing a fair amount of writing at the moment, he is writing a memoir about growing up with Tourettes Syndrome (he basically is done with this one, just revising it for the 1000th time before trying to get it published) and a novel for fun on the side that looks pretty good actually. 

I've been looking for nature jobs for him, and living in Idaho there are a few options but they are all part-time / seasonal (makes sense) or require a bachelor lifestyle, or are not able to finance a family. I think he legitimately NEEDS this kind of job to not kill himself eventually, but he's limited in the options he has because of has having a family. 

He is highly motivated and super energetic. Once of the ways he deals with Tourettes is by working out so he's strong and capable physically. I legitimately believe that his writing will take him great places, but he has to live long enough to achieve that and have the stress of normal life ease off his shoulders enough to focus on the things he loves and is good at.

Here's the question.

What kind of nature / writing jobs can someone with an unrelated Bachelor degree (Health science maybe? Can't remember. ) get into on enthusiasm and passion and spunk?

872,"Warning: this is pretty long. All advice is wanted. 


Sorry for bad formatting. (And grammar) I’m on a phone. And I’m lazy) 

The main characters in this story is 
Me: me 
My Mom: mom 
friend: Sarah (not her real name) 
&amp;  John:  (Not their real name either)


This long train wreck of a friendship starts 3 years ago. Me and Sarah met at a community art class in our town. She approached me first coming up to say sense I was shy at the time.
And also hand no interest in talking to Sarah sense I was a tomboy at the time.
We started hanging out that fall.
Art parents met while we were in the class and would talk during it. 
They seemed to hit it off. And so did me and Sarah. 

Are friendship stayed strong through the winter. By that time I’d gone over to her house once or twice. 
But then there was the first incident 

In September my brother had his 17 birthday party and my mom invited a bunch of people. That we had known for years, Sarah being my friend was invited and I was happy about it. 
But the whole time she complained about not liking the other people there. And wanting to hang out with me one on one. She’d pull me away from games to tell me this. 
(Shea was fully included but decided not to participate) 
When I’d say “just a minute” or “maybe later” she’d get upset and huff and puff and refuse to talk to me for the next 5 minutes All throughout the night this went on. 

The next thing is that she’d do was copy all the major parts of my personality,
I had my art up on my walls next thing I knew she did too. I wanted to be a fashion designer
( She was a major tomboy then too) 
and she decided she wanted to be a fashion designer. 
Next was Paris. I’ve always wanted to go to Paris. I talked about it a lot and she never seemed interested.
But, two weeks later she had a bunch of Paris room decor. And talked about how “she always loved it” 

(she later admitted that wasn’t true)

Next was the big accident 
Almost three years ago has by today. 
I discovered amino. It was a newer app and I took a shine to the 
“littlest pet shop” 
Community. And I wanted to share it with her. I was able to convince her mom to let her get the app. 
( That was my first mistake) 

3 weeks later. I had been using the main amino app. And I loved it. My friend found out about it and begged me to convince her mom again. 
I did.  She got the app and both times I gave her the internet safety speech. And showed her how to remove location (when that was an automatic thing) 
Everything goes fine. 

Until the next time I go over to her house. 
We were up in her room. And her mom called for her. She called her over to the stairs and they started talking in hushed tones. And I had really good hearing so I was able to make out part of their conversation. 

Her mom: don’t let her use that app in front of you, don’t re-download that app even if she says it’s ok, don’t let her make you talk to guys again.

I was like “wtf” but I didn’t press until the 3rd time of this happening. 
And when I did I found out that she’d been talking to a 19 year old guy online. They had pet names for each other. And talking inappropriately, And they were “dating”
 (she’s two years younger then me so she was 11 at the time.) 
when she was caught by her parents. 

She told her it was my fault.
Told her that I knew about it.
Told her that I said it was ok.
Told her that I did the same. 
And told her I made her. 

When the truth was

It wasn’t my fault.
I didn’t know he existed.
I didn’t think it was ok.
I didn’t do the same.
And I definitely didn’t make her. 

And the worst part is I had to overhear her lies from her whispered conversations with her mom.
And that killed me.
She told me what happened but left out the part about where she blamed me. 
She laughed it off and moved on in seconds.
That was the last time I hung out with her. I saw her once after that in a public setting but then I was done.

Every time I’d go over there I’d be belittled and trash talked behind my back. So I stopped hanging out with her all together, I didn’t have a phone at the time. 

So id just have my mom say I was sick or busy. Whenever she asked to hang out.

(She knew because I was worried that she’d tell the lies to my mom) 

In those two years I had a phone for part of that time and never gave her the number. My phone was canceled fall of last year due to me never using it. 
And that’s when I ran into her at the library.

She said hi and we talked.
And I thought 
“damn she must of really matured”
forgave her and moved on. 
We started hanging out again. 
And I was desperate of friends so I’d put up with it. 

Her coming to me for every little problem in her life.
If I didn’t text her back that day shell spam my phone with 30+ texts. Even tho I’ve never talked mental health with her,
She’s memorized my schedules for my art class, and my theater group, 
If I don’t pick up a phone call. Even if I’m busy. She’ll call and call and call again. 
Then get mad when I tell her I can’t talk.

She’d gets mad when I can’t drop everything that day if she wants me to come over in the next 5 minutes. Since that’s what she’s used too.

I talk to her when she’s upset. And I cradle her like all my other friends.

But when I tried to open up. She compared my past anger issues to a river dale character. And says “mood” when i say I’m sad and need to talk.
She “can’t rn”

But when I actually can’t. She’s upset. 

She’ll zoom in on photos of you and laugh and make joke but if you even joke about her fandom crushes. She’ll get mad and ignore your for 10 minutes.

But if she insults yours she’ll expect to to get over it. 

She’s used the excuse “I don’t mean to dish it out it’s just who I am.” 
And then the same day told me that “it hurts when you make jokes like that”

Like girl. She hit so quiet when I smiled and said. 

“If you dish it to me you have to be able to take it.” 

She tends to try and make things about her. She talks about why she doesn’t support lgbtq even tho half of her friends are lgbtq. 

I don’t know if I’m thinking to far into things. And she’s actually an amazing friend and I’m just sh*t please let me know what you think I could do

this isn’t as serious as some other stuff on this subreddit but idk where else to put it so here I am lol

Basically I was showing my irl friend a funny reddit post, and she saw my username and followed me (she’s on reddit also)

the problem is that she’s going through all my old posts and comments while I’m sitting next to her and she’s laughing at everything I’ve posted in the past and it’s making me really uneasy

Like loads of other people here I’m a completely different person online than I am in real life, and I mostly used that other account that she found to say whatever was on my mind to people who I’ll never have to worry about meeting, and the fact that someone I know is now able to read those completely ruins it :(

She hasn’t commented on anything and she won’t tell me her username so I can’t block her, but she followed me so that she can see anything new I post and now I’m scared to use that account, what should I do? I don’t want to tell her that I feel like she’s kind of invading on my private space a bit cause that would be really awkward lol

876,"Hello all

Through therapy for an unrelated issue, I (18F) uncovered I may have been groped by my cousin when I was 8 and he was 16/17. It was a one time event. He was tickling me and started to tickle by bare legs and made contact with my private parts (not with his fingers, but his arm/hand made contact). I told him to stop tickling me and he did. The whole ordeal lasted for about 2 seconds or less.

Is this enough to constitute sexual abuse? It never happened again after this, so this is the only incident. I brought it up to him recently and he apologized and said it was a lapse in judgment. He remembered it happening and he knew what he was doing.

I don’t think that he’s a predator but he was a pervert in this instance. Should I tell my family about this or keep it to myself?",08Jul2019,1
877,"So where do I begin? So in 2010 after working 8 years in retail I decided to go college at the age of 27. I went to community college and wound up exceeding my goals, making the Dean’s list every semester. I worked very hard and was accepted into the University of Texas at Austin studying International Relations. I continued to preform well. Then in 2014 the start of my Senior year my Father was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I had never really got to know him much throughout my life as he was very closed off and suffered from PTSD from the Vietnam War. So I decided to leave UT and get to know my Father and help out around the house. I never regret leaving school as getting to know my Father, hearing his stories, having him open up to me, and seeing his emotions for the first time in my life, and being there for him as he took his last breath was an experience that was priceless and completed a piece of my soul. So I’ll go back a bit now to the Summer of 2013. I had met a girl through mutual friends and we started dating and it turned into an on again off again relationship. During my time with my Father however, she would come up and visit and was 100% there for me and my family during this time. After my Dad passed I returned to Austin. She told me shortly after she wanted to move to Dallas to be closer to her Mom and family. I had an apartment in Austin and stayed 6 months more to finish my lease always driving back and forth on the weekends to see her. So I made the move to Dallas. She was living with her Mom and I got an Apartment. We continued our on again off again relationship until November 2016. Despite being on again off again we loved each other and were there for each other and things were blossoming much more as we both began to mature. She had surgery that month and she woke calling out my name. The doctor came and got me from the waiting room and I went back to see her. I held her we cried and she looked me in the eyes and said “I want to spend the rest of my life with you. You are the one”. So shortly afterward we got engaged. It was the happiest time of my life. So we get a nice apartment together and we are building our life together. When I moved to Dallas at the end of 2014 I met up with a friend from UT and he was able to help me get a great job at a company doing consulting work, I was relieved because I didn’t have a college degree but my friend vouched for me, they say my intelligence, and they took a chance. So I’m working and making great money then in May 2017 I got bad news, I was being laid off. I had to resort to ask my Mom for money to stay afloat. It saddened me because I had always been independent but she was delighted to help as she knew I had fallen on hard times and she and my Dad has built not a huge fortune but a sizable one as she is a Physician and has made wise investments. So I’m just asking for the bare minimum to get by each month. Enough for rent, food, gas, utilities, and enough to go out every once in awhile. My fiancée and I remained happy and loving with each other and she enrolled in college for the first time studying to be a Dentist. So during this time I’m applying for job after job after job and I keep getting turned down. I started for the first time in my life to become depressed. We had made several large purchases before I lost my job and the bills and phone calls stared coming in. Several debts resulted in charge offs and out credit scores started plummeting because it was eat and have a roof over our heads or pay our debt. In May 2018 our lease expired and we went to go live with at her Grandma’s house in exchange for $400 dollar rent. It wasn’t bad, we had 2 bedrooms for ourselves and a yard for our dogs. I’m still applying for jobs and getting turned down and then getting depressed, rinse and repeat. We remained loving to each other but we start arguing a little bit about finances nothing major but just little arguments we easily got over. A major problem however was that her Grandma was very racist toward me. I’m white and my fiancée was African American. When she was alone with my fiancée she would say that whites were the enemy and that I was nothing more than a slaveowner. That hurt when I heard those things but I didn’t let it get under my skin because she was old and came from a different generation and my fiancée’s Mom told me to just ignore it. But I could tell my fiancée’s attitude was beginning to change slightly but we remained very loving to each other. So flash forward to May 2019. My friend I who I hadn’t seen in 5 years calls me up, we had remained good friends and would talk on the phone every few weeks or so he had been begging me to come to Amsterdam where he has lived for several years but every time I had declined because I couldn’t afford it. So he calls me and says he wants to buy me a plane ticket to come see him, his wife, and his new baby daughter and that don’t worry about money while I’m there because I’m good for it and that we could discuss possible business ideas. I had talked to him previously about wanting to be a business owner someday. So I told him that I would ask my fiancée if it was ok, I asked her and she was like yes that’s freaking awesome. She had previously in the years prior gone on trips with her friends so it wasn’t that big of a deal. She is excited for me and we are loving on each other and June comes and I leave for Amsterdam, she drops me off at the airport, hugs me and cries that she is going to miss me and that she fucking loves me. We talked on the phone a lot when I was over there and she seemed happy but that she wish I would hurry back so she could hold me. So a week later I get back and she picks me up and she is happy I’m back. 3 days later we get into an argument about finances but we talk it out and go to sleep holding each other like we always do. The next morning I wake up and she is sitting in the living room crying. I said what’s wrong Baby. She said sit down we need to talk. So I do and she lays a bombshell on me that she is leaving me. I’m in shock and stunned trying to understand what’s going on so we hug and she says she loves me but she thinks it time we go our separate ways. I never got a definitive answer as to what lead her to this decision but I believe it was a combination of finances and most her friends being single and wanting her to be single too. We were both loyal to each other with no infidelity what so ever in our relationship that’s what why I was in shock too. So she says I need to pack up my things and go. We are both bawling as I’m packing up my stuff. So I pack up just my clothes and some toiletries and as I’m walking out the door she kisses me and says she loves me. This was 3 weeks ago and it hurts bad. It hurts my soul too because we were trying to have kids and she left me on Father’s Day. She blocked my number and blocked me on social media as did some of her friends and family that’s why it feels different this time because we had so much riding on this relationship and they never blocked me before. Her Sister called me a week after the breakup and was in shock as well at hearing the news asking me what had happened. She was floored at the news because she said I was a great guy, that I took such good care of her, and that I loved her like a man should. She was also angry that she just kicked me out homeless into the Texas Summer with no place to go. I’ve been bouncing around some AirBnB’s and motels for the past few weeks and I’m asking for advice on what I should with my life now. I fear I may never see her but should I stay in the Dallas area still hoping she may come to her senses like she did in the past and takes me back or should I move to another state and try to rebuild from scratch because I do want kids and a family someday and I don’t want to wait til it’s too late. It’s going to be very hard to get an apartment with bad credit as well but I know I need to work hard at fixing it. Should I go back to college or not? Or should I go another route in life? I’m 35 and this is a very awkward and confusing situation I’m in right now. I fortunately am 6’4”, in very good health, I exercise and take care of my body, and I have my intellect. I feel like this rock bottom and I need some major life advice.",08Jul2019,1

880,"my gf (20f) and I (22m) met in March and became ""official"" in May. things have been amazing since we met, and for the first time in my life I really feel like I found someone I can say I truly am in love with.

she works as a camp counselor at a summer camp an hour away, monday-friday. her original plan was to see me on the weekends since we can't really communicate much thru phone while she's at camp. she has times where she can, but she's generally too busy, it's usually just a text or two here and there.

it's been really hard on us and she's been overwhelmed recently by a lot of things and feels very stressed about the distance between us and also the fact she basically has no time for herself this whole summer.

she called me at camp about a week and a half ago and basically told me she couldn't see me for the next few weekends bc of the reasons above and that she felt really awful about it but that she needed space and that she was still very much in love with me but just can't handle a lot rn. i gave her space, and she just called me last night after not talking for over a week. i asked her if she was still feeling the same and she said that nothing has changed between us, she still loves me, but that she's still really overwhelmed.

she wants to come over next weekend tho, bc im going out of the country for two weeks this month and she wants to see me before i leave.

one thing that she said to me was that she doesn't think about me at all when she's at camp. that she doesn't even think about her family or friends or anything else, bc she just can't focus on anything else rn. it hurt to hear that, but i'm trying really hard to see where she's coming from. i told her it's okay, i understand that there's a lot going on right now, but i'm just looking for advice on how i should handle things. we both have really bad anxiety so that definitely isn't helping.

881,"I have social anxiety, and i struggle with panic attacks.  

I hate airports. They trigger my anxiety like nothing else, but airport security is the worst for me. Last year i flew for the first time in 5 years, and i got searched randomly and i had a panic attack while she was searching me and my bag. It was the most awful experience i’ve ever had, the whole time i had to try my hardest to keep myself together while i was panicking and shaking infront of her. I’ve always been anxious in airports, but what happened last year made it into something more like a phobia almost. When that happened last year, i was in a much better place in my life than now, and it still happened. I am struggling a lot more with my anxiety right now than i was then.  

I am scared that the guards will notice how nervous i am and think i have heroin up my ass or something haha, i mean why would i be nervous? That must look very suspicious. I am scared of the panic attack i might get because i can’t handle them and i don’t know how it will effect me this time. If i start going trough the security, i can’t just walk away, i have to stay and go trough with it and doing that while i’m feeling like that is horrible.  

I am going to fly to Greece tomorrow with my mom and i am freaking out right now. I don’t have any medication or anything i could take. I am thinking about having a drink before, because i don’t see any other way to help myself get trough it without having a panic attack and ruining my whole trip there. I know using alcohol to cope with anxiety is bad, but i just don’t see any other choice here and i would never do that in another situation. I would just have one drink, which won’t take away the anxiety but it will probably stop me from having a panic attack and make me feel calmer. We have Whisky at home and i’ve talked to my mom and she thinks it is okey for me to have a drink in a situation like this, however my dad is not supportive of the idea.  

I could really use any advice i would get. Do you think that having a drink is okey?",08Jul2019,1

Anything I should be mindful of while he's in nursing school? School comes first for the both of us so I obviously wont be forcing him to make time for me if he can't.

The punishment violates the National Labor Relations Board protections and I've filled out the form and am about to submit it to my CEO.

I'm serving it because Wednesday is the end of the 6 month statute of limitations and I need to do it ASAP.

889,"Let me start this off by saying that my grandmother was one of the most badass old ladies I've ever met. She went through a lot in her 92 years of life (she was less than a month off turning 93 at the time of her death) and survived world war two, a broken hip in her 80s and somehow kicked cancer in the butt not once but twice. But in her last few years she became more and more fragile and barely left the house. A few months ago she stopped eating and my family jumped into action moving her to a care home (yep the badass was living independently up till a few months ago as well) near us because she previously lived nearly 4 hours away from us and she was telling us that she didn't have long left. She was in and out of hospital for the next few months with a possible diagnosis of bowel cancer (we weren't long off getting the final results when she passed). On Saturday she finally gave up and left this earth for some place better.

We'd known for several months that my grandmother was most likely dying and were planning for a big fun party to celebrate her birthday this year (3rd August) with the entire family coming down as we knew it would most likely be her last but we thought she'd survive the summer. So when I got offered the trip of a lifetime paid for by my university which is a month spent in the city of Rome (I'm British) studying Italian (I started learning it this year as a beginner). Its basically a requirement for me to be able to study Italian again next year. I couldn't turn it down and jumped at the opportunity. So I packed my bags and arrived in Italy last week. So the last week has been amazing and I love this city and my italian is improving already thanks to the three and a half hours of classes I have every morning.

But obviously my heart broke at the news about my grandmother especially as I never got to say goodbye due to having returned from university for two chaotic and busy days full of last minute shopping and packing before coming to Rome. Honestly I was sort of in denial about my grandmother dying and I never really considered that she could die whilst I was away. My dad is trying to organise her funeral for after I get back but nothing is certain yet.

I feel completely torn as there is a part of me that really wants to just get on a plane home right now and into my family's arms and forget about this whole Italy trip but then I've basically signed a contract with my university that I'll be spending four weeks here (three more weeks left) and not staying here the whole time could mean that I can't take the advanced module that I want/need to next year in order to have the right amount of credits. Plus Rome is amazing and I won't get this opportunity again also I think my grandma would have wanted me to stay (I told her all about this trip and how excited I was to explore) here but part of me just wants to go home where I can lean on my family and closest friends. I just don't know what to do. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? If so please tell me what you did.",08Jul2019,1

891,"So I work part time in admissions as an assistant
And most of my job consists of auditing student files, putting them in the right order and scanning then into our database.

I make extra sure I'm doing my job correctly but its to the point where its affecting my mental health. I used to only double check my files and upload them into the database one file at time with all the documents in order but now I'm super paranoid and it takes me longer to do my job because i find myself double checking the same file at least 5 times over and over just to be 100% sure im doing it right. And then after I have uploaded all the files into our data base I double check them to see if they are uploaded to the correct student profile and are in the correct order.

This paranoia stems from my boss and co workers finding errors in my scan uploads and files that I dont even remember seeing...but they think im lying.

Here is an example. Student file for a student named sandy cheecks. I audit it and put it in the right order, and go over it 5 times to check if there are any errors and write down the date and time i audited it in my note book and put a sticker on it so that i know i auditied and double checked it. Then I scan it and manually upload it into the data base and put another sticker on the file so that i know I uploaded it.  I do all of these isolated and one at a time so I dont get anyone's files or documents mixed up.

Suddely Sandy cheeks student file is due to be mailed off and my boss telling me that not only is the file out of order but it also isn't in the data base. I show my boss my notes and that I have uploaded them and. They dont even believe me.

I know that the other admissions associates not only have access to the files as well but are also putting documents in and out of them and they also have access to the same database as me and can upload the files themselves as well. I feel like they are making the mistakes and I am getting blamed for it as I am only there for 3 days out of the whole week and they make a ton of errors that i correct all the time thus why im working there to begin with.
Most of these errors that I am being blamed for are only on one admission associates files but not the others and is it a coincidence that that particular employee doesn't like me very much?

I wanna find a way to see if my co workers are tampering with files after I audit them when I'm on my days off but im not sure how i thought of putting comments and notes on files in the database that way i know who did and didn't upload them because theirs wont have the same notes as mine. I told my boss about it but she rolled her eyes and said I shouldnt waste my time and that im being delusional and start taking responsibility for my mistakes.

I'm currently trying to think of ways to determine whether someone else touched the file before i completed it. I was thinking of using a tiny tag of paper that will fall out when someone opens it that way if the tag isn't there and there is also an error in the documents or in thr database I know someone tampered with it.

Or maybe I'm being too paranoid and im just a bad employee and i should quit and find another job that im good at.  The only reason i got this job was because the person before me couldn't handle it and got fired but it seems like such an easy thing to do, audit files, scan them, upload them, done✔ it shouldn't be that hard but holy crap I feel like an idiot for not getting anything right...

894,"So i havent seen my bf in 2 months and he's coming over for a long weekend. I'm feeling anxious because i want it to be special and of course the two of us are BEYOND sexually frustrated and will want to fuck probably all night most nights and do activities and dates during the day.

&amp;#x200B;

Heres the problem, my room is directly next to my housemates and the walls may as well be paper, i can hear every shift, cough, sneeze and step from his room and vice versa. He can hear me turn over in bed thats how bad it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont think he's the type of person to be comfortable with sex and i would be extremely surprised if he has even ever kissed a girl. This makes me extremely uncomfortable as if it was someone more open or liberal i wouldnt mind as much cause i know they would just laugh about it but i feel it would make him awkward and/or greately disturbed. He is actually moving out on sunday so its not like it would really matter but i dont want to be a dick  and upset him.

&amp;#x200B;

I want it to be really special, i like the guy i'm seeing and i want to be able to be sexually free and not worry every second about making noise or the bed creaking (and my bed CREAKS) 

&amp;#x200B;

heres the thing, my housemate actually is renting out 2 apartments this month and is moving to the second one on sunday (he has already been in it dropping off some stuff) and he told me he was going to stay there this week but sleep back here on friday, saturday and then his friend is moving here on sunday. My boyfriend arrives late thursday night so we would basically get thursday night to have proper fun, and then it would be mega uncomfortable for both of us knowing my housemate can hear every single thing the rest of the nights. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way i can tactfully approach my housemate about this? honestly i would love if he slept in his new apartment while my boyfriend is here but i dont want to be a giant dick suggesting it either, but honestly if it were me i wouldnt have to be asked i wouldnt even want to be here lol but i'm not sure the concept of us having sex has even crossed his mind.. and i dont want to scar him for life. I just think it would be more comfortable for both me and him if he slept there (especially since he's already sleeping there anyway during the week).

&amp;#x200B;

I just want him to be fully aware that we will be making noise and probably keeping him up (even though we wont mean to).

896,"So, I have a group of friends I hang out with daily, whether it be online or in real life (mostly in real life). They started playing a game they used to play and I wanted to join them, however, I dislike the game very much, it isn't my type of genre of game that I like. They really enjoy the game however, which, I think is fine, it is ok to like whatever you want to like. However, now, they only play that game, and here is where I need advice. I feel like I'm being too selfish by not wanting them to play that game, but I also want to hang out with them and interact with them, but they're too focused on the game even when I'm in the call. I'm an extrovert, and I have fun by hanging out with my friends, but since I'm not playing the game with them, and they focus too much on the game, I can't really hang out with them unless I play the game. Also, I'm severely behind in the game in the resources department, which means I constantly die and I'm basically not even playing the game at all. Also, **even when I'm playing the game, I still feel left out.** I still feel left out because they constantly only talk to one another, while I'm just sitting there, not getting any help and/or dead. I'm new to the game, and they're veterans, but they don't really help me at all, only the occasional ""here you can have this"". I understand a game is supposed to be a learning experience, but since I'm placed with them at the same time, I feel they should help me understand the game, before we jump into it. They jumped straight into it, while trying to teach me at the same time, but it didn't work. I got more and more behind, and more and more bored, eventually getting to the point of me not wanting to play at all, and me making this post. What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: My friends are obsessed with a game that I don't like (attempted to enjoy, but didn't work out), and now I rarely can interact with them other then playing the game, which I still barely get interaction in. I feel it would be too selfish to say to stop playing the game, but I don't want to lose touch with them.

I've tried to explain to them why  I couldn't be their friends anymore but most of the time it ended in us getting in an argument and yelling at each other. We could never come to a solution. Slowly I separated from each of them and we don't associate anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never thought that we'd become friends again. I  try to forgive a person if they apologize to me but I never forget what they did. None of them apologized and they all called me crazy and said I have no reason to hate them. Some even talked to the people I'm friends with now about me and how I either tried to steal their friends or that I'm a terrible person.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I couldn't keep a friend. It left me thinking that I was the problem and I felt very isolated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways...one of them apologized to me about a week ago and wants to make things work again, but idk if I can. I don't know if it would be healthy. We haven't really talked in a year. After all I'm in a good place now and I wouldn't want to go back.

Today I was at the park and saw the squirrel trying to eat something.

I thought it was a grape, but it was actually a marble ball. You know, toy for children?

I thought it might hurt the squirrel's teeth so I walked to the squirrel, it ran away without marble ball.

Therefore I grabbed it and searched for the nearest garbage bin.

However, the squirrel followed me and stared at me.

I thought the squirrel wanted marble ball so I gave it back, and the squirrel tried to eat again.

905,"I have this friend that I met years ago when I worked at a group home for teen moms. I was in my early 20s at the time, not much older than the girls themselves. I've kept in touch with all of them over the years.

One girl, in particular, was especially troubled. She had Munchausen syndrome by proxy. She used to feed paint chips and other things to her daughter in order to get trips to the hospital, where she would demand her daughter get an IV, whether she needed one or not. Eventually, she lost custody of her daughter, who was adopted into a wonderful family.

Now, keep in mind, my friend (now 30) was only 14 when she had her daughter. Prior to that, she was sexually abused, neglected, and her mom used to pimp her out to pay the bills. 

Well, my friend recently got married, and her and her husband got 2 cats when they started living together a year ago. Last week, she announced on Facebook that she had to have one of the cats euthanized because she was so full of worms, nothing could be done to save her. This cat was only a year old, and up until that point, my friend was always posting photos of the cat looking happy and healthy. A worm infestation doesn't happen overnight. She would have had to have been neglected for a very long time to become THAT infested.

I suspect either a) severe neglect (though photo evidence suggests the opposite), or b) she did something to deliberately harm the cat.

Here's where I need your advice.

Should I tell her husband that she has Munchausen, or stay out of it?",08Jul2019,0

I live currently with my parents, I don’t see any point in moving at right now when I can save money to get a better place when the time comes.

908,"Ok so a bit of background. I'm a 29m living with my mom for the past 2 years after suffering from psychosis. I'm really worried about living on my own in the chance that I relapse.

I make about $1600 per month. My rent at my moms house is currently $500 and I also have $500 I pay every month towards student loans/collections debt, so things can get tight after other expenses. Typical rent in my city including utilities is about $1000. If I find roomies it could be about $700. 

The thing is I'm a smoker of 10 years, and she is telling me I can't live with her if I smoke. I never smoke in the house. She's kicked me out before with no where to go for smoking weed (it's legal here now, but I quit weed when I had my psychosis). I was absolutely fucked when she kicked me out and spent several months homeless/couch surfing. A few nights I had no where to go and slept on the streets. 

What I'm trying to say is she will definitely change the locks on me and not care about what happens to me if she doesn't get her way. 

Anyways, I know I should just move out. It's so frustrating living here. She lashes out at me for everything and is in a constant state of being pissed off because I smoke. This leaches through to every area of my life and she will go through passive aggressive/aggressive phases for days at a time. I will wake up and say good morning and she will have some passive aggressive remark or else just straight up ignore me. Most conversations she has with me she will be yelling at me or nagging at me on anything that comes to mind.

What makes me more upset than anything is that she doesn't even care about the effects smoking has on my health, she literally only cares because it smells. 

I'm feeling forced to quit smoking, handed an ultimatum, which is the worst way of going about quitting any addiction. Being successful at quitting takes a personal motivaction from within. 

I've tried to quit for the past year with varying degrees of success, I've tried champix, gum, patches, inhalers and even a vape. The vape was the best because it was the most similar but 3 weeks ago it almost exploded (it melted) in my pocket so I haven't been using it and am pretty apprehensive about getting a new one.

Any advice would be appreciated. I know some of you might think I'm entitled but I'm really feeling like I'm in a bind right now. I hate how abusive my mother is towards me, I'm going to be flat broke if I move out, I'm struggling with quitting smoking and barely feel like it's on my own accord so I'm feeling just really shitty. I'm worried about living solo and relapsing into psychosis, which can lead to severe isolation and would probably mean me losing my job. I'm worried about finding a second job because the increased stress can trigger my psychosis again.

909,"Hey all.

I'm 21 and I work at a Lawfirm, I do pretty much everything. Unload supplies, manage a file cabinet worth of closed files and close the files. I answer phones, I run out and grab documents and files for them.

When I first started at 18 I was working two days a week for 15 dollars an hour in 2016 in Los Angeles. I car pool so gas never adds up. Since late 2016 I chose three days (I am in college)

I was in Target yesterday and my buddy told me they got a raise to 14.25.

I do much more than he does (not discrediting his work, he's a great worker it's just I should be getting accommodated more for my job, right?) 

To add, I've been working five days a week for a while now. I'm doing online classes now.

I haven't ever gotten a raise, I don't get sick pay, or vacation time, I have ultimately zero benefits. I also don't have my AD yet (soon). So can I ask for one, should I? Is it ethical? They're pretty stingy.

912,"Title pretty much says it all. There’s a medical program that my mom wants me to do that goes straight out of high school, and she’s pretty much been making most of my academic decisions thus far in order to get me in (I’m about to be a senior in high school). I’ve pretty much coped with the fact that I would be rejected from the program since sophomore year second semester, as my gpa is far too low compared to some family friend that got in and I didn’t really have many strong extra curricular or anything to cope. However, my mother continued to push me. 

One of the recommendations for getting into the program is having a chemistry class (again, this is a recommendation, not a requirement). I took physics my junior year first semester, because I thought it would be more interesting and I would do better at it than chemistry. 

At the end of my junior year, my mother realized that I didn’t have chemistry done, and made me sign up to take it over the summer with a local community college, an idea that we went to my counselor about and she continuously recommended that I didn’t do it, as I had never taken a chemistry class, and wasn’t the best math student.  My mom made me do it anyway. 

Now the final exam is in a week, and I’ve tried all I could to pass this class, but my current grade is a 51. By pushing me to take and fail this class, my mom has effectively botched my chances of getting into a good college. I’m sure I’ll find a way to get in somewhere, but I believe my chances have been immensely lowered at the fact that there’s an F on my transcript, and that it’s a college class, too. This has been ongoing, as my mom has pretty much made or had a hand in all my academic decisions for me.

My mother also forced me to get a job dealing with kids. Our family friend that got into the program had a job watching kids, and my mom believes that that’s part of the reason she got in, so my mom made me get the exact same job to work over the summer. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great job, but I would have much rather worked a basic job in food service or something, and I definitely would have made much more money doing so.

Where should I go from here? I’m completely through with my mom tampering with my academics and other aspects of my life, and it feels like my life and my choices aren’t even mine to make anymore. I appreciate that she has so much hope in me and that she wants me to succeed, but I feel that i should at least have a hand in where I want to go after high school.

Tl;Dr my mom wanted me to get into a special medical program straight out of high school even though I knew I’m not a strong enough student to do so. Her decisions have ultimately led to me failing a college class, and now I feel like she’s screwed up my chances of getting into certain colleges. What should I do?",08Jul2019,1

914,"I'm an Incel myself (I'm 16 years old by the way) so I joined a incel forum to meet other people with the same problems as me and who could understand me. 
I befriended this one guy who's 22 years old and has never had sex, gone on a date, kissed a girl or even any experience with girls at all. 
He always complains and talks about how it's VITAL to lose your virginity in highschool because it's easier to build relationships with people because you seen them everyday and teenage girls are much more hornier than adult women and are dumber so therefore it's easier to seduce them for sex. I 100% agree with him. However I don't know how to talk to girls nor am I funny or anything so I'm stuck as a virigin and I'll likely be an Incel for the rest of my life. 

One thing that incels always do is blame women for their lack of sex but honestly that's something I don't agree on. It doesn't even make any sense to me. 
Because women, like all humans, expect things back as well. Us incels have NOTHING to offer them.
We're not funny, not charismatic, have no clue on how to talk to girls, we aren't intelligent or masculine, no CONFIDENCE or self esteem, no talent etc. There's no reason for girls to date and give us sex. Humans want the things that are desirable and valuable.  Incels aren't attractive. We have NOTHING going for us. There's nothing interesting about us. We don't even know how to create chemistry with girls through conversations at all. NOTHING!

Something that incels dont try to do is fuck ugly unattractive women to fulfill their empty sex life. And why is that? Because we incels are mostly men and we want sexy beautiful women. We would reject a ugly FAT woman if she were to make a move on us. 

So that's why i don't understand why other incels like me blame women for not getting laid. I would never blame girls for my lack of sex. It's my fucking fault and always will be. I don't know what to do or where to start. I also get envious and very angry at teenagers my age who have sex. When I see a couple making out in the hallways in my highschool I pick fights with the guy and I often win. This one time I broke this boys nose in front of his girlfriend because she was a gorgeous girl that I can only ever DREAM of being with.  But I try not to fight to much or I'll get into more serious consequences so I do other stuff like steal boys phones and break it by stomping on it and flush it down the toilet but I only target boys with hot girlfriends. I fucking envy them so much... I hate them....

But back to the topic of the title, said incel I'm friends with has started to talk about how he plans to rape women in his college and other places. he says how he wants to drug them or kidnap them for sex so he can lose his virginity. He really has me worried about him and the women around him. Is there anything I can do or say to change his mind? If that doesnt work than will informing someone be nessesary? I don't want to get him in trouble. I really care about him. I've been friends with him for a while and he's always understood me.",08Jul2019,3

It almost sounds like when someone angrily knocks at your door except it's a wall. But we're not doing anything noisy. Tv is off, we don't have a dishwasher, even the lights are off. 
The worst thing is that we can't even locate where the noise is coming from. Sometimes it feels like a back wall, sometimes it feels like a ceiling. That's why I never went to confront the neighbour.

921," These ""friends"" were the closest I ever had. We talked everyday and everything seemed normal. Summer comes by and they no longer reply to my texts. I asked others to ask them if I did something wrong and they told me no but I don't believe that, they just cut all contact with me. I was always there for them whenever they had their difficulties and was willing to stop what I was currently doing to help them. Now they just decided to stop talking to me. I don't know what to do anymore, I gave them all I could and they left me. I find it difficult to make friends because I'm super shy and don't talk much. I'm pretty sure noone gives a flying fuck about me because noone has ever texted me asking me how I'm doing or if I wanted to hang out. I feel abandoned and I don't know what to do anymore, I've been having daily thoughts on just ending this horrible life I had been given but something just won't allow me to actually do it. Family isn't much help either because their solution is to ""just forget them"" but how can I just forget the people I trusted most and considered my closest friends? Now they hang out with a giant group of people and go out and get drunk (All under 21 which is the legal drinking age in my country). I should have noticed them trying to start cutting contact with me as they made plans right in front of me to go out and never asked if I wanted to join them. They even told me that I talk about my crush too much but I only make harmless jokes about her while they say some of the meanest shit I've ever heard about my crush, they also go on and on for hours sometimes talking about their crush (they have a crush on the same girl, I got a crush on another girl). This is gonna sound nuts and like I'm a stuck up dishrag but their crush prefers talking and being around me rather than them, I've treated her like a friend and she does too while one of them generally treat her pretty harshly and the other doesn't even talk to her, strange considering he has a crush on her but hey both of them said they only like her for body and nothing really else which is pretty shitty (She has rejected one of them about a year ago and rejected him again about a month ago but he just can't take no for an answer, sometimes I can see that she gets uncomfortable just talking to him). I think that they are trying to just cut me out so she can't talk to me anymore even though they all know who I have a crush on and told them that I wasn't interested in a relationship with the girl. Another crazy thing is that they talk shit about her because he got rejected or they think she's in a relationship with someone but they still have a crush on her (Guess they're incels). One of them literally never shuts up and constantly sings which sounds absolutely horrible on his microphone, and I supported him telling him he was doing great. The last few weeks they even ignored me when I talked to them face to face, one day I was feeling absolutely shit and after an entire day of not talking, smiling or doing anything really one of them asked if I was ok, we were in a hallway full of people so to avoid having a full mental breakdown I just said I'm fine.

He also knew that I was obviously uncomfortable with sexual touching in public.

Another thing that happened was: he tried to take my pants off multiple times even when I said ""no"" and ""stop"" multiple times. He did stop eventually but it still made me panic. 

I don't know why but it took me quite a while to realise that this behaviour was not normal. And I can't seem to get over the shame that I didn't say anything at the time and that I managed to still trust him after it and still wanted to spend time with him. He seemed like such a nice and trustworthy guy.

924,"Tl;dr at the bottom 

(On a throwaway because obvs personal stuff, though I doubt the friend surfs reddit) 

So I’ve been friends with H for 2 years. She’s a wonderful friend, and we’ve both been there for each other through some shitty times. 

H started seeing a guy (we’ll call him T) around October last year, and within a few months they were engaged and living together. I met him a few times at social events and although I thought the relationship was moving a bit quickly (she started seeing him within a couple of weeks of her splitting up with “the love of her life”) he seemed nice and genuinely caring towards H.

However in April of this year they broke up after he sexually assaulted her after a night out- turns out it wasn’t the first time he’d done it, and other girls have said he’s tried the same sort of thing in the past with them . He moved his things out not long afterwards, and I assumed they didn’t speak anymore unless absolutely necessary. I tried to be there for H as best as I could, but she wasn’t willing to talk about it at first, which is totally understandable (she’s a very closed off person anyways, and made out she was “used” to this sort of thing happening, so she wasn’t that bothered but nonetheless needed space to deal with the breakup) I respected this and told her when she was ready to talk I would be there, and would accompany and help if she decided to get police involved, 99% of the time I reached out to see how she was I was ignored, but I understood she needed time and didn’t push too much about it.

She said her and T hooked up a couple of times after they initially broke up, and she wouldn’t get police involved if he went to counselling and told his friends what happened (the counselling never happened, and his messages to me and his friends were basically along the lines of “this is what H has told me to say”), and she insisted that “maybe a few years down the line when he’s gotten the help he needs, we’ll bump into each other and get back together”. Eventually they fell out of contact and until recently I assume they hadn’t spoken for months, bar when discussing him getting his stuff back.

I met up with H a couple of weeks ago and she told me that her and T had been hooking up again for a few weeks (I had NO idea), and that he had assaulted her several more times in this timeframe. I won’t lie I was kind of horrified, and felt like a really shitty friend for not preventing this. 

She told me that she and T are convinced that he has some form of split personality, as he claims he cannot remember the assaults happening, but she says he appears horrified when she tells him about it, and is willing to tell the police everything. It might just be me being pessimistic but I feel like he’s talking shit, and has said he’ll talk to police on multiple occasions but never does.

I know I should’ve stepped in more and told her NOT to contact him, (I did tell her to block him and everything, but she wouldn’t and insisted she wouldn’t contact him unless absolutely necessary, I couldn’t really do much besides take her word for it) and I can’t be there 24/7, so she’d find ways to message him regardless.

I guess I’m just worried even though she’s said they’re done, they’re gonna get back in contact again (they’re still connected on all social media), which will lead to her hooking up and him and the same stuff happening all over again. She’s said it’s happened so much in the past with exes that rape/assault no longer affects her, so I don’t think she’s realising how severe the situation is. 

I feel like contacting the police myself but H is the sort of person to get rid of any evidence of the assault happening (ie. texts discussing it) and tell them I’m lying. 

I don’t know what to do. I just want my friend to be safe.

Tl;dr: Friend is on/off with her ex who has sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions, but he’s claiming some form of “split personality” to justify “not remembering” the assaults, she believes him. Want to contact police but know she’d likely destroy any evidence of the assaults occurring. Feeling like a really shitty friend for letting it get so far.",08Jul2019,1

I’m a 31F who has been diagnosed with posterior tibial tendonosis dysfuncrion (PTTD) as a result of chronic tears in my spring ligament and talofibular/calcaneofibular ligaments. All of these have led to arthritis in my midfoot and ankle. 

I don’t know how this happened exactly; it could have been an old injury from playing tennis or running on a beach, or it’s from power-walking 6% incline at 3.5mph. Either way, I noticed a big bulge on my arch my podiatrist suggested could be the beginnings of PTTD and prescribed green SuperFeet, which I’ve used religiously since December 2017. Fast forward to May 2019, and my foot was swollen beyond belief and I couldn’t go above 3% incline at 2.5mph. Went back, was told to wear a walking boot for 6 weeks, pending MRI results. 

Now that we have them, he says custom orthotics won’t be sufficient, and that I need an AFO (ankle-foot orthoses; Richie-style). He didn’t mention physical therapy—I assume because of the arthritis. He also doesn’t want to perform surgery on the foot because I’m “young” and he doesn’t want to limit mobility.

I am waiting to hear back about the AFO. I’m not supposed to wear the boot anymore, so I have purchased the TriLock brace which does help, but it still hurts when I’m walking or even just lying in bed. I’m not supposed to gym at all until I have the AFO. Going out and enjoying summer has been a bust because I’m always in pain. (I’m a professor, so this is my off-time.)

Now I’m looking for any tips about any of this:

1) Do you have any suggestions regarding the PTTD/arthritis, such as a way to enjoy life a little bit more right now? 

2) Will an AFO fit in any regular type of shoe, or should I be looking for something in particular? I really enjoy working out but haven’t been able to, so I’d love shoe recommendations for both exercise and work (I like all-black combat-style boots for work).

3) Should I be content with the treatment? The way he spoke about the AFO would be a “forever” kind of thing until it’s bad enough to warrant surgery. 

4) Until I get the AFO, should I avoid the gym completely, or would it be okay to use an exercise bike with the TriLock brace (with caution)?",08Jul2019,1

931,"A neighbor is intentionally drinking himself to death. He was hospitalized in January for a month after being discovered unresponsive on his kitchen floor; he was hospitalized again in May for three days after a wellness check found him sitting in a chair covered in his own faeces and urine. Both times he came home and immediately resumed drinking.

I'm new to the neighborhood, but from what I gather it's been a long time coming. He is in his 60s, has increasingly isolated himself over the last decade (girlfriend left, dog died), and is determined to die.

He has family and one friend. His mom is elderly and I'm told that she's not-all-there mentally. His brother lives about seven hours away, and his sister is about three hours away.

His brother and a high school friend who lives nearby are the ones who have intervened in the past. They had an intervention and brought AA to his home (I don't know when, but it sounds like it was within the last six months). I tracked down the phone numbers of his family (I don't know his friend's name). His sister is a psychiatrist, but she's never been mentioned by the neighbors - I am not sure they know that he has a sister.

What's the right thing to do? The options I see are to do nothing or contact some/all of his family. I don't expect a miraculous revival of his will to live, but it's hard to watch and do nothing.",08Jul2019,1

I had, however, one FWB who I have expressed to my boyf I had feelings for. To me it was a lot more than a fwb.

He has mentioned it 3 times in our 1.3 year relationship but it just hurts so badly to hear and makes me feel really, really cheap.
He apologises each time but today it made me cry as we are already rocky. He’s slept with a few more people than me but they were in committed relationships.

943,"I (17M) was at a course at a university recently which was organised by our schools. There I met a girl who was pretty cute and clearly seemed interested - going out of her way to talk to and smile at me, seemingly looking at me while I was looking elsewhere and playing with her hair somewhat nervously, as well as inviting me to sign in her row during a talk (though I wasn't able to for various reasons). Also she was *way* too enthusiastic when greeting me at times. 

 At the time I was very stressed due to a combination of a bit of social anxiety and a mishap during the course, so I never really got to talk to her much. I resolved to talk to her more on the last day and maybe ask her to remind me of her name or give me her number so I could get in touch again. 

Unfortunately, her school left earlier than expected and I didn't see her again.

  I was vaguely considering seeing if I could find her on Facebook or something, but realised I had forgotten her name. I should note that everyone wore badges with their full name and school for the first couple of days.   

I figure my chances are pretty much nil, but I was still wondering if anyone has any advice on trying to find her on some sort of social media to say hi. I've not got that much to go on, but I have a little: 

 1- was on the course, obviously (30-40 people attended)  

2- from my relatively small country (under 2m inhabitants in an area under 15000km^2) 

 3- I've got a photo of her, as a group photo was taken at the end of the course. That said, a reverse image search shows up no results, even though I got it directly from one of the university's Twitter accounts.  Useful for reference, if nothing else. 

4-  The uni *might* answer me if I ask which schools attended, in which case I would probably recognise the name, or could find out from their Twitter accounts etc which was the right one. If I could get that far, it might be possible to find her if they named her in their posts, or if she commented on them or something, but it's too many maybes.

5- People have suggested vague ideas about what her first name might have been, but not really clearly enough to be all that much use.

I'm not trying to be dodgy here, and I hope I haven't come off that way. I just don't really know what to do, and figured that since it's information I would had anyway (from the badge, if nothing else) and since she was interested, it might be worth looking into.

I’m 20 and have been working at my dream job for about 5 months. I absolutely love it and planned to be here for a long time. 

I met my boyfriend here and we started dating about 2 weeks into the job. I found out he was cheating on me with another coworker and instantly ghosted me. My boyfriend has been at this job for about 4 years. The girl he cheated on me with just started about 1 month ago. 

Since then I’ve been crying constantly at work. I get so incredibly upset and my coworkers can see how sad I am. Most of them are supportive of me and hate what my boyfriend did, while a few people say that I deserved to be cheated on. I’ve been doing a poor job at work since I just have to focus on not crying. 

I take my lunch and breaks in this little closet room where nobody goes so I can cry in peace. Everyday is just filled with me crying at work. 

I know I’m to blame because I ultimately put myself in this position. I decided to date a coworker and the risk it carried. I knew if we broke up it would hurt but I could still work. But to be cheated on with another coworker and have some people blame me, I couldn’t predict that. 

I loved this job and nowhere I go will make me as happy as my job I have now. But I haven’t been happy here for a few weeks and don’t know how to change it. My parents will be so disappointed when they find out I quit.

So after some time things got a little juicy and we started sexting, he wanted some pics (sent as well), so i sent some nakedish pics. Insisted on having a videocall but i rejected.  And then when we're done, i deleted the chat history. Later that day, i don't know why but it felt a little suspicious, so i checked his name from IG. I found his account but every pp he used in his social media (both the exchange app the texting app) was from that IG... Soooo idk if he's the guy he said he is.

949,"So, I have one big brother (M 27) and a younger one (M16).

My big brother (let's call him G) had a relationship in the past with a very young girl, she was still a minor when they were in a relationship. Here in my country it's not very uncommon for such things to happen as you always see younger girls wanting guys over 20, so I didn't pay much attention to it as I was young and didn't know any better. They ended up breaking up after 3 years and he fell into a state of depression cause he really cherished their relationship.

My younger brother (let's call him S) never really had any friends except from this year were he started hanging out with a new girl that transferred to his school and from that he also met countless other ppl.

 So S developed a crush on this girl but he found out and told me that G had been talking to her lately and he also told me that one day G asked him if he liked this girl, in which S bc he got caught off guard replied with a ""no"", which wasn't in fact true.

 I was EXTREMELY weirded out by the fact that my big brother had taken such interest in S's friend and I knew that his feelings weren't exactly friendly. My theories came true after S told me that G had confessed to his friend.

And I'm just very, very, VERY disturbed. He is 2 fkn 7 years old and she's a fkn 16 year old girl. He is ELEVEN YEARS OLDER than her, and what makes it even more disturbing is that she is A MINOR. I'm so frustrated by all this, I really am. I advised S to tell her to STOP talking to G cause she's giving him the green light to be even more creepy but not only did she NOT do that but today they met up with each other (she did not tell anything about this to S) and did GOD knows what.

What should I do about this? I have talked to him (G) about how wrong big age Gap relationships are, especially between an adult and a minor but he WONT listen to me. He makes my little brother feel ashamed and he also makes me at the same time feel the same way.

958,"In general, I’d like to learn how to be a better conversationalist, but I especially struggle with making conversation that doesn’t majorly involve ‘heavy’ topics, like politics, philosophy, religion, linguistics, or ethics. I enjoy talking about these things, but I find them difficult to bring up, especially around groups of people, as it’s hard to find common ground to start discussion. I also feel like it can devolve into me essentially describing a topic/subject to someone, which has condescending overtones that I hope to avoid. I still hope to retain some essence of these conversations, in that they are stimulating and can be built on later.

Perhaps I’m just looking for a way to initiate and maintain conversation about these topics in a way that people can contribute by highlighting curiosities or personal experiences without feeling like they don’t have some prerequisite knowledge about the topic.

On the other hand, I acknowledge these topics have some sort of dryness to them, so I want to find other topics that can engage a diverse group of friends. How could I initiate these conversations, maintain them, and find new topics to talk about later?

A potential example: “How would you describe the taste of beer?” I think it opens up conversation because everyone in my circle has had beer, but also there are different preferences. On top of that, you could go deeper into the topic, by asking “Is the bitterness enjoyable, or is it a good tradeoff since it gets you drunk” for example.",08Jul2019,1

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",08Jul2019,0

969,"So my mums overprotective. She’ll go through my phone without permission then lie to me claiming she never did. If I go 1/4 a mile away from where I said I was then she’ll ask me at least 4 questions on what I’m doing and while I appreciate her trying to protect me, she goes too far. Yesterday I was at a park with my friends cycling around and my mum texted me saying “where are you? What are you doing? Who are you with?” And I replied being honest. Then she said “come home right now” I asked why she said “because you’re coming in early”. This shocked me seen as I didn’t have to go in for another hour. She then called me but I was cycling so couldn’t get to my phone. When I stopped and checked she sent me a message saying “answer me or I’ll get you arrested. Me and my friends were in shock that she would say this. One of my friends said “your mums actually mental. I’d never want your mum as a parent” and then I went on a rant about her and I cried because I realised just HOW overprotective she was. I asked my mates if any of their parents did the things my mum did and they said no to all but one which was “do they go through your phone often?” To which one of my friends said yes but they asked him first. I genuinely couldn’t wait to move away from her just to feel less burdened. I wrote down what I am going to say to her and I’ll put it down below. If you want to tip me on things to add or delete then please do. Thank 

Mum, can I have a talk with you?
So I want to talk to you about how you act towards me but not in a negative way.
I feel that you are overprotective of me. 
What you said to me on text yesterday about how if I didn’t answer your calls you would get me arrested was way too far. When my friends heard it they genuinely opened their mouths and said “does your mum say that to you?”.
You always feel like a... I wouldn’t say burden but maybe a cloud looming over me. I can’t do anything without you needing to know. I appreciate that you’re just trying to keep me safe but I’m not going around jumping off of buildings am I? I’m not an idiot who would do risky stuff. Mainly because it’s risky. So I just feel like you need to lower your protectiveness of me. You act like I’m a china shop and that the worlds a bull.",08Jul2019,1

972,"I’m at a camp right now and next wednesday there’s a camp prom. Promposals are a HUGE deal to all the counselors and CIT’s and campers, and people go all out to ask people. I really like this boy who’s my age, and we’re friends from the camp and we’ve been talking alot. I want to ask him to go with me beacasue I don’t think he’s going to ask me. He’s just another stupid teenage boy who’s never going to take a hint that I like him, and I’m probably never going to see him again after this week. Should I ask him to go to the prom with me???!!",08Jul2019,1
973,"I’m having a quinceanera at the end of August. But I’m so stressed out because we haven’t gotten all of our stuff yet. So we are literally buying everything at once. But my mom decided to delay the surprise dances and all of that until 2 months before. So we are going to cram all of it into 2 months. Half way though my mom decided to change the theme and everything so we have to buy more stuff. And I’m so fucking stressed out that I no longer want to have one. She doesn’t tell me anything, and it’s so hard sometimes. She can’t stick to a plan. For example I specifically told her that we are meeting with someone for a puppy on July 8 ( today ) at 6pm. I told her weeks prior that we are going and she approved. Then when the day came at 5:30 pm, she told me we are no longer going. That broke me, she always does this and I get so many tension headaches and it’s hard communicating with her. I tried but since she speaks Spanish and it’s hard for me to understand sometimes. She would eventually would give up and stop explaining it to me. I had tried to have my relatives help translate but they ended up saying “ you’re Mexican, your supposed to know”. I always end up crying I can’t handle all the stress at once I just wanted everything to be planned out.",08Jul2019,1

975," I  have to ask someone to give something to somebody else.  (I have to tell to somebody ""heey can you give something you own to another guy ?"" ) At the end I  profit nothing (its a long story) all I want to give a hand too both of them but just  asking  that ""something"" goes against my principles .   
so is it good to step over my  principles and do something that I don t like to do just to give a  hand to someone ? why ?

976,"So, I (female) am back at my parents for a week and all of my friends are busy. There is a guy I have slept with twice over the last two years, who I normally meet on nights out when I am home. I am bored and horny and want to attempt to attract him using my feminine guiles to go on a one night trip to bone town (if he is single). 

How would be the best way to go about this? 

I was thinking maybe saying that I was only here for a week, and if he was still single if he wanted to go for a drink one night. 

Is lust blinding me or is this actually a good plan?",08Jul2019,1
977,"As the title says - my friends all vent heavy stuff to me that involve things way above my pay-grade and i try to offer my best support and advice to them always, of course, but the pressure is a lot. They dont trust anyone else to talk to about these things except from me and it feels like it’s my responsibility to keep some of them sane or alive. I try and convince them to talk to doctors/specialists/help-lines and they refuse, though they often take my advice otherwise. I feel flattered... but I have my own shit to deal with too. I work and am considering a second job, I do lots of extracurricular studying that takes lots of my time, I take intense subjects in college, I have clubs, I’m busy with activities whenever I’m not busy with work or school, I take care of my house/bills/appointments myself even though I’m the youngest in the household, I cook for myself for every meal. 

It’s exhausting talking for hours on end in the middle of the night, sometimes all night and not sleeping to make sure they’re okay and not alone. I go out of my way to help them, including cleaning their space when they’re too depressed to do so, cooking for them, teaching them basic life skills, helping them with school work, fitting in time to spend with them around a busy schedule etcetera. I don’t mind being there for them and being a friend like this, I actually enjoy it mostly, but it’s taking its toll on me and I don’t know how to deal with it. The last thing I want is to get frustrated with them and take it out on them - that’d be unfair. 

How can I deal with the pressure better?",08Jul2019,1

979,"So I'm an 18 year old guy. People have always said I was overly mature for my age, really intelligent blah blah... In retrospect I'm pretty sure they meant I didn't take any risk whatsoever, was a weirdo around boys my age and this kind of stuff.

Fast forward to now, I haven't ever had actual friends or social life, feel extremely lonely and have been taking antidepressants for 3 years. I had no problem talking to people in highschool but never fitted into any group because of how weirdly I talk and behave.

The thing is, I feel as if I had never been young and that I've missed on so much, specially now that I'm going to college and have no expectation of having any fun at all (college in Europe is way more serious and uninviting than how American colleges look on Hollywood movies). I even wished I could try again at highschool or could just take a gap year, but I know that nothing I do will bring me any closer to making friends.

So how do I go about not missing out on what's left of my teens?",08Jul2019,0
