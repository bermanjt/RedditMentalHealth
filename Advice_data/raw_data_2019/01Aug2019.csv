2,So I will be starting school in a couple of weeks. It has been about a month since I started my job. When I go back to school I will be about 2 months. The thing is my boss knows that I have school and I told her I will only be going Tuesday and Thursday. I go in at work at 8:30 to 1:30. during school I will be going from 11 to 1 on t and th. My boss had discussed how she wanted me to go in from 8:30 to 10:30. The thing is I don't drive. My mom does. But I wanted to ask my boss if I could go in on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays and extend my hours those days. I only get paid 7.25 an hr working at an income tax place. And my trainer was telling me that maybe they will be closing on Fridays since there is not much work. Would it be okay for me to discuss with my boss to go in only those days. My mom can't be driving me back and forth both those days.,01Aug2019,0
3,"VERY LONG POST

Hi,

I'm going to list some instances and am wondering if anyone thinks there is a probability that I was abused or if anyone has experienced similar things. I have no memory of anything happening but after being in therapy for over a year and a half and thinking of this on a daily basis for the past 4 or so years I'm starting to feel tired.

Instance 1: when I was a child, no older than six, I remember my cousin and me were kissing in an innocent manner -- quick peck on the cheek or lips. But one time I tried to shove my tongue in her mouth and make it sexual. I dont remember ever learning this from anything, but that seemed to be a natural impulse at the time. I'm a bit confused where I would have learned this from.

Instance 2: when I was in the second grade I remember trying to coerce my toddler cousin into kissing me (she didn't) and having pretty intense sexual feelings toward her, all while having an erection at the moment. It's strange because it seemed as if I wasn't fully aware of what I was doing. It was just happening. 

Instance 3: there was a large period of time in elementary school where I felt intense shame and hatred after masturbating to the point where I would cut myself.

Instance 4: when I was thirteen I remember being in a pool with the same little cousin and trying to grab her butt, again it seemed as if I had no awareness of what I was doing, as if something just took over. I never took anything further because she was asking me to stop and I felt gross for doing so. 

Instance 5: I ate psilocybin mushrooms when I was 16, had a terrible experience, experienced an ego death and at the height of the ego death my voice was telling me that something did happen to me and at that moment I was crying really hard. I remember during the trip trying to deny those thoughts but they continually came back and stronger until it finally came out. 

More recently within the past year I've had a lot of intense dreams of being raped, not only rape but other forced sexual acts. 

There are many more instances of odd sexual behavior as a child to my early teens and a very long history of intense guilt, shame, and anger.

As for my cousin, she has grown up normally as far as I can tell. I feel DISGUSTING thinking about my past actions, and I really want to talk to her about them so if there is anything going on internally she can be helped. 

Also: my brother had a long history of drug abuse but got sober after admitting he was molested by our older cousin (at one point we lived in the house, but not with the abuser) 

I wasn't sure where to put this post, so please redirect me if it does not belong.

If anyone wants to know more, please PM me. All viewpoints are/will be considered.

I thank anyone who has read this with every bit of me. 

Un'abbraccio forte!",01Aug2019,1

6,"Just remembered this incident that happened over 3 years ago. I was driving my friends car and I was on the lane about to pay for my toll but I had the ez pass thing that you mount on your windshield so I was on the express lane. 5 lanes all the way to the right I see this car drive past all the lanes heading my way. I was about to reach the toll anyway and I was hoping the driver was going to stop...but I stopped right away I thought he was going to hit my car! That guy was insane he basically was driving pretty fast passing 5 lanes. Anyway I just remember given him a dirty look and since I felt he didn’t hit me at all I went my way. When I got home, there was a tiny dent on the front right passenger side which my dad fixed right away. Now that I think about it, i should’ve said something then but I honestly didn’t think he hit me. Would’ve that been my fault? I was on my lane and that asshole literally drove all the way from 5 lanes away without stopping. It’s not like I was not letting him merge. He should’ve stopped and looked.",01Aug2019,2
7,"So 6 months ago I started working at a restaurant. The manager quickly took a liking to me doing things yelling ""he's so handsome"" as I walk by. Telling me to stop being so pretty. Telling people she was going to marry me. Telling me I'm cuter when I smile and not to go home because she'll miss me too much. Pretending to give me a BJ at a employee meeting. When we would talk she could very close and hold my gaze even in silence. I really liked this girl but I'm pretty inexperienced and have anxiety when it comes to that sort of thing, so I just played it off like cold and aloof. So eventually she started to resent me since she thought I didn't like her or rejected her. This all happened spread out over 6 months with other things she did I can't recall right now. So eventually I decide to quit because it wasn't working out there. When she found out she looked at me dead in the eyes with a facial expression like her dog just died.  Which made me feel like shit the next few days. My last day comes and we don't say anything until the end of my shift she says a meeting that week was canceled. So I said cool since I hate going to them. And she said ""yea I bet you're happy since you don't want to see me anyway"". I didn't respond to that and just went home pissed that she would think that way. It's been almost 2 months since I stopped working there and I do go eat there once a week initially when I would go I would see her still looking at me, but recently she hasn't been there and my former coworkers are acting very weird and cold to me. How do I stop thinking about this girl and move on. There have been a lot of girls more attractive than her giving me attention lately but I just can't seem to stop thinking about her. I don't know why she's stuck in my head. How do I move on?",01Aug2019,1

9,"BROKEN INTO PARTS: PREFACE ( CONTEXT), MAIN (THE ISSUE) and OTHER (MISC INFO). THIS IS LENGTHY, SORRY.

PREFACE: My friend, S, is a 21 year old female and I am a 23 year old male. We went to high school together and after I graduated (a year before her) we stayed in contact on a consistent basis. To date, she is basically my only friend and she exploits this periodically. Anyway, she had a kid two years ago of whom she has sole custody of and takes care of. However, she doesn’t keep jobs, she rarely has her own transportation and her living situation often goes from her living with her mom to living with her dad to living with her grandparents to living with some random guy to living with one of her friends. Her life is unstable. It may also be important to note, she indulges in regular use of marijuana and sporadically uses other drugs recreationally (about 3 years ago was on methamphetamine of which she is now sober from; random drug use also includes inhalants, pills, cocaine, and others but not in an addicted constant basis) and drinks. She enjoys to “party,” have sex, etc. Myself on the other hand am more responsible. I work a great job with great benefits and pay, just bought my own home, am taking college classes to get my bachelors, own a car and have very little if any debt. I’m fortunate enough to have a savings account. I have never done a drug in my life and I don’t engage in any activities that could destruct or damage my life at all. She is basically my only friend, however, which is bad. 

MAIN: My friend S [21F] called me earlier and asked me if I could give her 300 dollars to buy a car. I’m fortunate enough to have a good job and a savings account. She on the other hand does not keep a stable job. She’s been working at chipotle, however, for the past few months and it seems to be going well. But, around 3 weeks ago she took time off work because she claims she was being stalked by an ex boyfriend and he was harassing her at work, etc and she had to basically hide out in her house for two weeks and file a restraining order. During that period she wasn’t working and thus didn’t have a paycheck. She has a 2 year old son. I feel for her, so when she asked me for 100 dollars, I gave it to her willingly out for the sake of being nice. She then, a few days later asked me for another 20 of which I gave and she asked me for yet another amount of money I cannot currently recall of which I also gave. When she asked for more, I explained to her that while I could give her the money, I wouldn’t because I’m not an ATM and she needs to figure something else out. Me being responsible with my finances and my life does not mean I should taken advantage of and exploited. She took that as meaning I was mad at her and that she would just call me for stuff less. Which was fine i really didn’t care, the only time I hear from her anymore is when she needs something. Our relationship is very unhealthy for me but once again at this current point in time she’s my only friend and being alone is extremely depressing. She calls me today and asks me for money to buy a car. She’s done this in the past, asking me like 4 months ago if I’d loan her almost a 1000 for a car and she’d “completely pay me back,” of which I doubted she’d pay back and I refused to loan her a dime. Anyway, this last phone call she asked for 300 (which is a more reasonable amount to ask to borrow than 1000) to buy a car and that she would pay it back. She states the car she had before was taken from her (idk by who). She then explained to me that if she doesn’t have a car she can’t get to work, if she can’t get to work she won’t have any money and if she doesn’t have any money I’m aware that she and her kid will probably be screwed. I hate looking out for people and being a genuinely good person because in the end I will always feel taken advantage of. But I don’t want to see people that I could’ve helped end up in a worse situation. I want her to get her stuff together and I want her to have a stable life. Her having a stable job for this amount of time (4 months) definitely alludes to the fact that she may be in fact trying to have some level of stability and I’m aware that she does need a car to get to work. But I can’t keep giving her money like this. It feels selfish to say no. But I’m not sure if I should just give her the Loan or tell her once again to figure something else out. Please advise.

OTHER: S and I have no romantic relationship, no sexual relationship and that’s not what this is about. I’ve spent some time wondering whether not I would even consider giving money like this to male friends however I believe I completely would if they actually asked. She also mentioned to me I’m the only responsible person she knows that would be able to help her in this situation which is why she asked me.




tldr; my friend asked me for 300 dollars to buy a car. Says she’ll pay me back. She’s never been stable though so idk if I believe this. Also worth noting she recently asked me to give her other various amounts of money (100; 20; maybe 60?) which I gave her. I don’t want to keep being taken advantage of but I don’t want to have her end up in a worse situation if I could have helped at that moment. Would you give the loan? I’m genuinely stuck. Sorry this post is so long, ended up venting but also wanted to provide context.",01Aug2019,0
10,"Wanted to post this on r/AskReddit, but wasn’t sure I could get my question across concisely enough.

I’ve been watching those YouTube vids where they sit two people down and have them ask some pretty deep questions to each other and answer them as sincerely as possible, and I started thinking, “wow I don’t really have those kinda talks with—well, anyone really”.

So I’ve been thinking, maybe I should start trying to have an annual meeting with my wife where we really lay it all out: how we’ve been doing, where we’re trying to go, what worked, what didn’t, things to work on, etc. Eventually, once our kids are old enough, maybe we could include them as well. 

So here’s the question: do any of you have some sort of “state of the union” kinda meeting with your family (or something similar)? If so, has it worked? Is there anything you’d do differently? Any other advice that might help?",01Aug2019,1
11,"I've been about 10 years in the job I'm in, and I haven't been able to do it for the last year.

I've read the reports etc.  The last ten years, dealing with work that involves child abuse, clerical abuse, murder, manslaughter etc.  The last six months have been kind of easy dealing with medical stuff,  but I can't face any more work about sexual abuse or infants dying.

12,"My best friends younger brother is 15. He really likes Tik Tok (the lip syncing app, I know, cringe) and has quite the following. Apparently he has made friends on there. He told his older sister that he was talking to a girl who was 19 and said she ""had a crush on him"" and is now asking him to face time. I really don't want to get the parents involved because brother and my friend have a great relationship and I don't want to be invasive but this is wrong. I don't have a good gut feeling about this person who claims to be a 19 year old girl, and the kid is underage anyway. My friend and I don't know the extent of the conversation, but according to her its been going on since at least July 4th. Should she contact authorities about this person? Should one of us reach out to this girl and tell her that what shes doing is illegal? I know its not exactly my place but I've known this kid since he was a baby so hes kind of like a younger brother to me as well.

13,"So my wife (21f) and me(23m) and probably gonna get kicked out. Not to fill in some story, we've been staying with my wife's family for about 7 to 8 months now. Her family is very religious.

16,"


I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

17,So why is it that when I have two days off I feel like it’s just not enough. I think four should be the minimum maybe longer. And I’m not joking about this.,01Aug2019,1
18,"2 and a half years ago, when I was 18, I started University and felt as though I was in a really good place. I was enjoying life. For the first time in my life I felt confident, happy and content. I was living with my parents while I had a job in basically the next town over.

Shortly after beginning uni I met my now ex-girlfriend (20 at the time), whom I love deeply more than anything. She is a strong, witty and unimaginably intelligent woman. Far more intelligent than I am. I miss her outlook on life more than anything. She's formed the kind of person I am today, and everytime I get passionate about the things I care about, I can't help but be reminded of the influence she's had on me. I would honestly be a completely different person if I hadn't met her so early. I don't think anyone will ever have the same impact on me again. Thus, we a very similar. She's caused me to have incredibly high personality standards.

I still think of the time we were playing a board game and she freaked out on me for winning and flipped the board. She was upset immediately that she got angry at me. (She's very competitive, and incredibly good at fortnite, haha). All I could do was laugh. We were sitting on a mattress on the floor at the time ( our bed frame broke )With tears in her eyes and on her cheeks, she stared at me. All she did was tell me she loved me. It's my favourite memory in the world. But I guess it's only that, a memory.

However, soon after our relationship began I lost my job, and failed to provide for her monetarily. We lived off her AusStudy and help from her mother and occasionally my grandparents. I was not eligible as my parents make too much money. Neither of us could drive. There were a plethora of other issues too, which I'll probably get into later. I miss her so much, it's been 9 months since we broke up, but only recently have I realised that I still love her deeply. Nobody I've met in the last year has compared to her, I wish I had tried more. Hindsight is an asshole, haha. I'm an asshole, really.

Within one month of breaking up, I was able to get a job. Mostly because I was desperate to get back together with her. That didn't happen. I now rent an apartment with my brother who is rarely home. I don't have any friends due to my relationship being an incredibly co-dependent one, thus I lost contact with my old friends (we only really talk on FB) and failed to make any at University due to spending all my time with my ex. I moved in with her and her mother within two months of knowing her, sufficed to say it was not a good environment.

I also have OCD, or Pure-O if you want to be technical about it. It causes me to near constantly have intrusive thoughts that permeate throughout my mind about various things. Thus I always carry around an immense feeling of guilt. I feel the need to confess things to people, even things I haven't even done, constantly to make my intrusive thoughts go away. I also have small rituals that you may think of when you think of conventional OCD, but they don't cause me as much pain as the intrusive thought.

As you may be able to tell, my outlet for such things was my ex-girlfriend. She was very understanding, however it was an immense burden on her and was one of the main reasons we broke up.

The final two reasons why we broke up are my poor emotional control, and I threatened to break up with her almost going through with it. On reflection, I realise this was due to my poir emotional control. I would constantly hurt myself or become erractic whenever I had an intrusive thought, or was angry or sad about something as a way for me to deal with the pain. It distracted me I guess, but it was rather scary to an onlooker. I've done this since I was a small child. At the moment I am in an awful place and stress constantly about things when I am home alone.

I was seeking help for a time, but it became far to difficult for me to schedule appointments between uni and school. I am trying to get back in touch with my therapist to start again. I don't take any medication nor have I ever been prescribed any. 

At work I live in constant fear of getting fired. I think I do a great job and do my best, but regardless I'm worried about being replaced at any second. 

I am terrified about being a bad person and this is where most of my obsessive thoughts stem, to the point where I will avoid socialising with anybody even though I desperately want to. I'm terrified of rejection. I have only ever been asked out myself, haha. Thus I have no idea what it's like. I'm too scared of people finding me creepy. I lack confidence, but on the flip side am incredibly vain. I care far to much about my appearance to the point of obsession, it helps me keep hygienic and looking well, but it's a little too much.

So all in all, I'm doing well. I have a job, an apartment, I go to university, I'm starty to work out and look after myself physically. And at the end of the month I have a test for my driver's licence. But I feel so hollow and empty. Purposeless. Helping people has started to bring me so much joy and purpose lately, but opportunities for that are few and far between. I'm terrified of being a bad person, and I am because I'm complaining about my relatively small issues on the internet to strangers. Heck, I only said that so people would tell me their not small, validation huh?

Anyway thank you for reading my incredibly dumb and poorly constructed sob story.",01Aug2019,1
19,"So for starters I went to the doctor today and got but on buspirone for anxiety, anyway I just took my first pill like an hour ago and now I'm feeling strange.

Like, I get that it's suppose to mellow you out or calm you down but it's not a sedative drug like Xanax or Valium. It says I can take up to two a day, but I was just planning to take one in the morning and one at night. Don't get me wrong, like I'm glad it seems to be working instantly. I certainly do feel a bit more mellow and relaxed than I have been in years, but the mellowness came on all at once. It was like a wave washing over me.

30,"I am a 21 year old chemistry major who is currently registering to go to Clemson University. I will be transferring from a small school where I was a junior. Transferring to clemson will give me sophomore status with credits most likely. I will need to have two years to finish the BS, taking no less than 17 credits a semester and maybe a summer course. 

The degree at clemson is high quality. The issue is money. At clemson, financial aid will allow me to have about $5000 per year, all federal loans + grants. I do not have family financial support so I will have to pay through a private loan most likely.  This is also problematic since I will need a cosigner on these loans. I have gone to everyone in my family and no one, absolutely no one will be a co signer. I dont know what I can do about this. 

I can work a part time job, to ensure I have rent money. But this will never come close to doing anything regarding my loans.

By the time I finish, since I already have more loans, I would be around 100k debt, if not more. I have a previous loan that requires $427 a month after graduation. I am not independent financially for government aid purposes as I am under 24. I would like to know if anyone knows of any programs or loans or other alternatives that would be helpful compared to the high interest private loans I know of, which I may not get if no one cosigns. Tuition or payment plans are due August 15.

Is there any way that I can gain independent status so I can try and get some more financial aid money. None of my family will help so I am alone in this. Any advice is good advice.",01Aug2019,1

32,"I want to start this off by saying i’m 18. My 2 friends and I want to move to A big city a couple of hours from where we currently live. We want to work and save money to go to college or technical school in a year or two. I have a job where I work at most 6 hours a day and make $10/hr. I have a car insurance payment of $250 every month, I have to pay for gas, I have some other bills as well. My main question is, how do I get to a new city, get a place without a job, and then get a job? Like, I can’t get a job without a place to live, and I can’t get a place to live without a job. I’m currently saving as much as I can from the job I have now, and figure I need to save around $1,000-1,500 to be able to have enough money for a month to pay deposit, 1/3rd of the first month rent, and my bills. How can I do this? It seems almost impossible, but I really want to get out of my hometown. Thanks",01Aug2019,1
33,"I work 2nd shift right now, 5pm to 1am. It's stress free, and causes me no anxiety, it pays well, and offers good benefits. The down side is that I can't have much of a social life. I can see some friends on Saturday, my family on Sunday, and that's it. Ive been spending a lot of time alone.

I was just offered day shift position for a similar job. I could have a ""normal"" life again, but I'd make a dollar less per hour, and stress and anxiety would set back in.

My friends and family are all telling me I should take the day job. But I really don't mind my night job that much. I'd really rather stay where I'm at. It's easier. But then again... is the night shift spoiling me? Should I challenge myself, and force myself to be around people again? Am I missing life experiences by working a night shift job?

What do you guys think? Should I take the offer?",01Aug2019,1
34,"I’ve liked her for months. She has all the same hobbies as me, the same sense of humour, the same political beliefs. She’s beautiful. We bond over the simplest things, and I feel so far away from her no matter how close I am. I have told someone I know how I feel about this girl, and they said that I would be a good match for her and that I might as well try. But I have such a low self esteem that asking her would require all my willpower. There is a very high-functioning depression within me, and I can talk to anybody and articulate myself with ease. But this one combination of words, this invitation, I can’t do. If I were to be rejected, I wouldn’t know how to take it. I’ve already been rejected twice in the span of the past 3 years and I don’t think I could handle a third time. And if she somehow likes me for who I am, somehow thinks I’m a good or interesting person, what do I do then? I would inevitably fuck it up. I would need so much research into how to talk to someone who genuinely likes you. All my life people have given me this odd objective but not subjective value. People say I am attractive, but not to them. They say “why are you single”.  And the only thing I’m good at is research. I have searched for hours on the internet for ways to make someone love you, things to do with a new relationship in the best case scenario, ways to improve yourself and talk about loneliness in a constructive community. I’m glad I was never dragged into the incel movement. But I hope that I do somehow figure out my character flaws, why people won’t like me, and what I can do to make them like me. But I shouldn’t ignore the main question I am asking here.
Should I ask her?

Almost every night they get together and smoke and drink and they know that I don't want to nor am I comfortable being around people who drink because of my extensive family history of drug and alcohol addiction. After me asking them to hang out and constantly getting shut down I decided to wait for them to reach out to me and I haven't heard from them since. I have no problem with people drinking and smoking. I've told them that. I'd just rather not be around while it's happening. Is it really that big of a request to set the drinking aside and hang out.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

44,"So I need some advice because honestly I just don’t even know what to do. So I work for a school and at the end of the year we were told in our region we would be given a cost of living increase of $1,000. So I’ve worked for this school for a year and honestly they are pretty good to us. I’ve never received this big of a raise and had this many benefits so I am pretty grateful. Well, we have an end of the year meeting and are told they are actually only giving cost of living increases to those who live in city limits. Very few of us live outside of the city limits but for the ones who do it’s just a small town right outside of the city. There are few small towns surrounding the large city. Well I just moved a month before this announcement buying my first home outside of the city limits in a small mountain town. My commute is like 30 minutes and it’s our dream home. I assumed (my bad) that the cost of living was lower in our town so I signed my contract to return for the following year grateful for everything I have. Well I did some research and my cost of living in our town is actually 8% higher and on top of my commute (which I chose) it feels like they intentionally didn’t check where everyone lived and if the cost of living would be beneficial for all. I feel like an idiot because I didn’t argue it when the conversation occurred but at the same time I feel defeated because I missed out on enough money that could help with gas, groceries, or even our utilities. 

I guess I’m seeking advice because I feel like I messed up and should have spoken up sooner so I should just deal with it or is there even anything I could do? I feel played but I know I have my own part in it.",01Aug2019,1

46,"I received a formal reprimand email at work today from the owners, about a reduced quality of my work performance. I'm not contesting that, I have made errors lately and understand they are frustrated. The email however was sent to an address that is not mine, but recently opened up password-wise with the intent that an assistant who is family friend of theirs and would also be checking it to help me with my increasing workload. I know they forgot about this, because hours earlier in the day I had reminded them that the email was now being shared. We clarified then that emails of a sensitive nature shouldn't be sent to it.

Some time ago, I received a different formal reprimand, for taking too many sick days. I'm also not contesting that, as I'd taken 5 sick days over the course of 5 months, and it was against policy despite some circumstances on my end. That time, the reprimand was cc'ed to an email that is only checked by one other person who is not in any way shape or form my supervisor. She is a part-time assistant who helps everyone in the office out, and is also a close personal friend that the owners consider family, and have known since one of them was literally a baby.

With the exception of one recent hire, I am the only person in the office who isn't a long time close personal friend of the owners, who are a married couple. They often talk about all aspects of their lives with these people, loudly and publicly, and because it is an open office with no real cubicles or desk, everyone can hear everything. When they get upset with me over something, they yell and demand I explain to them repeatedly what happened, each time insisting they don't understand. It's stressful but sometimes work is stressful and I understand that. Especially if I've made a mistake. However everyone can hear them yelling at me, and saying they have no confidence in my work. I can feel stares, see winces, know I'm being avoided a little extra after. It is an extremely uncomfortable environment.

I understand that at least to certain degree I am being a little bit too sensitive, and that I need to toughen up. However, I do feel that I'm justified in being uncomfortable with formal reprimands being what feels like to me openly shared with others in the company instead of emailed directly to me. I feel like at least that should be private and when it isn't it feels very humiliating. How can I respectfully bring this up with my bosses without them getting even more angry with me?

50,"Yes. Someone threw SHIT onto my balcony. About a month ago I (24 M) moved into a new apartment downtown with two roommates. It’s in a tall apartment complex and came with a great balcony that is bigger than most of the other units so it sticks out about 10 feet further than the other balconies. It wasn’t more than a night of being here that we noticed cigarettes constantly being on our balcony. Despite it being a no smoking community, it only slightly annoyed me because I’m not one to let a cigarette butt ruin the awesome apartment we moved into.  But it kept happening until one day last week we came home to a burnt hole in our new patio furniture. And the following day someone threw a god damn whole orange down from what must have been the top floor because it hit and splattered everywhere. At that point I complained to the front desk but there is obviously nothing much they can do without knowing the exact unit (there are 24 more balconies above us) besides sending a mass email that no one will read. It bummed me out so I just began paying more attention. My roommate suggested putting a motion detecting camera outside to see if we could catch whoever was doing this. I thought that was overkill for the current circumstance. Then this morning my roommate was outside the patio and down came a sort of baby wipe. Covered in (I hope) dog shit. The balcony above us has a dog and they always keep it on the patio. To add to it, there is always a little girl babysitting two toddlers and I wouldn’t doubt she did it but I can’t be sure. Complained to the front desk they said take pictures and continue to keep and eye on it. Long story short, I immediately hooked up the motion detecting camera and it is now pointing up at the 10 or so balconies above ours. No, it can’t see into other people’s homes or anything it can only see the balconies. I’m hoping someone throws something and we catch them and this can be done with. Are we dealing with this appropriately or how would you handle it if someone threw (possibly human) shit onto your balcony. Any advice helps we love our new place but this really sucks.",01Aug2019,1
51,"So I have done terrible things.... 2 really main terribly fucked things but only as a young child. Even illegal. But I’ve discussed these situations with family and friends and they’ve reassured me I’m not a horrible person. They’ve showed me incredible compassion and gave me the benefit of the doubt when I couldn’t even do that for myself. It’s because they know how sickly I worry and how benign I’ve always been so they don’t doubt me. and As crazy as the situations were, I didn’t have any real ill intent when committing them. And this is where that ends, I won’t go into further detail because I owe no one can explanation and you don’t either! Normally, I would be posting everywhere asking for reassurance on these matters. However, the number one rule of helping OCD is to get rid of reassurance seeking. So I won’t do it. I’m posting this here to help others. I’ve seen many posts on here where people worry about being a bad person. And I’m here to tell you it’s not as black and white. It takes a lot to be a bad person. Even 2-3  fucked up situations (obviously not everything) don’t guarantee you being evil. A bad person does not care that they’re bad or even think they are, I can assure you that. Also, people who have been bad can change. Even the worst people. On a more ambiguous note, do we really know what makes us bad or not? (Again, not including not deeply morally wrong decisions such as rape etc) there’s layers to each and every one of us. Some negative information that you could say “incriminates” us, positive information that spins us more in a positive light. That’s exactly my situation. Yes I’ve done messed up things but so has every human being. Even the Pope. Whether you believe you’re bad or not, the truth will always exist. Judgement always comes to pass. There’s no concrete reassurance that we’re 100% good because we’re NOT. Chances are, if you’re doing more worrying that you’re a bad prison then actually doing bad things, you’re good.",01Aug2019,1
52,"TL;DR: pretty much the title. My cousin passed away, I was given her locked android phone. No one close to her knows the password, and if possible, I’d like some help on how I might go about bypassing the lock. 


I apologize in advance if this post has too much or unnecessary detail; writing this will be the first time I’ve really opened up about it in general. So if this post doesn’t fit purpose of this sub, my bad. 

A bit of (lengthy) backstory to follow up with the title:


about 10 months ago, my older cousin passed away. She was my mom’s favorite niece, and my favorite cousin, my friend. And I miss her every day. 

My mom helped clear out and sort the personals from the hospital room, found my cousin’s phone, and asked my aunt if she could could keep it so she could save the photos on her computer (my cousin was HUGE on taking and sending us selfies. Like so so many). 
My aunt gave it to her, but let her know she didn’t have the password.

Since Her death hit me really, really hard, so my mom didn’t let me know about the phone til a couple of Weeks later. 

So When my mom told me about wanting to go through her pictures, I told her I would do so first, so I could delete  anything I know my cousin wouldn’t want my mom to see. 

(As I mentioned before, my cousin and I were friends. So unlike the relationship she had with my mom, we knew some more “personal/private” things about each other) 

My mom agreed, then told me she wanted me to keep the phone instead in case having it would help me feel close to her, and just save the photos for her. 

Anyway, that’s how I came to have the phone. 

I went and bought a charger cuz it was dead, charged it, and saw my cousin’s face as the lock screen wallpaper. Which I knew was there, but I still wasn’t prepared to see, so put the phone in my dresser and that’s where it’s been ever since. 

I tried googling methods to bypass phone passcodes, but didn’t find anything helpful and it was really just a bit too much to deal with at the time. 

It still is now. but with the anniversary of her death coming up in a couple months, my mom and I were talking about her and memories etc. 

So I guess this is kind of a last resort. If anyone has any ideas or anything, it’d be a big help.",01Aug2019,1

So I am currently in a LDR with my boyfriend (I’m in Indiana, he’s in California), it’s been about a month and it’s going great. Anyhow, I recently turned 18 on the 23rd of this last month (today’s the 31st for me) and he is turning 17 this December. I met him before I turned 18 and I had my birthday after we began dating. 

Is this wrong of us to pursue? Neither of us have voiced any discomfort with it, our friends haven’t as well.

I can't consciously move her into any NCO positions like this and conventional methods of training have been ineffective thus far. 

I've elected to meet her on our off time to try some exercises. What I had in mind was just no-pressure, impromptu speeches and simple chatting to start with in an office environment. Then I sit further and further away and just challenge her to project so I can hear her while we shoot the shit about whatever. 

I'm leaning towards her chronic quietness being more of an anxiety issue, so I figured this would be a good start. I'll have about 20 minutes this ""session"" to work with her. Any other exercises I could try?

Now, retail is alright..it's alright as a starting job, and it's alright if you do decide to go with it for the rest until retirement but it's not something I wish to pursue for the rest of my life.

66,"The title really says it all.   


I live with my girlfriend of 6 years and we have (had?) more or less decided to get married, but I insisted she allow me to make the proposal (which isn't happening for a variety of reasons, including lack of a ring etc).  


My only friend (literally) I've known since we were 14 and he lives about an hour and a half away.  


Essentially, the crux of the matter is that they are not friends nor will they ever be. I'm okay with that. They can and frequently do act friendly and cordially to each other on the rare instances they cross paths in one form or another. However, whenever there is any kind of conflict each of them makes the same argument to me and it usually goes something like this (when I say 'they' assume I mean friend is talking about girlfriend or vice versa):  


""They're too controlling and demand too much of your time (usually with the implication that I could then use some of that time to spend with whomever is saying it)"". ""They said mean things to/about me and you should have defended me / my position"". ""I would never ask you to choose between me and them, but things can't continue on in the same way that they are."" etc. etc.  


This leaves me feeling caught between them. The details are irrelevant because I'm not asking for you to judge who is 'wrong' be it my girlfriend or my only friend. I realize that I've been put in this position (now, in the past, and possibly in the future) by my own inaction, desire to avoid conflict, and passivity. I always make the choice of least resistance or, in one way or another, pass the responsibility of actually choosing onto someone else. This, in turn, supported my passivity because I ultimately did not have to decide and could  delude myself into thinking that I had somehow played the role of diplomat and it was the fault of whichever person backed out that they were not up to the task of negotiating a compromise.  


In the past, this has actually meant that either my girlfriend did things (angrily or at her emotional expense) to ensure that my friend and I can be together and work on our non-trivial goals. Or, my friend becomes frustrated and terminates whatever project we had set out on together because he feels that the girlfriend is too much of a disruption to the project. So, if I choose to support my friend, who for all intents and purposes is my brother and longest lasting relationship, the girlfriend may choose to leave me under the complaint that she feels I always choose him. If I choose the girlfriend, who I would marry, who has impacted and improved my home and life in so many ways, the friend will say I once again chose her over him and will for all purposes stop being my friend because I never choose him.   


So, as the title said, how do I choose? On what basis do I evaluate the value of each relationship so as to compare which one I should support in any particular instance? Do I always choose the girlfriend under some arbitrary and outdated sense of loyalty to the idea of creating a family? Do I always choose the friend who has supported me in literally every way (including giving me a place to live and food to eat rather than see me be homeless)? Can the two things even be consistently compared on any basis that ins't arbitrary or giving undue importance to one relationship or another.   


How do I choose?

69,"long post

i was ""relieved"" from my job today. it was only a summer job and i was set to leave in two weeks to go back to college. i worked at a local animal hospital in the kennels cleaning, boarding, feeding, etc. to help with credits/hours towards vet school in the future. 

my boss is apparently notorious for not giving out schedules on time; i only experienced this at the beginning of july when i didn't get my schedule until two weeks into the month, and the last week of the month still wasn't filled in. i normally work full time tuesdays and fridays with alternating weekends, but this week i wasn't on the schedule at all until this weekend, and my normal tuesday was taken by the other part time college employee who normally works wednesdays and thursdays. last night i get a call, while out of town, asking if i could come in to help out tomorrow (10.5 hour shift, not a busy job AT ALL) because there was only one person that would be working. one of the other full time employees has been out for a few days due to family issues, and the other is already 4 hours overtime (my boss' words exactly). i tell her i won't be able to come in because i had already made other plans for the week, which i don't think is unreasonable since i had the entire week off and it's my summer break after all. I think it over and leave a message about 30 minutes after closing time saying I could come in at 1:00 and help out for the last half of the day. 

she leaves a message for me this morning (from a phone number that wasn't the office's) around 11:00 saying she didn't listen to my voicemail, but i don't need to come in today and to give her a call when I could, while i was driving home. the office opens at 7:30. I run some errands, do what I needed to do for the day and call her, only for her to tell me that it was ""irresponsible"" for me to not come in when she ""thought we had agreed I would"". which we never agreed to. to add, the previous night when she first called, i begrudgingly said i could come in at 2:00, since i already had plans for my days off, to which she responded, ""i've never asked for any favors from you before"" (running to the store to get dog food would be a favor, not this, we aren't friends). she proceeds to tell me over the phone that i was let go. I said thank you for the opportunity and she hung up. 

all of the other employees have complained about her not giving out schedules in time, not keeping track of overtime, not putting in orders in time (the whole hospital was out of paper towels for a week), and not hiring permanent kennel help, since two of the five employees would be going back to school in august. 

to me, it kind of seems a little unreasonable of her to fire me for this. she is the one who is supposed to keep track of her employees' schedules and make sure they don't work overtime, she knew that one of her employees would be out for a few days, because she had already been informed of this days prior. if the schedule was kept normal, i would have worked my tuesday, friday, and weekend and there wouldn't have been an issue. even if she had called me the day before, i would have had more time to change my plans and not leave town for my days off. to me it seems that she was the one who was ""irresponsible"". 

the part of me that doesn't blame myself for everything that goes wrong feels like she was looking for a reason to fire me. i pride myself in my work ethic; i'm a hard worker and i always make sure to go above and beyond. but unlike the other part time college employee, my dad doesn't work there, and i've been a little bit of an outcast since i started working there. i've always gotten the feeling that my boss didn't really like me, for some reason. i want to think that they hired someone else to work, which is good for the other kennel staff, because if they really needed an extra person, i would think she would have at least allowed me to come in at 1:00 to help out and then fired me afterwards. or maybe the other college employee asked her to work more hours, and that's why she got my tuesday. and i've never given her a reason before to fire me or think badly of me. 

now i'm worried about how this will look on my vet school application in the future, and if i should even use the hours that i've earned this summer. 

advice? reassurance? similar experiences? anything helps.",01Aug2019,2
70,"I’ve kept my hair short for years now and it took my mother a while to get used to. She has trauma from being in the hospital for years due to multiple cancers. 

A lot of seemingly simple things bother her greatly due to these memories. 

Anyway, when I first got my hair cut she would make passing comments that were really hurtful to me, until I told her how they made me feel. We made up after that, but it is still difficult for her to see me with short hair. 

It kind of hit me one day when we were arguing about it and she told me that I would look like a cancer victim if I got my hair cut. 

I’ve been having trouble finding a job due to my blue hair. I want to cut off the dyed tips (which would make my hair very short), but my parents suggest I dye it natural instead (due to her aversions I’m assuming). 

I know I want to go through with this even though I will be criticized for doing so. Is there a way to handle the guilt more effectively, or to talk to my mother about it?

I know that the internet is the last place to go, but this topic has been a real (seemingly menial) power struggle for us. 


Also, side note, my parents are absolutely lovely people and not controlling in any way. I don’t want people freaking out saying my mother is “manipulative” or something.",01Aug2019,2

72,"I'm a bisexual woman who recently moved in with my roommate is also a bisexual woman. I've always thought she was incredible and she's been my best friend for the past year, but since we moved in together, I've liked her more and more. 

I also have a longterm boyfriend. We've been together for about a year and a half now. I love him dearly.

My roommate and I got drunk about a week ago. You can probably see where this is going. I had absolutely no idea she had feelings for me but I confessed and we ended up kissing a couple times.

I started acting very off when I was around my boyfriend, for obvious reasons. He picked up on it, and I ended up telling him what happened. He was rightfully pissed and we broke up, but now he wants to get back together. I still love him and he thinks we can work through this. However, I still have feelings for my roommate.

The thought of breaking up with my boyfriend feels bad. I don't want to not be with him. The thought of being with my roommate seems not quite right either. But that could just be because I'm not as comfortable with her as I am with my longterm boyfriend.

As a bisexual woman, I have never had sex with another woman. I grew up in a small town. There weren't a lot of options. I sometimes worry that my desire to be with men comes from the fact that I've never been with a woman. Heteronormativity and all that. I'm definitely more attracted to women than I am to men in general.

But still, breaking up with my boyfriend feels bad. I want to be with him. I feel terrible for doing this to him. But my roommate has strong feelings for me too. And our lease just started a month ago.

I have no idea what to do. Advice from LGBT+ people is especially appreciated.

Unfortunately, when I'm on my period I'm even more mean. When my grandmother asks me if I want oranges for the third time in an hour, I'll yell. When my parents ask me about life I'll literally drag my words out and roll my eyes and I can't help it. Of course, after I do this I'll get yelled at and I'll start sobbing in my room while being angry at the world. I don't know how to stop being such a bitch all the time.

I have no talked to him in months because of a conflict we had. He had never really been nice to me unless it specifically catered him, and he started pointing out my acne.

76,"24yrold female here. I have 2 kid, 8 and 2. School starts up for my 8 year old in 3 weeks. I was hoping I could put off buying school clothes and shoes until later but she has been complaining for weeks now about her shoes fitting too tight and now she is beginning to get blisters on her feet from them being too tight. I told her when her dad's child support loaded, I would buy her a new pair but then he didn't pay his child support for the month of July and it's looking like he won't pay for the month of August too. I told myself to just wait until payday next Friday and I would get them if I had it left over after paying rent. But as I was at work tonight, the babysitter text me to tell me her blisters were popping open and bleeding and she was refusing to wear her shoes. I cried on my break and had to go back and work another 3 hours feeling like the world's shittiest parent
And when I got off work, I stopped my target and said fuck it, I would get her the shoes. I felt sick to my stomach the whole time and even after I put the shoes in my bag, I felt like I was going to just spew my guts all over the place. It felt like my heart was in my throat and I was so terrified I was going to get caught. And when I got back in my car, I just cried. The amount of shame and guilt and anger I feel towards myself. I am disgusted with myself for doing what I did earlier tonight

And when I picked up my kids from the babysitter and gave my daughter the shoes, her face just lit up. She kept thanking me over and over. She told me all she wanted for her birthday was a new pair of shoes  and ""Now you don't have to get me anything mom, you can put that money towards bills""

Either  way, the stuff that happened had a lot to do with her still being in  college and wanting to fit in and be young.

79,"We are both autistic. This woman never said she likes me as a boyfriend and explicitly said she only likes me as a friend and ever will, after I had told her that I like her as a girlfriend. However, her brother and our therapist told me she likes me as a boyfriend and was wary of dating anyone only because her previous ex inappropriately touched her. Our therapist also told me her mom told her she likes me as a boyfriend, and she and my mom told me that we are going on dates and she will later want to be my girlfriend if I am friends with her and do not call them dates now. Going forward, I never mentioned that I intend to be her boyfriend. She dropped obvious hints like initiating to hug and hold my hand, asking “Are you nervous?” on a date, a vibe, saying “after we are just friends” she can drive me around and asked what if we are an actual dating couple in the future.

After 2 months and before our 10th date, my mom called her my girlfriend, so I asked her to kiss me because I wanted to get my first kiss, and she said yes and kissed me with tongue. I asked her in person so she would not change her mind or get advice, and a break-up would be worth my first kiss. My therapist suggested I tell the group against my gut instinct and that we are official, and put me on the spot, so I did, but her brother said he will not tell. This should not distract judgment (not arguing, but it is insignificant context in the broad scheme). 2 days later, worried, I asked her if she is upset. She sent me a text saying “We are still friends and we will see each other tomorrow. It is not like we are boyfriend and girlfriend or anything. I just have a different agenda than yours.”. I asked her what I did that made her think I thought we were more than friends, and she said she was sorry she said that, but the damage had been done and was unable to take it back. I repeated the question and asked if we can still be friends ”like we were before we kissed”, digging myself deeper in the hole of agony and despair, and I told her that I will give her some time to decide if she truly wants to be friends with me. I showed my mom the convo, who advised me to apologize and say that I value the friendship and I did and then she apologized too. Ok, fair enough. I later realized that as often when not told something, people think of the worst case scenario, and it was not because I told the group, because she read the text and was already ignoring me before her brother could have told her.

The next day, she rested her head on my shoulder and said the kiss felt good, but gradually withdrew more distant in the next 7 weeks. She did not hug nor sit by me in the car because she feared it will lead me on. My mom talked to her mom who said she only wants to be friends. I ended the friendship because I did not want a friend who was uncomfortable around me, and at our therapists’ office I confronted her in the hall about our text conversation.

TL;DR: While I respect that she said that we were just friends, **she made it very clear to me that she KNEW that I wanted more, but failed to tell me what I said or did that implied it, and I could have accused her of the same - yet continued to initiate affection and for surptised when I continued. When she said “sorry”, it seemed to take it back and I had trouble distinguishing between “friends” when we made out and “friends” when she was distant.**",01Aug2019,1

88,"Title, basically. I'm an editor from Germany, in my 20s. In May, after working in this business for a year, I met a director who's a rather big figure. One of his movies ranked the #1 watched true crime documentary in the US 2019.

I've been working with him on his latest movie since May, it has been an endless summer with endless work, and I loved every minute of it so far, no matter how little sleep I got. But now I'm running into a problem, which is exclusively a me problem. 

I've never been a guy with high self-esteem. I've always felt like I have to make up for an ugly face or me being a weird guy, and because of that, I worked hard to achieve things other people didn't even want. It's true what they say about comedians, these are all guys who had to make up for something to get people interested. I feel exactly the same. 
I've gone through years of hardship, 16-hour days in editing rooms, long shoots, tough decisions, and the loneliness that came with the decision to focus on working instead of anything else. I couldn't go on a vacation, it makes me sick doing nothing. 

But in all this, something happened that I didn't expect; the countless hours of hard work actually paid off, and this guy is happy to work with me. He likes the way I work, he values my advice, he actually listens when I have something to say, and he told me he could imagine working with me for a long time. Which is everything I ever wanted, it's like a dream come true. 

But I can't believe it. I don't feel like I'm that good. I feel like a piece of shit, actually. Why would this guy actually want to work with me? I constantly look for a double meaning, it's like I'm scared he could find out I'm not who he thinks I am. I mean, I'm just a guy. Right? Life has been a piece of shit, it's been disappointing, it's been tough. How could it ever turn this way?! I know what people mean by ""Too good to be true"" now, because it fucking is! This guy should be working with some veteran of this business, who knows what he's doing and has worked on films for years! And I just can't let these thoughts go, I can't sleep.

91,"As background, I am a young professional who has been working for a large company for ~9 months. This is my first job out of school. My company pays me salary, but allows for over time when necessary.

Last week my work sent myself and a few other coworkers to another country for a conference. During this conference, I spent 2 days working 12+ hour days, which I assumed I would be compensated for. These working days were spent actually working, not just schmoozing and drinking.

However, once getting back to the office, my approval for overtime was denied: my boss said that getting to go on the trip was it's own reward, and any over time I did was my own personal time.

So my question is this: Is it reasonable for me to try and get the company to give me over time, or am I being entitled? Is getting to go to a conference fair compensation for any potential over time I might incur? I hope to reread the over time policy at my work for clarification, but assuming I have a case, is it worth fighting for this?

I’ve lost like 15-20lbs, can barely eat and when I do I’m in extreme pain. The brain fog has been so bad that I’ve been making consistent errors at work and can barely find my words when I’m speaking. At this point I feel embarrassed to go back to work. 
All this has made me feel incredibly weak, useless, stupid, ugly, lonely and hopeless.

Eventually went to get ultrasound and they said I have a cyst on my liver. The doctor was supposed to call me to schedule more ultrasounds and to talk more but they never called. And I ended up feeling fine so I just forgot about it. I read that most people don’t have any problems with cyst on their liver so I didn’t worry. 

Until recently, about a month ago I have had this weird circle looking thing on my lower side. It almost looks like a bruise. It’s getting darker and darker. Doesn’t hurt or anything.

I’m not used to someone being childish or immature. But pretty much I’m usually very busy with work, family, my fiancé l, taking care of my pets. We planned to hang out Friday. I had to reschedule because I needed to help my mom and sister move because my parents are separating. So she was annoyed I changed the date to Saturday to hang out because she had made other plans. So I told her how about we agree on Sunday. So she agreed, but Sunday morning I woke up sick and let her know I was very sorry but I can’t go anywhere being sick. I said we can do it during the week since I was off work a couple days. She is completely ignoring me and I’m pretty sure she blocked me. I honestly have no idea what to do because I’ve apologized even though I didn’t do anything wrong.

So recently, me and my friend were talking. He said he had a question. And I said ok.

He said it was hard for him to say so I told him to spit it out. And then he asked “you won’t judge me” and I was in the process of typing sure. And right when I send it. His question pops up before my text. 

His question was if he could call me kitten.

Ok now this might not bother you but it bothers me a little. 

We are both very open about our kinks since our friendship is that strong. And when he calls me such a name it makes me feel like I’m in some ddlg role play. And I don’t really like that. And I don’t know how to tell him.

100,"So I just need a little advice, nothing life changing since I'm just feeling a little down on myself. I don't really wanna get into the specifics of things that happened, but the important detail is I have a friend and he generally is more popular (idk how to describe it please don't think I'm trying to be attention-hungry) so if we have votes on club positions he generally wins. I try to run for president of a club here and there but he always ends up beating me since he runs against me.

Anyways... He's president of drama club and senior class, and VP of film society this year. I get to be the president since we both agreed last year that we'd switch after the year was over (I was VP last year also this club isn't really big enough to vote so people just can step in if they please). Now, I'm feeling a little upset since today he asked if we could instead be ""co-presidents"" even though I did all the work behind the scenes last year, and he seldom showed up for an entire meeting. I understand it's just a title, but it just annoys me that I do everything yet he's recognized for it.

Also to be clear, he said his mother would prefer him be president over me so that was his compromise... I understand her reasoning (he wants to go into the film industry) but after college and such will people care he was president instead of vice president of a club with like 7-10 people?

Any advice?

My mom and sister are both allergic - not deathly, but enough that they are very uncomfortable and sneezy when in the room with one. But I don’t live with my mom and sister, I’m a grad student and I live on my own. But I’m not fully independent yet. I still stay at my parent’s house often and depend on them in other ways too. I really want to adopt this cat. I want to take care of a small living fuzzy creature so bad it hurts. But I’m so poor, and my family is so allergic, and I’m so inexperienced with cat ownership, and I’ll only be in school for another year before I go get a job in some other place that I don’t even know. 

I guess my question is then, how do I feel a little less sad about not being able to adopt this kitten?

I show up and 3 people were there who dont acknowledge me. There are no customers yet so I introduce myself to them and ask how I can help. Crickets.

I just started asking a few questions about how much food to put in the bags etc. Finally one girl tells me.

4 customers come in and the girl on the right bags the first half then the girl on my left bags the second half. This happens for the rest of the clients. I'm being iced out for some reason and starting to feel uncomfortable.

No more customers come in the rest of the night. The 3 workers sit down and start chatting so I joined them. After some small talk one of the people said to me they really wanted me to go and pick up the food during the daytime at the food bank. I drive a Toyota Corolla and I am 55.  

Then one of the other people said they really didnt need any help except for when one of them couldn't make it then they could call and see if I would fill in.

107,"I decided I'd share with you my 2 week personal hell.
Also if there are any sub reddits that could help me please let me know.

About two weeks ago, my ex, our friends and i were about to play Splatoon since there was an important event going on (The Chaos vs. Order Splatfest). 

We had been broken up for about a month at the time but agreed to stay friends since romance would only put strain on our relationship. It was the 3rd day of the event and we had most of our group ready so we decided to play. That day I had woken up early, so I wasn't feeling my best just yet but i was just happy to play. A few matches in one of our friends had to go walk his dogs, leaving me and my ex alone. I told him that i wanted to go eat food since i was hungry and wanted to take care of a headache I had.
He says no because he wanted to keep the win streak. I warned him that if I didn't take care of myself that we would lose. And so we made a deal. We would keep playing until we lost, and then take a break.

Wouldn't you know it? We lost the very next match.

It was actually pretty even until the very end. I went to the center of the stage to use my ultimate move (MC Princess) when i saw an enemy come in close, so I aimed it at him and killed him. 

My ex flipped out saying why I didn't aim at the team in front of me, and I told him that there was nobody there. Truthfully there was nobody there, i even studied a recording and saw nobody in the area.

I left the call and got breakfast. Then as soon as i got back, my ex and the friend called me. My ex started yelling the same question and I said the same thing again. The friend left half way into the conversation, where my ex started barraging me with insults and even exploiting my fears and insecurities. All of them! Shortly after he told me to leave, and i did exactly that. As I was leaving, I looked in the chat and what I saw at first was his leg and a knife. He did this often but never hurt himself. I said something like ""you gotta be fucking kidding me"". Then as I got a closer look, i saw the pool of blood coming from the bottom of his foot. I left the group chat and made another one without him. I asked a friend about it and he said that cutting his foot helps calm him down when he gets over worked.

A few days later i decided to play some RD2 on my ps4. My ex gave me a call and had a tone like nothing happened. I stayed quiet, aside from the time he invited me to play GTA to which i quickly declined. That was about 3 days later.

This happened nearly two weeks ago and it still hurts. I trusted him with all my secrets for 3 years and he kicks me out like some sewer rat. And now I hear that he's replaced me with a other guy.

113,"So I (20 M) and my girlfriend (20 F) are trying to get advice on dealing with her mother and younger sister. Both of us still live with our parents (she lives with her mom and sister, dad is not in the picture). We both recently started new jobs and don’t make a ton of money, but enough to keep up on our payments and buy things for ourselves once in awhile. 

I’m not sure where to even begin so I’m just gonna talk about everything, sorry if it seems scattered and confusing. My GF’s mother absolutely does not discipline her sister. She lets her get away with everything, let’s her steal GF’s belongings, like clothes, makeup, hygiene products, etc. with no repercussions. She hardly ever has to do chores, leaves her room, bathroom, and house a mess. She was given a car, mother constantly buys her new clothes, always makes her meals, etc., etc., etc., I think you get the hint.

On the other hand, my GF is expected to do everything around the house, clean up after her sister, buy more clothes, makeup, etc. after her other things have been stolen. She is harshly scolded anytime she doesn’t do chores (even if it’s been agreed upon that it’s her sisters job), never buys or makes her food (I have to buy dinner for her and myself or else we won’t have  anything to eat). Her mother never helps her with anything financially; she wouldn’t co-sign on her student loans because she wouldn’t be able to buy a new SUV. There’s tons of other examples but again, I think the point is pretty clear.

My GF is not very confrontational, and gets emotional when conflict does start to get heated. Any time she tries to stick up for herself, it turns into an enormous argument that often ends up with her in tears and them laughing at her because she’s crying. I’ve tried for 2.5 years to be neutral in the matter but we’re both at our wits end, we don’t know what to do to help fix the situation. My GF is in therapy (the one thing that her mother does pay for but also complains about it) for depression and other things but it’s not really helping her situation at home. Believe me when I say that we are grateful for what we have including a roof over our heads and, sometimes in her case, food to eat, but we just want to see the situation have a positive outcome, so that we can all feel like a family.

119," 

A silent night that is still. These moments when the chaos and distractions of the day is over, when nothing occupies my mind, I come back to this place. The laughter and chatter of the day goes away, and the terror and loneliness of the night replaces it. To avoid this, I find ways to steal a company for the night. Yet even so, this feeling of emptiness remains. Pleasure is not enough to fulfill all physical needs, physical touch doesn’t touch the emotional needs, the love of the night doesn't make one feel loved. It only gets the night through, so that the night doesn't have to be spent alone. But this temporary fix doesn’t cover the eternal doom that stands behind it. One night may have passed, but countless others still await you. By throwing yourself at pleasure to forget about your pain, you give birth to a pain that is more chronic, one that delves into you and builds itself a home. At the end, you only feel shittier. To throw yourself away, to run away every night, to dread the silence, to be terrified of the sole company of oneself... How many nights have I ran away like this? I feel my heart churning with every moan I cry, I feel disgusted with myself with every comment of the flatteries of my body. I have reduced myself to a body, and let my sexual organs define who I am and how I am judged. Spending every night with a different body, each night a new face. Those mouths that speak the same words, the hands that touch the same places, the demands, the deed, and like a dog in heat, I get on my knees and surrender myself to that body. Letting this stranger watch me, touch me, judge me and take my body as if it is their own. These strangers who satisfy their own needs and with my body they pleasure themselves, while I give myself up as though I have no will of my own. It’s not my hands, my feet, my words, nor the cries of pleasure- the words that beg them to pleasure me further are not of my own. It is as though I become possessed by a demon of desire, a reckless desire, a helpless desire that overcomes me, and each time the demon enters, it eats away at my soul. So now, I have become numb. I feel nothing. And at this dark hour of this silent night, all my screams and cries fill my ears. But what are these tears anyway, I don’t understand them myself. It is as though I have become detached from my very self. Who am I? I must have known at some point, didn't I? I must have had some sense of myself. But now, all light of my identity has disappeared into this darkness of these nights.",01Aug2019,1
120,"Hi,

When I was a senior in high school, a boy who I had a very new relationship with (my first relationship ever, actually) decided that things weren't progressing at the rate that he wanted. Instead of trying to work with me and move through it, he decided to turn on me. He managed to make one of my best friends hate me, and soon did the same with the entire school. At the end of it all, I was being glared at in the hallways and called a ""psycho b\*\*\*h"" by people I'd never even spoken to before. He destroyed me, over nothing at all.

Near the end of the torment senior year, he started cyberstalking me and my friends, and harassing us over text. He also made multiple threats to my wellbeing. I found this out through a mutual friend, who had heard him say that he would leap at the chance to push me out of a fifth story window, and how he'd just love to see me dead.

My best friend goes on his social media every so often to see if he's making these same threats so that we can address them in case he starts back up again (I have him blocked on everything). He does still post about me. It's not in a threatening way, but it's still really unnerving that after two years, he's still so worked up over me.

While I was away at university, he got a job at my favorite store. It's a quirky little comic and memorabilia shop at my local mall. I've been going there for over a decade - it's my happy place. As an art major, its basically me if I was a store. But now, every time I walk in, I brace myself for impact, terrified of having to deal with him again. I can't enjoy it anymore, I'm on edge from the second I walk in to the second I walk out. Luckily, I haven't bumped into him yet, but I'm bound to eventually. There's just no avoiding it.

I won't lie, I'm scared of him. Genuinely, truly, terrified. He's unstable and warped, and I don't know what he'll do if he ever sees me again. He's gone to such lengths to make me miserable and now that there's no school principal to threaten police intervention, I have no idea what he may try. He's a very different person than the one I knew in high school - he's really changed for the worse.

Truthfully, I believe that he's more scared of me than I am of him. I'm a master archer and markswoman with experience in jiu jitsu (I'm fully capable of throwing a man three times my size across a room). He knows all of this - I used to talk to him about it all the time before things went haywire. But regardless, crazy people do crazy things. I have no idea how twisted he's become in the last two years.

I hate being scared to set foot in my favorite place. I shouldn't have to feel this way. I keep telling myself that if I see him again, I'll fight through it. If he tries anything, I'll put him in his place and make sure he regrets trying anything again. But realistically, I'm not confident enough to do that.

I don't know how to handle this situation. How do I talk myself through this? If I avoid the store, he still have control over me. I refuse to let him control me like this again, but don't know how to avoid it.",01Aug2019,3

* Class started a week late because (textbook issues). During this time we got almost no communication from the professor in regards to what was going on.
* He was almost always late updating the modules for the week that we would be working on. In fact, this is the 5th week and we should be working on the fourth module, but he hasn't even posted it and it's Wednesday.
* He hasn't graded any assignments we turned in until recently. And there is no feedback on our graded assignments, instead, its almost as if he just gave everyone the same grade.
* We have only completed 289/1000 points that he claimed we would cover in the syllabus and classes end in about 8 days.
* There's supposedly going to be a final exam? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just so annoyed, I'm paying for this class and I'm not getting what was expected. But, if I report this, isn't there a possibility that I don't get the 3 credits? Which I really want to keep when I pass this mess of a course.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess, I'm just asking for advice on what I should do in this situation because I'm kind of at a crossroad. On one end, it's ridiculous that I am paying for it, but on the other end, I do get 3 credits.",01Aug2019,1
128,"So I’m in a MBA program at a state school (part time).  The classes are split up into two 8-week terms per semester. So for this summer semester the first half I took an online marketing class. This marketing class has a syllabus that grades: discussion boards 20%, 1 quiz 10%, 2 case study analysis 25% (12.5% each) and a final assignment/paper 45%.

I had an A all semester. 100s on all discussions, 81 on the quiz and two 94s (As) on the case analysis. I submit the final assignment. Never receive a grade but noticed my grade was up on the school site and I got a B. By my calculations I would have had to have scored 65-70 to get a B. And honestly, maybe that is the grade I got but since I never saw it posted on my course site I asked they professor. He said no he doesn’t do grades he just averages how you did in the class with the final assignment and gives you a grade. He said he issued feedback and rereleased that feedback. There is no grade on the assignment but my feedback was “good but I needed more references to the articles used throughout the course and more content”. Literally that’s it. 

For the last three weeks I’ve been back and forth with him (he’s only written back to me like 6 times bc he tries to ignore me).  I have been ccing my “student success coach” and she has even asked him for my grade where he does the same runaround or doesn’t answer. The student coach has emailed me every few days saying she’s working on it. Today it was a week since I heard from her so I decided to finally reach out to the MBA office’s head. She had called me and left a message saying she is aware of the problem and is working on it. She said bc it’s the summer it’s tough getting a hold of the professor. 

Well tonight the professor confirmed he doesn’t even look at the analysis grade and more just considers the discussion and quiz grades and then picks a grade based on those and how he felt you did in the final assignment. I have even asked him why did he provide a rubric if he doesn’t even grade against it. He just ignores the question. I emailed this last email with him confirming this to the professor head and asked if this was something I should expect at the university (that professors can provide a syllabus but then completely deviate from it when grading and pick and choose what they actually grade). 

What should my next option be? I’m pretty infuriated that this professor thinks he can get away with this and part of me is afraid he might. How can you just assign grades arbitrarily. And at that why would you admit that!? I’m just at a loss at what I can do. Any help is greatly appreciated.",01Aug2019,2
129,"So I met this guy at my job and we instantly connected and just a super fun person to be around. He recently got back home from a trip and invited me over to catch up &amp; hang out. Our plans for the day didn't go the way we wanted to so we ended up watching a movie &amp; talking. We were getting personal and while I was opening up to him about something important to me I realized he was texting on his phone not even paying attention to what I was saying so I kinda ended the conversation short. Then a couple minutes later he said he would be right back and that turned to more into a hour so I just decided to leave and I texted him I was going to and he didn't reply. Unfortunately, my phone died trying to find the lyft and I ended up missing the ride so I had to go back into his complex. I found him in the common room talking to someone on the phone all this time. I started to tell him what happened and he cut me off  and asked  if I could wait in his room so I did. When it was time for me to leave again (this time with a fully charged phone) I didn't even say bye and just left. 

A couple hours later he had texted me apologizing for his behavior saying that his girlfriend (might I add they only got back together cause she threatened to kill herself) was getting him upset. I told him how it hurt my feelings about how he wanted to see me and then proceeded to ignore me. I also expressed how it hurt my feelings about him ignoring me while I was opening up. He said ""im sorry you feel this way i didn’t mean for that i promise i was just feeling a bit off today."" I left him on read then he said ""I hope we can still be friend you're cool peoples""

I don't know if I'm over reacting but saying ""I'm sorry you feel this way"" makes me feel like he didn't acknowledge what he did was wrong and that it isn't a real apology to me. I don't wanna be around someone who pretends they care just to walk all over me again so I don't know what to do",01Aug2019,1

132,"My friends question: 

Well, this girl I knew many years ago that I was friends with happened to move back to town last year. I got to catch up with her, and we began hanging out a bit about a month later. Around that time, I did wish to pursue her, but there was a catch, she was taken. Turns out, she's been dating this dude for a few years, and I had to make a choice about what my course of action would end up being.

I should mention, that the boyfriend is quite different from her in many areas, in attitude, religious beliefs, music tastes, personality as a whole, etc. She's told me about this,
some of the things she wasn't too happy about in general. (For example, she isn't a fan of him trying to have control over who she speaks to, or even to some extent, what she wears. That's the major end of those differences. The lesser of these differences are more of the fact that she doesn't like how much he curses.)

In the past couple of months, we have been talking and hanging out more often, and she seems compatible to me, but I again come to that decision, of whether I try to pursue her or not. I originally, months ago, decided against pursuing her, even though I wanted to, because I respected her relationship, and at the core, I do value our friendship. However, now, I am reconsidering that position, and trying to figure out a way to have a romantic relationship, rather than simply a platonic one.

135,"Long story short, i had to move out because of how shitty my grandma was to me and how overwhelmed i was and my dad would never back me up. Shes been shitty to me since she moved in. Before she moved in I was starting to get along with my dad great again. It was like when I was a kid again. We did argue like once when it was just us, but it wasnt anything super horrible. Just didnt talk for like a few hrs then i got over it and so did he. 

My dad has late stage cancer and Im just mad at my grandma because she ruined the last years I had with my dad. I hate how now shes pretending to be nice. And she told me she is sorry my dad made me move out??? Idk if she honestly believes that it was my dads fault or if shes lying to me on purpose. 

I avoid talking to her and just being in the same room as her because i dont wanna pop and end up getting confrontational with her. I keep on thinking about how she ruined everything and just her even being in the same room gets to me. I dont know how im gonna make it. I hate that im just feeling mad at my grandma and not being able to entirely focus on spending time with him.

138,"This wouldn't go up on r/AmItheAsshole so here, also trigger warning for mention of suicide I suppose.

For this I'm like 70% I was the asshole but I still need a consensus. Also some context:

For starters my therapist already knows my significant other, let's call them E for this, has depression and suicidal ideations. I've talked to him in length about how I'm terrified E won't get to live a full and happy life because of it and I was even planning to get E some medication through said therapist.

E usually had no trouble opening up to me and others about their depression but for some reason would get very uncomfortable telling therapists and such about it.

We both suffer from depression but I'm medicated, E is not.

Now the story:  
I was in therapy with E and my therapist and we were slowly talking more about E's personal life. Therapist asked if E had a plan for school and I said ""Do you wanna tell him what your plan was?"" I then told the therapist something E had told me many times before ""They're gonna drop out of school and hang themselves."" Therapist then started talking about therapist stuff you say when you hear that and after a while E starts to cry. I walk them out of the room and we hang out in the bathroom eating chips while my mom and therapist start their session early.

Now a few weeks later I see E in our group chat with other people said

""Ya know what, fuck you Gooshgoosh\_mp4 for telling your therapist I was depressed when I wasn't ready yet.""

I know I may've brought it up to early but I was just so scared for them and I knew they needed help. I know it wasn't the right thing to do but christ they've never said fuck you to me before and it really cut deep. So AITA?",01Aug2019,1

My neighbors also have only shot me down when I asked if they have a space I could rent during the week nights.

What I have been doing is calling my town's police department and asking for permission to park overnight in front of my address. They recently told me that they will not always grant permission for excessive overnight street parking because I have been calling them almost every night for about a month or so now.

I brought the subject up with my therapist, who said that the possibility had crossed his mind. He offered to do testing so I can get an official diagnosis.

I'm pretty on the fence about this and have been having a hard time sorting out the pros and cons of actually getting tested.

I feel like this might need some back story so here it is: I was sexually abused when I was 8 and was in an abusive relationship about a year ago that lasted 9 months.

When I got out of the abusive relationship I practically jumped on the next person that showed any interest in me and used them to fill up the void my ex ripped out of me. That happened a couple of times until I realised what I was doing and I promised myself to stop doing that and not get into any emotional relationship until I gott emotionally healthy enough to be in one.
While I was still healing I started a physical relationship with a boy but he got emotionally attached pretty quickly even though when we first started we both agreed on not having a romantic relationship. But since I didn't want to hurt him I really wanted to fall in love with him but I couldn't, I really tried but it didn't happen; so I broke it off with him so I wouldn't hurt him more :/.

It has taken me allot of trauma therapy to get over all of the trauma and now I mostly am and live a mostly PTSD free life and still go to therapy.

Witch brings us to today. I recently started talking to this old class mate that I haven't talked to in a really long time and we started hanging out together and one evening we got really drunk. (I now do consider myself healthy enough to be in a emotional relationship).

165,"Sorry for the lengthy post.  

Last August I started my first year of grad school, and I moved to a state where I didn't know anyone. There were only 3 people I was in regular contact with for the summer and pretty much my entire first year: two great (male) buddies from college, and a female friend that one of my friends had met (on Tinder, and they hooked up for a while but remained friends without issue) the summer after we graduated. We all liked to game and frequently hung out on Discord. Because of my depression and social anxiety I failed to make any close friends in my new city, so most of my free time was devoted to hanging out with these 3 or gaming by myself.  

Around December I started to develop feelings for the female friend as we had started talking more often. Near Christmas I had let her know that I had feelings for her and she didn't feel the same way. We both wanted to still be friends, but it was difficult. We had decided not to tell the other two about my feelings, which in hindsight was a bad move. The loneliness was crushing me, and with recently being rejected I felt the worst I have in my life. And the only person I could talk to about this was the same girl that had rejected me.  

The next semester was really tough. I was wrapped up in self-pity and was venting a lot to my female friend. She was very supportive and tried to help me as much as she could. I ended up becoming obsessed with our friendship, only feeling excited when I was able to hang out with her. It was a toxic way to live. I started going to therapy and tried to improve myself, but I wasn't ever able to develop habits and basically just kept complaining about my depression and insecurities.   (Eventually I did tell my other two friends about my situation when my female friend had told me it was too much for her to listen to my problems over and over).  

I was fortunate to be able to go home over the summer while working on an independent course with a professor at my university. Luckily my family had moved extremely close to my friends, and I was very excited to spend the summer with them. I thought that I would spend the summer studying, working out, hanging with them, and overall developing good habits. It was exciting that I now had friends to hang out with in person, but unfortunately this was more of a crutch than anything else. All I wanted to do was spend time with them. I would waste my days gaming and come the afternoon, basically everyday, I would ask my friends if they wanted to hang out. This is where I think the issue really began.  I became extremely needy towards my female friend.

I had agreed to help my female friend with a class she was taking over the summer. Because of my feelings for her, I (stupidly) told her she didn't need to pay me, and that all I wanted was for us to hang out a lot over the summer. She didn't seem completely comfortable with the idea in hindsight, but I missed the signs in the moment. So maybe once a week she would come over and I would basically do her homework and tests for her. We did hang hang out other times; I saw her maybe 2-3 times a week including homework sessions. One thing to note is that I almost always initiated us hanging out; she basically never did. She only ever asked me to hang out if she wanted to do homework. I had pointed this out to her, and she said she felt guilty and apologized, and promised to be better about it. Spoiler: she wasn't. Once the course was almost done, I noticed that she would ignore me whenever I asked to hang out. We would be having a perfectly normal conversation, then I would ask if she wanted to do something later, then I'd get ghosted. Like the idiot I am, I also let her know my issue with this, and around this time she stopped apologizing and started making excuses. It was becoming very clear that she wasn't interested in hanging out with me anymore. We hung out a couple times in groups, but she would always ignore me when I asked her individually (i.e. not in a group message).  

Eventually my frustrations get the best of me and I end up asking her to pay me for doing the course for her. I told her that I felt that I only declined payment because of my feelings for her, and that that wasn't healthy for our friendship. (Yes, I know I should've just asked for money in the beginning, but I wasn't in my right mind). She was giving me many signals that she didn't want to spend time with me, which was what I (regretfully) had asked for. I felt I was due some compensation, so I asked for money. She does agree to pay me, but I hear nothing from her for the next couple of days.  

I talk about this with a friend and she convinces me to apologize. I end up apologizing to my female friend about how I've been acting and that I would promise I'd change. Unfortunately, I had made many promises like this in the months before and never acted on them. So, she decided to cut off all contact, however she did pay me for the course (granted it was half of what I asked for). Being how I am, I was very passive and apologetic, and decided that she was right and this was my fault.  

My main question is: how can I be better? While I do feel she used me and took advantage of my feelings to some extent, I recognize that this is mostly my fault. My actions mainly stemmed from a lack of self-respect and confidence, as well as my immaturity and inability to move on. I felt that our relationship was me giving (a really nice birthday gift, initiating hangouts, buying her lunch to celebrate her new job, buying gas when she was flat broke, etc.) and her taking. I want to have more respect for myself and in turn more respectful to women. I want to be a good guy, not a nice guy.  

I'm back at school now and I want to better myself. I know that I need to socialize and take care of myself physically. Do y'all have any advice for how I can change my mindset and start respecting myself more, so that I can avoid situations like this? I don't want to beg for attention from women anymore.",01Aug2019,1

167,"Title is pretty self explanatory but I feel as if I need to give some background. I’ve been talking to this one guy for a few months and things were pretty great while we were in the honeymoon stage but it went downhill. We’d argue almost constantly and while the majority of the time I was the one picking them because of the excessive trust issues, he’d lose his temper and say awful things. My trust issues were caused by getting cheated on in my last relationship and I’m aware that that’s my problem, not his. I don’t have the best rep either because there was a time in my life where I was promiscuous because I thought my body was the only good thing I had going for me. He constantly reminds me of this by saying things like: “I’m the only guy that doesn’t use you” or “I’m the only guy that doesn’t see you just for your body” and while this is appreciated, it reminds me of how I’d get used and it just feels like he’s using this to make me think he’s the only guy for me. Recently, we got into a pretty heated argument because of my lack of communication but while I was maintaining my cool during this, he said some pretty awful things. He brought up my past and said he was “disappointed in me for still being the same even after I said I was “changing’”. He’d also go on and say how’d he block me on everything because “that’s clearly what I wanted”. He also threw in a couple fuck you’s and went to say how he should’ve listened to people from the start when they’d talk badly about me. He was drunk during all of this and he used that as an excuse but you know what they say, drunk people are the most honest. I’m aware that I’ve done some pretty shitty things but I’ve told my friends the whole story and they’ve told me that he seems like a “real piece of shit” and that I should cut it off. Thing is, I don’t know how to. I’ve given him so many chances because I try to see the good in him and I give him the benefit of the doubt. I truly do think there’s good in him but since we both have issues, it’s a problem. I’ve gotten pretty attached to him as well and when we don’t talk, I get lonely and sad because it’s only him and my best friend that I talk to on a daily basis.",01Aug2019,2
168,"A little bit of context... (long read ahead be forewarned)

For the last year and a half I have had my sights set on starting what I’ve always called my dream job working at the international airport.

I’m a 30 year old single female who , for the last 14 years, worked exclusively in the service industry. I love serving. I love small talking for a living, I love that even though I more or less “bring people things” for hours a day my job is never the same , and is never boring. I’ve never stared at the clock counting down the hours , work has always been fun (albeit stressful at times).  I’ve worked in every aspect in a restaurant setting, my longest stretch reached a decade at the same restaurant . I’m loyal, and my customers even followed me from my last restaurant to my current one. People remember me , and I remember them, and I’ve met so many great and interesting customers / coworkers / regulars .... I’ve saved all the notes I’ve received over the years... from the couple I bought dinner for the night before they got induced ... the woman i served unknowing she was out for her first meal since becoming a widow and the note she left me in appreciation of my kindness..  the Christmas cards and birthday cards, even the police reports (lol). All of it. I love serving .

For my 30th birthday last year I made a plan that I would come back from my bucket list trip to Africa with an idea of what I wanted to do for the rest of my life . I never went to school, I honestly believe to be successful you really need to WANT to learn .. and if at 17 I had really truly known that “hey, I want to be a dentist”, then I would have went and done it.

I came home and explored the school route, met with advisors, took competency exams, picked a course I felt “do-able” and learned I needed to upgrade one course I never took from 13years ago to complete my acceptance. Mature student apparently isn’t a thing anymore . 

I figured hey? How hard can this be ? And chose to take a high school chemistry course from home after not having thought much about the subject at all in those 13 years .
Spoiler alert : I was not successful.  I withdrew from the course and teetered with the idea of taking it again in a classroom setting where maybe having an actual teacher and a timeline instead of a “do it when I please” attitude .

Then life happened and it ends up the course was not offered again with enough time for me to complete the requirements for acceptance . Oh well. Did I really want to put pills in a bottle for the next 35 years of my life ? No, and I never wanted to go to school just to “go”. I was never about that.

Before Africa I always talked about how my favorite part of traveling was airports .
You could delay me for days on end and I wouldn’t be upset. Something about them, all these people coming home to see loved ones or leaving and going on adventures. The bustle, the busy-ness. The shops and last minute souvenirs. The people sitting contempt with their books, or slamming overpriced cocktails to pass the time.
No matter the airport I was never bored , walking into them fills me with so much joy . 

I had a customer who (until the contract was sold) worked very high up in the security sector of my local international airport . She loved her job , and we talked about it often.  Then a new coworker I worked alongside with told me that she used to work security at the airport! And she loved it ! Then her baby came along and the hours just didn’t work for her family anymore . I signed up for the email newsletter for the new company who ran security and last year got the courage to apply.

I was in Africa when I was invited to the “testing event” and had to decline the initial invitation. The company rules are you can only apply once a year , so I had to wait another six months to re apply. The first invitation was August of last year, the second invitation I received in April, and this time I could make it.

I went to the testing event with 148 other people. You had to pass the first test to make it through to the second , then to the third, then to a 5 minute interview. From the 5 minute interview you were then selected for a 30 minute interview the following day.

Out of 148 people that tested that day. 3 people were hired , and I was one of them.

I was over the moon. Elated . Overjoyed . I DID IT. 

Then started the hiring process, which took up until this week to complete. A lot of background checks , financial checks , police record checks , doctors visits , rental history , employment history . They dug through all of it .  I completed my transport clearance and went to the airport to pick up my restricted area access card. Got my fingerprint and retinal scans done. It was official.

I let my employer know that this was it , I had a start date . August 12th. I received my final instructions via email today and I’ve been a total mess emotionally ever since .

Why am I all of a sudden scared ? I know the obvious answer is because it’s a big life change for me. I’m leaving the only thing I’ve ever known , something I knew I was good at but I’ve constantly been telling myself I’ve been ready to be done with .

Serving has an expiration date and I know I’ve reached it . I hate starting work at 5pm. I hate working 6 days a week to make 35 hours. I hate working every weekend . But I’m suddenly very scared of how alone I know I’m going to feel.
All of my friends are service industry . For the next 6 weeks of training (which will entail me getting up at 430 am Monday- Friday — and going to bed at a reasonable hour to be able to do so) I’m terribly worried about being alone. 
I’ve been telling all my customers about me leaving and I’ve done so with a grin on my face ! I got a “real” job! I can depend now on my paychecks to get me through life and not wondering about working extra to make extra tips to pay my bills ! I’m joining a union! Paid leave ! And health benefits ! I wanted to find something new to do with my life and I might have found just that. This is the job I haven’t stopped talking about for over 2 years , and up until today I was so excited to move on to.

Now I’m sitting on the couch, crying my eyes out, writing a note to strangers on Reddit because I really am hoping for words of encouragement or opinions and thoughts I might not hear if I reach out to the people closest to me about my sudden change of heart.  I’m afraid of being lonely , and now the people in my life are left working the schedule I grew to hate . 

I have a week + a day doing the only work I’ve ever done before I start on this new adventure ? Any kind words would mean a lot to me because never in a million years would I have thought I would regret the decision I’m about to make . Up until today i was truly so excited to start “going through peoples bags and ruining their days 😉”.  I don’t feel like I’m afraid I’m going to fail, I am so excited to learn the ins and the outs of my favourite place - and to be a part of the safety and security , it truly is a very important role I’m about to be a part of .. I just hope these are just feelings of nervousness I’m having that are honestly just coming at a bad time ( I have to go buy polishable shoes this weekend !)
Is it because now , after all of these months of waiting it’s finally real ? 

Regards,
S.",01Aug2019,1
169,There's a kid at school that enjoys insulting me and getting others to do it. I don't mind this since normally I'm good at comebacks and saying something smart back normally shuts him up and it turns friendly. But sometimes - today in particular my mind was completely blank and I had no idea what to say. I hate when this happens since my mind is so unpredictable. Somedays my mind is sharp and quick and words easily flow out my mouth. And then there are times where I'm struck for words and don't know what to say. What pisses me off more is my inability to understand what makes my mind sharper to make better comebacks when insults are thrown at me.,01Aug2019,1
170,"Im 16M going to be starting my junior year of high school in late August. For years of middle school and some of high school. My grades have been awful like D’s and C’s throughout those years. Didn’t have the motivation to try hard, had trouble finding a point to try to do good in school and always having trouble paying attention in school. 

Now after thinking about this a bit in the summer, I do want to try to get into college. Want to be able to be successful in the future.
If I would be able to get good grades during my junior and senior year of high school would I be able to get into college?",01Aug2019,2
171,"I asked a question in a post in a Facebook group. I replied to the comments, and it can be seen in the edit history and time stamps of the comments that people did not correctly read my question, yet people still accused me of not asking the question clearly enough. Thus, trying hard to be polite, in another post, because italics, bold, and underline are not easy on Facebook, I asked the question in all caps five times. Three people got hung up on one detail, only that I was rude, and I apologized, yet they would not let it go and ran with it. I was misunderstood before I was rude and I was still misunderstood when I was rude because I was desperate to be understood, and I feared that saying it too many times would make me not understood.

I made a third post seeking, complaining that people were being rude to me, and I was implicitly referring to people not reading the question, and that was obviously the reason for my repeated all caps. However, someone who did not make an effort to know what it was that rude, just condescendingly, genetically commented “Maybe you should know that if you are rude to people then people will be rude to you.🤷‍♀️“. She was biased and one-sided, in that she cherry-picked when I said “they were rude to me” only to say that, but did not even listen to me saying what was rude. If she believed me that they were rude, then why not see what was rude, and ponder that it was in the other order? She could have politely disagreed (said that incorrectly answering the question was not rude), or just not answered the question at all. Just like smart-Alecs twist our words against us and throw them in our face and miss the point and make us regret saying something a certain way, this was similar. She was not in a position to give unsolicited advice if she did not know the whole situation. I am not justifying my rudeness, but was this rude of her?",01Aug2019,1
172,"So I(F20) worked at a big supermarket doing night crew (specifically file maintenance, which is going through the whole store and updating the price tags).  I started there when I was fifteen as a bagger and then became a cashier when I was eighteen, but also did the night crew job on the side.  I've since moved about a half an hour away and I quit the job a little bit less than a year ago.  

I left on good terms with everybody and my night crew manager said that she was sad to see me go.  Right now, I have a lot of free time and I am in need of money.  I was thinking of applying at the same supermarket (but at a location closer to me) for night crew, but then I thought that I could maybe just... reapply back to where I used to work. 

I wouldn't mind the drive, but I'm not sure how to go about asking to work there again.  I have my night crew manager on snapchat and I was thinking of messaging her and asking her if they had any openings for night crew jobs.  I'm not sure if this would be *professional* or not, but the manager is only like a year older than me and she's really chill.

Would something like ""Hey, Jenna!  I was just wondering if you had any job openings on tags at night?""  or something like that work?  Just something simple.  

AAaaaaa I know what I want to ask but I'm too tired to think of how to phrase it.  BASICALLY, I want to maybe work at my old job again, how do I ask my old night shift manager if there are any job openings?",01Aug2019,2
173,"I had my best friend over for the last 2.5 weeks, she recently left. We had not seen each other in a year, she got into college, was diagnosed with depression and had already been on her pills by the time we met. 

I live in the US, while she is from another country, so when she came here, she lived with me and spent all of her time with me. In the beginning, our relationship was fine, and I knew that she had depression (knew that as a fact, i never knew much about the condition itself), but I was willing to help her, so I constantly checked up on her and did everything to make sure she was feeling safe and comfortable. 

However, the stories she told me were very disturbing to me (I usually think I am pretty empathetic person, so anything dark or sad really brings me down and makes me worry about it) such as her experience with suicidal thoughts, self-harm. Having those stories repeated a bunch of times, I was feeling very helpless and scared. By the end of the first week, I ran out of all of my energy and was feeling emotionally drained, since she wanted me to calm her down and expected my help and support every time she felt bad. And initially I was willing to help her, but by that time I had no energy for myself as well. I was feeling very unhappy, very lost and very uncomfortable, since she expected some things from me that I could not give. I had no time or possibility to re-charge since she did not like it when I went out with my boyfriend or went to work or anything else.   And again, initially I was fine with having no other social and personal life during her stay, but by the end of the first week, I really needed some time to get back with my own emotions and energy overall.

I told her about it, but since she has an issue with blaming everything on herself, I just told her I had a hard week (which was partially true), and explained that I needed some personal time, at least an evening, to get back with myself. She seemed fine with my words, so I calmed down a bit. (Later she told me that I did a bad thing since she was very self-conscious for the rest of the time).

The second week we argued much more. Her therapist asked her to write down all of her negative emotions, and sometimes in the evenings, she would read the cases where I irritated her out loud. I understood that it was a needed measure, but still, I was feeling very uncomfortable because after some of my actions she would just open the notes on her phone and would start writing something. 

By the end of the week, she got angry on me for refusing to watch more episodes of a show we were watching and for talking to my boyfriend after one episode (i warned her about it beforehand). After my remark on that, she only listed my negative sides and then went on about her state and her depression overall.

She told me that she does not think therapy or meds help and that she just wants to kill herself but she can't (and that was a very common thing for her to say, which also scared me). At some point, I started feeling as if she was blaming every single bad thing in her on her illness, which confused me a little bit. She became very anti-social (like she refuses to talk to people in cafes and would make me do that) and decided to drop her upcoming long-anticipated internship, required for passing a year in her university because she was feeling tired with me. 

All these things left me wondering how much in her is depression and how much is her actual self (we never lived together before), and if it is depression, then what could have been done form my side to help her or to what could I have done differently? 

This whole experience has left me drained and I just feel like I did not help her at all, and started feeling uncomfortable about her more. What can she do to get better? 

I read a bunch of articles online but they did not seem to help. 

Any advice related to the topic of treating people with depression, depression itself or anything that comes to your mind after reading this would be wanted.",01Aug2019,1

We just had our first child back in January so there's that as a factor. We agreed upon her giving us $400 per month to help us offset the additional utilities, food, etc that are associated with having more people in a house. The rent itself is $1250. I knew she was moving here without employment and knew it would be a few weeks for her to find something. Flash forward a couple of weeks and she is debating whether to take a job offer $13 because she says she wouldn't be saving enough money. I think that's crap especially when I told her that coming from FL to GA that she would be taking a pay cut because of the cheaper cost of living. She was not going to come here making $17 or $18 per without a degree. Hell my wife has her associates and still got offered $12.

My wife offered, without my knowledge, to her that she'd ask me to only ask the sister for $300. I said no for the reason stated above.

I work at a mom and pop exotic pet shop and today my boss came up to me and asked if I wanted to quit because said friend had told her that I was planning on doing it (I had vented to her and said I was gonna because I was angry about hours being cut but who doesn't say they're gonna quit their job every once and a while when they've had a bad day).

192,"throwaway.

So basically my friend started a company with some other people but after a while he came across a problem.

Basically a platform he wanted to use in his work/company/whatever wasn't very friendly with americans.

I'm not from america, though currently residing there, and so he asked me if he could get my passport and stuff (from a different country) so that he'd have an easier time working with the people with the platform.

basically he'd say i was the one trying to use the platform and it was my company and i'm not from america.

(note: I recently became an american citizen and so don't use the other passport if it matters in the slightest)

anyways, i obliged and it was a big help to him, but i'm beginning to wonder if i did something really stupid and ignorant.

So I was wondering what legal problems I was potentially looking at /what could go wrong/what to do/tips/help/whatever you got.

I don't think he'll do anything illegal under my name but i'm not 100% sure about under the company. 99, but not 100.

It's been keeping me up for a few days now. HeLP!

193,"I guess a bit of context, I[18M]have a group of friends, maybe 6 or 7 of us(guys and girls), and I’ve known most of the people throughout high school, we just graduated High school this recent June. Unfortunately I’d say I’m relatively tight with about 2 of these people, nonetheless I consider everyone else friends. I’m staying in the city for college, as are most of the group, but I feel detached from the group most times. We have a group chat, and a big part of it is the group call, which I usually choose not to join. I choose not to join because I think I have it in my head that I’m just not a big part of the group, even though I was one of the first in the group. Also I can never get a fuckin word in which is also annoying, too many voices overlapping.

No one, and I mean no one, ever asks me how I’m doing, or what I’m up to. I can’t remember someone in the group asked me what’s new. If any of my friends are feeling shitty, I try and reach out and see what’s up. I try and help. But it’s never requited. It’s absolutely rare that I get a phone call from any individual person in the group, even from people I consider super close. They’re always usually doing stuff at a friends house, and I never know because I never see any texts about it in the group chat. They literally go over to our one friends house and watch game of thrones, and I love game of thrones(they all know that), but do I get an invite? No. 

I do not want to lose these friends, but I already feel detached as fuck, and I hate losing people, but fuck I’m upset that no one reaches out to me, and that goes for checking up on me as well as just hanging out. 

Any advice?",01Aug2019,1
194,"Tl;dr - not covered by insurance, living in Colorado. What would be a ballpark estimate of a checkup cost for Paruresis, otherwise known as “shy bladder”?


I’m on probation, and part of the process is having a monitored drug test. I’ve taken about 10 so far, and each time has been done with multiple attempts from me “going”.

This last (most recent) time, it was so bad that I was unable to.

I don’t feel tense or anything, but it’s obviously a psychological issue. After I was dismissed, I went into the bathroom down the hall and pee’d with no problem.

Usually I can pee with someone in the stall next to me, but I guess it’s when a “big guy” breathing heavy, staring at my *who-what* is when it’s difficult for me.

Anyways, point is this - I’m not covered under insurance. What would the cost be to go to the doctor to get checked up for this? My P.O. is willing to switch me to mouth swabs if I can get a note, so I think it’d be an appropriate action, as I’m most likely going to have this problem moving forward.

198,"Hello, I'm going to be asking for some general advice, and ideas. I'll give you a little context, and some of my story.  


I work full time in a warehouse job. It doesn't pay much, but my expenses are covered. So that is good. It does however put me in agony at the end of the day. The workplace is also very toxic. Addressing the people who are the worst is impossible, because they're close to the boss. I have taken to recording my work days with my phone, in case legal action is justified. I am told constantly that I am not good enough for this position, whether directly or indirectly. I wish to leave as soon as possible. But I want to trade up in job quality and pay, because I know I am worth more for my work. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I find it very distracting to start working on my 2019 fitness goals because of the pain, and mental drain, this job leaves me with. Every start I've had, has been stopped short, and I chiefly blame the damage this job is doing to me. Heavy lifting, rapid walking on concrete for 9 hours a day, the mental tax of correctly recalling product numbers, and the constant feeling of being watched. Not for productivity, but for the appearance of being busy. My boss hates it when I take a moment to stand and socialize between pick orders. Other employees are allowed to socialize, relax, and even get smoke breaks. None of this applies to me. And every time I bring this up, I am immediately shot down with replies about moving faster, or not making mistakes.  


I desperately want to leave. I go to sleep far too late, because I don't want to go to work the next day. But I do not have money saved up to take time for an intense job hunt. So instead I quick-apply to places on websites like Indeed, Ziprecruiter, and so on. I live in Canada, so I've been following some of the local cannabis manufacturer websites, and applying there. They're looking for young people like myself. I'm only 31. I also follow local government job postings, because government work has a great work-life balance. But I'm limited there, because most government branches are very strict about education requirements, and I do not have any post-secondary education.  


I've been intensely searching for work for almost six months, and had some promising interviews, but no luck in getting out of this warehouse. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also teach a martial arts class. And here I really thrive. I'm actually a great teacher. I build rapport with students, working with their limitations and helping to correct techniques, tactics, and forms. I can also show them alternatives instead of adhering to a strict doctrine like most instructors. I love this work, and even with the worst parts of my warehouse job, when I spend ten minutes with my class, I'm as happy as I can ever be. After the two hour lessons, three times weekly, I love myself and look forward to the next things I'm going to teach them. And the students pay good money for the lessons.   


I've actually built a business of it. I handle insurance, rent, arrange space, special events, cross-club sparring, collect dues, order club equipment and group purchases for their personal gear. I really want to teach full time. If I have a single goal, it is to do that. For that end, I want to go to school to become a fitness instructor. Get certified as a sports coach in our national body of coaches, get proper sports-specific first aid training, and really elevate what I'm teaching already. I can offer products like fitness instruction, a group fitness class using my martial arts, a youth lesson focusing on teenagers, and I can continue to offer the adult lessons, open sparring, and private lessons. I really feel like I could open a brick-and-mortar, 24/7 place. It's just building up to that right now. I'm marketing the class, doing social media campaigns and occasionally postering parts of town. I even opened a Saturday lesson in a second town, just to draw students from there. 2019 was the first year where I haven't sunk a single dime of my own into this operation. And that feels like a huge achievement.

And that...that's the bright spot in my life.  


The rest of my life is a mess. My house is disorganized. My car needs some minor repairs. I don't make time for a social life. I have a minor credit card debt (3.4k) that needs to be deleted. I don't wash my clothes enough. I need to buy new clothes. I need to do all these things. I am not happy with the state of my life at all, except for my class. But I know that only focusing on my class is unhealthy. Because I already neglect other parts of my life. And I need to build a strong foundation in my life in order to thrive. Therapy sounds like a nice idea, but I don't know if I can find time for it, and I don't know how much is covered. Or if OHIP covers it at all, or if my company's health insurance plan covers it.   


But I do have action plans. They just...haven't concluded yet. New job, new fitness routine, fixing my house, removing credit card debt. Those were all supposed to happen in 2019. It's august already, and I've made no progress. It feels like I can't get anywhere, and like this job will hurt me to the point where I could risk my ability to teach martial arts.",01Aug2019,1

200,"I am a 23M, I would say in general I’m pretty successful for my age. I live with a couple of roommates, have a full time job that I’m making plenty to be able to survive.

Though, I find it hard to handle the shit I need to handle. I recognize the bad habits that I am in and really would love to change them but haven’t been able to. 

I don’t have a license (ideally getting it in two weeks). I have trouble with my finances, as I said, I’m making plenty but I have been unable to save it. I haven’t been able to quit smoking cigarettes. I eat like crap, though, I’ve been getting in the habit of cooking more nights than not. I need to start working out and gain weight.

201,"This is on a throwaway account for very obvious reasons, these are personal problems that I just want advice on.

I'm 14 and don't have a job, I don't think my parents would let me get one, I'm obviously still too young to move out.

My parents over the course of a few years have gotten around 20 cats, and it's made my life just utter shit. My mum makes me, my dad and my brother clean up after them and this is something that is very difficult to do, as I gag half the time I try to clean and I'm disgusted by what I have to clean. My parents will yell at me and even go to hit me if I refuse to clean up when it is particularly bad. This sparks numerous arguments and whenever we argue my computer gets taken away. This is a major issues because I'm unable to speak to my friends at all and just have to sit in my bed and watch youtube all day. My parents don't really let me do anything on my own or go anywhere on my own. Soon my brother will move out and then the division of labor will be mostly on me, and I'm not sure how I'm going to handle any of this.

Around a year or two when it first started getting bad I developed symptoms of IBS I guess, it probably isn't IBS but that's the closest thing I could find to what I experience. I have sulfur burps, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting every now and then, this has been going on and off for a few years now and has made me kind of drained mentally. I have medication for this but I'm still not satisfied with this issue. Maybe it's unrelated but it occurred around the same time as the 'cat' problem and further developed my mental issues. I'm not depressed, but I'm just constantly angry and overly aggressive, I can have mood spikes very easily after a heated argument or having to clean something.

My parents have moved houses once which forced me to leave behind all my friends, I only speak to them online now and we just play games, they're my only source of real fun or joy I guess. I was unable to make friends at my new school due to the awkwardness of always going with cat hair on my clothes, this made me feel self conscious about how people viewed me, and developed into social anxiety. Now I have issues with how I look every time I go out into a social situation. We're about to move again and I genuinely do not want to do it at all, I'm fine living where we are now and when we move we have to sort out the cat situation... again... it's going to be pure hell.

I'm also worried about the well-being of the animals, I feel like they aren't being cared for properly. We have them in a sort of enclosure and it's always filthy and not sanitary in the slightest.

Contacting authorities is not an option because I would probably be put into a foster home which would be worse than my current situation. I'm not sure if this is true but I've heard that foster homes usually aren't very good, I'm worried that my computer and phone would be taken away if I was put into a foster home. I have other relatives but I feel like they would not help me.

I don't know how much longer I can put up with this, I'm only 14 and I still have to wait another four years before I can move into a friend's place or something. I may have left out a few details which I will edit in.",01Aug2019,1

205,"TL;DR provided at the bottom!!

Let me start this off with, I do eventually want to drive. I would love to have a car and drive from point A to point B and whatever. It would make school and work so much easier, but I just cannot do it. I tried practicing once when I was 16 in my moms big Ford Explorer in an empty Walmart parking lot and it was all fine! A little nerve wrecking at first, but it was good! I turned 18 and people offered to teach me -seriously- how to drive and so I took them up. My mom is very rough and tends to yell at me very often, so driving was no different, and every ride ended in tears. My cousin, had less of the yelling, but all of the condescending, and he consistently belittled me. 

My girlfriend has been teaching me how to drive lately, in her smaller (compared to my
mom’s car) Honda Civic, but I just can’t seem to get the hang of it. I work terribly under pressure and every time she points out the mistakes I made, I shut down. I feel like a danger to society behind the wheel. I have no concept of the space the car takes up, my braking is terrible, turning and changing lanes is either done too fast or too slow, and I can’t keep a steady speed. All of the buttons and functions trigger panic in me and I also have to wear thick glasses because my vision is not the best. I am very oblivious and have a hard time catching onto things, with very slow reaction times, for these reasons I feel so unsafe in a car as a driver. I fear I am putting my life at risk as well as others, because I just suck THAT badly.

Sometimes after a while of practicing I feel better about it, but the next day is like starting from zero again, and it’s like my brain has lost the saving point and erased all the date, like restarting a game.

A lot of the time I think the people who have taught/tried teaching me are just a bit too rough for me to handle (I am an absolute crybaby I admit it), but I can’t afford a professional driving instructor so I’m kind of screwed! Maybe I’m just too sensitive to be behind the wheel, I am just too concerned about what other drivers think and how much they hate me because I’m slow and indecisive. It could also be the fact that I am in a fairly new area and have no sense of direction, and even more likely, I have horrible anxiety.

This could have stemmed from years of childhood “trauma” of my mother screaming at me for directions when I was about 8-9 years old, and feeling so afraid of reading maps wrong because I did not want to upset her. This trauma has somewhat intensified as my girlfriend and I tend to get tense when she drives and I am giving directions, since I suck at them and it frustrates her.

I guess my question is, how can I improve? How can I motivate myself when all I want to do is breakdown behind the wheel? Am I just one of those people who will never learn how to drive? And if so, how can I tell? 

TL;DR: My anxiety for driving has been added onto by an emotionally abusive mother and a well-meaning but also anxious girlfriend. Now I can’t drive without crying. How does one drive?",01Aug2019,1

208,"I (23m) live in a house with my two sisters. My parents helped me finance it with the stipulation that my siblings could live there if they were in need. They both found it was far more inexpensive to live here than an apartment, but that's a separate issue. 

About 6 weeks ago, my sister asked if a close friend, Roxanne (25f), could stay with us after she got kicked out of her house. I agreed, believing it would be no longer than a couple weeks. Now it seems that it may be much longer than that. Roxanne doesn't own a car and she doesn't make great money as a server. She also has zero motivation to improve her circumstances. 

Roxanne has suffered from depression, drug abuse, body dysmorphia, and self-harm stemming from a rough childhood. She was in rehab to get clean from heroin, but isn't currently seeking any therapy or treatment. Roxanne still drinks and does certain drugs at least 2 days a week. Mainly cocaine, which is very normalized in my sister's circle and among young servers in my city. When she does ""party"", her consumption is excessive. Very similar to behavior in other addicts I've associated with.

I am very self-motivated and driven to accomplish my goals, so I thought I could help her get motivated. I enjoy helping people (sometimes too much) and I want her to move out as soon as possible. I've also made the mistake of getting romantically involved with her making matters worse. 

Everytime I talk to Roxanne about steps to improve herself and her life, I get nowhere. I believe that no matter how bad your issues are, you can always work to improve yourself. While mental illness isn't necessarily curable, it shouldn't control your life. She tells me that I couldn't possibly understand because I've never dealt with mental illness personally.

The other night, I noticed some bile in the toilet after she was in there. I asked her about it as I was concerned and dumbfounded. She assured me that she rarely regurgitates her food, only after very unhealthy meals (McDonalds). Also, it's a ""control thing"" over her self-image. I attempted to give the alternative of other control methods of self-image. Obviously, diet and exercise. I know her condition isn't that simple, but small steps lead to mountains of change.

I ended the conversation after she said, ""Did you ever think that some people really enjoy self-sabotage?"" At that point, I realized that she has no intention of changing her habits or working on herself. I feel that there's nothing I can do to change her preconceived notions. It seems that she's using her preexisting conditions to justify being helpless. 

I've been in a similar situation with a past relationship. My ex-girlfriend pitied herself constantly and also believed she was hopeless. I was trying to figure my life out and I couldn't handle her problems on top of my own. I left my girlfriend when I realized I couldn't be her savior. After the breakup, she realized she needed to address her issues. After therapy and life changes, she is doing much better. I don't think she would have ever gotten help if we didn't split up. 

This is why I know Roxanne isn't hopeless. I am much more stable now than in my prior relationship and I do genuinely want to help her. I've considered giving her 2 more months at my house before she has to leave. I'm hopeful that maybe a deadline will make her realize she needs to manage her money to support herself. With this accomplished, she might see that she isn't a victim of her conditions. I've also considered ending our fling as a breakup helped my prior girlfriend. Our fling is becoming an unofficial relationship. We call each other pet names, we sleep in the same bed, among other things. I just don't know what to do at this point.

211,"Sorry if I unintentionally generalize gay people.

Am I gay?

I’m not a very flamboyant person, but ever since highschool everyone  has questioned my sexuality. I grew up with a mom and a sister so naturally I find it easier to build friendships with women rather than men. I know for a fact that I’m attracted to women but I don’t know if I’m attracted to men. There are certain things make me feel like I might be gay. 

Here is a list; feel free to give your opinions, again, not trying to over generalize gay people

-I take care of my hands/nails so they’re not crusty (no I don’t paint them).

-If I want to wear something nice with a particular piece of clothing or shoe I will go on google and analyze what the model in the picture is wearing
(I do this because in theory, the brand wants to make the product seem attractive so they obviously take their time checking what goes well with the product. This saves me the hassle of seeing what works and what doesn’t.

-I catch myself staring at other men, it’s more of a comparison of clothing/body type rather than admiration/attraction 

-(This is the gayest thing I’ve done) NSFW
I’m going to get kind of personal with this since I’m anonymous..
*I occasionally watch porn throughout the week, I’ve learned that I’m into older women. I switch between girls in college-middle aged women (I’m a college student). One day I was beating my meat while I was high as a kite and I started to really analyze what I was doing &amp; what made me choose this specific porno. If you’ve ever smoked weed you know sometimes simple questions can lead you down a rabbit hole of other questions. Anyway, so my dick was hard and as I was stroking it I stopped and said “fuck it, let’s see if I’m gay”. I went to the category logs and looked up gay porn. I tried masturbating to it while I was still hard from the other porn I was watching but my penis deflated instantaneously like a balloon losing air. I genuinely tried to enjoy it but it was no use. Could there still be a chance I’m gay or..? I haven’t met any guys that I’m attracted to although I do recognize that guys can be attractive. It’s really hard for me to make guy friends (I do have some), but the majority of my friends are women. I’ve had girlfriends before and occasionally I’ll have sex with women. Do men genuinely get hard when they have sex with one another or do they really love each other and then proceed to use a stimulant? I know these are really taboo questions but this is reddit and I’m genuinely curious. I wouldn’t have the guts to ask someone I know or didn’t know, in person about these kind of things. 


Oh yah! Sometimes on Snapchat I get bombarded with Grinder or other gay dating site ads. Ads are based on your search history &amp; other things, what if Snapchat knows I’m gay before I do? 

im not trying to be cocky or anything when I say this but, I think I’m pretty attractive myself. I’m really skinny but I’m mainly talking about my face, do you think that’s why I talk to &amp; hook up with women so easily? Or do they just stick around bc they genuinely think I’m gay. I alwaaaays get hit with the “when I first met you I thought you were gay”.

If you took the time to read all this, thank you. Please try and be serious about this, I’m genuinely curious. Thanks.",01Aug2019,2
212,"My parents are heavily Christian and insist on ending each day with a family prayer. After a lot of thought and mental struggle, I’ve decided I no longer believe in their faith and no longer wish to take part in any of its rituals, including praying to a god I do not believe is there.  

When I told them I wasn’t going to pray with them tonight, my mom looked at me like I’d just punched her in the face.  I felt bad doing it and I’m not sure if it was the right thing to do... I mean, should I just not care what I think and pray with them still?",01Aug2019,2

219,"So my mother is ill. She has been for years and we think it’s a brain thing/ hormonal. At first my dad thought it was end stage kidney disease but she’s missing the stage of turning yellow. Anyways basically she is mentally and physically sick. And she doesn’t realize it. But first I need to give you backstory on why she moved out in the first place. 
My mother moved out about 7 months ago because she cheated on my dad with a man she had been emailing for months behind our backs. She has told me many times she’s leaving my dad but this time it was real. I was so done with all of it. My dads not a passionate person, he never has been and never will be. He has been the same my entire life. But my mother made it seem like it was his fault for cheating because he’s not affectionate enough. But after these past months I realized my dad does in fact love my mom like a lot and has stuck by her through all her procedures to figure out her illness. Now one day I woke up and all my moms stuff was gone. She had gone to a Christmas party with the guy she cheated on my dad with even though she said she wanted him back. She even gave me and my brother a tour of her house like we were going to live there (we are not my dad refuses). But my dad took her back(not living with us) and decided to stay by her side because he thinks the cheating was apart of her mental illness and stood by her side. But she still lives with the guy she cheated on my dad with. The only reason she kept living there was because she didn’t want me and my brother to see her like this. Now let’s get down to the problem.
My mother wants to move back in l. Probably because the lease is up on her new house with that guy and she misses me and my brother.I miss her too but her mental illness changed her personality. She became vulgar and toxic and nasty to be around. Sometimes she acts normal but mostly of the time when she comes over it consists of her watering the garden for like 2 hours.(where I live it rains a lot so it’s pointless most of the time) she comes in and yells at me or my dad insulting us and crying. The other day she cried because we were talking about cable. CABLE. We don’t need cable and she bought a new cable box even though we already have one and she’s paying for it even though it’s not installed. But the point is that she is a ticking timebomb anything you say will make her cry. Then she storms out of the house insulting me. She’s yelled at me before at a nice restaurant for not taking my brother to school (hypothetically) when it starts because everyone is a bully to her and yelled at me calling me a terrible sister and awful person. It’s hard to spend even 30 minutes with her on a bad day. Not saying there are only bad days. Some days she is my mom again and we dance in the car to 90s and 2000s music. Those are the good moments but they are very rare. I remember last year living with her was so toxic I struggled so hard in school. I would isolate myself and I put all my emotions into my ex. I would sit in my room to avoid her. I would never want to come home but had to because I had nothing to do if I didn’t. She’s micromanaging my senior year and won’t let me get a car that does not fit her requirements (my budget is 3,000 and it’s hard to fit all those requirements) I just know I can’t handle it if she comes back since she is 10x worse. But I feel so guilty she is my mother I love her. But I know every night would be another battle against her. Every night she’d cuss me out if I don’t bring my brother to school because I’m late or something.",01Aug2019,1
221,"I asked a question in a post in a Facebook group. I replied to the comments, and it can be seen in the edit history and time stamps of the comments that people did not correctly read my question, yet people still accused me of not asking the question clearly enough. Thus, trying hard to be polite, in another post, because italics, bold, and underline are not easy on Facebook, I asked the question in all caps five times. Three people got hung up on one detail, only that I was rude, and I apologized, yet they would not let it go and ran with it. I was misunderstood before I was rude and I was still misunderstood when I was rude because I was desperate to be understood, and I feared that saying it too many times would make me not understood.

I made a third post seeking, complaining that people were being rude to me, and I was implicitly referring to people not reading the question, and that was obviously the reason for my repeated all caps. However, someone who did not make an effort to know what it was that rude, just condescendingly, genetically commented “Maybe you should know that if you are rude to people then people will be rude to you.🤷‍♀️“. She was biased and one-sided, in that she cherry-picked when I said “they were rude to me” only to say that, but did not even listen to me saying what was rude. If she believed me that they were rude, then why not see what was rude, and ponder that it was in the other order? She could have politely disagreed (said that incorrectly answering the question was not rude), or just not answered the question at all. Just like smart-Alecs twist our words against us and throw them in our face and miss the point and make us regret saying something a certain way, this was similar. She was not in a position to give unsolicited advice if she did not know the whole situation. I am not justifying my rudeness, but was this rude of her?",01Aug2019,0
222,"Hello, I have entered a situation that I did not want to enter. My great grandfather left me a trust fund of around 300 to 400k, and left my siblings each about 150k before he died. My mom was considered the trustee until I came of age. Currently, I am 22 and just found out about my trust by going to the lost and found randomly in our state and seeing that I had 30k of lost funds in there, and then proceeded to ask my mom what that money was from. After I kept pestering her to fix it and finally give me my funds, my mom today told me that when the market crashed in 2008 she took all of the money out of the stocks me and my sibling fund were invested in (basically making the value 1/5th  after the crash) then NEVER REINVESTED IT AGAIN, BASICALLY MEANING I HAVE LESS THEN 80K AND MY SIBLINGS HAVE NOTHING. Honestly, I can not believe the ignorance of my mom to never reinvest the money again and just leave it in the bank and to lose EVERYTHING. I would have over what I had before 2008 if she had just done simple investing in the SPY 500. My mom also lost her entire fund from my great grandpa, more then 500k from a bad business investment. Now, my grandmother is still wealthy, and my mom will inherit that money and Realestate once she passes. Honestly, should I try ask my mom for some of that money? I know it is selfish, but honestly my mothers ignorance and stupidity has basically removed the head start me and my siblings had. I realize that many of you will think this post is somewhat bratty, I just can not believe that my mom lost over 500k in assets that were for me and my siblings. What would you guys do?",01Aug2019,3

226,"This is probably extremely obvious for people looking from the outside, but I need advice. 

Since May I’ve been working for an independently owned business that’s very well known in my town. I’m currently a university student living on my own with little to no help from my parents so I knew I would need a job soon and fast. I applied to this place and was hired quite unexpectedly. I didn’t even expect to get the job in the first place due to my horrible interview (stumbling, stammering, being unsure) but apparently that was better than the other applicants (brought mom to interview, high on crack at the interview, didn’t show up, etc) 

Things started out great I guess, but then I noticed some things. 

1. There’s an INCREDIBLY high turnover rate. Since I’ve worked there, 8 people have been fired or have quit for various reasons. 
2. I’ve been repeatedly scheduled outside of my requested hours. 
3. Management is a nightmare. We have 6 managers for a cash team of now 4 people (yes, the store has 4 cashiers including myself). Most managers will not answer your pages for customer assistance, are impossible to track down and are unhelpful. One of my managers came in clearly intoxicated, and smelled like weed. Another is rude and will write you up for minor infractions such as, in my case, being two minutes late. 
4. The location is sketchy, and it shows in the customers. I have gotten customers who are rude, misogynistic and many have made me uncomfortable. For instance, an older man made comments about my looks (calling me, ‘sweetie, honey, cutie’) and told me not to take nude photos of myself. I have customers who clearly smell like they’ve bathed in urine, or others who don’t understand our policies and take their drug fuelled anger out on me. While I’ve worked there have been police inside the store, as well as fights in the parking lot. Most people look like addicts and I’ve seen many buy cocaine holders (YES, WE SELL SNUFF HOLDERS). 
5. Allowed breaks. Labour law says in Ontario an employer legally required to only give one unpaid 30 minute lunch for every 5 hours worked. They stretch this to the extreme. I could work just five hours and not get a break, or work 9 (which is illegal, you are only supposed to work a typical 8 hour day) and only get 1 lunch. 
6. The cash system. Instead of a normal store that has managers count and organize your till, at the end of the night you count your own. This has lead to some issues where when I count I will be missing certain values. 

The reason I’m writing this is due to my breaking point. 

I was written up twice the other day. One for being two minutes late, and one for googling ‘cocaine holder’. Before I’ve been written up for again, lateness (the most I’ve ever been late to this job is 10 minutes and I ALWAYS call in), and being bored and reading news articles on the work computer. I know those are both my fault, but the next one is making me anxious. 

Today after counting off I noticed I was 5 dollars short. When your are more than 3 dollars out or over, a manger has to sign off on your sheet confirming they looked for the value. Now, I’ve been a cashier for 3 years now since I was in high school, and anyone who has been one will tell you: money just doesn’t disappear. You’ll remember that one order where you made a mistake. Anytime this happens, I legitimately don’t know what I did wrong. 

During the day I ran out of 5 dollar bills twice. I requested on those two separate occasions, ten  5 dollar bills. The only way the cash could’ve been lost is the manager didn’t count my fives correctly and put them in my till. And now I’m getting a write up.

228,"Disregard the simile in the title, I kind of got carried away. Anyways, my grandparents about a year ago found a mother cat and her 4 kittens in the backyard. They started feeding it, as most people would, but kept them outside because their cat inside wouldn’t enjoy the extra company. They started trapping them in order to take them to the vet and get them fixed. They got 4/5 cats fixed, but the last one- a kitten/young cat -  managed to unlock herself from the cage before my grandfather could take her to the vet. Well, she ended up being pregnant, and a while later she had kittens. Unfortunately she won’t step foot near those cages again, even though her kittens like sleeping in them (too young to fix still). This wouldn’t be a huge problem, except that same cat got herself pregnant AGAIN just recently. We don’t know how to stop her/catch her, and eventually the number of cats would be insane, and their fenced in backyard won’t be able to hold them for long and neighbors might complain.

232,"TL;DR how do I get my husband to desire sex?

 We’ve been married 5 years, dated for 3 prior. We (I’m F25 he’s M27) both grew up in very conservative homes and waited to have sex until we got married. We both fully agree that was the dumbest choice we’ve ever made. While dating we did “everything BUT PIV sex” and did that often. Now there’s hardly anything except maybe 5 minutes of sex once a month. The wedding night was traumatic and didn’t work (by no fault of our own, I had medical issues we didn’t realize), so I understand the fear that could have caused. He’s also just..bad at sex. He never watched porn as a kid and to this day can’t masturbate. He doesn’t enjoy porn now. He’s able to get hard and has erections when we are intimate or he plays around with me. He’s been talking to a therapist for a few months - all she’s said is that he seems to struggle with connecting emotionally during sex, but doesn’t think he’s asexual or homosexual. I’ve told him he’s welcome to experiment with any person he wants outside of our marriage, and I genuinely mean that. I personally don’t view physical intimacy as an emotional experience. I recently bought toys to try to peak an interest, but I don’t know how to help us overall.

236,"So hello Reddit. This is my first post and honestly I need any advice I can get. 

Basically I have known this girl for probably 6 years. I'm 19(M) she's 18(F). We were good friends and use to flirt alot but eventually I just decided not to talk to her. That was three years ago. But recently I started getting interested in her and started texting her again about a week ago. We didn't leave on bad terms of anything just kinda grew apart. 

Currently she's in another state and so am I but when school starts in a few weeks we will both be about 30 minutes from each other. I want to ask her out but I have a few problems. 

Problem 1: It doesn't seem likes she's to interested. Which makes sense because we haven't talked in a while. She doesn't text me alot and when she does it's not like this riveting conversation. She isn't ghosting me but there is a lot of time in between texts.

Problem 2: She's totally out of my league. This girl is an absolute 10. Me I'm not bad looking but definitely nothing compared to the guys she talks to now. 

Problem 3: Currently she's out partying for her 18th birthday. She's not even my girl but I can't help but think there's probably other guys where she is right now. This gets me really nervous about whether I should ask her out because what if she has something going on with someone else? I don't know if she does and I have no reason to think that she does but I just can't help but think, what if?

So what are my options. Do I just go for it and see what happens? Or do I cut my losses here and just end it before I get denied. Or do I wait a little longer and just stay friends and talk to her for a little longer?  If I do ask her out I'm not sure where to go from there because I've never been on a date or had a GF.

Any advice is helpful.

238,"Hey so Ive posted on reddit a few times about getting healthy. Let me just say, I really dont know if I'm just making excuses at this point. I've struggle with Bulimia and extreme restricting. Ive never claimed to be anorexic or have anorexia but I've definitely lost an extreme amount of weight via starving more than once. I started to do well in my late teens. I ate healthy and started exercising once or twice a day and got down to a great weight. Then I met my husband and started binging with him, stopped exercising and then when I got my first job, the weight piled on and never came off. I binge every day. And if I know I'm starting a new diet, I eat like crazy the day before. I keep thinking of ways to gradually lose weight so that it's not too hard and I stick to it but I also feel like I'm not doing enough. Like start with just soda for a month for example is extremely doable, but what about all the other stuff in the meantime?

I also recently left a fast paced job for a desk job and now I'm gaining worse than ever, and I don't know if exercise will do enough to make up for it. I'm scared to start new diets because I'm afraid I will let myself down  again. I don't feel like I'm capable of being consistent. 

And lately, Ive been seeing women who lift weights and eat 2000 or more calories a day and they look fantastic. I don't know if that lifestyle is okay for someone my size, seeing as the healthiest thing to do would be to drop the pounds faster.  I don't want to over restrict but I also don't want to be so lenient nothing happens.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, when I was 11/12 I got a new custom built computer with someone in my family's hard drive on it. It had all her old files but I was young and didn't think much of it and didn't delete it as I was young and didn't really know how to do technical stuff. However,  a hour ago I read a post something on the lines of ""computer workers of reddit what was the weirdest thing you found on reddit"" and so I decided to snoop through the files and check on them - saving old pictures. However, while checking up on them and backing up files I found some NSFW material (the thumbnail gave it away) - nothing illegal. I quickly deleted (recycle bin) all of the NSFW files but I'm just scared that I might find more, and I'm scared I might stumble on more NSFW material.  I'm not sure on what to do now. Legally, am I the owner of all the files on my computer? If something illegal was found on these old files, would I be accountable for it? I can't really wipe out the hard drive because it has my files on it as well. For reference I only use the C: drive. The old files are on the F:, G: H: and are all labelled as ""old"" and the date modified on all of the files are before I got my computer.

241,"About 5 years ago I \[29F - 25F at the time\] dated a friend \[35M - 30M at the time\] for about 9 months (6 months of the happiest days of my life followed by 3 months of emotionally manipulative hell that I very recently learned was thanks to a prescription drug habit). I finally hit my limit with his BS and told him we needed to take a break to look at what we really wanted from the relationship. We're in the same social circle, know each other's families, sometimes work together, etc. 

So, I knew that we would need to be in at least weekly contact, stay on good terms, and honestly, wanted to leave things open for him to resolve whatever the heck happened in those last 3 months if he wanted to try getting back together.For the next 2 1/2 years, we were inseparable best friends -- or so I thought. His plans to move across the world to be with another woman fell through and we both went about dating other people. At one point, I thought we might get back together and threw a few moves that he seemed to dismiss so I started dating another guy who became my next boyfriend... And all hell broke loose.

He completely cut me out of his life and asked our close mutual friends to not invite us into the same place at the same time, not include us on the same projects for work, etc. This went on for a year and had a major effect on my friendships, my work, my new relationship (which ended quickly and in part because my new guy was made to feel suuuper unwelcome), etc.When I was single, he was in a committed relationship with his new live-in girlfriend \[30F\], and all our friends were sick of managing his emotions via everyone else's schedule they started inviting us to group events... And it turns out there was more hell to break loose, at least, behind-the-scenes.

The conversations went from friendly to flirty and after months of politely trying to redirect conversations, I recently decided to confront him about setting boundaries which is when he told me:

\- He was abusing prescription drugs starting around the end of our relationship and continuing for years part-way into his new relationship, which he regrets ever getting into.

\- He's miserable in the relationship and doesn't even view it as a ""real relationship"". He's in love with me and has always imagined a life-long future with me (something he never shared while we were together).

\- His girlfriend hates being around me and they fight about me at least every month or so because of how he acts when I'm around. She's usually fairly cold and a bit catty toward me.

\- He recently lost his job and is depending on her for all of his financial needs, which he says is the main reason he's staying with her. 

\- He can't say that if I were to get into a new relationship that he wouldn't try cutting me out of his life again -- and while he's choosing to stay with her, he has been and very much wants to continue looking for opportunities to cheat on her with me (something I'm totally against). 

\- He expects me to keep all of this between the two of us.

At this point, I'm really angry that he threw all this on my lap at a time when I was trying to create better boundaries so we could actually be friends. I don't think he genuinely wants to be with me (and even if he did, considering the way he's treating his current girlfriend behind her back, I don't see myself wanting to be with him again in the future) -- so this is not about how to win him back or anything stupid like that. But I've been consistently opting out of important events with friends because of how uncomfortable and unwelcome they both make me feel and I've had multiple promising relationships fall flat early on at least in part because my new partner got a taste of the bizarre group dynamic and noped out. 

I've tried resolving this multiple times with him and instead of respecting boundaries (from a friendly phone call to outright crying in a coffee shop and asking him to please, please, please just stop), but every time he throws out new info that complicates the whole thing and at this point, I wish we'd just continued not speaking. As hard as that was, this is much harder.I feel trapped and don't know how to get space from him and his advances without letting friends know that we're not quite getting along the way it would seem, but that would invite a lot of questions that I don't want to deal with.

I have to see him and his girlfriend this weekend and I'm already dreading another super important event with friends and thinking of dropping out. I feel like I'm ready to snap and obviously don't want that. How can I get some space while staying classy in this situation?I don't want to involve mutual friends and don't know who to talk to, so I really appreciate the advice!!

\-- 

TLDR: my ex from 5 years ago (who is in my close circle of friends, same small work industry, and can't be avoided without making a fuss) hid a drug problem from me, threw a little sabotage into the relationships I tried having since him, and now won't stop trying to cheat on his new girlfriend with me.

242,"This is unnecessarily long. I apologize.

I dont know what good this post is going to do. But I'm so lost. So, where do you turn to when you're lost? Reddit. 

I have a cousin who isnt really my cousin, but she has been apart of my family for as long as I can remember. All the time as kids we would sleepover at our grandma's house and I've never had a bond that close to someone in my entire life. 

I stopped seeing her. Not because I didnt want to, but because her family just became too busy for us. To be honest, I have no idea why not. Her family is very christian. Not saying it's a bad thing to be christian, I dont even know what I believe in, I just dont agree with most of what certain christians believe in. 

She's switched schools her whole life, her mother wouldn't let her have friends that had different beliefs than her, she basically lived at our grandma's house while her mom did god  know's what, and she only just recently got a sturdy father figure in her life. 

Since I havent seen her in a while, I was only now learning that she cuts and has attempted suicide more than once. And in the times I have seen her, she came out to me as bisexual and I was so happy for her, yet so scared of how her mother would react. And I'm devastated, because she's so important to me, and means so much to me despite the fact that we don't see each other enough. Her mother started a GoFundMe on her Facebook to send her away to a 'wilderness christian facility' in Wyoming called Trinity Teens and apparently it was supposed to be 10,000 dollars but is now 3,000 for them. She told everyone not to say a word to her daughter about it.

I watched a movie called Boy Erased that's based off of a real story, where a kid was sent off to conversion camp and they used the same selling method 'oh we'll give you a deal and blah blah' None of the counselors there were professionals. It's a really good movie, and it may have been foreshadowing for this very moment. But it just got me thinking that this definitely cant be good for her. She hasnt had a stable home in her life, and they're sending her away to a place that can probably be abusive to her.

So, I turn to google and search up Trinity Teens where some of the things they treat are 'sexuality' and read the reviews where people constantly gave bad reviews saying how none of them are medical professionals and they make 100 dollars per day, that they'd make you do chores and rarely even met up for counseling sessions. Somebody who actually went there said they made them stare at walls and even sometimes justified their suicidal emotions. 

I'm just scared. I dont know what to do, or how to help. I dont even know what this long post was even for, because even I know that there's nothing I can do. I just need reassurance, advice, or something ANYTHING before I lose my mind.",01Aug2019,1

My girlfriend is the most important thing to happen to me, and she feels deeply sorry and guilty that it happened. However, I am not upset. I am more upset that the guy took advantage of her more than the kiss itself.

The advice I seek is what to tell her in order for her to realise it isnt her fault this happened. Shes afraid I will break up with her in the near future for it and overall I'm just looking to calm her down.",01Aug2019,13
245,"Trigger warning (i guess): sexual abuse. 
So, my best friend and I have been by each other’s side since the day we met. However, last year he met this girl that he became incredibly obsessed with. The first time I met her, we drank a little and she ended up molesting me. I cut her off for a while, but for the sake of my best friend tried to make amends—that’s where everything went downhill. She seemed okay, a little eccentric, a little over dramatic, but nice and continually showered me in compliments. I see now, that’s a HUGE red flag. I start to notice, too, how loose she is with other people continually touching all over them and flirting right in front of my best friend/her boyfriend. I started noticing a lot of little behavioral ticks that, to me, didn’t add up. She seems be insecure but then turns around and acts super arrogant. She tries to relate to me on things that she has clearly no interest in. Then she “confides” in me and makes sure everything she says is confidential, except she’ll tell me the same “secret” like 4 times. However, she’s also stated several million times how much she hates lying and mentioned breaking up with my best friend because he lied about hooking up with someone before they started dating. Well, she also stated being in to one of my other close friends (who lives with my best friend and this girl), but that was a while back. Now that all three live together, I’ve witnessed fist hand that she flirts and crosses boundaries with friend #2. She’s also mentioned that best friend (BF for short) is terrible in bed and she’s left unsatisfied. I’ve gathered all of this information and been just holding on to it for a few months. Well, last week I told BF, “hey, dude, I think your girl is lying to you... you need to be really careful” and then mentioned the behavior that I’ve seen. He went to her and she FLIPPED. She cussed me out, told me how horrible I was, and blocked me on everything. Recap: the same girl that supposedly hates lying has been lying and manipulating BF so she can continue to live with him, but secretly wants to date our other friend; then, cussed me out when I mentioned the behavior to BF. So, recently she texted me something completely random and got upset that I didn’t respond (I cut all contact). BF and other friend haven’t so much as texted or called or anything since all of this has gone down; so, I can only assume that she felt her false sense of superiority  threatened and slandered the hell out of my name. I realized she was a narcissist because after some time away from her I ran across an article that pointed out all the traits of a narc, and she matched every last one. I guess I’m just not sure what to do. Do I cut all of them off? Do I try to remain friends with BF and the other friend? Do I call her out? Do I mention to them that she’s a narcissist? Is it even worth it?",01Aug2019,1

247,"Recently posted about this issue, and everyone recommended I say my peace to my roommate. I spoke to my roommate about my anxiety surrounding her FWB’s untrained, unneutered husky/wolf dog, and having it just be there when I get home is a huge surprise and triggers my anxiety around this animal, due to have been bitten by 2 different huskies before. We also agreed on the fact of communicating better when friends/family are coming over, which helped to partially patch our previous issue.

My solution is for the large dog issue, is to tell me in advance when the dog is coming over so I can make plans not to be there. She says due to her nature, she can’t always guarantee more than 5 minutes notice for this dog to show up, and she wants to find a “medium” solution, so we can all be in the same house in harmony. We talked about some alternatives (mostly blocking off part of the yard so I can feel comfortable not having to deal with the dog when I let my small dog out). My solution was to give me the maximum amount of notice that is possible, so I can make my own choices about the headspace I can try to be in, and/or finding a place to stay if I am too stressed. This seems to be unacceptable to her, because “she knows herself and FWB, and they might not remember to say something to me”. I’m not sure if there are alternative solutions, but I am in desperate need of guidance. I feel like she’s trying to force me to be around this dog “so I can see how much of a sweetheart he is”, instead of having my space respected as 1/3 of the tenancy.

ALL I WANT IS A LITTLE HEADS UP, do I just stand my ground on that? How do you make someone communicate their plans?",01Aug2019,1

My dad suggest I stay living with them till Im 30 or until I marry (not very likely to happen)

Im 25 and while it is common for the children of ppl here to stay until their 35 or married I don't want to do that. This is getting embarresing that I am still being treated as a child no matter my age. I know buying a house won't stop that but at least I won't be supervised 24/7.

But here is the thing my parents do own a tiny summer house that Id like to live in despite its age but due to the neibours rebuilding they may destroy it and give us a flat for free if were lucky or if they damage the building we sue.

Its been over 2 years and they havent even started it. If they had changed there mind we wouldnt know so parents aint giving it to me till they finish. It will probably be anouther 6-10years before that happens so should I buy the one man appartment, for a couple of years easily payed off and then set it up for rent when the new flats are ready?",01Aug2019,1

254,"Title is pretty much self-explanatory. Sorry if this may be shitty to read, to be honest I don't even have the energy to do anything anymore but I wanted this to be my last shot. Hurray for strangers on the internet. 

Anyways, SO and I have been in a rough patch for a few months now. To the point that we start fighting over something so petty until it turns out to be this huge fight about anything and everything (we used to just acknowledge petty little things, apologize, and then laugh it off. The only thing we'd fight about is some huge misunderstandings or other non petty fights.)

But things have been worse and worse. It's honestly so tiring to be with each other now. ***We both don't want to end things*** at all but at the same time we're both pretty mutual in acknowledging that everything is just shit. 

We've given each other some space. Once for 3 days and then it kinda (not really) became OK for a while. But then the fighting would come back and now it's been a week of space and nothing is really happening at all no matter how much we rest from each other (to reflect on ourselves).

At the moment, SO is on my way to my house and we're about to return expensive things that we've given to each other (specifically phones). I'm currently on limbo trying to decide whether to end everything now or to try once again to talk (hopefully not fight) and give our relationship another chance. I feel like we have hope and I honestly don't want to end this at all either but all fighting spirit has left my body. I started to eat away at myself everytime we'd fight and now I'm just in this deep dark hole of feeling like shit because of our relationship and I keep blaming myself because my stupid fucking brain can't think of anyway to fucking fix what used to be a wonderful relationship. Sincerely strangers, please do help.

A list of things we often fight about:

The major things are

* Lack of time and communication
* Pointing fingers at who started to make the relationship shitty

But the petty arguments that turn into a whole debacle are

* how we don't text/contact each other before having a sudden plan that involves being gona for a whole day
* No longer sending sweet messages to each other
* Watching a movie instead of talking to the other person
* Walking away when there's a fight instead of fixing it right away
* Us telling each other that (and this is a rough translation because I honestly don't know how to translate this in english and my brain is not working) ""I'm so sick of you"" ""Don't call me crying because I don't care""

Have tried to reach out to a few ""friends"" who just told me to end it or move on or find someone else and that ""they've heard/had much worse problems"" fuck you.",01Aug2019,1

Despite being in a bad relationship for three years and recently getting out of it, I still feel almost nothing. After leaving that relationship I realized that I have no friends around me, yet I am still not scared. It almost seems as if I have no emotion, and it kind of weirds me out. Like in almost any situation, I can think so abstractly about it to the point that I just don’t care, or I can distract myself from ever feeling.

I feel like this isn’t really healthy for me because I am not actually confronting my emotions, but just forgetting them, or arguing that they don’t matter.

So I guess my question is... how do I get myself to actually confront my feelings?",01Aug2019,1
256,"So my roommate and I are pretty close friends, which is nice. She is doing an internship that's about to end and one girl she knows from the internship who lives on a university campus near us has a small gap between when she has to leave campus and when her lease starts.

The thing is, we used to live with other people in the past and just had terrible luck, and I'm really wary of letting people I don't know into my home. I feel bad that this girl will be homeless, and I know some of the other interns are facing this problem too, but I just don't feel very comfortable with it. On the other hand I do feel bad, but I've also been burned so many times, and I just don't know if I can deal with someone else living here right now. She still has 20 days until the end of her lease. Should I let her stay here or should I ask my roommate to tell her to figure something else out?

I’m also in love with my best friend and I have been for like 2 years. recently, i’ve had really strong feelings for her and i found out through a mutual friend that she felt the same. ALSO it should be noted that my boyfriend and my best friend dated about two years ago for like a month and apparently he said some bad stuff to her. so basically they hate eachother and she hates that i’m with him. She and a couple of my other friends are constantly telling me to break up with him because they think he doesn’t care about me and all we do is smoke weed and have sex, which isn’t true. I really like him and I don’t want to lose him, but i also don’t wanna lose my best friend and i really love her. I just wish i could have both of them but i know it would never work. 

also tonight i had a huge mental breakdown about this situation and i told my boyfriend i had feelings for her. he threw up a couple times and i cried a lot. i told him i really cared about both of them and i didn’t want to lose either but i didn’t know what to do. he told me he just wanted me to be happy and wanted to work something out. That would be really good but i don’t think she’d be down for it unless i broke up with him. so yeah i am stuck and i just don’t know what to do. I can see where people are coming from when they say he’s not good for me because we don’t really go on dates, he’s usually high, he always wants to do sexual stuff and both of us have a lot of emotional baggage, but i really don’t want to break up. I’m not sure if he really cares about me but he seems like he does and i feel so bad breaking his heart.

ALSO there’s more. for a couple weeks he has been telling me he thinks she likes me and he’s scared that she’s trying to steal me from him, which isn’t far from the truth. So i’d feel really bad leaving him for her and i’m scared he would hurt himself.

Her only argument against us is that my dad is a recovering alcoholic. However, he’s been doing incredibly well and strives to get better every day. Now, we are in no ways professionals, but based on my dad’s experience with her while they were together and her excessive posting about “getting drinks with the girls!” We believe there’s a chance that my dad’s not the only one struggling and she just refuses to admit that she needs help.

Anyways, I started falling for her, but I didn't want to pursue anything seeing as I had just gotten out of several year relationship, and I got the feeling she had some interest as well. Anyways, I ended up leaving that job and did get her number to stay in touch and maybe get together.... Only to have my phone destoryed about a week later and losing all of my contacts. 

Here's where it gets cringy IMHO... She's stayed on my mind ever since :p Not like an everyday thing, but its a constant ""What if...?"" I always ask myself. The thing now is, after all this time, I decided to look for her on social media and I found her on Instagram... But idk if I should try talking to her, in general even, not like a ""looking for lost love"" type way. But even then, the fear of coming off as a creep makes me hesitate... How would I even word an initial message? 

Any and all advice would be much appreciated. Thanks fellow redditors",01Aug2019,2
282,"I have this girlfriend that I met quite a while ago. She's someone with whom I connected very well, she was the only person in the world who would understand me and I believe I was the same for her.

Unfortunately, as time passed by we kind of grew distant. We no longer have things in common and to add to that she and I have our own psicological issues that definitely have an impact in our communication.

I no longer care to talk to her, I ignore her messages pretty often because I really don't know what to say or how to talk to her anymore. Although I try to answer even if I don't want to.

Anyways, my main concern about her is that she's a girl that is not doing anything for her and I'm rather scared of her future. I'm not much older than her,",01Aug2019,3
283,"This has been going on for two days. I didn’t take any medication at first because I thought it was from stress. But it hasn’t subsided nor intensified. I just took an Advil pill to help. 
Still...... I’m not sure what is causing it. 
I can’t sleep at night at all. 

Has anyone experienced this?",01Aug2019,2
284,"Okay so about 3-4 weeks ago my boyfriend accepted a follow request from a girl he was talking to right before we got together. They had a fling and she wound up blocking him. We got together shortly after and it's been 4 months. When he told me about them talking I expressed that I was uncomfortable with it but I trust him. Fast forward a week and he decides to unfollow her because he said he felt like it was the right thing to do. Tonight I went on my Instagram for the first time in about two weeks (took a small break from social media), and was looking for someone he follows when I noticed he was following the same ex fling, and liking her pictures (not just of her but her bf and such). Now I feel some sort of way because of the conversation we had after he deleted her. It's currently 2:30 am and I can't talk to him about it until he wakes up. Before I confront him (if I do), am I overthinking this entire situation? Right now I'm nervous that he finds interest in her because he didn't start following her again until sometime after I got rid of social media (I don't know when he started following her again but I haven't been on since the 15th of July and for the 2-3 weeks after he unfollowed her that I was on he hadn't tried following her again until after I was off Instagram), or could it be just a coincidence as far as timing? Sorry for this being all over the place, but I'm just trying to get my thoughts together.",01Aug2019,0
285,"Hiya. I’ll keep this short and sweet. 

I’m 20F, and it is currently 2:30 AM. I have to wake up for work at 7, and I haven’t gotten much sleep these past few nights due to anxiety, etc. 

I work as an assistant camp counselor at a summer camp near me, and my one cousin is the woman in charge of the camp and the other one is who I am an assistant to (one of the main counselors).

I meant to be home by 11, but I just got home now. I was with this guy I like whom I’ve known since I was about 13 years old. We just got to talking and hanging out and I knew it was getting late but just didn’t go home yet. This is 100% my fault, I know. A rookie mistake. I have never skipped a day at this camp thus far, and it’s from 8:30-4:30. I know that I physically will not be able to make it through the day tomorrow on this amount of sleep especially given that my IBS has been acting up in the mornings. 

I sound like a train wreck so I apologize. Lol. 

Anyway, he accidentally — and yes, I really mean accidentally —- gave me some hickeys on my neck. He is by no means a player or a bad guy, and I’m finally giving him a chance after he’s wanted me for such a long time now. I honestly didn’t even feel any sucking or pressure on my neck while he was kissing so I was in shock. I’ve gotten hickeys before but I knew when it was happening, and I stopped it quickly. 

I am embarrassed and cannot show up to camp tomorrow with marks on my neck especially in front of children or my family members. I feel very guilty for getting home late and now trying to skip a day of work, which will not happen again. 

My parents would kill me if they knew I skipped, so I was thinking about texting both cousins that I got sick during the night and can’t come, but leave the house and act like I am going. My only fear is that they text my parents or something. 

Can anyone help me in this self inflicted, stupid situation. I do not want my family to ridicule me for my neck because we seriously only madeout, nothing further. But they’d never believe it. 

Yikes. I’m an idiot for this one and I’m aware. Any good ideas?",01Aug2019,0
286,"Alright still in shock here not because i'm homophobic just very surprising. 
So basically long story short this gay guy hmu on here and made me get kik basically because he wanted to help me get some girls. 
Anyway he gets me on this website called doublelist where people post sex ads so i've posted in the straight category and not much luck as you can imagine.
But just now I searched my area and found an ad that was a guy looking for ""hung mutual play"" and there was an image attached so I had a look. I'm pretty straight but was just curious. Anyway theres a kik attached and the name of the account is my mate that i've known since I was 12 and go to univeristy with. No face on any of the pictures but i'm about 70-80% from the photos that its him.
I'm not trying to out him as gay because it doesn't worry me what he likes but it just seems odd as he's aggressively straight from when i've been out with him to clubs and stuff.
Should I just mind my own business or have the gay guy that got me on kik find out if its him?",01Aug2019,0

288,"I (25M) noticed on my SO’s (22F) the other day that in her gallery there was an album titled “reddit” and it was nothing but nude photos I had sent her and a few she had sent me. I’m wondering, does this mean that those photos were shared on reddit? I know previously there were other social media sites that would auto generate albums after you posted on them but I’m not sure if that’s the case here. Every time I try to do a search on google I get no answers no matter how specific my search is. Please help. Ive been really paranoid about this since I seen it.",01Aug2019,2
289,"I posted this in another sub and I just really need to get a better idea of what I can do. If that's not allowed, I completely understand. 

My friend is F17. I met her when she was 15. She was sexually active at that point, but only with people around her age. I live in Canada and age of consent here is 16 for all ages or 14/15 if you're close in age (within 5 years of age) 

However, she's has this ""boyfriend"" for a while now. She didn't tell me or anyone else much about him except for that he was ""older"". Except she got drunk the other night and came over and she told me about how he was 29 years old and how she had thought she was pregnant (false alarm, which she celebrated with getting drunk).

She showed me his Instagram account, and without her realizing that I knew, I realized that he managed the place she works (my brother works there also and I've met the ex-manager before). She worked at a gas station stop-esque place. ""Boyfriend"" recently quit as manager and my brother complained about it a lot because management went to hell. 

She won't tell me how long she's been dating him and she'd definitely lie if I asked her about him being her boss previously. (long story short: there is a rule that you can't date someone in a position of power over you when you're under 18 but I know for a fact that she'd swear they started dating after he quit). 

There really isn't any way to prove that they were dating while he was her boss, because she's not stupid enough to tell anyone that and she says she loves him.

She says he's good to her and that I don't need to worry and that she's not doing anything she doesn't want to. She also swears up and down that she's not sugar dating (like getting paid). I'm not one to shame anyone for sexual expression, but their age difference just makes me feel so icky. She's not a legal adult yet. And he's 12 years older than her.

I don't want to reach out to police because there's no proof that their relationship breaks any rules, unless she provides it and she won't. Her parents are divorced and are barely home and her older sister was a teen mom that is living in Italy or Portugal or something

Does anyone have advice in how to talk to her about this or how to ""intervene"" without ruining a friendship?",01Aug2019,2
290,"There is this girl that I thought was really great at fist and we are both interested in each other, however it has taken a turn. I found out that her step brother is actually one of the most toxic people at my school. This guy has gone around and took a ride on almost all the girls in his grade. Single girls, taken girls, you name it. He is a manipulative dick. On top of that he does drugs all the time in a non responsible manner. It is to the point where it is pretty much morbid. He is just an overall stupid person considering he has failed countless subjects just because of his stupid beliefs and habits. Is it wrong for me to care? I consider myself an academically prestigious person and I believe in the power of education and staying away from fucking idiots.",01Aug2019,2
291,"There’s going to be quite a lot, just a fair warning in advance.

Things to keep in mind for future reference..
• I’m 19 (M)
• I’ve been unemployed my entire life
• I’ve been diagnosed with MDD during 2013 and it has made things incredibly difficult for me
• I come from a wealthy family 

Here’s my life.
I grew up in a family with 2 sisters and both parents, except one of my sisters hated my parents. CPS would be over every day because she hated my parents so much that she was trying to ruin their lives by putting me and my younger sister into Foster Care (Ridiculous, I know).
I grew up fearing of everything, extremely paranoid even, and I still am the same. I had to drop out of high school and get a GED due to being bullied and beat up for my height and looks (To be brutally honest, I am 5’2” and I look 12. I don’t think that’s normal for guys that’re almost 20), and I’ll be starting college in August. 

During 2018 my parents started making me pay for my own stuff when I was 17, and they would talk about how much better my younger sister is, showered her with gifts, and made sure I saw it all happen. I grew up playing a game of “who’s the favorite child” but didn’t care enough to partake. 
I started doing art commissions since they stopped paying for stuff for me, made about $700 in 4 months and I was pretty happy with myself. I was looking forward to buying a new laptop and a few games to distract myself. My parents realized how much I was making off of being awake nearly 24/7 and just drawing, so they thought it was a good idea to make me pay for my phone bills. All of my money was gone very quickly, and I’ve never felt so ripped off.

After that I started getting severely depressed due to lack of socializing (we moved to a state with 100% no family members and all my friends broke contact from my old school, I was a primary bully target during high school and didnt make friends) and I stopped getting commissions slowly and thought it would be a good idea to LDR since I didn’t know how else to obtain happiness during that time. Worst decision of my life. He (I’m bi) moved in and promised we’d move out within a month. I live in a very large house with 3 dogs and he got attached. That 2 months became 5 months, then 8 months, then he started getting abusive physically and mentally, told me to kill myself constantly and I actually was stupid enough to listen and ended up on Legal Hold for 3 days in a practical mental asylum (my parents caught me beforehand which is why i was sent there) on Christmas Day, then dumped me and called me a fag when he was the one who asked me out. Harassed me for a month on a meme page and posted my address to over 9,000 people for literally no reason, all that fun stuff. Turns out he was just using me for my house and dogs (he told my father this for some reason like he wasn’t going to tell me), so he got evicted (this took place this year). However that’s not necessarily my issue right now, this is all just a big public vent I guess. 

What’s my issue right now? Money. Surprisingly coming from a wealthy family my parents prioritize big fancy TVs instead of their own children, they wouldn’t lend me a penny. I’ve been frantically trying to obtain art commissions because of a medical problem I have that requires monthly medications that cost me about $60 every month. I’m currently down to $37 and I just feel like this is it. I can’t attend to my medical needs anymore and this is really just it, I feel myself giving up out of my own will and it’s scary because I don’t want to give up.

“Why can’t you get a job?” is probably what you’re thinking, but here’s the thing. I live in a state where it’s over 103 F (39 C) on average, and the closest bus stop is an hour walk away. UP HILL. In DIRECT sunlight. Closest retailers are full-staffed and a 30 minute walk away, also in direct sunlight. I’m stuck where I am, otherwise I’ll have another heat stroke like the last time I thought getting a job would of been a good idea (Not a fun experience whatsoever). I’m not a fit guy, kind of skinny and malnourished due to a lack of appetite from antidepressants destroying my stomach lining since I’ve been taking them for so long. I can’t hold food down sometimes, even if it’s my favorite food. I’ll throw it up and it isn’t a good feeling.

I love my family regardless of shit they do, but nobody is perfect. I just wish they showed that they cared more, is all. It’s the only care I ever receive and I hardly get it from them, I feel emotionally dependent on them and I don’t want it to stay that way. I don’t want to compete with someone I care for just to get a higher rank status of being the favorite child, she well deserves it and I’m glad she has supportive parents on her behalf.

I need help. I need friends. This is the first time I’ve even been on social media for several years now, I’ve been so disconnected with everything and I’ve just generally wanted to die a majority of my life. Thankfully my mental state has been friendlier with me this year, but now money’s an issue and I don’t know what to do.

I was thinking about starting a pin business for enamels, but I’m nowhere close to being able to financially affording it, or to start it at all. Ever since my account’s been practically depleted I’ve been worrying over everything. How I’ll pay for my meds (I have medicaid but they hardly do shit because of my parent’s wealth), how I’ll have enough money to uber down to work instead of risking heat strokes if I ever do get a job, etc. I never realized how money-dependent life actually was until I was thrown in blindly. I wish my family could’ve been more clear about how harsh reality actually is, but I guess they just took my art money at their advantage. 

So what I’m saying, I can’t get a job unless I literally wanna die getting there, if I make money my parents will find a way to deplete it, and my health’s now at risk which is why I’m here now. I don’t want to be mentally ill for the rest of my life, I want to take small steps and recover. However it feels impossible, but I know I’ll be in a brighter point in my life and if I dwell on stuff I’m merely just holding myself back.

I’m scared of college and being publicly ridiculed again for my height. I didn’t ask to be this short, it’s frustrating. I anticipate college fs, but I’m just scared about the actual students. 

I need a guide, anything. Someone to talk to, someone to laugh with and make jokes. I’m sick of being alone and listening to the twisted shit my mind comes up with, I want to function as a normal person but I can’t. I feel trapped in every way shape and form, fearing of the unknown, I’ll cry for help if I need to. I want to fix my life but I have little-to-no knowledge about how the real world works due to how much I isolated myself from it until now. If someone can help me with how student aid works, student loans, etc., that would be great and would seriously make my year. 

I’m hoping this will be the right choice posting here, I have nothing to lose so I might as well get some so I actually have stuff to lose haha. Not actually, but you get my point.

Everything’s mixed up but I’m not too good with writing large amounts of texts and staying on topic. Apologies in advance for that. If you made it here I’ll just assume you read most of it and you’ve earned some respect from me, thank you.",01Aug2019,1
292,"I have a lot of friends. But I feel like they aren't my friends.... like I'm not a part of the group. I always feel excluded and lonely when I'm surrounded by people. They act as if they dont care about me and always cut me off. They don't even address me as part of us while talking. Everybody (at least at my school) has a pairing. Like everyone has that best friend of bf/gf and everyone knows they're close, at least that's what it seems like. But that's something I don't have. I'm just tired of feeling not cared about and discarded. I need a good friend, like an irl one.

Idk what to do. My mom continues to open up the house at night because she doesn’t like to run the ac. I encouraged her to buy mothballs but she claimed the smell made her sick.

296,"This is my first post on reddit so please forgive me if I commit any mistakes.

So basically throughout my entire life everything I buy and love just drifts away from me as quickly as it can in oneway or another.

When I was in high school I bought a cycle after searching for it with my dad in our city.
We travelled far distances just so I could have the bike I wanted.
And few days later my dad bought it for me.
I loved my bike and was proud of it as I was the only one riding this exact one( Hercules rodeo NFS) throughout my entire school and even my entire city.
Fast forward 4 months.
And one day as I'm going to school I start thanking God and start to really appreciate the fact that I'm riding this bike and I literally said to my bike that I love you.
As I'm gettin nearer
I get stopped on the way by a man and he gives me a cock and bull story that his brother was injured in a fight and he needed a quick transportation to help him. 
And I was a fucking dumbass back then (even now).
So I believed his story and lent him my bike.
Infact the bad guy was so surprised he got the bike with no issues that he turned back once to look at me. And I gave him a thumbs up signifying it was okay and that I would wait for him. I took his number ( obviously a fake one)
I waited for 10 more minutes.
Oh and I forget to mention that I also had an English exam that day.
My friends came and helped searching for it but it was getting late.
So we went to school wrote our exams and on my way back I stopped by the exact same spot waiting for him,In vain.
I didn't wanna lose hope.

Finally I went home and sat down infront of my mom and dad and for a second tried to processed what in the actual fuck I had done that day.
I brokedown and started mumbling what happened.
And I could see and hear my dad was in utter shock he couldn't believe the fact I had just given an  expensive cycle to a stranger.
He wasn't shocked by the cycle which got lost but by how it got lost and the fact that his son was such a dumbfounded idiot.
My mom was not happy either.

We went to the cops, investigations took place but everything in vain again.

To this day many people don't believe that story.
As it's ridiculous and they also think I got mugged rather than the fact that I voluntarily gave it to him.
Hell my own mother thinks I got mugged.

Idk why I did what I did that day.
I could have just rode off but till that day I trusted everyone around me, like the guy frickin came asking for help.
Maybe that was the day I lost faith about the people around me.
I'm still confused idk why but I keep thinkin the world is a better place every time.
And I keep getting hurt everytime.

I bought a puppy after waiting for 5 long years.
A gsd puppy.
I loved him like I had given birth to him 
The doctors said he could not be vaccinated as he was too malnourished. 
The breeder I bought it from had separated from the mother too early.
And he died within a week.
He had caught parvo.

I worshipped a guy when I was young.
for now let his name be Gary.
I was really young like probably in the 4th grade when I first became friends with him.
He was a really funny guy and charming too.
But idk what he used to get happy by making me cry I don't know why.
All I wanted to be was his bestfriend.
And sometimes very rarely he'd act like that too.
But idk he used behave in a sadistic manner towards me always.
But I worshipped him no matter what because I was a true friend.
He isolated me, made fun of me, made people fight with me. The thing I don't understand is that I had never done anything bad or annoying or irritable ever to him but was the feeling full force of his hatred.
But for 3 more years I worshipped him as much as I could because as a friend I loved him too much.

Fast forward to 9th grade and he threw a grotesque image of me and my then gf blowing me scribbled across a paper in the most disgusting manner.
He had thrown it on the steps of my house.
My dad caught the paper.
Showed it to me.
Hell broke loose at my house.
And I didn't know wtf I had done.

My dad met the principal the next day and Gary'd parents were called.
And that was the end of my friendship with him.

To this day there are some of many events which make me question as to what I did wrong in any of these situations.
Was being a good friend bad?
Was helping a person who was in need bad?
(Regardles of whether he was faking it)


I'm still a dumb teenage kid(18M)
Situations like these keep happening to the point where I am now cherophobic.

If anybody has anything to say please do as I really wanna hear if I'm not alone or something that would help me later on.
Thank you :')",01Aug2019,2
297,"We needed a cheap mini fridge for me to take to college, and I hadn’t even considered the issues that may come with that. We found and killed two roaches, one crawling from the opening panel in the back (where the compressor is) and one was crawling on the door while I tried to wipe it down with a disinfectant wipe (a few hours later). We took the fridge outside into our shed, opened up the doors and set it high up so as to encourage the roaches to leave. We are also buying roach traps to set out in it tomorrow. 

I feel very anxious. I really don’t want to go to school and find even more bugs. The fridge is old and beat up already, the bottom itself looks a bit dingy. I can upload pictures if needed, but I don’t know where the roaches were coming from, how many there are, and honestly I freaked out a lot when I saw the bugs both times. The little roaches scare me to death. I want to try my best to ensure all the babies are gone and any eggs are gone. I’ve only seen the two babies so far.

I am a senior in high school and I’m unsure about what I should do for a career. I’ve loved writing since I was in elementary school and I have also recently developed a love for movies (mainly horror).

So naturally I started thinking about maybe going to film school and bringing my stories to life. But the problem is that my family has always believed that film and cameras have always been a waste of money and time therefore I don’t have very much experience with that kind of stuff.

Admittedly, I have a lot to learn about writing and film and I feel like it would be a massive setback to me. It’s definitely a big gamble but I’m definitely willing to learn.

I have gotten almost 5 pairs of custom orthotics from 3 different podiatrists but nothing seems to work. ($500 x 5 = $2500 down the drain)

When I wear the orthotics, my right foot (the flat one) feels great but my left foot (the non flat one) is in pain. I'm not sure why my left foot is rejecting the insole so much. The pain persists mostly where the arch is on the insole. My doctor has tried altering the left insole so that the arch is lower on the left side but that so far hasn't helped. 

When I wear regular shoes with no insoles, my left foot feels great but of course my right foot which is flat is in pain. 

I've also tried wearing the right insole with the right foot and leaving the left foot without the custom insole. This does reduce foot pain slightly however I feel unbalanced and I get pain in my left knee. 

Does anybody else have this problem? If so please let me know what you did to fix it? 

This problem has really made my life less enjoyable and I just want to find a way to fix it so I can run, walk, jump and play sports without pain.",01Aug2019,1
304,"Hi everyone. Hope this is the right place for this sort of thing, and I'm hoping you can calm my nerves.

Basically, I had a 'secret' instagram account. I'm in a relationship, and I had this other account to follow girls and celebrities I liked. I'm not proud of it at all, and at this point feel really disgusted in myself for even ever having it.

There's this girl on there who also has an admireme page (sells her nudes). One day I came across her name on the fappening blog website. Someone had posted her on there, asking if anyone had any of her pics and posted some pics from her instagram.

I had an account on that website also and commented, saying i'd like to see more pics of her. That's all.

I had the same username on instagram and fappening. She messaged me on my instagram saying she had found the thread and that she was getting the police involved because anyone sharing her content could be prosecuted.

I replied saying I've never shared or even owned any of her pics. I actually offered to message the admins and get her page removed. She said don't waste your time, the police are involved.

Since her message, I've blocked her on instagram, delted my account, and deleted the fappening account.

But I can't stop thinking about the police threat. It's got me worried sick. I don't think it's even whether i'm in trouble with the police or not, because I know I've not actually done anything wrong in the eyes of the law. But what is bothering me is if my partner finds out. 

It would genuinly ruin my life. She would leave me over just having the accounts. And like I said earlier, I hate that I had them.

I just need someone to talk to about it all because it's got me worried sick and there's no one I can talk to.

Can the girl use the usernames in any way to find out who I am?

Can the police do the same and come find me?

Can the police tell the girl who I am if they find out?

Then what if she messages me or my partner?

Those are my main worries.

Or am I just overthinking things? Was it just a threat and she hasn't actually got the police involved? Has she reported it but the police won't actually care that much?

I just feel so stupid and want it all to be over and I'll never be using accounts like this again",01Aug2019,1
305,"For a few months after moving in, I didn’t have a car and when my roommates and I were doing group things, I would hitch a ride with someone else and occasionally I would get rides from them. 

Now I have a car and I have noticed one of them has started asking me to drive to group things. Sometimes I don’t feel like driving, and it’s my car and I shouldn’t have to. Especially if it’s a group thing and people are going anyway; someone else can drive. I don’t understand why she has to “even the scales”

At the same time, she probably sees it as fair because I got rides when I didn’t have a car and now it’s my turn to “pitch in,” but the other day when she asked, I honestly think she just doesn’t want to spend gas money. So I got irritated and said I wasn’t going at all, just so I wouldn’t have to drive. 

Honestly, do you think this is fair or petty? Just tell me, I won’t mind.",01Aug2019,2
306,"Okay to start I’m (F) new to my job and I am extremely young compared to most of my co-workers. I work at really big facility and it is mostly male dominated. I’m very friendly to all that I work with and I recently got moved to a different part of the facility that’s very secluded from the other parts.  I work with three other males in the unit. I have casual conversations with them sometimes during shift because it can get very slow and it sometimes I need a break from my office. Well one of the co-workers on the unit likes to chat with me a lot when I see them and it’s just friendly light chat. He happens to be good friends with my boss who is female. Recently she’s been very cold with me and the last thing she did was call my mother who also happens to work at this facility claiming I’m not following orders, breaking rules, giving her attitude, and spends most of my time flirting with the guys. My mother was baffled mostly because I’m an adult who is out of college and can take care of myself. My boss didn’t even tell me about anything she mentioned to my mom. My mother had to tell me.... I explained the situation to my mom and how this is not true and my mom said that my boss has a thing for that co-worker who chats with me a lot and I guess because they are friends he talked to me about to her and she got jealous. She even told my mom she was going to move me units. My boss is mega alpha female with lots of power at work so if she wanted to make my life he’ll or potentially get me fired she could. My dilema is here this guy, my co-worker has been talking to me a lot outside of work as friends and I think even chatting with this guy will piss off my boss. I feel terrible for blowing off this guy all the time but I love my job and I don’t want my boss to make my life hell. I feel like I fail in all situations in this scenario because I ignore the guy he asks what’s wrong and goes to tell his friend my boss. I don’t ignore him he talks about me to his friend my boss. I love my unit and my job and this situation is stressing me out a lot. How should I handle something like this? I hope this makes sense I’m bad with my words.

307," TL;DR:  For a long time I've wanted to be a doctor, and as I am just about to  start on the path to doing so, I've been having growing fears that I may  not actually like it, and will be left with no other options.

I'm  18 and just graduated high school, in the fall I will be attending my  first pick school (University of Texas at Austin) to study biochemistry  and I am planning on pursuing an MD after undergrad and working in the  healthcare field. This is what I've wanted to do with my life since 8th  grade, and it's all I've ever known, in high school all my slots for  classes were dedicated to health and natural sciences forgoing any  courses which would immerse me in any other field. However, something  changed in me this summer when I went to my freshman orientation, I  think I realized that there is a whole world out there of people living  their lives with entirely different priorities and goals than I, what I  mean to say is there are people who have always and will always try to  do what makes them happy, but that wasn't how I came to realize my dream  of working in the heath care field. When I was that directionless,  naive 8th grader I wanted to become a doctor because I had determined it  was the best way for me to make a meaningful impact on the world, that I  would be able to die happy knowing that I had helped so many people to  live healthier and longer lives. And while that very well may be, I had  never considered if I would *live*  happy. When I was younger, I don't think I cared about my personal  happiness in the matter, I saw any adversity I would face in my future  as a noble sacrifice for the greater good. But since then I've changed,  and I honestly don't think I had realized until that orientation. I've  come to learn there's more to life than simply taking what I may deem to  be the most righteous path, It's about living well, living happy.

So  that's the situation but here is the problem: I don't even know where  to begin figuring out if there is something else I would want to do, and  I fearful I am running out of time. As previously mentioned, throughout  all of my schooling so far, I have experienced nothing outside of this  field, so if there were an occupation out there I would enjoy more, I  don't know how I would find it. And to complicate things, looking at who  I am as a person, I consider it highly possible that healthcare does  just so happen to be that thing. I do really enjoy learning about the  human body and many of the related fields (by far my favorite subject in  high school was chemistry, which relates to my major so I have built  myself a small escape hatch at the end of the next 4 yeas). Also I  personally believe I have the characteristics necessary for such a  strenuous career, I proved that to myself in high school in which there  were some periods of my life where all my time was dedicated to either  school, study, or the gym. I also work well under high stress situations  and never struggle with remaining on task. But despite all that I am  afraid it isn't what's best for me, I'm afraid I'll become yet another  one of the nearly 50% of residents/doctors who burn out, and possibly  hate their life for it. The life of a burnout doctor is so frightening  to me because not only do they hate the position they are in, but they  had to make sacrifices to get there. I am afraid that, just like in high  school, I will pass up opportunities for socializing or dating, in  relentless pursuit of success. I cant help but imagining myself as an  old, lonely, unhappy bitter man who ruined his life doing what he  thought he was meant to do.

But  most importantly, what I fear more than the problem itself, is the lack  of control I will soon have, I fear I'm running out of time to change my  life for the better. You see, biochemistry is not a very competitive  major for those who don't know. Had I applied for any of the more  serious majors at the university (computer science, engineering,  business) I can assure you I would not have gotten in, and it is for  that reason I fear the option to change my life has already surpassed  me, as I see it an highly improbable I could switch majors at this  point, at least not without enrolling an a different university. and  frankly speaking, an undergraduate biochemistry degree is not worth  much, there are not many successful career options from that point.  Leaving my options to an MD, or a Ph.D (possibly both depending on the  career I want to pursue) if I want to live a life which affords me (and  hopefully my future family) comfort and success. Not to be misconstrued,  both of the aforementioned options I am open to and even excited about  pursing, but I am becoming hopelessly afraid I will reach the summit  only to realize I hate it, and there will be nothing I can do about it,  and no one to blame but myself.

As  this upcoming school year approaches I can't help but feel the grip of  the golden handcuffs closing in, I will be on the path to achieving  everything I ever wanted, but at what cost?

End  note: I am fully aware that the thing I am feeling are probably common  of someone at this particular point in life. A month from now I will be  living a radically different life than anything I have ever experienced  with its own host of difficulties and freedoms and frankly changes  scares me, I think it scares all of us in some way. But recognizing the  commonality or even the insignificance of these thoughts do not make  them any less real, nor any less painful for me to think through day, by  day, by day. So I suppose I'm posting this in the hopes that someone  who has gone through a similar struggle, as I am sure many have, has  some guidance for me. I haven't even started school yet and I can  already feel my mental state rapidly spiraling out of control, I just  want to stop feeling what I am feeling, and fearing what I am fearing.

End  end note: I would like to sincerely thank anyone who took the time to  read through this thread and/or respond, I understand reading through  such a long-winded personal story may not be particularly appealing to  most, but your willingness to do so I appreciate in a way words could  not describe.",01Aug2019,1

312,"I was originally going to let this go but it's been bothering me. 

So I was at the urgent Care 2 days ago. They sent me to get x-rays. A tall fat guy named started with A. was the person doing it. He told me to hug the board to so a back seat that's fine. Initiates the scan. He then told me to face the wall for a side x-ray. He then got extremely close to me on the side to demonstrate the position. He described it as hands in the air body lean forward and chin up. I thought to myself why is he making me do this? Shouldn't it be straight

Then he came behind me and adjusted my body with his hands and grabbed my waist to adjust and straighten my body to a completely straight position? So why in the fuck did he tell me to lean forward just so he can tell me it's wrong and correct it to a completely straight?
I googled images later on positions for x-ray and they are all completely straight body positions too.

313,"I’ve been homeschool since the 2nd grade due to an amputation of my left leg. I love cyber school and I’ve very grateful for the opportunities it has presented me with. I’ve been getting high honors since the 4th grade. I even skipped the 8th grade entirely. Most of my time is spent in school or studying. A regular day is school, chores, studying, dinner, and finally more studying. Now that it is summer I literally do nothing. 

As you would imagine, this has impacted my social life severely. I have zero friends. Although my parents never explicitly stated I’m not allowed to have friends, they do everything in their power to prevent them. The last time I was able to see a “friend” was back in November. It’s fucking July.

- i’m 15 years old (i know, young)
- sophomore in high school
- decently attractive w/o makeup ( a 7 or 7.5, ive been told)
- kinda overweight? i’m 155 pounds lmao, i should be like 120.
- pretty shy

the reason why i told you all that seemingly uneeded information is because it ties into becoming an actress.

i want to join the drama club so i can work on my acting skills (i live in california, my school has decent extracurriculars) but i’m also not very confident and kinda shy. i want to lose weight because i feel like i’ll be happier and more confident if i liked my body.

i’m also reletively attractive, which i feel like it’ll help me get lead roles and such (i don’t know how narassitic that sounds, but i’m not full of myself don’t worry) if i ever did school plays.

i don’t have a very loud voice, but my acting is semi believable. i can shed a tear or two on command, fake anger, express sorrow without being cringey, etc.

321,"I work at a Petsmart, and recently (back in April) we got a new store manager. Everyone immediately noticed her attitude but it was nothing we couldn’t handle. She sends us the occasional overly petty group text about small things (cleanliness, something didn’t get done, etc.) but last night was the nail in the coffin for me. I was desperately trying to find another manager to cover my shift because my brother texted me from home with pictures that indicated my dog was peeing straight, red blood. She’s an older dog so of course I was worried out of my mind. All of the other managers were unavailable, and she was out of state but she kindly offered to make the 4 hour drive back to cover my shift. So I took my dog to the vet and discovered she may have bladder tumors which of course is devastating. After I got home around 6, I was emotionally drained and fell asleep around 6:30. I just woke up around 3 AM to the following texts from her.
6:53 PM- How’s your dog doing?
6:57 PM- ???
8:39 PM- Well I hope your dog is ok. (Another manager) said you text him back ((right at 6 when I got home)). So I'm starting to think you used my kindness and made me drive an 8 hr round trip so you didnt have to come back. I'm disappointed and exhausted. Hope you have a good night

My first thought is that that was insanely rude and extremely unprofessional. I texted my boyfriend because I didn’t even know what to say. He gave me a response for her and then told me to collect all of these rude and petty texts we’re constantly receiving from her to send to corporate. I am, but I’m afraid they won’t do anything. She has a reputation as a “fixer upper” who comes to manage stores that need improvement (the only reason we needed improvement is because our last manager didn’t do his job at all). Because she has this reputation and heavily kisses up to all of her superiors I’m afraid any complaint will be fruitless.

336,"I'm 23 years old, I come from middle class parents who are constantly worried about money. My dad is a stressed frugal introvert who always tells me to work hard and save money (he was raised in poverty), while my mum (who was raised fairly rich) is a carefree money spender extrovert who says it's more important to work a job you enjoy and not to worry about money. I don't have contact with other relatives so I've always been torn on what to do with my life (parents lifestyles keep me torn) so ive been trying to cover my bases but everything I do goes nowhere.

When I first started uni, my parents wanted me to go to the better one (and so did i) so I did- but I changed from computer science, to anthropology, to law, to statistics, to chemistry, to language teaching, and then just settled with a bachelor of arts because I'm good at writing essays. 

After I graduated I worked as a receptionist for a month but it was horrible, and then I spent about 2 or 3 years playing video games at home. I was super depressed and couldn't find work so I decided to apply for a different uni and study digital design this year. I've been happy just because I'm doing something but I keep wanting to change like I did at my old uni. I live in a small country where you can't really get any work in this field, plus I'm a woman which I hear greatly reduces job prospects too, and I hear the field doesn't even pay well.

I'm stressed because I want to have a job that pays well (I want to be the kind of person who can go overseas for holiday) but I haven't been able to feel motivated enough to work hard in years. I'm always tired and my memory loss (I assume due to depression) just makes me feel hazey all the time and have no energy. I also live in a moldy house that we've rented since I was a kid and it feels like a basement since it's so dark, and I feel like that really isn't helping but I can't afford to live anywhere else. Parents would help me if they could but they just can't, and really this is my problem to sort out anyway, but I'm stuck now.

I don't know what I should do. My student loans keep getting bigger so I'm scared to switch again (business was on my mind) but I don't want to be stuck with another degree I can't do anything with (or would have to probably move to the US to even have a chance of doing something with it). I want to live well, and work a job I can do, which is what I'm doing now, but I want to be able to support my parents when I'm older and live comfortably. But switching to another degree I don't know I can even commit to (mentally and physically) when I'm already terrifyingly deep in student loans doesn't seem like a good idea. I considered applying for the JET (English teaching in japan) programme so I could at least learn to live without my parents/be independent, and work while I basically travel, but I'm also scared that I'm already 23 and everyone else I know (or used to know and wouldn't help me) have businesses, well off jobs already, or are married with kids and I'm stuck in debt not knowing what I'm going to do 

Sorry it's so long, everytime I try to talk people about it I get ""make your own decisions, don't bother asking me"" or ""there's nothing wrong with being a grocery store cashier, stop trying if nothing is suited to you"" and I've just had enough keeping this to myself and I could seriously do with advice from anyone who has been in my shoes",01Aug2019,1

When I finally left, he decided that since I didn't want to be with him, he could stop trying to be a dad. I was more than ok with this. I didn't ask for child support, I didn't take him to court, I just wanted him out of our lives because I knew it was what was best for my son. His family mostly sucks too, so he doesn't know them either. The man I married met my son when he was about a year and a half. He is 5 now and thinks that my husband is Dad. We never argued this.

insecurity I was born with extra skin. (I do not have normally belly button.)I was born with open belly and they had to save me by stitching it up asap before I die , a girl next me had it and they choice me to save me.  it is driving me crazy as I just can not have sex without my shirt. I had ex’s (5) they did not care as they loved me. Every time I hooked up with a female she tells me to take off my shirt , I do not want to show it to her. I am proud of my body as I been going to gym for 5 years diet and etc. I am in good shape. The problem is my belly it looks weird &amp; gross. This insecurity is killing me alive, there is times I am scared to talk to females. I am not bad looking or anything with hooking up its difficult. 
 I know many people may save love is love, what if I am just hooking up with a girl.

I called him and he told me that he doesn’t think he can be a partner. He can’t see himself getting married or having children. He doesn’t feel like he can fully support me or fit the life I want.

He did this over the phone. So we decided to meet up tomorrow to exchange stuff and to say one final good bye. I love him so much and I want to get back together with him.

355,"I just moved to Seattle and need to pick an apartment. Tossing and turning about this - please share your advice! 

**OPTION 1****: Nice apartment but just okay location, with bus commute.** Apartment has a nice layout and all the amenities I want. Location is average (upper Fremont if you know Seattle), but it's a 20+ min commute to work that relies on the bus. Will add complications to my mornings and evenings (I can walk to work right now). it's a 15 min walk away from the area of Fremont that I like, so not directly in an area I'd want to hang out that much in on weekends.

**OPTION 2: Okay apartment but nice location, with walk commute.** Would still need to find the right apartment (a few more days of searching). Apartments in this area (Queen Anne) in my price range generally lack the amenities that I like (in unit laundry and dishwasher).  more inconveniences at home, though the apartment layouts seem comparable. But the area is beautiful - nice buildings and parks, grocery stores and cute cafes/restaurants right there, and a 20 min walk to work (I really like being able to walk). 

It's currently 2 am and I'm currently scheduled to put a deposit down on OPTION 1 at 11am. ADVICE PLEASE!!! Go with option 1 or look for more apartments in the Option 2 area?

One of the chefs repeatedly refers to himself as my “cuñado” which in Spanish means “brother in law.” This implies that he is with my sister.

360,"I woke up this morning to find a pile of dog crap on my lawn. 

I’m concerned about this for a few reasons. The first is that it was on the side of my house, not the front, which means whoever was with their dog would have to cross through my driveway and through the lawn to reach the spot where the poop was. It’s rather disconcerting to me that someone would walk with their dog that far into my property.

Second, I spent well over 100 hours this spring renovating my lawn, having seed imported from overseas, adding a half ton of soil, painstakingly removing weeds etc. If someone is letting their dog roam into my yard and poop (or pee, which will destroy the grass), I’m really concerned that my hard work will be destroyed by an inconsiderate neighbor.

My entire neighborhood is only 2 years old and I’ve only briefly met a handful of my neighbors. We’ve hardly exchanged more than greetings...good morning / good afternoon etc, so I doubt it was malicious. Maybe just someone not caring. 

I only know of house here that has a dog, but there could be more. Therefore, I don’t really want to accuse them right away.

Last year, I saw one dog roaming around on its own but I don’t know who it belongs to. I haven’t seen it this year.

I really don’t want this happening again and I’d like to avoid conflict with my neighbors as much as possible. 

What should I do to prevent this from happening again without erecting a fence or buying / installing surveillance cameras? I don’t want to fork over money because someone is letting their dog roam into my yard, nor do I feel I should need to put up a fence on the far side of my driveway to keep a neighborhood dog out.

365,"Close relatives are about to have their first child.  They live in an illegal basement apartment with poor air flow, with only one mode of egress, and are planning to put the newborn in a windowless room.

The couple has lived in this situation for seven years.  The home in which they live is owned and occupied by other family.  While the situation is also against the HOA regulations, extended family has accepted the situation as consenting adults accepting the risk of danger or being thrown out at any time.

Now, however, with a newborn the situation is more complicated.  I am a child advocate who had a friend (strong, healthy young man) die several years ago when a fire broke out in his basement apartment.

The new parents have not paid rent, nor utilities for their entire time in the apartment.  They claim they are looking to get out of their situation, but travel, go to concerts, buy new cars, electronics, and sporting goods.  While they complain about their circumstances, the danger and fact that they're well into adulthood without paying bills seems lost on them.

367,"I grew up in San Francisco, was used to taking the bus and everything like everyone else. I kind of had a troubled childhood, people in school always taunting and disrespecting me so I didn’t have a whole lot of friends. Maybe they viewed me as the loser all throughout elementary and middle school and it was no different in high school. Never felt I fit in. Used to cry myself to sleep every night.

Was an only child, so I kept to myself and was pretty sheltered. Also had a father who would beat me. He apologizes now, but I don’t know...all of these experiences probably led to me being anxious and afraid to do things.

During a friend’s birthday one time during middle school, he invited a group of us to go to this go-kart place. I’d never operated a vehicle on my life. I was probably 13. I got on the go-cart and at first I suppose I was doing fine, but then I couldn’t brake drive through the grass and burned it and almost hit a post. I remember people laughing at me. I thought to myself that I wouldn’t want to do that again.

When I turned of driving age during high school, there was no real reason for me to want to get a car and drive. I had no friends to drive to or to show off my car or whatnot and my dad would drive me around if I needed to get somewhere.

Fast forward to college. I finally move away from San Francisco and get into an elite university in Los Angeles. I have a much happier time here as I felt like I belonged and had a ton of friends. My family moved to suburbs nearby.

There was an incident actually during a fraternity function. We were attending a function at a golf course and all of a sudden they said we needed to drive the golf carts to somewhere. I was like wtf, I was kinda panicking. Was kinda embarrassed to admit that I couldn’t drive. Anyway, I end up driving the cart fast as fuck and almost hit a few things lol. People thought I was drunk. Finally, I admitted I couldn’t drive, so an alumni drove it for me.

Anyway, after graduation, my parents try to make me learn how to drive. My dad gets me a Mercedes for my first car, but says I can only drive it after I learn with our old car. The thing is, he’s a horrible teacher. He’s always yelling and criticizing and he said he’d only take me out to drive at 6am. My aunt asked him to teach her how to drive and she regretted it after one day. He yelled at her the whole time, she hired a teacher the next day.

So, my dad says to hire a driving teacher who was charging like $120 every hour-long lesson. The driving teacher would do three lessons a week, but he said I would only learn if I practiced every evening. I asked my dad and he kept putting it off saying he was busy and the teacher is the one who should be doing it. My mom doesn’t drive. The driving teacher is pretty annoyed that I’m not practicing in between lessons, but what can I do.

After the lessons, which were probably about a month or two, my dad finally took me out to drive, but only on his conditions. And that was I had to do it at 6am. We drove around one evening around 7pm and I thought I was doing ok, but my dad said I had to make a turn or I don’t know what happened, but I got into a slight accident again that cost like $4000 to repair.

Driving makes me nervous. It’s too much to pay attention to everything, trying to make sure you don’t hit anyone or anything. Makes me anxious. And I get confused about left and right sometimes too. Don’t know if it’s because I was born a lefty, but was trained to use my right hand.

So, it’s been a little tough finding a job in Los Angeles, since most of the ones I’ve been looking at in the entertainment industry (which is what I majored in) requires a driver’s license and driving (because entry-level in the film industry pretty much means chauffeur).

Not being able to drive has pretty much held me back from finding a good job.

I’m pretty much ready to just leave LA and go to NYC where life would be much easier, from a transportation point of view. First of all, driving isn’t in the job requirements as only 30% of New Yorkers have a driver’s license. I was just there, it was so easy to get around, I was pretty happy. I can go 45 miles away, just on the subway.

My question is, am I strange for not driving? I feel like a freak; it’s embarrassing. Probably one of the things that makes me flustered when people ask. I was relieved when Uber came out a few years ago.

And, should I just move to NY where I don’t have to worry about driving anymore or learn to drive and stay in LA?

I don’t really like LA that much, to be honest. There’s nothing really holding me back here.",01Aug2019,2

But my mother also wants me to visit my grandmother on my father's side.

 My father's family has never put in an effort to talk to me or to make amends for the things they've done(outcasting my mother once she married my father is the most notable and awful one). None of them have ever really reached out despite my efforts to talk to them nor have any of them shown interest in me outside of the ""you're my relative so I'm somewhat obligated to talk to you"", aka. the bare amount of effort.

 Simply put, I don't want to see them at all. Even if it is for a few days I don't want to. None of them like me and I don't want to hang around people that I can't enjoy.

 I did offer that, if my father and grandmother truly want, I can hang out with them for a day, but that was the extent I would be willing to go. I know it might sound harsh to not want to visit my own grandmother, but most of my family has disowned me and she's barely any better.

So coming to the point i want to tell her bf about all of this like straight forward. But my friend is saying not to do that because it will cause a lot of problems to me. (A case happened where a girl sent nudes to a guy and got him arrested somehow even if the guy did nothing wrong). So how can i inform her bf without me getting into trouble?",01Aug2019,1
377, There are some youtubers i really enjoy watching on Youtube but the thing is i also feel really bad with myself when i compare themselves to myself. I realized this happens especially with tech youtubers that everything in their life seems so smooth and on track. They seem so chill and in control that i feel like im such a failure. It doesn't seem like they have any actual bad moments or moments where there anxious/depressed/sad/angry. I feel so jealous of them and don't understand how they can have a life like that. Anyone else feel like this?,01Aug2019,1
378,"     In my junior high basically everyone is going to High school A(called it that for privacy) and the rest are going to the other high schools in the area. I’m leaving behind my very close friends to go to High school B. As you can imagine I’m super stressed. My last year of junior high was trash and I’m just scared.  I’m scared of having to make new friends, I’m scared of not having a good school year, I’m scared of being bored, and I’m scared I was wrong to choose the school I did. The school I chose, High school B, is very academic. That’s not the issue for me, the issue is that it’ll be boring. Every time someone describes the school is only about academics. I was reading reviews of the school, as one does, and people we saying the school was soulless and dull. I wanted to do well academically, but I also wanted to enjoy high school. I’m just worried the environment is gonna be stuffy and cold. Uggggggh I’m just so confused and scared and excited all at the same time.",01Aug2019,1

This is my first time talking and building a relationship to a girl that I like. I've been shy and quiet my whole high school life and I never socialize, I mostly just let people talk to me and I know nothing about socializing and making friends. But my friends are helping me get her to be a close friend but I can't seem to do as they say. 

She's about to have her birthday and I decided that I'll be giving her something she would really like. I messaged her about it, and she was the first one to message. I talked too cold and I realized I fucked up. I lost a chance. I'm gonna talk to her and I'm gonna say sorry about it in person.

380,"Hi guys, as the title says, I’m a 1.98 guy who weighs 110 kg, and kinda muscular. My problem is that I’m scared of conflicts, to the point where I can feel my pulse rising if I even read an online argument or confronted while playing Dota 2. 

I’ve always been a calm person and avoided fights/arguments, due to previously having problems controlling my anger. But now I feel like a coward all the time, and I’m hugely embarrassed. Everyone expects me to be the big tough guy who can fight everyone and be fearless. I want to get involved in politics because of my huge interest but I feel that my fear might become an obstacle.

382,"Hi, I'm probably totally overreacting/thinking this but I'd like some other opinions. I think my friend is exaggerating her medical conditions. I feel like a shitty friend writing this! I don't want to accuse her of making things up because that won't help but I'm worried for her. For a bit of context, we've been friends for about 12 years and she's always had something to see the Dr about, strange rash, bad back, bad shoulder, chest infections, stress, depression, anxiety and on and on. Recently it's been getting bigger. She has had several severe chest infections that cause pleurisy (inflammation of the lining of the lungs) and hospitalisation but I only found out after she's been discharged. She claims to keep dislocating her shoulder and I've noticed that it was always the right shoulder and now it's the left side. She told me that she was having key hole surgery on it but didn't say when. A couple of weeks later, she said she'd had the surgery but I haven't seen her since to confirm anything visually. She has run out of sick days and holidays from work and is getting into trouble at work for the way she treats the other staff there as she is a kitchen manager in a pub chain. The latest thing is that she has slipped at work, cracked some ribs and got concussion. I offered to visit her in hospital but was told no as she'd been discharged, it seems too quick to me. I've offered to visit her at home but told no because she's no up to it, which is very possible. I'm worried for her because if she's doesn't have the conditions she says she does, things like surgery are going to make things worse. Please help me!! I don't know what to do to help her or even if it's my business. Thanks xx",01Aug2019,1
384,"So, as the title implies my mind wonders while having sex. My main problem is (believe it or not) I am worried about taking too long to finish. I have recently been diagnosed with prostatitis (literally yesterday) and thats one of the symptoms of it but I have no issue climaxing while masterbating. I read up online and they all say shit like breath and what not which ive tried and it helped a little. It used to be much worse and is getting better. Currently, I have no problems relatively climaxing during actual sex however, while receiving oral sex it is nearly impossible taking upwards of 2 hours at times. Usually my girlfriend gets tired and I masterbate and she'll kiss me or something. She's very understanding of the issue and i'm very comfortable around her (been dating six months) so i dont think it has to do with her. I've been trying to just not worry about it and I haven't but it still feels like its lingering subconsciously or something. It's definitely a mental issue as far as I know and I'm working it out on my own effectively but if anyone has any tips or experience with this issue it'd be great to fix the problem asap because it can be extremely frustrating at times for me and her. I previously was having ED due to similar mental complications but I fixed it on my own. I'm not really comfortable going to a sex therapist or anything like that.

I am unsure what is the safest way to move my cat with me.

I have a very sweet Siamese cat (Jasmine, 2 y/o) who is very skittish, and was born and raised indoors. I've been working with her on a leash and harness to practice going outside. 

I have two ideas for moving her:
1: EXPENSIVE  IDEA: Fly across the country with her, get sedatives for her and stay at the new place for a week or two to help her get settled and leave her with a family member who she is familiar with while I fly back and then pack and drive across the country. 

2: STRESSFUL IDEA: Drive with her! This would take a LOT of training, and I would have to figure out the logistics of driving with a cat  and litter box in the car + all my belongings

392,"This is gonna be a long post, bear with me.

3 weeks ago I went on a camping trip with my best friend, his girlfriend, and my best friend's cousin. All was good until the last night when we started playing this drinking truth game where you assume something about someone and if its true they take a drink, if its not the person who makes the assumption takes a drink. Well as we were playing this game a few things my friends girlfriend said kind of weirded me out/pissed me off. The first thing she said was after my friend said he finds a friend of ours to be pathetic, she responded with ""I love it when you call people pathetic babe"", this really threw me off but I let it go for the moment. The next thing she said was when I was telling my friend that I believe he thinks he's better than me because he has a superiority conplex, to which she responded with ""he is better than you"". That pissed me off, after that and because my friend was in general acting like an asshole,  I was just annoyed and wanted to leave. I didn't talk to my friend for a few weeks until he messaged me wondering what was up. This is what ensued:

Friend: what's wrong? You haven't texted and you looked upset on the last day.

Me: you and your girlfriend were saying some wierd shit, like about how she likes it when you call people pathetic and then telling me that your better than me, Also you were acting like a dick. Being bossy and feeling superior, trying to make me feel stupid. Wtf dude?

Friend:Well That's whom I've been all this time u know it. It's nothing new. The fact that my girlfriend is attracted to me because of my air of superiority is not a reason for you to be annoyed, dude I feel superior to everyone.

Me: Your not fucking superior, your insecure, that's why you have to act like that.

Friend: I'm not insecure about anything, I'm not a teenager anymore.

Me:Yes you are, its textbook, anyone who has to constantly try to feel superior than others is really only inscure about themselves

Friend:Why does that bother you? If you believe I'm not then why do u have to get mad at that when u can easily dismiss it

Me: because you treat me like your better than me is why.Bottom line is that I'm not going to tolerate any type of behavior like that, if you want to believe your superior so be it but your not gonna act that way with me neither is your girlfriend.

Friend: well fuck you then.

Me: I'm not tolerating being treated like shit.

Friend: No one treated you like shit, seriously, But fuck you anyway.

Me:  the things your girlfriend was saying wasn't right, its evil to get enjoyment from you calling people pathetic. 

Friend: don't fucking say we're evil. She doesn't just go around saying this shit to everyone, she likes my friends so she said it in a comfortable environment.

Me: I mean dude she said she loved it when you called other people pathetic. Then said you were better than me. I dont have any issie with her but i wish she would keep those things to herself.

(After this interaction my friend didn't message me for awhile so i messaged him)

Me:Hey man I don't know if your angry which if you are you shouldn't because you have NOTHING to be angry about. I never called your girlfriend evil I just said that how she feels good towards you putting others down by calling them pathetic is evil...because it is. You acting like your superior to everyone is not evil, but very wrong. Her TELLING me that YOU ARE BETTER THAN ME, may not be wrong, but it was pretty fucking rude. So if anyone has a right to be upset it's me, Why do I have to be told that? You didn't say anything either when she said it. If your gonna get upset with me for not tolerating that type of behavior and standing up for myself then so be it. It is wrong, it is evil, and if you can't understand why I wouldn't want to hear/be told those things and want to get upset at me then there's something wrong with that too. I'm willing to let all of this shit go, you can believe whatever the fuck you want to believe about yourself, but I will not tolerate rudeness. 

Friend:She never said I was better you. She asked you if you felt I was better than you! Even my cousin heard it. Every fucking time you get drunk you always have something bad to say about her. Seriously. She's my gf not yours. So stop criticizing. She never has anything bad to say about you, but ur clearly giving her reason to now. And it's pissing me off. You clearly don't remember shit and you clearly didn't understand the rules of the game. That is not my fault. It's yours. So stop feeling so attacked by her I don't want to speak to you for while or see you. If we ever do hang out, it'll just be us two never with her. You obviously don't like her and some way somehow she offends you. 

Me: Dude, it's not about that fucking game! When I was telling you about you being superior to me she told me directly that you are better Than me. You fucking asshole, who the fuck says that they find enjoyment when someone calls someone else pathetic!, I've never had an issue with her until she said those things, why can't you just understand that?  I wasn't even going to say anything but you wanted to to explain myself so I did. You get to blinded by the fact that shes your girlfriend and feel like you have to defend her for everything.

Friend:No I don't. I literally asked 6 other people about this and they all agreed your in the wrong. Go and ask my cousin what was said. Secondly of course she thinks I'm better than you. She fucking likes me. She thinks I'm better than anyone. Bohooo that she likes to tell me. 

Me:So i shouldn't get offended at that?

Friend: NOOO YOU FUCKING RETARD!

Me: your fucking crazy

Friend: And who the fuck are you to judge though!!!! Like fuck dude. It's her personality and it's my personality, why can't you respect that asshole?

Me: being an asshole is your personality?

Friend:Dude you've know this side since I was 15 idiot

Me: why should I have to fucking tolerate it? Were not 15 anymore.

Friend: because fuck you, what's it to you?

Me: your acting childish

Friend:You're the one acting immature and reflecting your fucking issues, fuck you.

Me: what issues?

Friend: I'm seriously done. I'm not replying to you and I'm muting you. Hope u like  talking to a wall.

Me: your unbelievable...

So that's that, I don't even know what the fuck to do, if I'm in the wrong or if i should cut this friend off completely, just to give some background I've never said anything negative about my friends girlfriend until this moment so i dont know where he's getting that I always criticize her whsn I'm drunk I dont even drink with him all that often. This isn't the first time hes gotten wierded out because of his girlfriend he also got mad at me when i made ajoke to her on her instagram. At the very least I'm not going to be speaking to this for a considerable ampunt of time but I need to know if its even worth it trying to fix this or if I should just move on?",01Aug2019,2
393,"Tl,dr: a cook (21/m) has a crush on me (26/f, his supervisor) and has started getting aggressive. He said it ends today. Should I report it anyway or wait to see that he stops?

I have a very bubbly, friendly personality. I smile a lot and like to laugh with people. Some people take it as flirting but it's not, I treat my own mother the same way. It's just how I am.

I'm a shift supervisor at a busy restaurant in Seattle. One of the cooks has had a crush on me for the entire 10 months I've been working there. I have always politely declined his advances and repeatedly told him that we are just co-workers.

In the last month or so, this kid (21yo, I think) has really started to lose any professional decorum. He openly leers at and harasses attractive customers. I've caught him dipping behind the line. He comes in late, clearly on some sort of drug (he swore it was only weed but I know a coked out cook when I see one). He's been calling out a lot, sometimes by text like an hour before his shift. He sends himself home if he gets to work and thinks there's enough cooks for the shift.

He has started messaging me on FB every single day even though I rarely reply. He's started doing that creepy, manipulative ""where's my hug?"" BS. Constantly fucking talking to me even when I'm clearly busy working. It's driving me insane.

A few nights ago, I had to cook with him for the first time. I was already so annoyed and anxious around him now that I came in a terrible mood. He was especially loud and obnoxious, dipping, frequently going out for ""cigarettes"" or going to the bathroom.

The flirting was relentless. He was every where I turned. Pretending to help me, standing really close to me, whispering to me so I had to get close to hear him. Kept asking me what was wrong and why I was mad at him. I was quiet and literally told him ""I'm not mad at all. I just want to work.""

Since I wouldn't talk to him, he started intentionally bumping into me or getting in my way. He would ""help me"" batter chicken and kept ""accidentally"" grabbing my hands and fingers. Everytime he passed me, he would very blatantly graze my ass with his hand. 

At that point, I told my boss I didn't feel well and wanted to leave. I only worked 3 hours, missed 6 hours worth of wage and tips on a Saturday night. I was so anxious and uncomfortable that I had to lose a good day's pay.

Fast forward to today, he and I finished closing alone. I jumped up on the counter to get a soda from the fountain. He got super close to my legs, I scooted away, he grabbed my ankle so hard that I yelled out in pain.

After we locked up, I bee lined to my car as he yelled at me the whole time, ""where's my hug? Are you serious? You're really just going to walk away like that when I'm asking for my hug?"" Shit like that.

He blew my phone the fuck up. Begging me to stop my games? I reiterated for a countless time that I am his supervisor and he will treat me as such. I have 110% NO interest in him past our professional relationship. The flirting and disrespect stops now. I deserve to feel safe at work.

He eventually relented, apologized, and said it ends tonight.

I have the next two days off but I am contemplating going in tomorrow to talk to the GM. I hesitate though because I don't necessarily get him in trouble or fired. I'm also worried that since I'm the one in a position of power, people will think I'm at fault and I'll get fired.

396,"Last year i was out of control with gambling online, i lost a lot of money. From the start of this year i decided enough was enough, cut myself off from every online casino and since then all has been good, not once have i had the ""urge"". During this time my sister has been improving the house, we own it 50/50. I owe her a few thousand or so for work done so far. She does not know that i currently have a personal loan for 5500. Im considering taking an additional loan for around 12500 taking total loan to 18000. My reason for this is because with the new money i can pay my share of the costs, have money in the bank to actually enjoy my life (not in a baller way or anything ott), and actually have something to look forward to on my days off from work. 

Work wise, i save around 700 every 4 weeks. I could have the loan fully paid back in 2 years. IF i were to lose my job i would get at least 6 months notice it was going to happen guarenteed, during which i could earn 50% more at my job if i needed/wanted. At the minute my life is sleep, work, eat, surf the internet, repeat. Having this money would allow me to be more social, enjoy my hobbies more etc.  The interest on the loan is very low, 2% and the payments are fixed - the payments are not going to be 700, they will be 450 or so but i would overpay, at not penalty for early repayment, to 700.

the mortgage on the house is set to be renewed to a new deal in the coming months. We are in a solid postion with it though, we have 50% equity and when moving onto a new deal we will be saving an extra 100 each per month.

407,"I’ve posted here before, and it’s been a a while. Let’s cut to the chase.

I have a friend, Female Friend, let’s call her Miley, who’s been around since March, and haven’t really noticed her since at least April. Me and her weere friends because of another friend who was in a Strange Relationship without a Name with a guy name Eric (pseudonym obv). Eric is around Ten Years her senior, and around Eleven Years my Senior. She doesn’t really mind the Age Gap, nor the stigma with it. And she’s been there for me when I needed support, and so has Eric. 

So here comes the fun part: I threw a 4th of July party and half of it was crashed by my Apartment Complex closing the pool at 3 pm (for some reason). We got invited to another apartment that did have a pool open, by a fellow friend. We partied over there, and I got drunk enough to let my insecurities out to one of my good friends only in private, and continued the party after I collected myself. And I said something to Miley, to the affect in private that I Liked her a lot. But as an addendum that I know she is with Eric, and I will respect the boundaries and decisions she makes with him and whatnot. And my Drunk self said the same to Eric, and to the surprise of not getting my Ass Kicked by him, understood and hugged it out, and was still willing to be my friend. Same with Miley.

Fast Forward a couple weeks, Getting my College Application in preparing to go through a Pre Law program if I get accepted and I feel content with my life, and over all happy. Today, received a Snap from Miley, saying she has to say something to Eric about her Dream Job in Dallas, and how she was called in for an interview. She was worried, but I gave her advice of being “Clear, Concise, and Patient, and understand where he is coming from”. She hasn’t responded. 

I get ready for work for tomorrow (or Today), And I sleep and get this gut wrenching feeling. Something has happened and I don’t know if something has happened to her in a negative way. I am no longer romantically interested in her, and honestly I’m even scared to reach out if she is okay. What should I do?",01Aug2019,1
408,So I have this sort of complicated so called “friend” who has made me feel like I couldn’t understand my own self worth and knowing he kind of made me feel like I had to be this certain person to just be around him . I never told him on how I felt that I was being used in a way or that he was “playing games etc. texting me only when he’s bored or texting me without any reason” bothered me. I know eventually he will find out that I’m not trying to talk to him since I know how the conversations go and so it will seem like I’m avoiding him. (Which I am at the most part) but I always been afraid of directly saying it to him since I know he doesn’t take action to fix and see the problem.,01Aug2019,1

411,"So, the way my life is setup and the way her life is set up we both need a roommate in about a month. We have everything figured out and setup we just have to move, but I’m not sure if I should...

I’ve known her for 2 years and I’ll be honest. I’ve always had a thing for her, but I was able to suppress those feelings because I knew she had a boyfriend. Obviously feelings don’t just disappear, but they can die down a bit if you work hard at it and that’s what I’ve been doing. 

Her relationship is long distance and it’s been going on for 4 years and he lives in a different country. She’s never met him, but she calls, video chats, etc. there’s plenty of trust between them and he’s cool with me moving in with her. I’m decent friends with him and I talk to him regularly so he’s cool with me. 

Here’s the thing though... I know she likes me to some degree. There's too many signs such as a lot of physical contact, calling me cute, etc to make a few ( she does all these things in public so imagine what she’d do behind closed doors) . I've never called her cute to avoid making things weird, and I don't initiate physical contact much unless there's a reason. I will say there's other ways I show her that I have feelings for her ( which I’m trying to stop) and I'm 99% sure she can tell. I don't think I'd ever make a move , but i feel like she's going to make a move and I'm not sure if I'd be able to resist considering my feelings. 

I really don't want to ruin their relationship by moving in and things going south POTENTIALLY. But I need a place to stay in this dire situation. What are your thoughts on this guys? Should I not move in, tell her how I feel, or am I okay to move in? I’m also taking tips on completely losing my feelings for her if you have some. Thanks!",01Aug2019,1

413,"So my ex wife and I were divorced since April of this year. We were together for 10 years and married for two. I should have never agreed to marry. The relationship was over to me before I even said I do and was just so checked out. I think I went through with it bc I told myself this is just what adults do and just try to be happy. Well that didn't work and I was so unhappy I tried to kill myself July of last year. We worked on it but by the end of the marriage we were sleeping in separate rooms and we're just roommates.

One night I get drunk, sign up for tinder(I was desperate for SOME kind of feeling) and she finds out right away and as I'm sleeping she goes into my phone and posts all these sext messages, my profile, my work, etc. I take responsibility for my mistake and even though I really wish she wouldn't have posted stuff about my job I accept that I screwed up and had it coming and we agree to get a divorce.

I work for a religious healthcare organization so I had some worry I violated some sort of personal conduct policy but after I found out from my boss that I wasn't going to be fired I took the strategy of just laying low on social media, work hard, and stay positive and polite to people. This worked out and I even received a promotion while doing all of this.

Meanwhile, while this this going on she is texting my friends, family, and co-workers saying how I was making up my promotion, I ran up all my credit cards by buying useless things, I was on some sort of manic binge state and was going to kill myself, etc. We work together but in different apartments. She all the sudden starts hanging out with my boss frequently (they were friends before), she throws parties and invites everyone on my team(she never liked anyone on my team before) while making sure I know all of this. She even starts dating a dude that sits 20 ft from me who is 20 some odd years older than her. She won't get out of my life.she is constantly spewing vile about me. The work stuff honestly scares me. I feel like she is going for my career and I don't know how to handle it. Help please.",01Aug2019,1
414,"Yesterday I was at work nearing the end of my shift. I was texting a friend talking about something we'd talked about briefly the other day, eventually asking what he was doing. He told me he was hanging out with one of our friends and planning on doing stuff later on. My mind immediately went to ""oh, they're hanging out without me?"" I became aware of my thoughts and tried to back pedal and maintain some positivity and just assume they were going to invite me later since I asked. Well, they never invited me. I ended up going home after work and watching a movie until I fell asleep. But the whole time I kept thinking about them hanging out without me and not inviting me to join. Did I do something wrong? Did they forget about me? Do they not want me there?

In hindsight, I know this is an immature way of thinking and I shouldn't let this bother me, but I can't stop thinking about it. I rarely get invited to things anymore and I don't want to invite myself to things people are doing. That's not fair for me. I consider it toxic to think this way because it makes me think negatively towards my friends internally and assume they're intentionally removing me from the equation. I just really wanted them to think of me and at least ask. But nobody seems to care from what I've gathered.",01Aug2019,1

I was so excited and i had all of these thoughts in my mind like what would it be like if i could use this opportunity in the right way and push forward until we can hold hands and hang out? That would be magical. A cute and rich girl from a famous family who also has a beautiful voice and could sing for me. I would talk to her from time to time on DM and tried to build a more friendly relation with her and win her heart. Finally i got to the point that i told her ""I wish that i could have a friend like you and hang out with"" and she replied ""you can have me as a firend though why not?""  and then she told me that she could meet me somewhere like a nightclub or even some cafe or park or wherever else that she says.

On numerous occasions I have tried talking to her about it, as have my family members, but whenever we think we're getting through to her she takes something new.

423,"Some background:
I’m in a Discord server with 4 other friends on Roblox. We mostly talk and play, but lately 2 of them have been in a bit of a pickle, I’ll call them K and L.
During a group conversation, K says that she liked to read gay comics (or something like that). L, thinking he would be making good jokes, starts teasing K about it. It was no big of a deal at first but eventually, it started getting really annoying for her to the point that K would leave the conversation feeling real pissed.
Last night, L PMed me to ask if I hated him. I told him that I didn’t hate him. He then tells me about how he believes that everyone hates him and everything is getting worse within the group, He believes everyone within the group hates him, especially K. I try to comfort by saying that what happened recently was just a bunch of coincidences (K’s been a little moody lately) and no one hates him. I also told him that he’s just not feeling too great and he should get some rest, then when he wakes up, tell me if he’s feeling better so that his perspective changes.
The next day (around 5:30am) he tells he feels the same, I wasn’t able to reply since I was busy preparing for school. I come back around 5:45pm and he is continuing to do what he did before. Long story short, he told me that he’s escalating a problem to “prove a point”

I sent my bank account information to my boss at the same day as I signed the contract. Pay day finally came and my bank account remained empty. Days went by and still nothing.

I'm a full time student but apparently my employer doesn't get the fact that I have to go back to school 10 states away when the summer is over, so he lays me off after working for two months. This isn't the problem though. Because I wanted to do something with my time I decided to get up really early instead of sleeping in really late. I set an alarm and I got up to it just fine. 6:30 to 6:45 I was having a wonderful time just playing with my cats and doing some house work.

It was about at 6:50 I decided to make up some tea, so I put the kettle on the stove and turned the burner which I thought to be the one the kettle was on. However, it was just my luck that it would be the next one over, the one that had a large glass plate on it. Now why the fuck a glass platter in on the stove is beyond me. My girlfriend does most the cooking. She doesn't live with me in my appartment, her parents think that's unethical or something.

But back to the glass platter, after about five minutes of it being on the burner it explodes with the loudest boom I have ever heard in my life. My heart is still fluttering and this happened an hour ago. There was glass everywhere and i thought the best thing to do was to just sweep it up. So i started to do so. But while i was doing it things seemed to get scarier the more I worked.

I was seeing movement out of the corner of my eye and I swear when I moved the microwave stand, there was someone right behind me. I didn't see them, but i know they were there, I know what they looked like, but I didn't actually see them. It only got worse.

Soon I just left the glass in a large pile in the middle of the floor, my kitchen all out of place, and I just left the flat. I think there is someone in my house, and I just left it, my cats are all alone there. It may be just me but even now as I'm sitting in the park I feel terrified with every little sound, every person who walks by scares me. I'm almost 24 and I'm curled up on a park bench terrified. All that happened was a large boom of an exploding glass platter and now I'm super paranoid. I don't know if I should go home or not. I don't know what to do.

The vehicle had been brought in for a trade the very same day I came in looking. I know they inspected it before I bought it because they had me wait a week while they got around to it. So they should have noticed how worn down the break pads were. 

Everyone so far has told me that I shouldn't have to pay to get this fixed. And being female, it's not unlikely that I could be getting ripped off.

446,"This is gonna be a long post, bear with me.

3 weeks ago I went on a camping trip with my best friend, his girlfriend, and my best friend's cousin. All was good until the last night when we started playing this drinking truth game where you assume something about someone and if its true they take a drink, if its not the person who makes the assumption takes a drink. Well as we were playing this game a few things my friends girlfriend said kind of weirded me out/pissed me off. The first thing she said was after my friend said he finds a friend of ours to be pathetic, she responded with ""I love it when you call people pathetic babe"", this really threw me off but I let it go for the moment. The next thing she said was when I was telling my friend that I believe he thinks he's better than me because he has a superiority conplex, to which she responded with ""he is better than you"". That pissed me off, after that and because my friend was in general acting like an asshole,  I was just annoyed and wanted to leave. I didn't talk to my friend for a few weeks until he messaged me wondering what was up. This is what ensued:

Friend: what's wrong? You haven't texted and you looked upset on the last day.

Me: you and your girlfriend were saying some wierd shit, like about how she likes it when you call people pathetic and then telling me that your better than me, Also you were acting like a dick. Being bossy and feeling superior, trying to make me feel stupid. Wtf dude?

Friend:Well That's whom I've been all this time u know it. It's nothing new. The fact that my girlfriend is attracted to me because of my air of superiority is not a reason for you to be annoyed, dude I feel superior to everyone.

Me: Your not fucking superior, your insecure, that's why you have to act like that.

Friend: I'm not insecure about anything, I'm not a teenager anymore.

Me:Yes you are, its textbook, anyone who has to constantly try to feel superior than others is really only inscure about themselves

Friend:Why does that bother you? If you believe I'm not then why do u have to get mad at that when u can easily dismiss it

Me: because you treat me like your better than me is why.Bottom line is that I'm not going to tolerate any type of behavior like that, if you want to believe your superior so be it but your not gonna act that way with me neither is your girlfriend.

Friend: well fuck you then.

Me: I'm not tolerating being treated like shit.

Friend: No one treated you like shit, seriously, But fuck you anyway.

Me:  the things your girlfriend was saying wasn't right, its evil to get enjoyment from you calling people pathetic. 

Friend: don't fucking say we're evil. She doesn't just go around saying this shit to everyone, she likes my friends so she said it in a comfortable environment.

Me: I mean dude she said she loved it when you called other people pathetic. Then said you were better than me. I dont have any issie with her but i wish she would keep those things to herself.

(After this interaction my friend didn't message me for awhile so i messaged him)

Me:Hey man I don't know if your angry which if you are you shouldn't because you have NOTHING to be angry about. I never called your girlfriend evil I just said that how she feels good towards you putting others down by calling them pathetic is evil...because it is. You acting like your superior to everyone is not evil, but very wrong. Her TELLING me that YOU ARE BETTER THAN ME, may not be wrong, but it was pretty fucking rude. So if anyone has a right to be upset it's me, Why do I have to be told that? You didn't say anything either when she said it. If your gonna get upset with me for not tolerating that type of behavior and standing up for myself then so be it. It is wrong, it is evil, and if you can't understand why I wouldn't want to hear/be told those things and want to get upset at me then there's something wrong with that too. I'm willing to let all of this shit go, you can believe whatever the fuck you want to believe about yourself, but I will not tolerate rudeness. 

Friend:She never said I was better you. She asked you if you felt I was better than you! Even my cousin heard it. Every fucking time you get drunk you always have something bad to say about her. Seriously. She's my gf not yours. So stop criticizing. She never has anything bad to say about you, but ur clearly giving her reason to now. And it's pissing me off. You clearly don't remember shit and you clearly didn't understand the rules of the game. That is not my fault. It's yours. So stop feeling so attacked by her I don't want to speak to you for while or see you. If we ever do hang out, it'll just be us two never with her. You obviously don't like her and some way somehow she offends you. 

Me: Dude, it's not about that fucking game! When I was telling you about you being superior to me she told me directly that you are better Than me. You fucking asshole, who the fuck says that they find enjoyment when someone calls someone else pathetic!, I've never had an issue with her until she said those things, why can't you just understand that?  I wasn't even going to say anything but you wanted to to explain myself so I did. You get to blinded by the fact that shes your girlfriend and feel like you have to defend her for everything.

Friend:No I don't. I literally asked 6 other people about this and they all agreed your in the wrong. Go and ask my cousin what was said. Secondly of course she thinks I'm better than you. She fucking likes me. She thinks I'm better than anyone. Bohooo that she likes to tell me. 

Me:So i shouldn't get offended at that?

Friend: NOOO YOU FUCKING RETARD!

Me: your fucking crazy

Friend: And who the fuck are you to judge though!!!! Like fuck dude. It's her personality and it's my personality, why can't you respect that asshole?

Me: being an asshole is your personality?

Friend:Dude you've know this side since I was 15 idiot

Me: why should I have to fucking tolerate it? Were not 15 anymore.

Friend: because fuck you, what's it to you?

Me: your acting childish

Friend:You're the one acting immature and reflecting your fucking issues, fuck you.

Me: what issues?

Friend: I'm seriously done. I'm not replying to you and I'm muting you. Hope u like  talking to a wall.

Me: your unbelievable...

So that's that, I don't even know what the fuck to do, if I'm in the wrong or if i should cut this friend off completely, just to give some background I've never said anything negative about my friends girlfriend until this moment so I dont know where he's getting that I always criticize her when I'm drunk, I dont even drink with him all that often. This isn't the first time hes gotten wierded out because of his girlfriend he also got mad at me when i made a joke to her on her instagram. At the very least I'm not going to be speaking to this person for a considerable amount of time but I need to know if its even worth it trying to fix this or if I should just move on?",01Aug2019,1

448,"Im 24M, i live in Russia and work from home. So i don't go outside as often as I used to when i was in college. The only reason for me to leave my home is to buy some groceries and go on a date with a girl i found on the internet/app.
For the last couple of years i feel like I've been going insane.
I go on dates, hang out with different girls for some time and feel like they all are not as beautiful and interesting as the one i once loved. 
Lately I've been having thoughts like ""I'm already 24 and still didn't find the girl i love, I don't need money, cars or anything, just mutual pure love"".
Girls of my age don't seem to be simple, fun, full of energy to do crazy stupid stuff. But i need it. The older i get the less chances i have to finally find that type of girl i want.
I don't know what to do at this point. Days go by, my life seems more and more pointless. 
I'm not even able to work now, stupid thoughts are killing me, i feel anger and emptiness.

Also i was in a mental hospital for a month and absolutely nothing changed (probably because in Russia free medical help is useless).
Maybe someone had similar situation? Will this state of soul go away or i should visit therapist?",01Aug2019,1
449,"My
Name is Dayton and I’m 21 years old and I’m not sure how to feel or react to this certain situation,
1 year ago I moved in with my two best friends, my childhood best friend and a friend I’ve hung out with nonstop for the past 2 years, the issue is that my other friend (not my childhood friend) is also my boss at work and he constantly brought home work with him, even going to the point where he shouts and belittles me at home for stuff other people messed up, we all shared equal rent and responsibilities but since he was 10 years older than me and my best friend he treated us both like crap and never let us get a saw in how we should do something around the house. He was also responsible for sending me to the mental hospital because of how bad he treated Me at home and work. Fast forward 5 months later And I finally stood My ground and decided To move out and back in with my parents. But I’m left feeling like I’m a failure for not being able to move past his problems and stand up for myself sooner, he still thinks he’s done nothing wrong and that my emotional instability was the reason for his blow ups even though I just stayed in my room most of the time. He wants to remain friends but part of me can’t let go of the treatment I’ve received the last year,did I do the right thing and how should I go about confronting him on this. Keep in mind he’s still my boss at work and I need this job...

451,"Here's the bottom line, I'm extremely unadventurous.

I've lived for the last 23 years within the walls of my comfort zones and have never really pushed them. I'm quite confident and approachable, and I've been to university and can drive etc, but of my own volition I will never push myself to go further. I don't know whether it's out of fear, anxiety or just uninterest, but I'll spend my time in the same way that I've always done.

I'm worried that once I start living independently I will just fold inwardly and soon I'll be 50 and wouldn't have done anything out of the mundane in my whole life. I think deep down I want to be a bit more spontaneous and outgoing, but I'm not there yet.

That was my plan, then my school cancelled it’s 6th form and I have literally no idea what I’m doing in September. 

I’m meant to have a meeting with my old head of year to talk about options, but what am I supposed to do. I most likely won’t get the grades for a college even if I could bring myself to go, and my head of years plan i’m pretty sure is to ship me off to art school (I’m not even good at art!)

453,"Hey all!

So let me start of by saying that English is not my native language, so I'm sorry if there's any mistakes in here. I'm trying my best to be as clear as I can, but I'm sorry if things are still confusing, if needed just ask, and I will try to clear things up as best as I can. Sorry if this is a long one, TL;DR on the bottom.

I'm currently 22 years old and I've had a difficult life so far. My parents severely abused me and I've been on my own since I was 15. I've been homeless, almost murdered by my ex and I've gone trough a lot of bad stuff overall. It's been a long road filled with a lot of traumas and struggles but I think I came out of it the best I could.  
I've been trying to figure life out, I went back to university, and recently moved in with my 20 year old boyfriend (we were long distance, I moved across the country to him) and I've been struggling a bit with adjusting to a complete different life. I'm not used to a family that’s this close and caring. It's a good change, but it's difficult for me. Luckily, my boyfriend is trying to be understanding. He struggles with this at times because he has no idea what it's like going through the stuff I did and how it still affects me in ways. I don't blame him for this, I'm happy he doesn't know and I know he's doing his absolute best with something he knows nothing about.

Because of all the traumas, I've been diagnosed with complex PTSS, anxiety, panic attacks and overall deal with small things like FOMO (fear of missing out). I've reached out to my doctor's office to get help with learning how to deal with all this, but I've been waiting for an appointment for 3 weeks now.   
I know that my issues are my own and I cannot hold people responsible for not taking my fears into account, or be upset if they do something that triggers it.  
I'm always scared I'm being forgotten about, scared of missing out on more than I already have, scared of not being good enough, scared of all that goes wrong, the list goes on and on. 

My boyfriend's group of friends consists of about 8 guys who are nice, but honestly,  all of them use drugs (almost) daily (pills mainly, some even use coke or heroin) and they hang out together a lot, but all they'll do is drink until they're heavily drunk (people have ended up in coma's) and/or use drugs. My boyfriend says he's tried drugs but doesn't use them anymore. But every time he goes, he gets completely wasted to the point where you're unable to hold conversations with him. His friends get mad at him when he doesn't go out with him. Honestly, I don't feel like they're the best friends, but he's happy with them and that's all that matters. I never tell him he can't see them, I tell him if he wants to do something with them, he should. He chooses not to most of the times. 

When he's drunk, it's always a question on how the alcohol takes. He usually gets angry or annoyed or just does stupid stuff like break things. At least, he used to. Now, he just gets annoyed or angry and I won't be able to talk to him or anything, I'll have to make sure he gets in bed. I want to say right here, that my boyfriend has never abused me, mentally nor physical. I'm usually not scared of him and he's usually really sweet.

Last time we both went out, I went to a girlfriend of mine who lives about 40 mins away by car. When I was there, she had an anger attack because me and the guy who were there, were discussing not staying all night. Because of my past, when people get so angry towards me, I panic and I want to go as far away as I can. So in tears I texted my boyfriend who was still at his friends and explained what happened and that I was scared, and not sure what to do. He told me he wanted me to come home, he missed me and would love it if I slept next to him that night and wouldn't stay there, that I would be safe with him. So I asked the guy that was with us if he would mind dropping me off on his way home, and he did.   
When I came home, my boyfriend was sleeping on the couch. No big deal, I thought. I went to wake him up and he smelled so bad of a load of alcohol, so I already knew he drank way too much (this was after he told me he wasn't going to drink much, only having a couple of beers). I tried waking him up gently. He woke up and looked at me like he was about to hit me, saying ""WHAT"".   
He just stood up and lied down on the dining table. I eventually got him to bed, but he didn't look at me, spoke no word to me, was only annoyed at me. He went straight to sleep, while I was crying next to him. After all that he texted me, and how the reality was so much different, after the night I've had previously, coming back from a friend to this, I was just really hurt. 

The day after, he apologized and said it wasn't his intention. But every time he goes out with friends we end up with problems. I understand that how I felt that night was my problem. But I'm just extremely scared when he wants to go out with friends. But the thing is, he wants to start doing more with his friends, which I get because they're his friends.

  
How do I deal with FOMO?   
The panic I get when I know he's out there doing god knows what?   
How do I distract myself?   
How do you guys handle this? 

This issue isn't just this example, it's also simple things like being scared of missing out on being part of playing with a certain team while I'm scrimming online (playing against a different team to see what can be improved), it's ridiculous, I know, but this issue is going to be the hardest for me until I can speak with a doctor about it. 

Again, I apologize if this is unclear, I might edit it later if needed. 

\--

TL;DR:   
Been through a lot in my life that's caused CPTSS, anxiety, panic attacks and FOMO. My supporitve boyfriend wants to go out with his friends more, which I'm totally okay with but scares me. Because his friends abuse drugs and alcohol and he gets angry when he drinks, it's always a problem. I'm waiting to see a doctor to deal with my issues, but how do I deal best with the FOMO, anxiety, panic and stress while he's out with his friends, until I have an appointment?    
I always panic when he's out with friends, scared I am missing out on more than I already have, scared he'll do something stupid while I'm here, scared he doesn't care, and I know it's stupid.",01Aug2019,0

468,"Im graduating this fall with an B.S. in IT. I'd like to plan to move out to Denver with my brother sometime early next year. Like between Feb. and April. I know common sense is to never move without a guaranteed job. That's totally true, but I'm not sure how to do that in my position?  


First, I want to work for at least 2-3 months after college (living with parents)  to save up a little more.  I will definitely have over $5K probably before January, but I'd like to save up some more. Also, thinking moving close to April when it will start warming up a bit. I dont want to move in the middle of winter.  


So that would give me about 2-4 months after college before I move. That means whatever job I get at home would probably be a low wage job just to save money. I dont want to get stuck in a good job at home, I'd rather move out to Denver and work on my career there.    


So that gives me two choices. Only apply to Tech jobs in Denver starting in Feb. or just get any job that pays enough to cover rent and move out there. Then job search for good tech jobs. That way, atleast I dont have to fly in for interviews.  


Either way, flying out for interviews for jobs that pay under $15 an hour seems way to expensive, but how else would I get a job? I can technically fly out there anytime and have a place to stay, but thats $$$ down the drain if I dont get a job.   


I just don't want to pay $200 for a plane ticket, just for an interview at Starbucks or Target.  Also, how am I supposed to work around that with my current employer?  


Am I overthinking this?",01Aug2019,1
469,"This is a long one folks, so strap in. 

My brother and I have had our rough patches, but as we both reached high school (we have a two year gap in grades because he’s in a grade below his age category), we became really really close. Until this year, I would have genuinely considered him one of my best friends and favourite people. When I was in grade 11, he went off to university in a different city to study engineering on a scholarship and we remained close, speaking quite often and spending time together whenever he’d visit home. He had quite a tough time with engineering and failed first year twice, but I’ve never thought anything less of him because of it. 

My parents are lovely and supportive and decided to allow him to go back to university to attempt first year for the third time, and we both decided that we wanted to go to the same liberal arts college about ten hours from home. At the time, I did think it was quite strange that he wanted to come to a university that’s well-known for its arts degrees and take mostly science-y, but I didn’t think much of it. I’d probably say that this is one of the biggest mistakes I’ve ever made. I love the university and I’ve got amazing friends, but it’s a really small college and my brother isn’t making it easy to be here with him. 

I spent the first half of semester one desperately attempting to make plans with him but he genuinely seemed to want to have nothing to do with me, going so far as to ignore me in public. 

This all came to a head when he got into a fight outside of a club that I was at, and when I stepped outside with some of my friends to try to diffuse the situation, he pushed me to the ground and I hit my head. I wasn’t physically hurt, but I was more shocked and winded than anything. Growing up, I was always more reckless and he was more of a pacifist so this behavior seemed completely out of character. I managed to get him into a friend’s car and they drove him back to his dorm. 

Our relationship and his relationship with my parents (who are still paying his tuition and giving us a more than generous allowance) has since deteriorated. Obviously, I told them what happened, and despite the fact that many of his friends and my friends witnessed it all, he continues to claim that I was just drunk and  being hysterical (because of course the teenage girl airing legitimate grievances is just dramatic and hysterical).

This was just before the end of the semester and two days after it all happened, my uncle (dad’s cousin, but we always called him our uncle) who my brother was very close to, passed away. My brother wanted to come home for the funeral, but didn’t want to stay the entire holiday, just for about three days, and my parents graciously booked us both tickets home. He missed his flight and they offered to find him a later one, but he refused to “cost them more money”. The next day, he posted an Instagram story of him in a recording studio with a caption saying something to the effect of “so glad this all came together”. After showing zero interest in music for our entire lives, he decided to become a Soundcloud rapper and his first studio session just happened to take place when he should have been back home grieving with our family. No biggie, but my parents decided to take the cost of the flight out of his allowance so that he learns to be more responsible in future, and not miss flights etc. 

Later in the holiday, exam results came out and he failed a subject, so my parents decided to reduce his spending money so he spends less on entertainment and focuses more on school. This made him really mad, and he claimed that they have undiagnosed personality disorders (which is plain offensive) and don’t trust him (true). Aside from him being a general asshole, he’s begun to threaten suicide if my parents don’t send him more money, he’s accused my dad of being physically abusive (which is a flat out lie) and he has attempted to include me in this narrative by telling me that they are threatening his life by refusing to send him more money and attempting to use me as a go-between. When I straight-up told him that I don’t want to be included in the issues that are between him and them, he said that he “will remember me not supporting him forever”, whatever that means. He compares us and says that they favor me, which is bullshit. 

He has an attitude that everyone is against him, and seems to think that he is entitled to the money that my parents send us. I figured being at university would teach him how ridiculously privileged he and I both are to be afforded the opportunities that we have been afforded, but he seems to have no sense of anything outside of himself. He victimizes himself and (now that he thinks he can rap) calls everyone who disagrees with him a hater and cuts them out of his life. Despite the fact that he’s done this to my parents, they still send him money and pay his tuition. 

I’ve become almost certain that he’s using/abusing drugs because he’s lost a truly ridiculous amount of weight in the last month and behaves in a way that is strange and completely out of character. I told my parents these concerns and they share them, but still take the position that there’s not that much else that they can do, short of sending him to rehab without any real evidence of a drug problem beyond a marked change in behavior/demeanor. I’m aware that my parents are doing what they think is best, but it’s really hard to be at the same (small, close-knit) university as him and hear stories about/physically see him destroying himself. He actually looks like he’s decaying and it’s extremely distressing for me. I’ve tried to explain that to my parents, but I don’t think they actually understand what it feels/looks like from my position. 

What, if anything, should I do? What can I even do? I feel absolutely helpless, especially as he actively avoids a relationship with me. The stress he’s causing me is beginning to distract from my school work and I just want to be able to focus on my law degree, and have a regular, fun first year at university, like he did when he went to university for the first time. 

I understand that he must feel unhappy with the fact that he’s failed, and it must feel pretty rotten to be in the same grade as your little sister, but I feel that his resentment of me is unfair and unfounded. I don’t know how to handle this at all. Any advice/commiseration would be greatly appreciated.",01Aug2019,2

471,"I am 15. My dad divorced when i was younger and i chose to stay with my mom. Nothing much happened in between, i just stayed with my mom and my dad did some things (like send bad messages to her or cut from the child support) that made my mom hate him. 

This year my dad and his second love are marrying and they invited me to attend the ceremony. My dad asked me if I can come by meeting with me in some restaurant and not telling my mom anything, letting me tell her.

I accepted because It's hard for me to say no and my dad's new wife is a pretty nice person. I told my mom that I wanted to go and all hell broke loose.

She yelled at me and asked me why i'm going when he did all those things and I just answered with ""well.. he's my dad"".

My mom got even more mad but didn't show it much. She did however tell all her relatives including my grandparents. This is why i am pissed at her, because my grandparents actually loved me and I love them back, nothing about the fact that I am going to my dad's wedding will change that.

I tried telling her that I still love her the same and the fact that i want to go to my dad's wedding doesn't change that but she just won't understand.

He's a writer and really does not get out, and I think the isolation is really starting to get to him. He's been living there for about 8 years since my parents split (and on and off throughout his entire life), but until this past year he had a girlfriend/life partner who stayed with him. She dealt with groceries, helped him with his computer problems, etc- she also made sure he got a cellphone, got satellite WiFi where he lives and a solar panel so there was some electricity, and overall really improved his living conditions. But eventually the isolation got to be too much and she left him. He told me he's been feeling depressed (he used the word ""blue"") and lonely, and I really don't know how to help him if he insists on staying there as he does.

I ended up getting a panic attack and pretty much vanishing for half a day. Was not on my A game for most of that week anyway. It was like a cloud went over my brain and I could not think logically.

This pissed off everyone on my team and rightfully so. My boss and supervisor both asked what happened. My boss straight up asked me if I had anxiety. They said I wasn't in trouble and gave me constructive criticism and encouragement.

The one silver lining to all of this is I realized that all of this is bigger than myself. I scheduled an appointment with a psych and a therapist to get this under control.

Nevertheless, resentment from my coworkers remains. I'd probably resent me too. I don't know how to fix it and I feel awful, uncomfortable, and ashamed. I've barely eaten this week, my sleeping has been poor, and I don't know how to move past this.

476,"Hello all,

My (29M) girlfriend (29F) broke off her 7-year long past relationship in January over a trivial issue, or so I've been told, like the guy wanted a late night party with friends before one of their wedding functions while she wanted him to drop her home. High chances that more happened there. But anyway, she and I started talking on FB within 2 weeks of her breakup.

We started our romantic relationship on May 1. She's been in a tough position ever since and her parents have been after her to get married. Naturally the pressure was on me to act as well and so me and my parents stepped up to the occasion and we by July 5th, both sides met formally over lunch.

Ever since, I've heard some crazy narratives from her parents side why this won't work. One example, to highlight the pettiness of their arguments, they said that we may not allow her to pick furniture where she and I are going to live. This kept going on for a while, I was being patient while they kept throwing shade at my parents for incredibly petty reasons.

Her parents eventually asked her to call this relationship off. She always seemed to be the victim in all of this.

When nothing seemed to have been working, I offered to her that we can live independently (not with my parents) post marriage. Her parents agreed to the whole thing within a few hours, and I didn't even have to convince anyone, just one sentence was more than enough to get them on board.

It seems like they were pushing me into a corner to live independently and the whole act of nitpicking was a way to manipulate me into agreeing to that. I don't mind living independently one bit but the way they acted scared me.

Yesterday, I asked her that I would need about 10 days to discuss this whole living independently thing with my parents and that I'm not too happy with her dad, how he keeps giving my family ultimatums. She broke up within 30 minutes of that conversation. I didn't respond and in about 6 hours she tried to patch things up. When I maintained my stance, she got aggravated and so did I. She apologized but when I didn't buy her apology, she broke things off again.

**Is all of this normal? Was I being manipulated? Or should I call her up and patch things up before she moves on?**

**I'm really confused and starting to doubt my own sanity.**

PS: She has a poor temperament, has an incredibly controlling family (super close attachment with mum and shares details about our intimate moments), they are psychologists by profession and I've seen them plot and plan conversations to get their job done, she's pretty cold emotionally and blames a different love language, says Love You's mostly as a damage control measure and gets flashes from the past relationship so much so that it led to her breaking up with me before as well. Also, she used to break up quite frequently in her past 7-year long relationship. This was a long-distance relationship and we're both based out of different cities in India.

I am burnt out and currently dreading returning to a job that I work my butt off for just to constantly be put down.

481,"I recently asked for advice on this on r/relationship_advice so this is more of an update and I decided to post it here to see if the responses are any different.

[here's the original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/chu1n9/does_he_16m_like_me_16f_for_who_i_am_or_does_he/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

^^TLDR: I've been ""speaking"" to a boy and it's pretty clear that we're both looking for something different in the sense that he just thinks i'm ""hot"" and whatnot whereas i'm more into what's deeper although I'm scared of getting attached to him but also losing him and it's a hot mess.

And following on from the original post, this seems really stupid but the day before I left for my 3 week holiday to China, we had probably the best conversation we'd ever had on snapchat until he somewhat subtly suggested we send naked pics to each other, to which I said no because I stood by when I told myself whatever happens with him, I'll take care of myself first.

Which is all well and good but the truth is I really don't know how to take care of myself. Since then (as in around yesterday, taking time zones into consideration), he kinda seemed disinterested in the conversation and hasn't snapped me all day although we've been snapping daily for the past 19 days (snap streak).

Reading this all back, I know I sound absolutely mental but I don't know. By the time I get back it'll have been 5 weeks since the last time I saw him. I read a few psychology articles on lust being the initial stage of attraction or something so is that the situation and if so, is it the distance, and the further distance created by me not sending him pics the reason he's losing interest? Or, more likely, am I just paranoid from being under a lot of stress? If so, how do I manage these emotions? Do I just give it time? I know logically, I made the right decision but I can't help but feel like I've fucked this all up for myself.

So yeah, if anyone can give some advice on how to focus on logic as opposed to emotion, I'd appreciate it if u could help. Thanks.",01Aug2019,1
482,"About 2 weeks ago I twisted my ankle whilst playing basketball at school, which to begin with, I am terrible at. 

I was unable to walk properly or put any weight on the ankle. That was when already 2 boys told me I’m faking it. 

It progressively got worse, and I could not walk without experiencing a lot of pain. When I got home I realized how bad it really was. My entire ankle was horribly swollen and red. It hurt a lot and my mom and I went to the hospital. 

I got an x-ray done and the doctor told me I had a very severe ligament tear. A plaster cast was put around my foot. 

I went to school the next day and those same boys again accused me of faking it. And today another boy subtly said the same.

483,"What I mean is, when I'm talking to someone, I keep overthinking what I'm going to say to them, because I'm scared they won't find it interesting, and instead end up not saying anything at all. I sometimes don't even pay attention to what the other person is saying, because I'm completely stuck inside my head.

A perfect example would be this. I went out with my crush a couple of days ago. She's very nice, smart and funny, we have a lot of things in common and we can talk about a lot of different topics. It truly made my day seeing her and talking to her. But the thing is, several times when we were talking, I felt like I had nothing to say. I was so busy trying to think of something interesting to say to her that I completely forgot actually talking. Luckily, she's very communicative, so she would most of the time (like, 80%) lead the conversation, which made it really easier for me. If she wasn't like that, there would be a lot of awkward silences because of me. I was probably very nervous, but I guess it also applies in these kinds of situations.

Sometimes it seems like I'm not enjoying someone's company because of these things. Any tips on how to be more overt and myself? It would be extremely helpful. I'm going to see my crush again in a couple of weeks and I really want to be MY best self.

487,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I also apologize in advance for any grammar errors, I’m typing this out on the down low at work. 

I went on exchange for 8 months and found a subtenant for my room while I was away. I was living in a house with 4 other girls and they were fine with it and it was all legal, landlord was aware and gave consent. As far as I was concerned everything was working out well. I would get texts from my housemates saying things along the lines of “subtenant did this can you believe” and I would have to text the subtenant every now and then to get her side and try and help mediate some minor arguments, but everything appeared to work out.  The arguments would be along the lines of subtenant freaked out because we moved her vegetables to make room for everyone else, or subtenant doesn’t understand why she has to help clean the kitchen and washroom in a schedule when she can just clean up after herself. It was a little annoying since I had explained most of the causes of the arguments when I met her and before she signed our contract, but I would just remind her that we had already discussed these things and that she had previously said she understood and agreed to them, and the argument would end. 

I think I should just mention here that the subtenant is new to Canada. She is on a student visa from Iran. Its relevant since a lot of arguments are due to some cultural differences in how conflict is dealt with and expectations on lifestyle and how students should act.  The subtenant is not religious so there’s no problems along the lines of you shouldn’t dress that way or the food you eat can not touch the food I eat etc etc, but some arguments do start when my housemates smoke weed or drink alcohol (sparingly, on weekends maybe or a bowl after work, but nothing crazy and we are Canadian after all). She believes weed is equivalent to meth and my one housemate can’t say anything to her because she thinks her brain has rotted (her words to me). When I met her and we were discussing her sublease, she seemed incredibly liberal and chill, perfect for the house and there were no real, obvious red flags. 

If you havnt figured out already, I found out about a month ago that all was not okay. In fact, it was nowhere near okay.  I guess it started near exams where the subtenant became a tyrant. Examples being she would make these ridiculous rules and enforce them by screaming and throwing tantrums. An example being my housemates weren’t allowed to do laundry after 7pm (which as students is the only time they can do it) because it was distracting (even though she got home around 8pm most nights). If they did, or objected to the rule, or just didn’t follow it because, let’s be real, she isn’t their mom, she would scream at them for hours (I think the max scream fest they told me about lasted for 3hrs). She refused to do dishes or clean up after herself, she would turn on the AC out of spite at nighttime to up the cost of utilities (She pays me a flat rate every month even though the tenants are responsible for paying utilities, so as per our contract she doesn’t pay for any extra cost the AC creates. I realize this was probably not smart of me to agree to, but I wanted to help make her time in Canada a little easier).  She brings home random old men who she calls her “friends” and let’s them pray in our living room. Obviously the praying isn’t a problem, but the fact she invites strangers into a home of 20-something girls is not.  She also threatened to not pay rent to me the other day unless I made her paper copy’s of the rent receipts, even though she already had them on her online banking account because she pays me with eTransfer.  There’s much more behavioural issues she has but I’m getting riled up thinking about them and since I need to work with the public today, I better end with the little taster i’ve just written out. 

Anyway, I didn’t realize how serious it was until like two months before her tenancy was supposed to end anyway as per our contract, but I was like well if I follow the eviction process she can be out a month early best case so I got a paralegal. Unfortunately, he cancelled our appointment and rescheduled for two weeks later, which doing a little bit of math means I would be paying 200$ an hour to have him to start the eviction process for only two weeks without her.  Anyway, as far as I know i’ve no real legal options anymore. Which is the reason I’m making this post. Does anyone have any experience with a similar situation and have any advice on either how to deal with her tantrums, or by some miracle get her to leave the house? She has a new house to live in starting september 1st.",01Aug2019,3

My plan was to go into the peace corps until I very recently was medically denied after being accepted, but I still want to go eventually (1-2 years) after settling medical issues. I have a couple of different jobs on the table and I need help figuring out what to do. I am really passionate about community work and working with vulnerable populations. I plan to do a doctorate eventually as well.

1) I was offered an Associate Director position doing Data Science and Program Evaluation with a kickass nonprofit that focuses on reducing the number of opioid related deaths. It is in my hometown, which is kind of a pro and a con lol. Idk if I want to move back home right now. Pay is decent and the work is highly related to what I see myself doing in the future. Cons is that it isn’t quite as adventurous as I’d like to be right now in my mid twenties and could be a long term position which would inhibit me from pursuing the peace corps or a PhD anytime soon.

2) a language school in the Yucatán is wanting me to come and build their library program for a period of ten months! I really want to be solidly fluent in Spanish (I am already an advanced speaker) and I love the Yucatán. Pay is basically nothing by US standards but is enough to live. Obviously working at a school building a library program isn’t directly applicable to public health but is still a worthy cause. The 10 month timeline is great because it means I can apply to the peace corps again soon.

I am just having a hard time because the first job would be the resume building wise career choice. The position in the Yucatán is not as relevant but could open up some cool opportunities in the global sector and I would be able to leverage that for the peace corps.

I always hope for the best in these kids in and out of sports, and I want to do all that I can to help them make the best decisions (especially during their troubled teenage years). I never coached this kid directly on one of my teams, but I have for a couple practices and he knows me. I have always thought this kid's best attribute was his endurance and relentless energy. I know his dad, the store owner, personally, but not close. Though I have talked to him on numerous occasions, I certainly don't consider our relationship close. Perhaps it's agreed that I am to help lookout for his son, that's what coaches do, anyway, right?

This ""juuling"" trend is SO stupid. These kids don't realize the impact of what vaping is doing to their bodies. First of all they are getting addicted to this substance that was made to help cigarette smokers have what is thought to be a better alternative. Secondly, they don't get anything out of it besides some fruity flavor that you could get from chewing bubble gum. If it was weed he was smoking (and MAYBE it was a THC vape but I doubt it), at least he would be doing it to get high as opposed to some stupid flavored bullshit. Thirdly, this kid is going to lose his strongest attribute as an athlete, his cardiovascular ability, as his lungs will get affected.

Should I tell this kid's dad that we saw his son vaping at his store? AND....

I know it's fairly easy for kids to get the stupid flavored vape cartridges, but how prevalent and accessible are the pure THC vape cartridges with kids?

Anyway while on vacation, i caught a glimpse of the feed on her phone and i vaguely know the location of where one might be but i have no clue where the rest are. i’m not sure how many there are, where they’re positioned, how well they’re hidden, whether it’s a live feed or recording, or how much they show (they have color as far as i know but i don’t know about audio or  how clear the video quality is). i find it pretty invasive to install cameras into a house that i’m living in without telling me but i’m not about to confront anyone about this. i also don’t want to frequently feel like i’m being watched while at home without knowledge of at least where the cameras are. i could really use some advice on how to find and maybe deactivate the cameras discreetly (i feel like she would be able to see me make eye contact with the camera and walk over to fiddle with it through the feed). Please give me whatever advice you can think of for dealing with these hidden cameras! 

TLDR : hidden cameras in house and need to somehow dismantle discreetly",01Aug2019,4
514,"This may sound like a post for r/datingadvice, but it’s a bit more than that. So I’m 23 and disabled. Not wheelchair bound, but I had a stroke at birth and my arm is a bit smaller and a tad “deformed” in a sense and I limp a bit. I’ve never had a girlfriend, still a virgin in regards to going all the way, and it’s honestly all because I’m terrified of a girl I eventually fall for will not want to be with me because I’m different. Throughout college and life it’s been hard(er) to make genuine life-long friends, and though I have, I feel like I sometimes need to overcompensate for being different. 

Damn near 1/4 of the Big Ten school I attended see me around campus and know me as an inspiration for what I’ve been through and how I’ve never really let things get me depressed for long periods of time, and yet I only feel close to a handful of people. I know “quality over quantity” when it comes to friends, but I wish I could connect on a deeper level with more people. Back to the girl situation, I just don’t really know how or when to ask a girl on a real date more than a “friends date”. I’ve always been the guy that girls are friends with but nothing more. Now that I’ve recently graduated I want to finally be more than that guy.

515,"Let me start off by saying that I fucking hate this situation. I wish I never did anything like this. I'm filled with regret.

I got a call from my good friend, which has been suicidal as all hell. He's not usually like that. That call, I realized I had just lost a friend 2 years ago, and I knew I had to talk to him in person. I needed to do my best to prevent something so atrocious from happening. I can't help it, that's simply how I am. But ... of course someone would do that, right?

Well, that's not the main problem. I work at a store that sells a little bit of everything. Household products, hardware and most things you can think of.

I hate getting caught in a lie, mostly because I don't really lie that often. At my workplace tomorrow though, I will be.

I said to my boss/teamleader(s) that I would be going to the doctor to check on my eye. As I got the call from my friend the day before, I was informing my work of that situation very late, obviously. I still came to work that day, and left one hour before the time I told my friend I would visit him. Visiting him and helping him with his current mental state was all fine and dandy, I actually think it helped him enormously. Helping people is one of my first priorities in life, so I know what I'm doing.

However ... after I got home, around 5 PM, my teamleader called me and told me they needed an attest to confirm I was at the doctor to check on my eye, because of the short notice.

There I am, knowing how hard I shot myself in the foot with a massive shotgun.

I'm having such an internal struggle right now, you have no idea. I even called my local doctor to ask if I could check on my eye to get an attest where the date was in the past. Totally nuts - I know - it would just be building lie on top of lie.

I ***had*** to check on my friend and ensure I did the best I could. At the same time, I love my workplace and my colleagues. I have never done something like this at work, and I never will again.

However, I'm afraid I will lose my job or something, as I have no clue as to how he/she/they will react to the whole thing. Knowing that at the end of the day, I lied to them. Even if the situation was very serious for me.

This is eating me up on the inside ever since I got that call from work. Please, if anyone has any reassurances or have been through something similar before (stupidly enough), I beg for you to help me out.

Thanks in advance.",01Aug2019,1

517,"I'm a 22 y/o bi male. Have been using Grindr recently. Met this really sweet guy (20 yrs old) a few days ago and we've been talking since Sunday on snapchat. I sent him a ""goodnight"" snap last night right before I went to bed. He usually would snap me in the morning (he's an early riser). But not this morning. Nothing from him. Said he was active around 7-8 hours ago, so I assume he's still sleeping. An hour or so later I check snap again and his location's been turned off and he hasn't replied to anything yet. 

So I checked Grindr and sent him a message asking if he was alright. My message sent, but it was not delivered. He apparently has been online off and on but my messages have still been sitting on sent, which is odd. I checked snap again and his score hasn't gone up so that tells me that he's not been active on Snap. 

He hasn't blocked or unfriended me or anything - he's just been inactive. But it's not usually like him to do this. I'm worried about him. He has a poor family life and was disowned by his parents for being gay, so he now lives with his aunt and uncle. He told me that he'd attempted suicide once before.

522,"Tried posting this last night but didn’t garner much response.

I’m a 23M and I struggle to take care of the stuff I need to do. I am able to recognize things I need to change and I even have strategies on how to get there. When it comes to actually acting though, I rarely accomplish them.

Some examples: I need to quit smoking. I need to control my finances better. I need to eat better. I need to work out.

I am generally pretty successful for my age. I have two bachelors degrees, moved out of my parents house 5 years ago and have a job where I make plenty of money for what I actually need. I also believe I have great potential and could really be an amazing person one day.

The issue: I’ve never been diagnosed but I know I struggle with self esteem issues, anxiety and depression. So it becomes a cycle of my shortcomings worsening my mental health and my mental health causing my shortcomings.

I am at a point where I could really use the emotional support of somebody. I have never been in a relationship, which wasn’t really a problem for me until now. I recognize though that I likely won’t have much success there until I like myself more.

So, I know the obvious answer is go to therapy. What can I do until I actually get the help to manage my life better? Also, just do it is a great in theory but due to my personality I’ve often struggled with that precedent.

531,"Hi reddit, I apologize in advance for this being long but I feel like the details matter a lot here so thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read. Throwaway because IRL friends follow my reddit.

I (23M) graduated college in May of last year and moved from a big city that I’ve lived in my whole life (1m+ people) about 2 hours away to a small city (50k people) for a job out of school that i’ve been at about a year now. I’ll call the small city SC and big city BC from now on. Of course my friends in BC tell me to move back and my friends in SC tell me to stay, so i’m turning to the great neutral source of reddit for more thoughts. 

Reasons to stay 

Job. my job here is pretty great. I work under 40 hours a week and make close to 80k a year after bonus, with good upward potential. It’s a good combination of relaxed but also semi interesting work. COL is so low here that I am saving so much money right now which can set me up amazingly for the future. 

Coaching. I started coaching a high school track team here because I wanted to get involved in something (ran in high school) and have absolutely fallen in love with it. I get to take an activity that I love and use it to help kids grow. Now I could coach anywhere, but I actually have the opportunity to become the head coach next year (which would pay $12k, which is a nice little boost), and this is a top 5 in state program. I can tell coaching is something I want to do for a long time and that I want to be a big part of my life, and I’ll probably never get as good as opportunity as this elsewhere.



Reasons to move back

Social life. I have made a decent amount of friends in SC, but hardly anyone my age, and I still have a lot more in BC. Some of my lifelong best friends have just gotten jobs and are in the process of moving out in BC. I would love to live with them and be able to spend so much more time with them and other friends doing things I enjoy. In SC, I live alone and spend my free time wasting time on stuff like video games, etc. It’s an extremely traditional, conservative, and christian town, and I am none of those things. I enjoy nightlife and things like that, and I don’t really have that option here as that’s not what people do. Most people here get married either before college ends or right after college, and then almost immediately have kids (I get asked almost daily if I’m married and have kids). Also, I am single and just entering the phase of life where I’m moving on from more casual dating to looking for a long term relationship, and there’s almost no chance of me meeting anyone here as I am just so fundamentally different than pretty much everyone here. I obviously can’t know that for sure, but my odds are definitely way better in BC and a long term relationship is really something I want to work towards. In BC, everyone is much more moderate-liberal (like me), and I just get a long with people better. 

Family - My family is in BC and I don’t see them as much. My parents are approaching 60, and while that’s obviously not that old I want to enjoy all the time with them I can. 




I’m sure a lot of you are going to suggest that I travel back more on weekends, which I already do when I can. It’s fun, but just not the same as being able to do stuff like meet my dad for lunch on weekdays, go to a brewery with friends after work, etc. And because of coaching I don’t actually have that many available weekends to travel (and that makes me wonder if being a head coach might be a bit much for me to take on at my age.) On the other hand, I already have bonded so much with the kids I coach and they know I miss BC and tell me all the time how devastated they’ll be and that I’m not allowed to leave. I love them to death but I know they’ll survive if I leave, they’re high schoolers and all they really need is each other. I also really dread the process of looking for another job. I have a good degree and resume, so id be okay eventually, but it could take me months to find a job that pays as well and I could end up hating it for all I know. And higher COL city means I’d save less money, though obviously money isn’t everything.

I’m definitely not living in SC my whole life, I’m debating between moving now, or staying another 2 years. Two years is a good time period because I’ll hit 3 years on my job at which point I’ll earn about 10k in stocks that I wouldn’t get any of otherwise, and also the majority of the kids on the team I coach are rising juniors so I could see them through to graduation while having an extremely fun 2 years coaching such a good team. There aren’t hardly any runners in the grade below so that would be a good year for them to transition coaches. 2 years HC experience would also be great for me whenever I coach elsewhere. Also with low COL i’ll be able to save up a ton of money over the 2 years.

However that would leave me 25 years old, likely still single. I feel like after college there’s a very short period where life is still “college-ish”, and then once you get towards upper 20s people are getting married and starting families and transition into more of a family lifestyle. So I feel like by staying I am sacrificing  a huge chunk of a lifestyle that I love that I will never get back. I can’t decide if it’s worth it or not, I literally flip back and forth every morning. So what do you think?

Thanks so much to anyone that read all of this",01Aug2019,1
532,"I just moved into a new apartment.  The neighbor that shares a door to my apartment has been very... grumpy/irritated every time I see her or try to say hi.  She runs a cafe out of her portion of the building, open from 10am to 3pm, and I’m never around while she does business.  However, she is always too busy to say hi when she is around after hours.  

The first time I stopped by (less than 60 seconds) to say hi she was working with her employees (during hours while I was just unpacking).  I said hi to one of the employees and asked if Tracey was around.   The employee was super nice, a moment later I hear loudly from inside “he needs to leave right now.”  (I was outside the whole time, never barged in or anything).  After hearing this I immediately and calmly said goodbye, and that I had should get back to unpacking, to the employee that was nice.

My current job isn't great and enjoyable. I travel a lot and I'm young so I am fine with traveling. I don't enjoy working for my tech lead or boss. My boss cares for himself and my tech lead is more of my boss than he is. However my tech lead micros me and looks into my cubicle to see what I'm doing and just complains about my work. He gives me constructive criticism but a lot of times it's just him biting into me because I don't do it a certain way. He has a very authoritarian style of ruling and it annoys the heck out of me. I'm sick of the public humiliation and his do it my way or else style. Not a lot of people like working for him and for good reason.

I'm so sick of going to work. I travel to avoid going into the office, to avoid my boss and my tech lead and it's just more relaxing but I hate coming back to go to the office and I hate being on travel because it cuts into my social life. I looked for a new job because of this.

But I found another job but it isn't great since it's shift work. I normally take every other friday off but this new job requires me to go 50 hours per week. I get 1.5x overtime and I don't travel as much but I don't know if I will honestly enjoy it. I would learn a lot but the work is shift work which also is a problem since my commute takes 30-40 minutes. My time is less flexible.

More Plus or minus means how much more I rate it.

\+++ Traveling is nice but I prefer to not travel THAT often  
\+++ I have a more flexible schedule (I can go to work whenever I want)  
\+++ I can take every other friday off  
\+ I don't work that hard when I'm on travel and I can charge time.  
\+ I make per diem and overtime a lot easier on Travel  
\- I absolutely detest my tech lead and my boss  
\-- I care very little for what I do  
\--- It's gotten to the point that I get really annoyed by my ring tone and I get triggered hoping it isn't my tech lead  
\----- I absolutely hate going into work and the dread of monday leaks into every Sunday. I really detest my job environment

This new job:  
\+++ Work is more interesting (but it isn't saying much since my current job requires me to work on only one system. I don't know much more than just that)  
\+ Guaranteed overtime which at my salary would be 1.5x of my rate which would be a pretty sizeable increase

\- No travel whatsoever  
\--- Less Flexible schedule and shift work. Shift work doesn't bother me but I also don't get as many fridays off.  
\- On-Call more often  
\- Definitely more difficult and more rigid than my current position. I'm not woried that I'm not capable of doing my job but it is scary.

The new job is a rotation which requires me to go to for 12 months as a trial period. I don't think it's that big of a deal but I'm worried about burning the bridge back. If it doesn't work out, I come back to my old position with a pissed off tech lead who may or may not make my life a living hell. And I'm just worried about it. I don't know what I should do. It seems like both positions are terrible since my overall goal is travel less than I currently do and get a better working environment. I want more of my own social life but it doesn't seem like either positions would give me that. What should I do? Do I just stay and look for a new job or should I try out the rotation and see how I like it and if I don't, apply from there?",01Aug2019,1

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

547,"My (24) boyfriend (25) is part of a tight-knit group of close guy friends and I completely love and respect how important they are to him. 

However, within 7 days. His roommate and his best friend have taken him aside separately and asked him for more “guy time” because he spends his time with me. 

The thing is, I’m really not a clingy or insecure person that needs to see my boyfriend all the time. I’m usually quite independent and enjoy alone time, but my boyfriend really enjoys seeing me whenever he can and I think it’s lovely to be wanted like that, so I see him nearly every day. 

We live about 1.5kms apart from each other, so it makes it easy to be together often.  Most nights I’m either staying at his or he’s at mine unless I have work. Cooking for 1 is a bitch, so it makes financial  sense that we have dinner together and we love spending time in the kitchen cooking after a long day. 

My BF has a roommate. 
The roommate has been a close friend of my BF for years. I really enjoy him as a person and I’ve always felt like we were good friends in our own right, our own personal jokes etc. today he messaged my boyfriend to ask if he could spend less time at me, or I could go over to their place less because he wants some more alone time with my BF.  I saw the message and his roommate  has no idea I know. so I feel like it’s a bit snakey in his part to guilt my BF away from me. 

He’s recently broken up with a long term GF and is going through some tough financial stuff and stuff with his parents, so I recognize that he’s lonely and wants his friends around him. But I thought that I was considered a friend too? I always had that impression so this request took me by surprise. 

I then found out that another close friend of my BF took him aside a few days ago and told him he needs to spend more time with “the boys” and I should stay at home the next time  they plan something. 

I’ve actually known this friend longer than I’ve known my BF, and we always got along great. I’d often be invited over to hang out with the group or chill on the weekends and that’s actually how I met my BF.  

All of the guys have girlfriends, and it’s a weird dynamic in the group where they are on their best boyfriend behavior at the “unisex” gatherings with the partners, and completely naughty and crass when the girls aren’t around. It’s almost like the girlfriends are killjoys which is weird to me (why are you dating them then?) but whatever. 

I’ve always been a tom boy and get along great with guys a lot of the time. I’m not easily offended and one of the friends commented how I was “more ‘one of the boys’ than some of the guys” in an affectionate way. 

I have always strongly felt that I never want to be considered “a girlfriend” but rather as my own person with my own merits. I’ve felt that I’ve also formed a close bond with these guys in my own way. And now I’m realizing that I’m still just “one of the girlfriends” to them. 

My BF and i got together about a year ago, and I’m hurt that this has suddenly come up.
My BF says I mustn’t take it personally, because they “can’t be themselves around a girl and need some gross guy time” 

but it seems so personal, because I never felt like I was hindering them from being “guys” (if you want to fart, then fart dude)

I think I just hate being considered a “girl” and want to be considered a friend. Am I wrong to be offended that my “friends” view me like this?",01Aug2019,1
548,"I (19m) and my now ex gf (18F) had a kindof initially nasty breakup. I broke up with her after 1 1/2 yrs because i felt like i didnt see a future together and wasnt keen to settle yet like she was. I decided to break up with her. After 3 hours of crying she decided to leave my car and we had a hug and said goodbye. A week later she said she wished to meet up urgently to address cheating rumours while we were in a relationship (which i didnt) but she got teary and we both ended up talking for a while and got much better closure. 

We then got to talking and agreed we both can talk really easily and we will miss our sex we have. So we decided that wed be fwb until whenever. I definitely dont have any feelings for her anymore and she still does. i just went to her house and we had sex, she said after she thinks it will help her get over it. Is a week too soon to switch to fwb? and what are some potential positive and negative outcomes? 

tl;dr me and my ex decided to become fwb a week after our breakup, is this okay or too soon?

edit: to clarify i asked her multiple times if shes okay with this and if she wants to wait thats fine and she said she wants to. Also our second meeting she said she was glad i ended it because we had an unhealthy relo and she needed to focus on herself",01Aug2019,1

I'm 19 living with my alchoholic mom and my stepdad in the deep south where I've applied for near 50 jobs and only one ONE called back for an interview and it was Huddle House and I went and the work environment wasn't great. So never had a job, have no money. Just finished freshman year at community college. I'm miserable here. There is no opportunity for dental hygiene career with the colleges unless I transfer 3 hours away to Jackson after 2 more years of CC. Then good luck with a job after because zero demand here. So zero opportunity, no money, I've been severely depressed for years now, social anxiety, recently was raped, and oh let me mention I'm gay...in the deep south. It's hell being gay here. There are hardly any gay people and the ones who are literally. just. want. sex. I'm so sick of being here but I have no money and no place to go. What should I do? I have no place to go no friends or family I can move in with except my dad in Oklahoma City and he won't answer if I can move in or not plus his neighborhood is really bad. Should I go ahead and just say screw it and enroll another year of college here? I'm not even sure if I can get financial aid again. Should I just keep applying for jobs and hope for a miracle? Both? If I choose the college thing and do get financial aid that's a whole school year being miserable again. I don't know if I can handle that. So please if you can help offer advice I'd greatly appreciate it.

554,"Hello everyone. This will be the first post I make on Reddit. 

I am currently a second-year going to be a third-year student at a university. To be honest I am very lost. For the past year and a half, I have been dealing with body issues (sure everyone has at one point), as well with the feeling of being sexually assaulted when I was younger (I keep having nightmares making me stay up for most days). Considering myself my issues aren't as bad as other people. I feel depressed. I feel like I always been depressed but now I am realizing. Ever since I was younger I wanted to be in the medical field and just in general help, my mother always pushed me because she believes in me so much (and because I was doing pretty good in school) but ever since the assault everything went downhill. I thought it was normal. To be touched and toyed with. Hearing the words they said to me like it made them happy, I didn't want to tell anyone, so I found myself eating more food, and my grades declining. My drive for everything went out the door. My passion for helping others, my ambition, my body and mental state. I feel like an empty doll just walking around. I am scared to tell anyone anything because I feel useless. My drive has been lost especially since the fact that my teachers always put me down and told me I could never do anything. Wanting to be a teacher I felt maybe I could help others around me. But despite being in uni my grades are terrible and I have no heart to tell anyone. My family is close and we are tight-knitted. Since I am the youngest of four sisters people often want to see better from me, I feel like I have so many expectations to fill. But I can't. I just don't feel I can. My friends are always there for me but I feel like a bother to them (since they have their own issues). 

  However, I may be foolish but I do enjoy writing (poems, fanfics and even my own stories) and especially drawing. But again, that only allows me limited happiness. Happiness is a strange feeling. I feel it whenever I make my mom proud, she is the only person I think I could truly love. But it's hard to say this. So many words I have to say about myself. Overall, I feel like I don't deserve this life I live. I have an exam in less than two hours, and I don't think I can go? I just can't.

So people of Reddit, what should I do?",01Aug2019,1

556,"I'm in my 30s. I built a relatively successful career so far and I think the secret is constant self-discipline. I usually make a thorough plan to achieve something that I really want to get and can stick to it. However, as time went by I found myself being under a lot of stress instead of a sense of fulfillment. Those bad feelings often ooze out so much that people nearby can even notice it. For example, when I'm in a study group or at work,  I always want to make the meeting or gathering productive. I'm annoyed deep in my heart when some people don't take the purpose of the group/team seriously, don't stick to the protocol and don't do their best. I know I can't change their attitude no matter what I do but I can't stop being annoyed, irritated, only to consume myself in inanity.  How can I get out of this situation? It is really hard to give upon people. Perhaps my standard is too high to them. In many times my coworkers and friends in the same group/organization acknowledge their lack of motivation and support my strategy toward goals but it's not enough for me. I don't understand why they don't take the initiative.",01Aug2019,1
557,"Throwaway account so that it is not connected to my original account. Also English is not my native language and I am on my mobile so the formatting could be horrific.

As the title says, there is something I can't process and the thing I can't properly process occurred in my life because of my ex. I was in a relationship since February 2015 until February 2019. The relationship was great, well it feeled like that when I was in the relationship. 3 months into the relationship, she kissed someone else at a festival, I was on holiday and it crushed my soul. She said she isn't doing it again and I believed that. Till the last day she didn't do anything else as far as I was aware of.

3 years into the relationship, she started to like someone else, out of the blue. It shattered my confidence and since then I've issues with my confidence and I have proper trust issues. My confidence was alright before this all happened. But now I am single, a girl really needs to tell me that she likes me before I am comfortable enough to make a move or to accept the move she makes.

It's really awful, see it as me being a paper, she made a paperball of me and when you try to make the paper again as it was before by unfolding it, You will still see the creases. That's how I describe it, it's not something that really follows me, but it could be a obstacle when dating a new girl, I know I am not comfortable when I am dating a new girl, when she's going to a bar, with some friends. Me not being there, while I know I can trust her.

I know I shouldn't be worried, because I've being dating lately with a girl, but I just really want to know how to process it and starting to be the old me again. I don't want to be a burden in a future relationship.

Hope someone can help me, thanks reddit :)",01Aug2019,1
558,"So he has lived with us 1.5 years, and at first it was going to be temporary just until his mom got a new place to live. Well she went to prison so it's going to be much longer now.

That's relevant because when he first came to live with us, all he did was play on Nintendo and tablet. Literally his mom would let him play on the tablet or Nintendo every moment of the day that he was awake. He was 4 when he came to live with us and he didnt even speak that's how little interaction he was getting. 

I didnt like it at all, but my wife said it's all he's done for basically his whole life, and it was just temporary so we should let him be until he moves back in with his mom. This was all prior to her going to prison. Well it's become  clear to me that it is affecting everything in his life, as he only wants to be on a tablet. I've discussed it with my wife and she always says things about how he isnt hurting anyone and we should let him play after daycare and such.

We dont let him on the tablet or Nintendo as much anymore, but I still feel it's way too much. The other problem is he spends all his time asking if he can get on it yet. It consumes his thoughts. Everything he does it about wanting to get on the tablet or Nintendo even after a year of limiting it.

I've been taking him to the park on weekends and he tells me he wants to go home after being there shortly. After daycare every single day, the very first thing he asks is if he can play on the tablet or Nintendo even though he knows it's not allowed and I tell him to not ask. He asks again every single day. He asks every single morning while getting ready to go.

We went out to eat the other night and he got so mad because we were leaving the house and it would interfere with him getting onto the tablet that day. He started crying. When I asked him why, he told me because he wanted to play the Nintendo. I discussed with him that he spends too much time wanting to play Nintendo, that it is all he thinks about, and that he needed to stop asking. I also told him that I just want the best for him, and that's why we limit his tablet and Nintendo usage. He continued to cry at the restaurant. Every single moment of every single day he is asking to get on the tablet and Nintendo. No amount of telling him to stop asking or to go play with toys even slows him down. He has wild mood swings that depends entirely upon his ability to play on the tablet and Nintendo.

I'm honestly to the point where I'm wondering if we just need to remove it from the house altogether though so he can detox from it.

My wife is more akin to just letting him be on it as she doesnt see the problem of letting him play for hours at a time. I really worry it will stunt his development. He doesnt appear to know how to play with toys. I think he lacks an imagination. Even when we sit down and draw or color, he usually just draws what I am drawing. I think it has everything to do with the tablet doing all the thinking for him and I'm worried about him.

Should we continue to just limit his tablet and Nintendo time as we have and hope he finally starts understanding and coping with the limitations, limit it even further to say only a couple of hours on the weekend, remove it from the house like I'm leaning to right now, or am I overthinking this and do what my wife wants and let him play more.",01Aug2019,1

565,"So, i have a long-time self-identified psychological problem and i need your advice.

Firstly and most importantly, video games. So one of my hobbies is playing video games, i play all kind of games, like FPS, MOBA, RPG and im tirelessly trying to find what playstyle defines me the most, but i just seem unable to tell what do i enjoy the most. In role-playing or moba games im constantly switching roles, characters and playstyles to find my inner peace and its been years, im playing less and less because the frustration it causes as i grow older (21/M right now). The worst is, when im playing something, lets say an archer, im constantly thinking how could i solved that situation or killing those enemies with a sword upfront, or sneaking and assassinating them from behind. And when im playing a fighter, the exact opposite, im thinking what would have been different (and better) being a mage or an archer. BUT, playing mobas, im kinda fine (not totally sure but its still a better situation) assuming which character i enjoy the most from a defined playstyle, lets say i """"KINDA"""" know which fighter or assassin i enjoy the most, but still cant tell if i would be better (and enjoying more) as a mage or marksman, so its changing weekly, daily, and its totally ruining the experience and skill-progression i want to achieve in a game. Im projecting myself literally every night before sleep what would i use in a fantasy ""real-life"" situation, but its different every night, and its kinda depressing i feel like i cant get a grasp on my own ""identity"".

In life, i tried a lot of sports, and its definitely more defined what are my strengths and weaknesses, like i was better (and enjoyed more) at football (and definitely knew what position fits me the most) than at basketball, but in videogames (and in my fantasy) im literally unable to tell.

Im looking for any kind of advice you can give, im even started to think going to a psychologist with my problem.",01Aug2019,1

I thought I should get tinder and I did so, and no luck. I though It was was my body that was bad so I lost 25 lbs and gained a lot of muscle (I'm like 140 lbs now), yet I have no luck.

I've also had a internship at a fortune 50 company as a software dev , my GPA from last year was a 3.8 . But once again no matter how much I do, I always feel as if I'm lacking behind because I never held someone close to me (I understand its dumb, but I cant help how I feel).

I very talkative so I don't get boring (I think) as well as I'm willing to always go on adventures and have many hobbies, so I don't think its a personality thing but there has to be something wrong with me right? And on a physical level I'm like average for a Indian man born and raised in America. I do so much to make myself look and sound good. I try to eliminate any variable but nothing seems to work.

My girlfriend (22) and I (23) currently live with her parents. We decided to do this after our unemployed neighbours started asking to “borrow” money, they were essentially harassing us.

Her parents were nice enough to put us up so we could “save up” to actually buy a place or at least to be in a comfortable enough position to re-rent somewhere better. We’d contribute to the upkeep of the house and they’d cover our food, simple.

This is all well and good. The issue is that what we give her parents in “keep” each month is more than our one bedroom flat cost each month and we get a room out of it. We don’t cost anywhere near as much as we contribute and her parents are actually making a tidy profit off of us, which shows in their lifestyle of constantly going out for nice meals and buying lots of wine and craft beer.

after all of this AND travel is taken into consideration we end up spending far more to live in one room than it cost us to live in our old flat.

My girlfriend still wants us to stay there and pay what we do and move somewhere ideal and I agree to an extent, however I think we should only pay around what we cost to look after.

Can I get an opinion on my perspective and potentially some advice on what you think I should do? I appreciate it.",01Aug2019,1
576,So.... my period is late.. by three days and I'm freaking out. Last weekend I did some things with my boyfriend and well we didn't have vaginal sex or anal and we were careful but I'm super freaked out that my period is late. My period has been late the past 3 or 4 times (because I started running the cross country again) so maybe I'm overreacting... I don't know what to do. I just wanna know what you ladies out there think.,01Aug2019,1
577,"I moved to a new city on July 15th and got an interview at this bigger coffee shop (corporate) just as a part-time barista. It’s not much but it’s a job I desperately need starting out at a new city. So I get an interview two days after I move down and get hired at the interview. She said they had gotten behind on some training due to their store being remodeled so they had to get the last group of trainees in before I could come in to be trained, so she told me to expect starting at the end of July, beginning of August and that we’d get all my paperwork situated while I waited. 

So I didn’t even get to do my background check until last Friday. They haven’t really been keeping in contact with me. I called Monday and they told me they’d have to call me back because they were in a conference call. I get called back later and they told me they’d call me in to start my paperwork whenever my background check was done. It’s been since Tuesday that it’s been done and no one’s called me and I still haven’t started training or even done my paperwork to start. 

I have had a lot of experience in the food business and was a manager at another corporate food business somewhat similar to this one beforehand, so I’m not sure if this is me being impatient because I know how short of a process this is supposed to take, or if I should just start looking for another job elsewhere. I like this one because of the pay and of the position and the fact that it’s corporate, but I’m getting very antsy being without a job for this long and I’m starting to get red flags from the lack of communication.

581,"!!don't tell me to quit. I am. Not my q

  


20F, worked in 4 restaurants. Been working at this casual/fine dining chain restaurant for 4 months. I'm quitting in a month cause the school semester starts back up. The culture is shit and I want to report it. I've been sexually harassed at every single restaurant I worked at and I'm tired of it being pushed under the rug. This franchise especially is known for treating its employees like shit but the public is totally unaware. The issue is that I feel like the only business that's mine to tell is the stuff that happened directly to me and didn't involve others' lives, and idk if my stories alone are enough for them to give a shit esp when I'm quitting

* Mid30s M bartender, honorary management , has a ton of pull &amp; privileges, bffs w managers. 2 weeks after I start he offers his \# out to pick up shifts, so I request him to pick up one of mine. Next day he asks me out over text. I reject him so unbeknownst to me he brings me multiple expensive gifts (a watch and a designer purse... the fuck dude) and I tried to refuse them but he threw out receipts and refused to keep the items so I gave them to my sister. he said ""im not interested in anyone else so it's worse if you reject me"" well another 20F server started a month ago, she told me that he found her number thru the app (our info is now posted w/o our consent I think ??) and asked her out. Both of us feel uncomfortable even working w him anymore...

* 22M head chef transferred here a month ago...the first day he met me he spent the 6 hours staring at me with some fucking animalism...his manager gf 21F was standing next to me for part of it and now she acts like a highschool bitch to me...the other 20f server, that head chef found her on Facebook and messaged her; the server showed the gf, so the gf cries and chews out the server, all while at work

* A 23M manager fucked a host for months, cheating on his gf , irrelevant to work but they made their ""relationship"" extremely obvious and she got fired a month ago for whatever reason. He also acts like a baby has insecurity borne tantrums if I even look at him and flirts w everyone including stopping his job once for an hour to flirt w a bar customer wearing a bandeau and short shorts... and him and that creepy ass bartender openly had loud conversations in the restaurant about female customers' looks and ages while I was closing with them

* The managers are just nasty people, if you ask them a question or even speak to them they will be rude. Only 1 (40M) doesn't absolutely suck and even he said in my very first week that we better do well bc our job can be done by trained monkeys. Whenever I go by the managers' office I hear one of the new ones (~30M) mocking the servers and imitating their voices

* The majority of us went a month or more w/o being paid and they just whined that they're working on it , yet when I screwed up one receipt and owed them $20 that I didn't have, the 23M manager (only 1 there) LITERALLY said if I leave the store I'm stealing, at 11 30 pm and they're threatening me w some shit. I offered to pay it back the next time I come in and he refused . It turned out the receipt was wrong so I didn't owe it, so idk what would have gone down if i had

* They just have no respect for us at all. We get a lot of male customers so I asked the managers for a men's shirt bc they let us switch between men and women's shirts and the women's is more revealing . I asked multiple managers thruout the whole shift (7+ hours), including an hour before the shift started, and they all said they would, but I never got the shirt. It's in a room 5 feet away from their office.

* different bipolar ass bartender, 27M, acts like a fucking dick to female servers bc we wouldn't fuck him, he got fired after 3 months but only for standing up to managers, not for his months of harassment and unprofessional behavior

* They also do some fucking borderline illegal shit. Our system went down a couple weeks ago for a few hours so they had us write down customers' orders and credit card info. This includes customers who ordered and ate before the system went down. Instead of management keeping track of this, they trusted a bunch of early 20 something minimum wage employees to literally carry around credit card info in our pockets for half a day and out of good faith report all orders &amp; payments

* They don't make up the difference when we don't make minimum wage and our sections are now like 8 customers so we usually don't. They pay us $3/hr even if we have 0 customers

This is not to even mention the bullshit ways they run the restaurant but that isn't my place so we won't mention that here.

  


THese assholes moved locations and fired a bunch of people but didn't touch the management just added some extra neurotic assholes. 2 of these managers are meant to ""fix"" the place lmfao (30M &amp; 21F) . I told 30M manager before the move that there were issues w harassment and unprofessional conversations so please emphasize that topic in training . He agreed but they didn't say a word about it or even any of the basic concepts. Their solution is a tiny sign literally on the wall next to the kitchen 4 inches above the floor saying text this number to take sexual harrassment survey. The quiz says ""what is sexual harrassment"" and ""should you report it"" multiple choice

Friend B told C about this in confidentiality not wanting me to know, but it slipped out today. Now I don't know what to do. I mean I don't want to lose him as a friend, but I don't want him to choose either. Should I just leave it and hope for the best? BTW, we're all dudes.

I'm 19 living with my alchoholic mom and my stepdad in the deep south where I've applied for near 50 jobs and only one ONE called back for an interview and it was Huddle House and I went and the work environment wasn't great. So never had a job, have no money. Just finished freshman year at community college. I'm miserable here. There is no opportunity for dental hygiene career with the colleges unless I transfer 3 hours away to Jackson after 2 more years of CC. Then good luck with a job after because zero demand here. So zero opportunity, no money, I've been severely depressed for years now, social anxiety, recently was raped, and oh let me mention I'm gay...in the deep south. It's hell being gay here. There are hardly any gay people and the ones who are literally. just. want. sex. I'm so sick of being here but I have no money and no place to go. What should I do? I have no place to go no friends or family I can move in with except my dad in Oklahoma City and he won't answer if I can move in or not plus his neighborhood is really bad.

587,"First time posting here so sorry for any mistakes. The past couple of days have been a whirlwind and right now I'm really questioning everything and if I should even continue my relationship. My mom abandoned me with my dad when I was 3. She just up and left one night, never to give a crap about me again. My dad didn't know how to raise a little girl but he did his best. He drank a lot and smoked a lot but he never hit me or was abusive to me. He supported me no matter what I wanted to do and did his best to be a good father. I met my now boyfriend 2 years ago through mutual friends at a party. We hit it off instantly. 3 months into our relationship, he revealed me to he had a kid and it would be a dealbreaker if I couldn't handle that. I basically became a stepmom at 18 and didn;t mind it. He wanted me to move in with him and he would 'take care of me' and I was really dumb enough to believe it. My dad never said otherwise, he just supported me and even went as far as helping me pay to move to rhode island to be with my boyfriend and his kid.

On Monday I got the call that my dad passed away. He was only 45. His girlfriend hadn't heard from him in a couple of days and went to check on him and she found him in his bed. She thinks it was a heart attack or aneurysm but it's still not 100 percent confirmed. She was the one who called me to tell me about him being gone. I feel so guilty because he called me on Sunday night and I didn't answer. I didn't get one last chance to talk to my dad.

My boyfriend didn't even try to comfort me or anything when I told him. He was busy playing a video game and I asked him to please stop because I was trying not to have a breakdown. His response to my dad's passing was ""Well all that drinking and smoking finally caught up with him huh?"" I asked him what the fuck was his problem, my dad just died. I needed his support and needed him to go home with me and help me plan my dad's funeral because I had no idea what I was doing. He told me under no circumstances can I go home and help my dad's girlfriend plan his funeral. I can't leave him with his kid for the weekend alone, he says. He literally said ""You're not allowed to go unless I say so"" which just enraged me. I asked him what his problem was and his answer was ""I never liked your dad and I don't want you going to his funeral. I need you here to help me take care of my kid when I'm at work. You're not going, end of story""

I've been seeing red ever since. I have sacrificed so much for him. I'm up to my eyeballs in debt for him. I've co-signed loans for him to help him build his credit and I've literally paid his child support for him before when he's been short. He's the one who convinced me to leave my job and go back to school full time and pretty much take care of his son for him when it's his weekends. There have been so many chances when I could have gone to see my dad before he passed and my boyfriend has always said ""next time"" and now there is no next time. He acts like he owns me and I just don't know if I can continue to be with him after this. He has been so cold and downright cruel

I am going to pawn my laptop and probably some jewelry and figure out how the fuck to get away from him. I've spoken to my dad's girlfriend and she's told me if I leave him, I have a place to stay with her and she's willing to help me get back on my feet. I feel so defeated and angry. I want to call my dad and talk to him and I can't even do that. I just want to go home and say goodbye to my dad. I just want to go cold shoulder and leave and say ""fuck you and fuck your kid"" but is that going to far? I know I don't want to be with him any longer after this. I don't know what's the right thing to do. I'm just so angry

tl;dr: My dad passed away. Boyfriend has been majorly unsupportive. Angry and just want to burn the relationship to the ground. So angry I don't know if I'm thinking straight",01Aug2019,1106
588,"Background: I'm a happily married woman in my mid-30s.  I developed kind of a powerful celebrity crush in the past nine or ten months, wrote some fanfiction, found some likeminded people on Tumblr and chatted with them, basically just kind of gave into the fun of it.  

My husband is a great guy and I'm happy being married to him.  Our life together is good, although we've struggled with getting pregnant and I lost a pregnancy late last year.  We have satisfying sex on the regular.

I guess I just fed this crush too much.  I'm starting to feel really badly about it.  The simplest solution is probably to just stop feeding it, which I think I'm going to do.  

But I feel terrible.  I don't know if I should tell my husband what happened.  Keeping the secret feels bad, but telling him also sounds like it could hurt him, because I fantasized a lot and talked about it with other people.  

I've shared this with my therapist, but it was really hard; kind of embarrassing to have a powerful celebrity crush as a married woman at my age.  I also have very high standards for my behavior typically and I'm struggling with the shame after having developed a secret social/creative life centered around this crush.  

I don't want to hurt my husband.  Our relationship is good and I love him.

604,"So this is probably just another generic ""cry for help"" post, but I'm going to throw it out anyway, partly because I've been struggling with it for a few years now. 

I graduated high school 6 years ago. In high school, I always got good grades and was in almost every AP/college course I could take but I put in zero effort. My tests scores were shit because I never studied but my grades were good because we had so much homework that it offset any bad test scores. Boy was I not prepared for college. First semester I fell into academic probation. I stopped going to class and started missing assignments. I then changed majors and that is when it spiraled out of control. I did poorly for another year and that's when I looked for other ways out. I decided to transfer schools. The school I was transferring to wouldn't take any classes I had actually passed for anything other than GenEd so I literally flunked out of those classes and just hung out on campus for the duration of the semester. 

I now owe $30,000 in student loans with a ridiculous interest rate. I fucked myself over hard. I started school online but missed the deadline for the current semester so I had to wait a semester. This meant that I had used up my grace period on my student loans. I spent 6 months at this school and hated it. It was all group work and I really just didn't want to do the work. I found another school and spent a year taking classes online. The entire time I kept telling myself I would get it done and be done with school but I kept fucking up. ""I'll just do it later"" was becoming my mantra. 

After a few months at the next school, I realized that it would take 2 more years to finish my degree. I didn't want to wait that long so I looked for alternative options. I found a school that I could finish a degree program in a year, especially since I was able to transfer a third of the program in credits. It wasn't the degree program I wanted exactly but I would have a degree and that's what was important. 

But I've started fucking up again. The first class consisted of 4 small papers (4-5 pages) and I could do it at my own pace. Something I easily could do in a week. 11 weeks later, it's 7pm and I'm trying to do 3 of the papers before the course closes at midnight. I finish 2 of them and am about to start the fourth when I see there's also a 90 question assessment that has to be done. I managed to finish that but couldn't do the final paper. 12 weeks gone and nothing to show for it. I should have been able to do 3-4 classes in that time period but I didn't. 

My home life consists of me living with my parents who go from criticizing me about not being done with school for an hour and then will go a week without even mentioning it. They want me out of the house and I definitely don't want to be here, but between paying for school, for loans, and my car, I can't afford an apartment. I don't even know what I want to do with my life, at all. I work full time and I keep telling myself that it'll get better if I just have a degree but I'm starting to question that. I really have no idea what to do and I'm beginning to feel like my parents were right and I'm never going to finish. A degree doesn't magically change your life and it's something weighing on my mind every day. I know I need to do the work and I'm screwing myself over by not doing it but I can't find the motivation. The whole ""just do it to be done with it"" bit doesn't work. It isn't until I have no way out that I start trying.

When I call the next day, someone picks up and tells me the manager left and to call the next day at another specific time. It's Saturday at that point and I call at the allotted time. He tells me that he was pushing me back to next week (likely August 5th if the same thing doesn't happen) and that he would call me himself, but I haven't heard back from him at all, and it's nearing the end of the week. If I don't hear back, should I call myself? Should I just assume that they made a mistake hiring me or something and go back to looking for jobs?

612,"So, I’ve been friends with this guy and his family for years now, but their way of life is very angering and honestly I can see them having issues down the road if they don’t get help. So I’m going to give as many details as I can so I can get advice to help them without angering them.

My friend: He is lazy. He lives with his parents unconditionally, but they don’t ask him to help with anything because he rarely actually does help, he wants them to leave him alone so he can do whatever he wants.(He is an adult) 

His father: I would classify him as a drunk. He leaves mostly everything around the house his wife and my friend to take care of because “I work hard all day.” And he drinks Fireball all evening, even on weekends. Then we he is drunk, he makes everyone that talks to him feel insignificant. I mentioned to him that I have back problems that doctors can’t figure out and he said “Oh, no no, you don’t have problems, I have problems. You’re young you shouldn’t be having any issues” Plus, when he goes to bed, it’s like he can even hear the quietest whisper because he’ll come barging into his son’s room yelling at everyone to “Shut the fuck up so I can sleep” and sometimes he’ll say “You better shut the fuck up or I’m grabbing my .38” to which my friend just bitches back and shrugs it off because it’s an empty threat. (I have told my friend that it doesn’t matter, that could still get him in massive problems)

His mother: Does everything around the house, cooks, cleans, laundry, everything. And just let’s her husband and som walk all over her. Then when she goes out to see her mother or go gambling with her family, she gets bitched at for leaving. Not to mention she will go and buy things often to better the house in some way which then gets her bitched at because when they end up missing a bill payment, it’s her fault. (Because her husband doesn’t like doing things over the phone, especially when he’s drunk. He’ll yell and bitch at the operators)

620,"We were just starting building a deep friendship and I rushed things, I'm 18 and he's 32 were both gay. We met on a dating site last year, said we liked each other as friends but things didn't work out. We didn't even got to meet. 

This year we reconnected at University through email and he actually remembered me and he was so nice and was glad to hear from me and that I took interest in his doctoral work he gave me his private email address and encouraged me to consider studying the subject as it seemed like I have a lot of interest for it since I also said I attended lectures and researched the terms that were discussed in the lectures on my own. 

He wanted to stay in touch and to potentially giving me advice since he is a PhD student in that field, I didn't even asked for it I just wanted to know about his research and it was never about my own benefit. I started seeing him as a mentor because he made me feel like I could achieve anything in this world when I actually felt so out of place.

He doesn't know me very well but was very caring in the beginning, after some time I started rushing things and feeling impatient because I always thought I said something wrong and I was worried he would stop talking to me so I tried to fix everything but made it worse. He then started being more distant and his responses were getting shorter. I sent many emails asking for clarification, but he probably didn't felt ready to talk again. This behavior is understandable I assume, because he still doesn't know me very well and probably felt uneasy and wanted to talk on his own terms perhaps? 

He didn't say anything before about that I should wait or that I should stop contacting him he was just silent. Only one time when we coincidentally saw each other in person I approached him and he said it's too much he can't handle it and I should have listened to that. I continued sending him emails because I wanted to fix everything and even asked if we should set boundaries because I felt so confused about the silence. But then a week later after all that, I receive a simple happy birthday email at 6:48am but still silence when I said thank you and asked about how things are between us. 

Now I crossed a line by calling him to his work because I'm so stupid I can't be patient. I tried telling myself that this is not a good idea, but I still did it. He works at the European Commission (which he told me about) and he has been working there for only 2 months which I assume is a critical time when starting a new job and I shouldn't have done this. He probably takes his work very seriously and I feel so remorseful. I didn't pull anyone else into this. Not his colleagues, not his boss even thinking about it makes me feel sick to my stomach. 

30 minutes later I get an email and he said I need to stop contacting him immediately, what I did is inexcusable and he said he will be consider calling the police for harassment if I tried calling again. He said from now on all his emails will be going directly into trash. He said wish you the best - just please stop contacting me and he said goodbye at the end. He didn't even said my name, he said just Hi and wrote all of this. 

The guilt I feel currently is indescribable, I do not know what to do. I can't sleep, can't eat. Now he clearly stated for the first time I should stop contacting him and I will follow through with that. 

I want to apologize some day in the future years since I probably caused a lot of emotional distress for him and he may want to have some closure and heal. 

I already seeked a therapist because I feel there's something wrong with me and that something happened in my childhood that is causing this attention and validation seeking behavior. I think I was neglected as a child. My mom was a single parent and works a lot and I grew up without a father and no role models. I never did anything like that ever in my life. I feel incredibly mad and I want to grow. 

I want him to find peace and I will do that by leaving him alone. What can I do? Other than trying to be a better person? 

He had encouraged me to study economics and if this actually happens, I will always be reminded of that experience my whole career. He basically told me what I should do with my life when I didn't know and there will be always this connection to him. 

He's an economist, he is so interesting. He studied at Harvard went to LSE, worked at the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for reconstruction and development and he had a research visit at Berkley and was a researcher at Dartmouth College and so much more it's unbelievable, he did everything while being an EU Citizen. 

I'm not that driven and I never will be. He seems so confident and relaxed and he seems like he has a purpose in life. 

I'm the complete opposite. I don't know how he got this. I don't want to eat anymore because I just feel so mad at myself. This will haunt me for a life time and I don't want to breathe anymore. This was my first time feeling anything for someone. This rejection hurts so deeply and I don't want to be on this world anymore. I hope I won't get judged.",01Aug2019,0

630,"I'm sorry if I break any rules but this just happened today. I have no idea what to do and that's why I'm here today.

Introduction:

 I come from a family of Vietnamese traditions and culture. My mom and my grandmom lived in Vietnam most of their lives before moving here. They had the chance because my Mom was the daughter of a US soldier. 

My Mom and her mother (Grandmom) have never been that great on terms lately. My mom was the obviously less loved compared to her sister. At a young age, my mom was the one who stayed at home and did all the heavy work to keep the house clean and functional. This involved her taking care of her sister and any of her mom's parents or etc.  I was told my grandmom never did anything for her. She neglected my mom pretty much most of her life and has yet still controlled it. Despite all this, my mom still loved her.

Now my mom supports my family as a stay-at-home mother. The family is 5 kids and her own mom (My Dad basically works 24/7). My mom does the majority of the cooking and cleaning for everyone. My mom is incredibly weak, she has asthma and low blood pressure.

Yet while my mother pushes forward, my grandmom virtually does... nothing. She has the pickiest of pallets making my mother cook separate food for her. After she eats she either works (Hotel maid) or watches drama on her iPad. Even though the kids and I know she favors our aunt, she refuses to live with them because ""she doesn't want to bother them"". Even though my aunt agrees and it will reduce the workload of my mother/father.

What happened:

I came home from school today to notice my mom was extra tired and sluggish. I noticed it for about 30mins and after I finished eating I asked her what happened. The Conversation goes like this:

Me: "" What do you look so sad, Mom? "" 

Mom: "" If I told you, you would ask why did I tell you ""

Me: "" It's okay, just say it Mom ""

Mom: "" When your Grandmother was at work, she was talking to her co-workers and friends about me. Earlier, your grandmother's boyfriend came over today and heard what they were talking about. He told me that your grandmother was raped. Which I resulted from. 

After:

My brain was taking time to adjust to the words my mother told me. How can she hide that from my mother for so long? This made my mom and I realize that this was probably why she was omitted and uncared for. I stood there thinking about what should I do and I told my mom that I wanted so badly to finally confront her about this and yell at her. How dare she treat my mother like that when my mom was almost always suffering. How dare she know that and treat my mother as a second class child. How dare she not tell my mom straight up and instead have to find out through a 3rd party. 

My mother does not want me to confront her. Cause that will get my Grandmom's boyfriend in trouble. She said she rather have fewer people ""suffer"" or get in trouble. Only I and my aunt know about this (excluding the co-workers).

I told her my mom that my grandmom isn't my grandmom anymore. I am not going to treat her as such nor look at her as such. 

Yet while I say that, I don't know if that is the best course of action. I don't know what to do. Any advice would help. Thanks guys",01Aug2019,1

640,"TL:DR Father-in-law won’t acknowledge abuse. Is it time to give up?

My husband’s father snooped and found texts that he wrote about his abuse and anger about his abuser(his father). 

My father-in-law is a narcissist and a lawyer and wants to debate, challenge and justify his actions. However, he also expresses his love and desire to resolve this pain.

My husband is mortified that his father found these texts and wants to patch things up, but can’t deal with his father’s arguments.

I am mediating, trying to protect my husband from further verbal abuse, but also trying to help my father-in-law understand the suffering his son is experiencing.

My husband has written what he would like to hear from his parents:
A. Our treatment of our son has been at times selfish and self-centered. 
B. Our insensitivity to (1) the harm we did to him and to (2) his resulting suffering is beyond obliviousness- it is cruel and re-traumatizing.
C. On some levels we do not care that we have negatively impacted him and his life, because we mostly care about whether or not and to what extent he says that he loves and forgives us. 

His mom has agreed to the above, but his father will only agree to the first item. I have gone back and forth 6 times and he is not willing to budge. I could get specific and spell out incidents of abuse that prove these statements are accurate, but then I risk narcissistic injury and he will most likely side-step me and go after my husband.

Without his father’s acknowledgement of his abuse and without accepting the above statements, my husband can’t move forward.

Do you think I should keep pushing my father-in-law to agree to the statements? Do you think I should confront my father-in-law with details of his abuse? 
Do you think I should give him an ultimatum, that if he won’t find a way to agree to the statements, we are done talking?",01Aug2019,2

I live in a beaten up trailer home that has five people in it (soon to be 4 who knows) and my Mother is (to me and my older sister; who doesn't live with us anymore) kinda crazy, she is constantly convinced that I (17M) will scratch and break her things despite me denying it 24/7, she will berate me for stuff that I didn't do, and she will call me a ""lazy bastard"" just because the only thing I do is the dishes. This causes me emotional distress and makes me angry since I can't do anything about it, I don't have a car yet nor a license, not even a damn job (Big sis is helping get those things) and the only place I can stay at is my sister's (but I don't go there because she has a hard enough time with her job and bills with her apartment) overall my mother causes me distress from her accusing me of stuff that I never did, this makes it worse because I had a traumatic childhood (Father abused my Mother and he sexually abused me) and I will break down sometimes or just start hurting myself (Punchings things, I don't cut, couldn't even if I wanted to) 

Then there is her ""Boyfriend"" (I put quotations because she keeps saying ""oh I'll get rid of him"") her boyfriend while being a overall nice person.....is frankly a idiot. He burns our trash because my Mom doesn't have any sense to pay for a trash service and then the fumes go all throughout the neighborhood and he seems to not realize **that it's fucking chemicals he's releasing into the air** I've told him to stop it, my Mother has told him, he still does it.....and my Mother is partially to blame, she said she would break up with him but she didn't and now I'm breathing it in and my sisters (2 young ones) are breathing it in too. He doesn't contribute besides  on doing some chores and has shown a really bad anger problem in the past, honestly I just don't feel safe at all when he's here.

What am I supposed to do? Call the police on my own Mother and her Boyfriend because they're burning trash that creates fumes? My mom obviously doesn't care because she hasn't done a single thing about it other than tell him to not do it, after that she just gave up. Am I just supposed to leave and live with my sister till school starts again? I don't understand, and the fumes make it worse because I have 2 dogs and one just recently had babies.

I feel like I just lost everything I don't feel like a failure because I know that the courses are easy with the right mindset and I had no academic problem regarding them.  


Anyways, I'm most likely gonna get kicked out my university because of this and after some research, no university will accept me with failing grades, so I guess an academic education is not an option anymore.  


I feel lost and hopeless, It's my fault and I blame myself every second for it , but it ain't fair that a bad year like this would result in my failure in life ..  


I'll use any advice I can get in this situation .

646,"Hey, everyone. This is a bit of doozy.

I (22f) had a Lyft driver who picked me up from my house one Friday. She had signs on the backs of her car headrests that said things like ""no changing clothes,"" ""no make up,"" &amp; ""no outside liquids but water."" which is totally fine, but also 

""no hacking phones. if i see anyone hacking mine or anyones phone during the drive, i will report you to not only lyft but to homeland security &amp; other government agencies."" 

I think to myself weird, but whatever. I just want to get to my destination. 

The driver is an older black woman &amp; she makes conversation with me. I can tell this woman is a very paranoid person from how she talks about her previous experiences with Lyft. She felt like the passenger she was going to pick up before me was trying to kill her. We have some reservoirs for rain water near my house &amp; she commented that the city needed to take better care of them in case people were dumping bodies in there. That has never really happened in our city as far as I know of. Her talk of death makes me uncomfortable but I try to stay quiet &amp; not really engage her. 

Here is where things start to fall apart. Her phone starts to act slow, the gps is giving her weird directions. She straight up asks ""are you hacking my phone?"" I'm a very anxious person &amp; I don't handle confrontation well so I ignore it. Her phone is still giving her issues, &amp; she keeps on looking back at me. 

Finally she points at her sign (""no hacking"") &amp; asks me if I've read it. I'm already on edge so I ask her if she's accusing me of something. 

""Well, my phone only started acting slow when you got in."" 

Ok?? I tell her I literally don't know her &amp; why would I want anything to do with her information?? 

She almost gets into an accident while accusing me because she keeps on turning around to face me instead of the road. At this point, I ask to get out. I'm really scared &amp; uncomfortable &amp; I don't want to be around her anymore. She pulls over cursing at me to get out but won't unlock the door to let me out. I hit the door &amp; yelled at her until she finally unlocks it. I call her crazy &amp; slam it. She rolls down her window to call me a bitch. 

I call my brother to pick me up. It takes him a while to get there &amp; she is still pulled over the whole time I'm waiting, making a report on ME to Lyft. My brother comes, we take some pictures of her car &amp; the signs. This upsets her &amp; she tries to take pictures of my brothers car, but we speed off. 

I contacted Lyft to report her. I found out she had reported me to Lyft for using a derogatory term towards her during our ride &amp; for that reason, they won't issue me a refund. I'm a college student, I would really like my money back after one their drivers endangered my life, threatened to report me homeland security, insulted me, &amp; wouldn't let me out of her car until she was done. 

I'm waiting for a representative to contact me about this but until then, are there any tips that can help me get my money back?

Thanks in advance to any insight.",01Aug2019,504

653,"I got a call at the restaurant from some guy wanting the owner's phone number or name. We're a family restaurant, and the owners are my parents, however they hate talking with solicitators and other advertisers so I will just say they are out and I can't give numbers or names. This guy was very pushy and demanding that he needed their number and he needed it today for permission to update our menu online or something? And when I asked which company he worked for, he legit said 'all of them' (?????) and that he worked for the internet. I assume search engines cause then he tried to scare me by saying that our restaurant didn't show up when he searched very very specific foods. (We're a chinese restaurant, and he tried to search eggrolls [city]) Saying things like we're losing customers because of this, our menu is wrong. We only really care about our menu in two place, google (a picture pdf) and beyond (order online), which we keep updated. Other than that, there's not much control we have/care about. Doordash took our menu without permission, so I don't understand why he demanded that he needed permission to 'update' our stuff.

This all seemed very suspicious to me and when I told dad after the call, dad just said to ignore it.

So is this guy legit or just trying to use scare tactics to get something? We're a very small restaurant, so a lot of advertising and stuff we ignore, cause we just get local regulars. And it's not like we don't get new customers at all, I think we are doing completely fine considering how small we are.",01Aug2019,1

I am not familiar with the other friends that are invited and I really wouldn’t feel comfortable in a bar setting alone.

662,"I don't know what other subreddit to post this to as most medical subreddits highly advise against these types of post. I am NOT looking for a diagnosis, or specific treatment. I am frustrated, in pain, and need some guidance.


I've had mild scoliosis since my adolescent years. I acknowledge it's nothing serious that needs immediate treatment, but it does effect daily functions and comfort. I feel like I am never taken seriously in PT for it though. No my curve isn't greater than 25 degrees, but my back gets sore and stiff from everyday activities. My scoliosis prevents me from doing certain back exercises/stretches properly. The times I have tried to get PT for it I have just want guidance from a trained professional with these exercises, but I'm shrugged off like it shouldn't be a big deal, or I shouldn't be making a fuss.


Today was the tipping point. I did something to my back Saturday night. I wasn't doing anything strenuous; it just decided to call it quits. I've been unable to stand up straight (and in severe pain) until Wednesday, where I saw a chiropractor. He said I came in walking in at a 30 degree angle. He was able to get me walking up straight, but after a 1-2 hours I was starting to hunch back over and it was SORE. I had my first PT visit today. I could immediately tell the therapist didn't take my pain or the situation seriously. He had me do some exercises. Some were okay, and some of that stuff felt like it made things worse (like him pushing on my back in certain places). The last straw was when he tried to have me lean against a wall and move my hips to it. I was crying from the pain. He told me to sit down, and the moment I tried to move I could barely think straight. He felt my back and said it was extremely tense, so he would get an electric stimulation thing. A 45 minute initial appointment turned into an almost two hour appointment, because I feel like he was wrongfully pushing my boundaries. I spoke up each time it hurt. Halfway through the appointment he mentioned that I probably have a slipped disc but ""I probably already knew that."" It's like he assumed I already knew what was wrong. I'm coming to him to figure out the problem! I don't know what a fucking slipped disc feels like, and the chiropractor said nothing about one.


I have other goals I'd like to work on with PT, but being able to stand, sit and lay down without being in pain is my priority right now. But I am so demoralized and hurt from this visit, and I'm not sure if my expectations are in order. I had to literally burst out in tears from trying to move to feel like I was being taken seriously. Then his whole attitude seemed to change after the electric stimulation was done.


Are my expectations from PT awry? Should I be looking at a different type of therapy? If no, how can I better convey my needs to the physical therapist? I'm at a healthy weight/BMI for my height. I've been lightly working out since March, and had been contemplating seeing a physical therapist about some stretches/exercises for my scoliosis. Because it does prevent me from doing some exercises/stretches properly, or at all. I have also been struggling with getting my glute muscles to wake up, and hoped they could point me in the right direction for that too. I feel so lost, and I am so frustrated. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",01Aug2019,1

Or I can move to Wisconsin which has the worst opportunities and the best support system.

He’s twacked out all the time, and constantly asking people or my mom for money.  He also only wears tattered clothing and shoes despite having clean clothes at home.

Shit I don’t know. I want to take them out but I’m scared he’ll get out of hand or hurt himself. 
When we go out to eat he’ll probably order a beer and I don’t want to enable him. But I don’t want him to be miserable I know going cold turkey can do even more damage.

691,"So a member of my family seems a little out of control recently. He is under 18, but was arrested a few months ago for throwing a bottle of water at my Grandad. He only escaped prosecution as the charges were dropped given that my Grandad very sadly passed away recently due to natural causes.

My grandparents (particularly my nana) have raised him and absolutely spoilt him - he has always has the best, and everything he wanted.

However, despite my grandad’s recent passing, he still treats my nana appallingly. He calls her a whore and tells her repeatedly to fuck off is she asks him to tidy his room. He is physically aggressive and has smashed tables, windows and doors at my grandparents house. 

He didn’t speak to my Grandad for over a year before he died after he smashed a window at his house with a stone. 

Is there anything that I can say to him that will try to get him to stop getting so angry? 

This morning, my nana had a breakdown and was on the point of tears with it all. He doesn’t really leave the house and spends much of his time on the internet - often until 5am and then sleeping throughout the day until 4pm. He’s not really even leaving the house anymore, despite consistent encouragement from family members.

Family members have booked GP appointments for him, but he won’t go or engage. I am not sure if he is going through genuine depression, or is his behaviour just abusive? He was taken to A and E before during a breakdown (where he smashed a table), however, he professed that he was fine when services tried to follow up on things. 

Is there anything that can be said to him before he either gets himself into serious criminal trouble, or pushes my nana to a breakdown?",01Aug2019,1
693,"I'm really scared to post this. I haven't shared this with anyone in my life, I don't know how to. Many LGBT people struggle with hiding their identity and finding out who they truly are- and I do not want to discredit that AT ALL. Many of my friends are LGBT+, I love them but I don't know how to tell them- or my family, that I'm not actually Bi/Pan after being out for years. It's a part of my identity at this point- but it isn't real. I feel horrible and I don't know how to set things straight. 

When I was about 13, I had a dream about kissing a girl. It felt very intimate and I figured it meant I was bi (or something similar), and I labeled myself so. After awhile I came out to my family and a few friends, who took it relatively well. (I never came out to my extended family as many of them are insanely homophobic and set in their ways). I always felt,, a little off about it. Deep down I wasn't sure if that was how I truly felt, but I was already out.  In high school I got a girlfriend (\*technically gender fluid, main pronouns were female tho). We got a little intimate- kissing was fun. I genuinely enjoyed kissing her. I don't know if it was because it was her (I did like her a lot) or if it was because I'd never made out with anyone before that, (to this day I've still never made out with a guy tho). Lately I've been realizing that I don't have the same reaction when I see a pretty girl as when I see a cute guy. (I've ALWAYS been awkward around guys- probably part of the reason I came out as bi/pan. I'm more comfortable around girls and dating them would be easier.)  

I'm honestly really confused. I have this label that doesn't feel right, and I don't know how to talk about it and tell people that I may have mislabeled myself, or even that I'm just confused. I sssuuCK at dating, so experimenting would be kinda hard...  I've only been in like 2 relationships in my life, (both lasted less than 3 months) and I'm a virgin. (not sure if that info's necessary but... more context???)

I went on a date with a girl a few months ago, and I remember just feeling uncomfortable,  it was just awkward. My dates with guys have gone the same though. (Honestly I'm just bad at opening up- &amp; being comfortable around strangers.) 

I don't know what to do or who to talk to. I'm confused, and I don't know who to talk to because as far as everyone I know is concerned, I have myself figured out. I also don't have many close friends (literally only one if we're being honest). 

I've never posted on Reddit before. I don't know if this is the right place to post this- or if I've shared too much information about myself, or anything really.. I also can't find any instances ANYWHERE of someone thinking they're LGBT+ and realizing later that they're not (which might be the case for me??? Idk.) 

How can I figure out for sure whether or not I like girls or not?? How do I go about talking to my family and friends about it, if it turns out that I actually am straight? ((How can I go on dates and meet people without being so awkward and uncomfortable??)  Any advice is appreciated.",01Aug2019,1
694,"TL;DR I’m planning to stop cold turkey tomorrow, any advice?

I used to be on 55+ units per day, around   400 units per week. I started a cocaine addiction on top, went to rehab and stopped it all.

I then went home and instantly relapsed on alcohol and cocaine and ended up in hospital for an emergency detox.

I then stopped for two days and reset but relapsed ok alcohol again! 

Luckily haven’t gone back to cocaine but I’m drinking again and it’s gone up to about 35+ units per day 

It was horrible and shit and I was fairly okay but normally sleeping most of the day as I had no job.

Now I have a new very very very good job, which amazingly I managed to secure even though I’m drinking 200 plus per week, but actually starting the job and not being able to drink during the day, I’ve started drinking more. My head feels like it’s exploding all the time and I feel sick all the time and I feel like I’m just going to drop dead most of the time. I feel so horrible all the time is unreal.

So my plan is to drink tomorrow to get through work without the severe withdrawals and then go cold turkey on Saturday - I’ll have 2 days to get over the withdraws before going back on Monday. My partner said she will support and make sure I’m safe, but is there any tips?

We were both working 70 hours and 7 days a week previously but it was too much on both of us. 

Well both of us love sex and we have a lot of it. The idea popped into our heads that we could potentially do cam shows. It would be immediate money, and would be rather easy. The problem is, I’m a little more worried about it than she is. 

I know that you can set regional filters to block out your local area, or even your country, but I know that all these cam shows get recorded and post on sites as well as google images. I’m a bit afraid that it will come back to haunt us in the future.

During 2019 for the past 6 months I lost the well to live for no reason I will try to say to you what I have and what I don't. 

Everyday I wake up 6:30AM for work, my works environment really good I meet new people everyday male and female. I finish work at 5:00PM, usually much earlier because I work based on tasks been given to me. 

I go back home I have everything I want and I need at my room, Gaming PC TV Consoles anything you could imagine. My room well organized and clean and comfortable. I stay at my room almost all night , sometimes I go check the family mom and dad my little sister and brother.

Anyway I have projects to make me busy, I have a car which I'm building to become 600HP this car is a 2006 Subaru Impreza. I stopped working on it cuz I don't feel the excitement anymore. also for gaming movies TV series""Netflix"" or whatever. 

As of social life, I have too many different friends of different ages and locations and nationalities. The good and the bad I don't really care because I'm too humbled and high mannered with them. They respect me back. 

As of relationship. None, I used to 10 years ago and I'm looking to have one , the problem is that I'm too specific with girls I have to accept her to open and be ready to have relationship with a girl. The look, the smell the color the hair the shape the age the state of mind. Too specific taste too hard to find. 

What I see my self ? :
I'm hard to be understood. I talk with no emotions and only honest I don't know how to lie. I'm a bit psycho really weird and creep but good looking clean and neat. Too smart can make the others get hurt because I only say facts, So specific with time and choices, decisions. I see things at night I talk to things at night while asleep, I hear voices in my head all the time since I was 5 years old. I see alot of dejvus and know what will happen to me in the near future. I remember a life that I never lived. I dream of two dreams since I was a kid after an incident happened to me when I was 4 years old "" Yes I have a strong memory"" I don't empathy because I see life as logic sense it was made like this to be like what it made to be.  

The Incident: 

I was playing under my bed with my Rex ""Toy story"" it was 2AM there was a dim red light inside the room for me to see at night, I fell asleep I woke up on the sound of the analog clock it was very sharp Tik Tok. I went out to have a leak, So I went outside all alone at night passing the living room I felt something behind me and saw a glowing fire on the walls then I looked behind me to see him the devil. I woke up at the same place in the morning. like nothing happened. a 4 year old kid seeing this things as if I believe in them that time as if I can comprehend that the devil is real ! anyway since then I see two dreams. 

The first dream. 

It's just a wall really ancient one. I see it in in normal dreams. Last time I was with my family going to check out a house to buy, I went inside the house it was cozy and nice big house. I felt the same feeling that I felt the time I saw the devil when I was 4 years old, anyway I followed this feeling it is like noises and like my body going to explode. I went inside a room and saw a wall different than the others, I pushed it to open it and there it is the wall full of scripts that I don't understand and everytime I see it I remember things that I can't comprehend. 

The second dream.

The tree of life as simple as that. 

Anyway now I want to know what is going on, I don't feel a thing no sadness no happiness no excitement I feel nothing. Like I'm in limbo or lost alone in the space. For no reason I even wnted to buy a new car last year I was excited but this year I changed my mind because I don't know ! I tried everything drugs drinks all the same. I buy stuff maybe I will feel a change but after a day or two I feel the same. I don't have a plan or a goal or any will to make one. Many people told me go to psychiatrist I said no. I don't trust them and I have no problem to say !

710,"Hello, I don’t have anyone to turn to but the strangers of the internet, so I appreciate any help/advice received. I don’t really know if this belongs here but I’ll try to maintain as much brevity as I can.

Some contextual details: I am in my clinical years of medical school, living in a very conservative society, if not one of the most conservative in the world. This incident happened early this year. The surgeon in question is of the same nationality as me. He hasn’t any track record of doing things like this. He’s a highly qualified, very serious individual. The overly 'ethical' and stringent one... In my country, he’s somewhat famous, doing interviews all the time, awards, getting rave reviews online, etc. Hell, a lot of the students have a crush on him.

I’d only interacted with him a handful of times over the last two years. I didn’t think he knew my name but I was wrong! I am a very serious student, and honestly I work hard and make no room for fripperies. I say this because other students who are his 'fans' always try to get his attention.

To some of you this may seem an overreaction when people suffer from much worse on the daily... But this was a major shock for me.

The story: 

It was the final exam of my surgery rotation (OSCE) and I was in the last station before the exam ended. It was a mannequin I was examining (all other stations had simulated patients) and I finished with about a minute to go before the bell would ring. I sat down to wait, then, out of nowhere: ""you’ve gained weight.” And added after I looked at him in stunned silence, “last year your body wasn’t like this.” 

I said something along the lines of, “I didn’t know you noticed...?” To which he looks me directly in the eye, smiles smugly and says, “you should take care of yourself. A girl like you... should always take care of herself.” And a wink. I mumbled something about stress at uni, then the bell rang and left. I walked out feeling completely numb.

I don’t know how he noticed... At that time I had only gained a few kilograms and hadn’t received comments from even my family. I hadn’t had to buy bigger clothes or anything. I couldn’t make a complaint because it was my word against his. No cameras to pick up on the conversation. I had no proof. A good number of people know but didn’t have anything to say. I tried to push it from my mind and move on. I haven’t seen that surgeon since that incident. 

The problem is this: for the past month or two, he’s been creeping back up into my psyche, I see him everywhere I look, he plays on my mind, the fixed stares, elevator eyes... I have so many questions, thoughts keep recurring, I even dreamt about him once or twice.

Does anyone have any perspective for me? Advice? Comments? Clarity? Am I just an over dramatic idiot that needs to get a life?

I am considering living in an apartment that is above a bar. The upside is that the apartment is extremely close to campus being only a 1-2 minute walk from some classes. Also, the rent is fair at $750 for a 400 square foot one bedroom apartment (electric and internet not included). The building itself has 3 floors, so I presume that I can choose either the second or third floor (I'm in the process of verifying this).  

The only thing that is concerning is the environment around the bar. I've heard that areas around bars often gets loud and smelly due to alcohol and smoke which may get annoying and make it hard to sleep from time to time.

Last night, me and my boyfriend got into a little argument. He said something that hurt me. When I tried to talk to him about why it hurt, he told me that I get “upset over stupid, little shit”. 

It hurt really bad because we’ve had these problems before and talked about. He promised that he would be considerate of my feelings, and gentle with me..
I immediately started crying on the phone, and told him goodnight and hung up after he said that. 

This morning, I went to work. I didn’t text my usually good morning. I guess I just needed time to think. This whole situation had been on my mind all day. 
He finally sent me some words of apology, and felt bad for it. 

I decided to call him a little bit later. He asked me how my day was going. I told him the truth, that it was going bad.. he replied with a snooty “well what, you get robbed or something?” 

That reply hit my heart hard. I know I can’t be overreacting. After all of this, how could he be that snark with me? No words or comfort or anything.. I started crying again, and pretty much said goodbye, and hung up.

719,"Preface: Sorry for the long story, but I felt you needed all the details for good advice.

My wife's parents recently got divorced at the end of last year. It was completely unexpected for their 4 girls. They were all very saddened by this. To add a little back story, my wife's parents are 20 years apart, and her father is in his 70s. He is beginning to have health issues. In addition he does not have any retirement plan or 401k and their plan was for the mom to continue working while the dad collected social security. When the 4 girls found out about the divorce, my wife quickly jumped in and mentioned that the dad would likely need help and recommended that everyone begin to save money to help him when that time comes. 

Out of the 4 girls there is my wife, one who works multiple minimum wage jobs to make ends meet while living in a one bedroom apartment with her ex husband, another who is in an abusive relationship with a dead beat who smokes weed and can't keep a job (1 kid and 1 on the way), and one that is just getting out of college and starting her life. Clearly in this situation, my wife is going to be the only one who can really help. So she comes to me and asks my opinion. I told her that we could help her dad, but that he should come down and live with us. (We live in the Southern US they live in the Northern US)

Her dad agrees and states he wants to move down with us. We begin looking for a new home with an additional living space. We find a gorgeous home with a pool and the extra space. We honestly were not planning to move, but our previous house had appreciated, it helped her dad out, and it gave our son some personal 1 on 1 attention with his grandfather. The new home added about the same as the cost of child care (as you likely know is a considerable amount) so the plan was for him to stay home and watch our son during the day while we were at work. I personally flew up and met him and drove down in a Uhaul with all of his stuff. 

After 3 months of being here her dad comes to my wife and tells her that he is moving back. He put an offer in on a house and is having his other daughter and her 2 kids move in with him. In order to buy the house he put down 100% of the money he had in his savings from the sale of the previous house he owned with his ex wife. So just for recap no 401k, no retirement plan whatsoever, and now nothing in savings.

To add insult to injury he waited to tell us about it until he had already placed the offer and been approved for the loan. He also decided to tell us the morning before we were going to head out on vacation for a long weekend. To keep adding icing to the cake we later found out that the whole family knew except the youngest sister, and us. The mom was even the realtor in the whole process. 

My wife and I are livid at this point. We changed our lives to plan for his future and all we got was a slap in the face. Now we're going to be spending a lot more money on childcare + the added housing costs from the new home. We are blessed that we are able to afford it, but that money could have been used for other things or better yet saved for our son. Plus we are now having to change our son's childcare situation for a 3rd time. 

Now you're probably asking what advice do we need. I am trying to be supportive for my wife because I know how hard this is for her. I was an only child growing up and at the age of 19 I told my birth father to stop contacting me because he wasn't willing to be involved in my life. This is something I won't get into, but I believe I made the right choice with that decision. The trouble is I know that not everyone is like me. My wife is at the point right now where she wants to do the same thing to her entire family. She feels like not one person in her family had her back, and she feels betrayed. If I'm honest I 100% agree with her, and I'm absolutely pissed. I want nothing to do with her family. But I don't want to tell her that. I want her to make her own decisions about the subject. I have been telling her to make sure before she says anything that she is committed to her decision. I told her the last thing you want in this situation is to turn around and say something you don't mean. Even with all that she wants nothing to do with any of them. She wants her dad out of the house by the end of the month and she told her mom and sisters to never contact her again.

My questions are: 

Should I push my wife to forgive her parents or at least her mom since all she did was fail to tell her about her dad's master plan?

I'm worried about my wife needing help through this outside of me. Should I recommend her seeing a psychiatrist? 

What are your thoughts on this whole thing? Are we making too big of a deal out of the whole thing to begin with?",01Aug2019,1

721,"My sister is 26 and I'm 23F. We haven't really been on good terms for years now. 

She blames her anxiety on my older brother 31 due to things that he did when she was little... E.g. pretending to die in front of her when she was 3, when she was 23 he called her saying he was going to commit suicide when she turned up he assaulted her.

I've given her a lot of slack for the way she treats me because I know how bad it was for her (in her eyes) when she was younger.

My reason for this post is because I just cannot take it anymore. 3 months ago we had a mini house party and she started talking about him AGAIN when she was drunk, I asked her not to as we were having a good time and tbh I personally hate even hearing his name. Now, 3 months later, she's still punishing me for this and still not talking to me. She literally treats me like a dog and expects me to be kind to her in return. My mom has now realised how she behaves towards me so she doesn't stick up for her when she cries to her about me, because she can't use my mom she is now going to my dad. My dad has started having a go at me because she keeps crying to him. I literally don't know what to do, I can't take her anymore. I've tried being reasonable with her, I've tried being nice to her and I've tried acting like she does to me back. However I always feel like she wins and I'm the one left upset. I'm sorry about the post but I'm just so angry right now, she's just done the same again, cried to my dad, my dad has had a go at me. I just don't know what to do.

Edit: she's currently running around the house happy because she knows she has been successful in getting my dad to have a go at me. She hasn't left her room for about 2 weeks to interact with anyone.",01Aug2019,1

When I asked the HR representative over the phone for more information they informed they couldn't release anything and I am unable to appeal.

I focused on calming down at the time, and just went back to sleep when I could. This morning, I searched up what I experienced and after, self-diagnosed it as a panic attack.

736,"Okay, so there’s quite a bit of context that goes into this situation. I’ll try to keep I️t short and summarized while also giving necessary details. 

I️ had primarily lived with my mom and stepdad for 15 years. In 2017, when I️ was 17, they got a divorce. I️ moved out with my mom and brother to an apartment. She didn’t work a good paying job so I️ helped pay rent every now and then, and starting paying for my own food, groceries, etc. The apartment lasted for a year and we moved to a duplex that didn’t last long. My mom couldn’t afford the duplex, and conveniently got married soon after, so she lives with her husband now. So that left me with no place to stay. While her and her husband don’t dislike me, they’ve said I️ can’t live with them. My biological dad was aware of the situation. 

This is beginning of 2019. So, I️ turned to my ex-stepdad and lived with him for a couple months only to figure out that he was not taking the divorce well, and was obviously not in any way mentally stable. After a solid month of him distracting me from my college work with drunken breakdowns every night, I️ had had enough and didn’t feel comfortable living there anymore. My biological dad was aware of the situation. 

At this point I️t is February of 2019, and I️ had been dating my boyfriend for 8 months. Not long, I️ know. But knowing everything that was going on, my boyfriend’s mom invited me to stay with them for as long as I️ needed with no strings attached. I️ was reluctant at first and didn’t take her up on the offer, but eventually I️t seemed to be the better option. I️ lived with them from March 2019 to May 2019. My biological dad didn’t know I️ was living with my boyfriend. 

In may I️ stopped showing up to school and ultimately failed all of my classes for the semester. I️ was working 5 days a week, saving up for a place to stay. I️ was overwhelmed and disappointed with myself. I️ called my dad and told him I️ was living with my boyfriend and that I️ had failed college. As I️ knew he would, he told me that I️t was a horrible idea and that I️ needed to get out. His main concern was that I️ would get pregnant, but I️ can’t get pregnant for medical reasons. 

For context, my biological dad has had a presence in my life but I️ never lived with him, and only stayed with him for weekends. He moved to Georgia in 2014, and in the years following I️ only saw him maybe 5 times a year. A couple of those visits we had a big fight that turned into a screaming match and had to be cut short. So my relationship with him hasn’t been very strong in the years leading up to the situation I️m in now. However, he has given me some monetary support, he has paid for my phone bills and has let me borrow his car since 2017.  

He has always been very very assertive, and in my opinion pretty manipulative. I️ didn’t want to go to college right out of high school given my unstable situation and I️ wasn’t mentally ready for that responsibility+working a job. But he told me I️ would become nothing in the world, and if I️ did not go immediately after high school he would take back his car and phone. I️ didn’t have the money to replace those necessities so I️ went to school and failed. I️’m not putting the blame of me failing school on my dad, but I️ feel as if I️ was pushed into college too early. 

Having said all of that, he used the same old tactics of threatening to take back his things if I️ didn’t move down to Georgia to live with him. He just got established and bought a new house, so he has room for me and he promised he would pay for me to go back to college, along with my food until I️ got another job. 

I️ didn’t want to leave my boyfriend and his family, as they have been the most supportive people in my live throughout the past year. They gave me a roof over my head and talked me off of many many ledges without demanding anything from me. I️ have never experienced unconditional kindness and support like that from anyone. But, I️ said yes to my dad’s offer and moved down the Georgia, hoping that things would be better if I️ took a risk and went against my gut feeling. 

A few weeks into living here in Georgia I️ already hated I️t. I’m living with my dad, stepmom and two siblings under 8 years old, people I️ have never interacted with for more than a weekend my entire life. In this time, I️ have decided I️ want to renovate an RV and live in I️t while I️ finish out college and work on my career. My dad has said I️ can’t park the rv on his land while I️ renovate I️t, but my boyfriend’s parents said I️ could use their land. Upon mentioning this arrangement to my dad he went berserk, saying I️ want to go back for “a boy” and that I️ will never be anything other than a housewife if I️ live with them while I️ renovate my RV. However, throughout this blowout he didn’t mention taking back his things or refusing to pay for my college. 

So here I️ am, a couple months into living here after I️ mentioned the RV. I️’m 19, a legal adult. I️ have $5k in savings, and I I’ll need more for the Reno. I️ don’t have a job yet, and I️ start online college next week with my dad promising to pay for I️t unconditionally. 

My plan right now is to finish a couple weeks of college to get an understanding of the workload I’ll be dealing with. After that I️ will go through with my plan to renovate an RV that I️ found in my price range at my boyfriend’s house in TN. I️ plan on finishing college, and if my dad decides not to pay for I️t I️ will assume that debt. (Which isn’t that much). I️ don’t want anything to do with his car or phone so I️ will use the RV as transportation and a cricket phone until I️ can afford more reliable alternatives. 

This decision will almost definitely create a rift between my dad and I️, leaving me with no family members who genuinely care for me. I️ plan on moving out of my boyfriend’s house asap, in the event that we break up god forbid, and just because I️ don’t want to overstay my welcome. I️ want to be completely independent because at this point, everyone who I️ thought was there for me in my life has fucked me over or held shit above my head, and I️m tired of I️t. 

I️m looking for advice on this situation and what I️ should do because I️ want an unbiased opinion. I’ve tried to describe everything the best I️ can without any bias. I️ know I️ won’t be able to come back from this decision, so I️ just want a voice of reason to point out any mistakes I️ might be making before I️ really screw myself over on this. Thanks for reading, I️ know I️t was a long one. Feel free to ask for more info on anything. Thanks for your responses.

742,"So a little context: 

I'm a 25 year old woman who just bought my first house a couple months ago. I met my neighbors (names changed) on my left a few weeks ago: James, an 80-something year old man, his wife Mildred (60-something), and their son John (40ish maybe?) But they seemed to have younger family (grandkids?) over often. James was sweet, allowing me to use his post digger to fix my new fence, so I made them all some brownies as a ""thank you and I think this is what I'm supposed to do in this situation"" type gesture. James and Mildred invited me in and I talked with them for a long while and they seemed like genuinely kind people. 

James tells me about how he's going into a surgery to get the fluid drained from his lungs. I work in healthcare and see his fragility, and internally feel grim, but outwardly wish him luck and express that if there's any way I can help him or his household, let me know.

Today I found out that James passed away due to complications from his surgery. I don't know my neighbors well, but I once again said that if there's anything I can do to just ask. Mildred is an older woman, and while they seem to have a decent sized family, she seemed rather lonesome when I went to visit. I've had major losses over the last few years and grief makes me VERY uncomfortable, but I want to do whatever I can to help these people.

I feel like I need to do some sort of kindness by these people, because they're very sweet, and because I understand the hurt of loss... I'm just not certain what I can do? I have only spoken with them a handful of times... any advice?",01Aug2019,1
744,"I don't think I need to use a throwaway. The only person who'll see this post and know who it is is also a very important part in this discussion.

Anyway, onto the problem.

My parents want me to make a plan of action for the year ahead. I do have one, but I trust them so little to actually support it because while my education is a major part, it isn't the *primary* part. I am going into my senior year of high school as an 18 year old male.

I plan on doing half days of school, since I only need 3-4 more classes to graduate, then work release so I can do a part time job until 4, then go home, do chores, and drive to the next town to meet my girlfriend. On weekends, I would probably spend most of my day at her place.

School:
&gt; I need a 3.5 GPA this year to compensate for a bad sophomore year and average out at 3.0 Career. I think having a good 3.0 with my ACT will get me into college with enough scholarships to make my life not as stressful

&gt;&gt; My plan: Do my work during breakfast and lunch. Everything but essays will likely be easy enough to do then (I read fast, write fast, and don't need to apply the entirety of my attention to complete an assignment and do well). Take ASVAB and ACT again to see if I can improve or get consistent scores.

&gt;&gt; My parents' plan: All A's or no phone. School is primary focus and needs to be treated as a job. Sit at the table after school and complete all assignments. Everything else is secondary.

Money:

&gt; I want to get a part time job at a branch of a large office supply store, but any store with a good part time wage will be just fine. I work hard and enjoy work.

&gt;&gt; My plan: budget a certain amount of my money away for saving and investing. Do not touch investments or savings for years until I need to (car, house, emergency, etc.) What I have left, I will send to my girlfriend so doesn't have to stress herself out so much for work in college.

&gt;&gt; My parents have no comment on money, just that I need a job.

Life after high school:

&gt; Here is the part I am nervous. My dad doesn't want me to stay in the house at 19 without paying rent. I do plan on leaving the house shortly after graduation.

&gt;&gt; My plan: Move in with my girlfriend at college, go to college for Mechanical Engineering for 4 years, and find a decent job afterwards. Obviously not as fleshed out, but still important.

&gt;&gt; My parents' plan: Not mine. They do not like the idea of me being in the same house as my girlfriend already.

Explanation on parents' side and why it's not something I want to tell them: They do not like the idea of me having sex with her, more specifically. I understand where they're coming from, but the way they go about it has really destroyed my trust in them. Ever since I was 8, my dad told me that if he ever caught me sleeping with a girl, he'd use a dull knife to castrate me and keep me from having kids so early. If the topic of sex ever comes up, he gives me the side eye and inevitability asks if I am having sex. I always say no because I am still olive oil, and my girlfriend and I agreed to wait a while. He then says, all cheerily, ""Good! You know what I would have to do."" 

There is more to it, and you can ask about it if you like, but this post is long enough already.

My mother passed away in July of 2018 after I cared for her for a year while she was sick. (I put myself into detox so I could take care of her.) I did everything to distract myself for the last year and I hid my grief very well. The year anniversary of her death last month seemed more heart breaking than right after she passed. But I processed my feelings very well. I went through the pain and allowed it to pass naturally. I walked around my house randomly crying and talking to her but I didn’t judge myself for what I was feeling.

And i just moved to my own place and i feel very alone. I rarely see my family, maybe once every 3rd week. I just somehow have accepted this. I would say i have social anxiety. 

I've felt many times that i should get my head in the game and fix my grades, but i have a hard time motivating myself due to the fact that i don't find anything interesting besides playing computer games that i'm shit at or browsing forums, ytube etc. It's insane how many hours i´ve could have invested to something else but World of Warcraft that i'm still shit at. 

My goal is to graduate from University, but i have no idea what to study since i'm not good at anything. 

Thank you, and have a nice evening!!",01Aug2019,1
751,"Hi Reddit, as the title says, I'm at a loss for what to do, and could use some sort of direction to be pointed in. I know it's long but I did say it's my whole life. Throw away because of obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

To start, I am diagnosed with High Functioning Autism (not the best term but it tells what it is simply), and I definitely have the signs of both depression and anxiety, though I am not diagnosed with them. Just this post alone is making me sick to my stomach, as it scares the hell out of me since this would be the first time I've really talked about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently 19 years old living with my mom and 17 year old sister, doing very little other than playing video games all day long. I dropped out of high school in my last year because after 3 years I really couldn't deal with the schedule of waking up so early again, so I took the GED and passed. The plan after was to go to community college for 2 years after that, as my mom decided that the first 2 years in college for her kids would be on her dime. i started my first semester, which was a couple networking related classes, as well as an online class that had to do with getting a feel for college like or something. I've always been interested in doing something in relation to coding or computers, as I'm told that I'm very good with logic and math (I say ""I'm told"" because it doesn't really feel like that's been the case the past few years), but I found myself unable to complete the classes, failing both.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I couldn't complete the classes was because whenever I'd go to do the homework, I would be incapable of reading the text book. I could try to read through the same paragraph multiple times and not remember anything I wrote. I'm more of a hands on learner, because, for one reason or another, I have a pretty bad memory, and it requires such significant focus to complete a written task. It's kind of like I'm always on auto pilot, just doing things, and I tune in and out of being consciously aware I'm doing anything at all every once in a while. I don't know how to describe the ""auto pilot,"" but that's the best I've been able to come up with. As for the third class, the moment I saw that it required interaction with other people in the class (the first assignment being to introduce yourself on the message board) I freaked out and did nothing, so I got dropped from that class. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I had now dropped 3 classes, and I feel absolutely horrible for wasting the thousands of dollars that my mom had spent on them. This was back in May of last year, and since then I haven't expressed any intention of going back to college, because I don't want any more money spent on something I'm likely to waste again. 

&amp;#x200B;

After reading all this you may, and probably should, think therapy would be a good answer, and I would agree. However, one reason that's difficult is because I don't work. I would love to, but because of anxiety and depression I can never bring myself to actually apply, for fear of having a breakdown inside my mind but being unable to do anything about it. I did a summer program at my high school before where I worked 2 days a week for 2 hours, for about a month, and there was nothing worse than wanting to curl up into a ball and sob in the middle of stocking shelves at a Dollar Tree. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason I have difficulty is that, as much I know my mom wants to support me (she's letting me live with her indefinitely until I can work and move out, which is so much more than can be said of other parents of Autistic kids), she is also not someone I can really talk to about any of this. After dropping the 3 college classes, I wrote down a lot of my thoughts (writing is easier for me) on why I failed them, including that I had depression, and that homework was incredibly difficult, and that together it was a vicious cycle of making the other one worse. Her response to this was assuming that I just ""didn't do my homework,"" and thinking that I've learned some lesson about how college was just unexpectedly hard compared to high school, so I'd do well if I tried again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm sure what I need is a therapist, but talking to my mom is very difficult, since she doesn't understand what my problems are even after explaining them, so I try not to talk to her about anything very serious.

&amp;#x200B;

With all that being said, I have a long distance relationship with my girlfriend who has severe anxiety, to the point of being on disability, and I want nothing more than to be able to live independently so that we can be together, so I've come to Reddit for some advice on how to get past my problems.",01Aug2019,2
752,"I got hired to nanny a 6 month old baby, the mom said all she could afford was $200 a week. I was fine with that and we agreed that I would be working 7am-5pm three days a week. Within the first week of working for this family, the mom made a “to-do” list for me to do while I was taking care of the baby. It consisted of washing/folding/putting away laundry, changing older child (m3) bedding, and vacuuming. I felt uncomfortable but I did it anyway because I didn’t know what to say. She was also late by almost a half hour, and didn’t offer to compensate me, and asked me to come in early one of the days. I ended the first week feeling taken advantage of and drained. I talked to my mom and she said I need to tell her I can’t do house work unless I get payed more, and I will need to be compensated $10 an hour outside the $200 a week for every hour of overtime. I told her all of that and she politely agreed. It’s been about 1.5 months and the mom has consistently showed up late after work, often with Starbucks in hand. I would be fine if it was 5 minutes but it’s usually half an hour or more. The other day she was an hour late with no compensation. She also has continued to add on other chores and tasks. The other day she asked me to pick up the older child (whom I am not responsible for) from daycare and drop him off at her work, today she asked me to get him ready for daycare and make his lunch so the dad could sleep in. She also regularly makes me drive to her work to get the babies breast milk. My question from all of this is, do I remind her again that I need to be compensated for over time and extra duties or do I find another job. And if I find another job what do I tell the mom?",01Aug2019,2
753,"I’m not scared of the act of dying, or not fulfiling my life, I’m just scared of not existing.

Recently, there has been certain amounts missing from the cash register around $50 or so when my boss checks it. This has happened a couple times now and my boss told me about it. Basically, this could’ve happened because we didn’t void correctly on the cash register, or someone is stealing from it. Now I know that I am certainly not stealing from it, and I supposed that it could be possible we didn’t void correctly. But 2 days ago, I was working with this one coworker, just me and him, we’ll call him Tom. That day was pretty normal and the boss was there until about an hour before closing.  We were doing the closing jobs, no boss there and Tom told me “I can do the rest of the jobs and you can leave, it’s fine” I was happy to hear this and left. But today I come back 2 days later and my other coworker tells me that there was $50 missing from the register that day.

759,"First time poster, and I'm posting with permission and on behalf of a coworker (she doesn't know what reddit is).
My coworker needs help with the following situation. She (let's call her A) is a middle-aged woman with two sons, B (18M) and C (17M). Son B is dating a girl, let's call her D (19F).
A is also divorced from the father of B and C, let's call him Z.
B dropped out of high school with just weeks to go. C is still in high school, but hardly shows up. D is out of high school.
B and D live together, with D's recently divorced mother. C technically lives with Z, but he mostly hangs out at the house where B and D live, crashing on their couch 'often'.
They have been obviously (not in secret) smoking pot for about a year now and moved out from living with A about a year ago. I (25F) was not concerned when she told me about this. Lots of teenagers smoke pot and rebel from their parents. We live in a state where it's legal for 21+ to smoke. But these kids are not 21. And when B dropped out of high school, this became more concerning.
A, B, and C have been to family counseling, and the therapist actually encouraged the boys to ""be independent"", which they took that they should drop out of high school and move in with B's girlfriend.
B and C both have part time, ice cream shop-type jobs. D encourages them to smoke pot and cut their mother, A, out of their life.
Things got really bad this past weekend. B, C, and D had completely blown off A for celebrating C's 17th birthday, and they were all 3 going to go to brunch together. But a belt in the car broke and so ""their"" car wouldn't start. A gets the call and comes to help them, because she's still supporting them financially and loves them. She gets the car to the shop, and can tell that B and C are 'very high'. She and her boyfriend were headed to a weekend trip, so they invited C to come with, and he agreed. In the car, he passes out. A asks C what's going on, and he tells her that D has been giving him Clonazepam to 'help him sleep'. Thus, C is taking a controlled substance that D is illegally giving to him, a minor. I have experimented with these drugs and even been prescribed this same drug before, so I know what the dangers and benefits can be. This isn't a safe move for anyone's mental or physical well-being.
They get to their hotel for the weekend get away, and C has his own room. He spends the entire weekend smoking pot. A talks to him about it, because her 17 year old son is openly smoking and smelling like pot, and he says it's not an addiction, because it's pot. Again, I understand why he thinks this, but since he's a minor and he's doing it so often, this is not good news.
He says that he has to smoke pot in order to tolerate her. Despite confessing to some yelling, she does not seem to have abused B or C in any way, she's just being a mom. C decides to call Z, the father, and Z comes to pick him up.
A is not sure what to do and is heart broken that she could lose her sons in these ways. Both sons are on a slippery path, and one is definitely risking some heavy consequences with prescription benzo usage. She is still paying for their health insurance and assisting them financially.
Should she cut them off? Go to the authorities about the drug use? I'm not sure what advice to give her.",01Aug2019,2

I was in my old job for 9 years and loved the people I worked with, we all got on amazingly well and we were like a little family.

The people in my new job are fine, they have been helpful and nice but obviously they already have their friendships with each other so they have their laughs and chats together and I just sit there and listen. I just feel like I don’t fit in. I have only been there 2 weeks so I don’t know the job that well, everyone else there is really good at what they do and I just feel lost. I miss my old job, I miss knowing what I was doing and being really great at what I did. I miss having a laugh with my old coworkers and being able to have a conversation without worrying about what the other person thinks of me or worrying if I’m making myself look like a fool. I miss being “me”. 

I have never been good at making friends or bonding with people, I have only been able to do that with a handful of people in my life. I wish I found it easier to bond with new people, I just feel like I’m not very likeable. I feel like people think I’m just a loser so they don’t want to involve themselves with me.

765,"I've worked in the service industry, for way too long. I have worked in male dominated kitchens for a majority of that time. Unfortunately, with this last job - I was subject to hear the men tell rape jokes and make fun of people who have been sexually assualted. I have survived very terrible things that I will not go into. I talked to the manager and he laughed at me..

So obviously, I quit. I refuse to work in an environment that toxic and that unprofessional. I started a website for my art and do freelance writing through Upwork. Unfortunately, it does not pay well at all... 

I can't get any non-restaurant jobs even at entry level. I'm in Ohio, so it's pretty crushing when you're .. not qualified for an entry level position at $8.25 per hour..

I'm sort of at a point of giving up. But, I just found this app called, ""Fans Only"" which is... Sex work. But, it's a social media platform in which people pay a monthly subscription to view your profile.

This sounds like a great idea, I'm cute or whatever... But but but... I have a boyfriend who I love very much and I feel like this is in a sense a form of cheating... I feel trapped because I can't find a job that's not entirely ran by really gross dudes making more than $8.25 per hour...but I don't know.

766,"Hey guys, I’m posting about this because I feel pretty confused. For a little backstory, basically two years ago I met this girl and we continued talking for a year. We were both 16 at the time, today we are both 18. After a year of talking I developed feelings for her and when I confessed my feelings to her we tried it for a couple weeks. But ultimately she still was dealing with her own personal issues before she could be in love with someone else, she needed to work on herself and she basically didn’t have feelings for me. She was still broken from a past relationship. I believe I was also too needy and childish for her to love me back then, so it makes sense to me now. Basically I was left broken just like she was before, it was my first real heartbreak and it’s been over a year and I’m still not fully over it, but I’m way better now. I cut off all contact and blocked her on Instagram. I told her it was something I had to do in order to heal and I couldn’t just be friends. She was very guilty for hurting me but she understood. I’ve pretty much moved on since then, it’s been over a year and a half, but I’m still not fully over her and I still find her to be the only girl I’ve ever fell that hard for, no one else has compared.

Well last week, after almost a year of no contact, she sent me something along the lines of this:


“Hey, i’m sorry for bothering you 
I just wanted to check up on you and ask how you’re doing, even though you may hate me or don’t want to talk to me or something. Anyways, i really hope you’re doing great and everything is good and life is treating you good, And i hope you’re happy❤
I wish you all the best, Andd...umm.. I miss you
Anyways, I’m sorry again for bothering you...
Goodbye”


I woke up to this message and I was kind of shocked to hear from her after a year of not talking. I replied telling her that I don’t hate her and that everything is fine with my life. She probably thinks I hate her because I cut off all contact, but it was just necessary for me to move on. She replied with:

“I just hate the idea that you may hate me or that i’m the one that hurt you or something, i reallyy hate it”

I told her she shouldn’t feel guilty about making a decision that she thought was best for her, whether it hurt me or not. Then she replied with

“No I’m not texting you because I feel guilty about it, honestly I’ve been wanting to talk to you for a while but I’ve been hesitating. And yeah about that decision I don’t know about that, I thought it was for the best but idk...”


Wtf is that supposed to mean? We continued talking about our lives for a bit after that and then I stopped replying.  But I’m really confused because it sounded like she regrets what happened between us and might want me back, but it also might be that she just misses me. I am just afraid that if she likes me now, that I will end up being hurt again, I’m afraid of feeling that pain again. But deep down I’ve always wanted to end up with her in the future. I feel that maybe, as time goes on we might reconnect with each other and it might end up working out between us in the future, because we both care a lot for each other. we both had a special connection and we both miss each other, it was just not possible to be together at the time. But at the same time I have zero expectations and don’t expect anything to happen, and I’d be totally okay with it not happening, because then it’s just not meant to be. 


A week after she sent me this message, I talked to her myself. We talked for a while and it was great, we made each other laugh and it was a good conversation. I kept my boundaries and I wasn’t needy or “friendly” as I was before. Although I’m not sure where she stands. A couple days after she texted me again and we talked again. The conversation was really playful and fun, the chemistry was there and maybe stronger than before. There was a lot of teasing/flirting and you could sense the chemistry from her also. So the advice I’m asking is, how can I talk to her now with a clean slate and attract her? She obviously wouldn’t have messaged me if she didn’t have some form of feelings for me, or if she hadn’t been thinking about me. How should I approach this? I don’t want to directly tell her I like her again because I’m afraid she will say no, but I want to build that attraction over time, in the hopes that eventually we will build attraction and end up together. How do I talk to her in a way where she doesn’t see me as just a friend, considering it’s been a whole year? Or should I just avoid contact completely? Currently we are not in the same country so I can’t see her in person, but I will be back there in a couple of months for Christmas, I’m currently studying abroad and all we have is our phones. She is also starting college this fall. The odds just seem slim given the circumstances but I think love is always worth it if it’s there. Thank you for reading this and for any advice I may receive! It’s all love &lt;3

I am now thinking that it's now or never to tell her that I want to explore our feelings - last year I nearly died and she was there for me every step of my recovery. Her relationship appears to be on the rocks  over certain impossible to resolve issues.

I also am now on the cusp of starting a relationship with someone else whom i value dearly and believe i could fall in love with. But don't want to go into it with lingering hopes of love with my friend

770,"My life has been a wild roller coaster ride for the last few years and I'm confronted, yet again, with another situation that I need your advice on.

Basically I've been living in the city I currently reside in since 2012. I moved here primarily for school. Stuff happened, I got kicked out, started all over, and have been at the school I'm currently at for over 3 years (I'm currently a senior accounting student).

Because I have so many credits from my previous institution, I've been charged out of state tuition at this school for the last three years. I'm also on several other restrictions, such as financial aid, etc. Anyways, due to that, I was only allowed to take intermediate accounting I in spring because it was a pre-req for all of the other classes I needed. I took it in spring and it sucked because taking just one class felt like such a waste of time. This summer, I was signed up for intermediate accounting II because I wanted to take it and get it over with so as to take my last four classes in fall and finish this well. 

Well, because I was low on money and couldn't pay it past the deadline, I had to drop and figured ,ah what the heck, I'll just take it in fall alongside the other 4 (so, 5 classes total). I screwed up because it too is a pre-req meaning that I can only take that class and no other in fall and then would have to take the remaining four classes in spring of 2020. I had no clue that it was a pre-req and couldn't pay for it on time regardless. I'm kind of only in this city for school and feel like I've never finished; I keep having obstacles come my way that are more than classroom issues (I have a decent GPA and have been passing my classes).

Being that I have 5 classes remaining, my options are now to graduate in spring 2020, or to move back to my hometown (where I have my parents and actually wanna live) and transfer. However, if I transfer, I'd be transferring to begin in January of next year and have no idea how long it would take to finish. I know different universities have minimum hour requirements for transfer students as to graduate. So, I called and was told that the only way to figure out for sure would be to apply, be admitted, have a course evaluation, then I'd know. I kind of am in a bind and don't know what to do. On one hand, just busting through and staying where I'm currently at will have me in and out in May of 2020, but it's still a long time from now and I'm already 28 years old. 

Moving would make me way more happier (I love my hometown in comparison to where I'm at currently, and so does my wife), however, it may, and most likely would take even longer, thus delaying my entrance into a masters program and eventually qualifying for the cpa exam.

With that said, I need a job and that'd be the constant factor throughout all of this. My mental health has been deteriorating to rather stressful trauma I've experienced in the past here in this city but at the same time I have a family to support and a child so I don't want to be prolonging my education further along when I was expecting to originally graduate this December. 

The only plus side to all of this is that the costs of education in my hometown are cheaper, I'd have my parents around, more friends around, and I'd probably be able to find a regular job around here easier (sadly, I don't see many corporate accounting opportunity gigs here because it's a smaller town nor many internship opportunities, but that's just my observation since I haven't actually been on campus to check what they have going on).

Basically, my mental health, patience, common sense, and finances are all screaming in different directions and I do not know what to do anymore. I don't feel like I'm stable enough to make a rational and stable decision so I'm seeking help here. Please let me know what you think. If you have any questions that you think would help me help you help me, please feel free to ask.

Thanks!",01Aug2019,2

I’m a pretty quiet person so unless someone is doing something really off the mark I normally wouldn’t say anything. I worry sometimes that it’ll build up and make me annoyed all the time though.

There’s five of us, and we spend lots of time together and do stuff together all the time. However, while we spend lots of time together, she is a very quiet person, and we get along less than any of the others. In fact, it’s the scenario where any one-on-one conversations are forced and short, do to us having very little in common.

I love her but she is very hard to do with. Very disrespectful at times in my eyes, which of course she doesn't see it the same way. I haven't done my absolute best and bent over backwards for this child but at the very minimum, there doesn't seem to be any respect there. I""m exhausted and at  this point I feel like I am handicapping her. She has no idea what life is really like and therefore has no idea how much i do for her and how significant it is.

781,"Ok so the title is a bit dumb. I know. I couldn’t really think of anything better. But hear me out. 

I want to understand how you guys accept the quality of life you live opposed to MANY others who live 10x better than yourself.

Think about all the cool shit out there. Guys in Ferraris with BEAUTIFUL women. Jet skis and margaritas. Smoking weed in the Bahamas. 0 worries. Just fun. All fun. A wonderful, fun life.

While the vast majority of people eat shit everyday and work crappy jobs and WILL NEVER even feel the steering wheel of a Ferrari, will NEVER be able to fuck beautiful women, will never ever be able to travel and see the world, will never be able to live care and worry free, will never be able to be the man/woman they always wanted to be and really most of all, they will never get to live a good life. Never. 

How can people accept that? I cant. Call me entitled or spoiled I dont fucking care. But the fact that one day im going to be put under 6 feet of dirt constantly nags at me. All this work for what? 3 months work of work go to fucking taxes. I STAND ON MY FEET FOR 10 HOURS A DAY FOR 3 MONTHS SO THE GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE A CUT OF MY HARD EARNED MONEY. 

It depresses me. It’s sure as fuck not motivation. I feel as though theres no reason to live. You work work work and what? You get a pension at lousy 60 years old? Fucking 60! When my dick stops working and im too old to jet ski and smoke weed while kite surfing? Fuck man. I have kids. I cant even see them because I constantly work.

Ive started online businesses in hopes of quitting my job. Im still trying to succeed. Im not a quitter. Im not depressed. I just cant take anymore. On the way to work I see KIDS in exotic cars. KIDS. Good for them. They’re living the life I wish I had. But man, this life is worthless. I come home exhausted. I cant be with my kids and wife as much as I wish I could. I cant do the things I wish I could do with them.  It just really hurts. Ive failed so many times. Every business I’ve tried to get into I just fall flat on my face and eat dirt. So I got to keep working. We live frugally already. Too frugally. To me, this is not a way of life. I dont want to be put to rest without having done the things I want.

But he never talked about his feelings so I'm not sure. I did apologize at the time for how blunt I was but it didn't seem like he ""heard"" me. But I just wanted to make sure we reached like a rhythm of sorts.

785,"When I write this out it seems super petty but at the same time I still feel upset. 

Anyway, my company laid off a massive number of people yesterday. In our team my coworker and I are the only ones left in the corporate office along with 3 remote personnel. So 5 of us total. My coworker and I both have the same title though I was a much more recent hire after contracting for a period (9 months vs 2 years with the company). I also brought a much more data focused skill set having a data science background. 

With the new restructuring of the team my coworker was promoted this morning in a meeting. I guess I feel sort of slighted, not because I want to be promoted to a management role, because I don't at all, but moreso because when I was hired in at the same level as him and more or less automated his entire job via programming. This of course freed him up and has allowed me to focus on more data related projects which are now entirely on hold due to the restructuring but a part of me is upset no one even mentioned the fact that he now has the time to do management work because I took his whole job and automated it... 

Is that extremely petty or is there some basis for being upset because he was promoted without even a word of the work I accomplished that freed him up. 

To put this in math, I essentially took his data entry and data analysis work that took him 6-8 hours per location (of which we have 50+ and growing) and automated it between our database (back-end) and our visualization software (front-end) down to about 1-2 minutes per location, meaning I took what would normally be 300+ hours of work for him every update and made it an easy hour to finish everything. I guess I feel like at some level, it would have been nice for someone to say ""Hey thanks for doing that work that no one else in the company knew how to do so XX can work on things they're better equipped to handle""

I think the biggest problem I have is he keeps getting bonuses based on other things he does because he doesn’t worry about doing the things he actually was hired to do because I handle it all now and i don’t get recognized for any of what I’ve done to make our team efficient. 

At the same time I recognize that maybe the reason I’m still here is because someone somewhere recognized I was useful...",01Aug2019,0

792,"Quick background. I come from a very religious family. They only care about religion, they will never, EVER tell you the good things you've done, they'll only punish you for the bad. My entire life was like this. It wasn't to an EXTREME degree, but just everytime I accomplished, or didn't accomplish something, I'd hear about how I failed, and never about where I succeeded. If I did hear something from them about me succeeding in something, it's generally along the lines of ""We don't really know much about these things, sorry"". After knowing them for a long time, it's apparent that it's not lack of knowledge, but simply disinterest in any of my OWN accomplishments that they did not influence. My dad wanted me to graduate from a specific program. I graduated from another one that makes ME happy, but he's not happy for me because it's not what he wanted. Anyway, this is the gist of how I've grown up.

NOW, at 23, I'm basically a walking ball of uncertainty. I never know if I'm doing something right. I always doubt myself, second guessing, etc. I work full time with my brother now, I have a good career ahead of me.. but he makes me feel like shit when I'm working. I recently got my drivers license, and whenever I reverse park at a slight angle, he gets frustrated and irritable at me. Starts talking to me in a rude way and it ruins my day. I thought I wasn't a sensitive person, but recently it feels like only like 1 person in my family is nice to me and it makes me feel a little emotional. I just hate hate hate that I feel like my minor mistakes can't be forgiven. Now, I can't even forgive myself for them.

As a residential painter in the past, I spilt paint on the carpet, a tiny amount, and I cleaned it up and it was 90% gone. I was shaky the entire day, slightly sweaty, beating myself up in my head, honestly it was crippling for working. I was constantly thinking in my head what a shitty job I've done, how badly I fucked up, I just couldn't give myself an easier time.

I really, really want to but how? How do I do it? When I speak to the family members I have that I'm not close with (both parents and all my siblings minus 1) they always put shit in my head like I'm not doing something right, and when they DO tell me I'm doing something right, it's because I've done something they've told me to do. I'm so sick of this. I feel like the way I was raised has impacted me now to this degree. I don't know how much more I'll be impacted in the next few years, but I'm scared and want to know how to fix this. I'm actually terrified. 

**TL;DR: Family never gives positive affirmation, only negative. Fucked up my brain wiring. I am afraid of everything, especially making mistakes, even tiny, tiny ones. How do I fix myself?**

The only good thing that came out of ALL of this, is that as a result of this I'm TERRIFIED of making mistakes, and so I ask a LOT of questions, which I consider a great quality.",01Aug2019,1
794,"A few notes before this post:
I'm using an alt because I don't want people I know to see this post
I don't know if r/advice is the right place to post this, but r/autism seems fairly inactive.  If there is a better place, please redirect me.
I'm asking here instead of a counselor or something for monetary reasons.

Ok, here's the story: I have high-functioning Asperger's and was diagnosed about 5 years ago (I'm 17).  As a young child, my autism was far worse than it is now, and I had many noticable tics like making loud grunting noises constantly, and also had difficulty interacting with others in a normal manner.  As of right now, I am far improved.  My tics are mostly gone, save for occasional 2 month streaks of small ones like nodding my head a lot or scrunching up my lips, and my social life is greatly improved (much, much easier to make friends, understand social cues and emotions, and most people I know don't say what I have is noticable unless they have known me for a while, but they could just be being nice).  I'm also pretty good with eye contact.I was homeschooled for 8 years and have been in a normal hs for 2 (I went to and alternative hs freshman year).  I do have one problem; while I have been actively trying to suppress my ""symptoms"" for lack of a better term that I know of, there are still some little things that aren't quite tics that I'm afraid are obvious to others and that people are being nice and not saying anything or being friendly to be kind.  I live in a good community where bullying is basically non-existent, and while I've made several good friends over the years,  it feels like I have much more potential for a social life.  For example, I have a lot of acuantances that I know, but am not friends with.  I've also had bad luck with girls; I've had 2 somewhat close female friends who were also attractive, and ruined both friendships by trying to take things further.  Almost no other girls seem even interested in being friends with me, and that is something that I feel will be poor for me in the future.  I make a large effort to look good and I spend a great deal of my personal money on clothes and spend a lot of time getting ready in the morning.  These little things I'm afraid are turning people away include some facial positions or awkward looking ""poses"" that seem to tip people off, my face shape is a bit different (protruding lips, a baby face), the way I speak (I needed to go to a speech therapist as a young child), and heated debates in class that I take too far (my political opinions are very strong, and I'm conservative in a liberal state). Here's my goal: I want to appear normal to most people, and to be able to be adept enough to get a date for senior year homecoming and prom (I haven't been to a dance yet).  I want you guys to give me some advice on how I can get there.  Does simply living a healthier life (eating right, working out) help a lot?   I feel like I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place with being aware and trying to help myself, yet finding it difficult to actually do that.

Thanks to all who took the time to read that wall of text.  I'm not just here to vent about my insecurities, I just really want advice on how to get better.  I have college in 1 year and if my goals are too lofty, I at least want to be ready for that.  Thanks!",01Aug2019,2

Long story short, I work 5 days out of the week, live with my boyfriend who is currently unemployed so all my money goes to the bills and feeding us, but once in a while a good friend will want to hang out and offer to take me out so I did and boyfriend was just gonna stay home and I had a great time and the next day boyfriend took me out to dinner which was random to drop the news that he had this friend over who is a female and yes she brought her kid so that the family could meet him, but we already had issues with this girl before me insisting that she was constantly flirting or whatever, so he gets mad and says this is why i didn't want to tell you and then i go on and try to make a point about how he wouldn't like it if he went out and i brought home someone he didn't like etc etc, well fast forward to the recent thing like two weeks ago i let him borrow my car so that he could take his cousins home while i was at work and three days later i just had this weird gut feeling and i know i shouldn't have but i went through his phone and found a messages between him and that girl about how he was on his way over so of course i got mad and called him out on it, but he said that he didnt that that's just how they joke around and his showed me his google maps and it showed me all the places he went that day and then he was like do you want me to call her and i said no, but he ended up texting her telling her I don't know what, I'm assuming something along the line that I don't want them talking or making a big deal about them joking like that i don't know and she told him that i should fuck off and if i was a real friend i would talk to her etc  etc, but it's not that i wanted them to stop talking i just thought he went behind my back again and doing whatever he wants, but when it comes to me going out he is constantly calling and asking what time i will be home and having to tell him days in advanced if I'm doing something and he just doesn't get that and i don't know how to say that and i feel like it's pointless because the damaged is done with that one girl and now i just look like a crazy controlling gf.

798,"I have grown up in a family that's had dogs for years and each has their own personality. I picked up a free puppy as a gift for my fiancé as I know he loves Jack russel breeds. The dog is named Dingus Khan as he isn't bright and is a little terror as he's Jack russel/miniature pinscher. Anywho, my point is that I grew up in a family that has trained nearly every and any dog to behave. We all know how to read their behavior and train them. My fiancé has also had many dog in his family but I don't know specifically how many or what kinds if more than Jack russel, German shepards, and pits. He has too much affection for the dog if you ask me and has imbedded a piddling issue and separation anxiety into Khan. The dog also absolutely refuses to sleep on the floor when we go to bed and I'm allergic to him! So I have to sleep far away on my side and make sure he doesn't touch me. If I put flea or tick medicine on him I cannot leave him outside as he is super small and I know that an owl could literally pick him up and away and not to mention there's a dog stealer in the area. I cannot simply throw him out of the room as he will pee and poop wherever and scratch and cry at our bedroom door. The only option I'm left with is to put his leash and collar on and tie him to our bedframe so that he cannot jump onto the bed. I'm hardly allowed to discipline the dog without getting a dirty look from my fiancé like I'm abusing the dog. I know how to fix all of our dogs issues but my fiancé refuses to listen to my advice and I'm tempted to get rid of the dog. My fiance went to his army annual training for two weeks and in that time I was able to whip the dog into shape. He was so entirely well behaved that I was impressed and very hopeful, but as soon as my fiancé came home all of my hard work went into the trash.

799,"So I am in need of some advice.

My best friend (17F) (lets call her Aliya) is going on a month-ish long family trip in a few days and we wanted to spend some time together before she left. We decided on camping since we both love camping and her dad was already planning this camping trip. The problem is, I doubt my parents will let me go with her.

They're what you'd think your average stereotypical Asian immigrant parents would be. They always had a hard time with me sleeping over at anyone's house, and even after four years, they still reluctantly let me sleep over at **my best friend's house** when I ask. They have obviously met Aliya's parents before and I don't see why there would be any problems since we are literally best friends. I feel like they are helicopter parenting me and wont let me do fun things in summer that the rest of my friends are. I'm literally home all day doing online courses and writing in grade 12 math and curriculum books that my dad forced me to do. I might be overeating but come on, I'm seventeen already and I'm going to be leaving the nest sooner or later. Also this constant helicopter parenting is making me feel like I am missing valuable life skills and independence skills that I could have learned if they would just agree to me going out. And It's not like I'm doing drugs or getting drunk, I'd like to say I'm a good kid that gets high marks in school and I do competitive dance and art classes. So its not like a have a bad record of doing things that are *too* wild, yet sleeping somewhere that is not my house is still a touchy subject for my mom. If she can't even let me sleepover or go camping with even my best friend of four years at age 17, then why is she allowing me to go to universities (if I get in lol) that are literally in different provinces? 

This is where it gets interesting, **I have actually been on a week long camping trip with her and her dad last summer**, but I kind of lied about how many people were going and I got busted when I got home. (please don't judge) That resulted in my mom not talking to me for a whole month. My dad wasn't as mad, and was actually even arguing against her when I cam back. So it isn't like I haven't been camping with her before and this time it would only be for one night. But I'm scared to ask about camping because it might trigger her about what unfolded last summer. I mean I understand why she got mad and wouldn't let me go because *I was 16 at the time.* But now I'm older and more mature.

Our plan was to go to Bancroft to visit the Gemboree and then we were gonna camp close to there for the night so that we could check out the meteor shower that's happening these few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Long story short:** I want to go on a one night camping trip with my best friend before she leaves for a month and I don't know how to convince my parents (mostly just my mom because my dad usually agrees to these things) to let me go. I turned 17 early this summer and I feel like my parents are helicopter parenting me. Also it's not like I dont know how to camp since I've done it before.

So If anyone could offer some advice on how to ask my mom to let me go camping with Aliya, or if anyone could offer alternate excuses or well executed plans in order for me to go on this trip. I would be open to any suggestions.

Technically, this does abide Michigan standards for minors, but I dislike breaks with a passion and usually opt out from taking them.

Usually, the common times are 2-10, 2-8, 2-7, 2-5, for reference, which is what I normally will work. There are some days where I either have to clock in early or stay later, and it seems to be alright. With how my job is and with my co-workers, I usually don't take the 2-8 break, and I can just write down NB (no-break) and get my six hours and be done with that. The manager is 100% okay with that when I talked to them, but I don't believe that they do the hours themselves.

Two days ago, I found out that my check has been short for 4.75 hours after doing some calculations by myself. Talked to the Manager, manager confirmed that my hours were shorted and told the owner. Owner said he was going to fix them and then directly told me that I *must* take a break when I work 6 hours or more.. because it was an inconvenience in his payroll (or something like that). The thing is, though, is that I'm not even sure if that was the main reason why my hours were shorted from what I can tell and that is just whoever marks it down accidentally skipping or assuming certain times.

In my mind, I am just wasting 30 minutes of time that could be spent doing something else, since it's an unpaid break. If it was paid, I would not mind at all taking the break, but because it is unpaid I honestly feel that I am wasting my time with taking that break.

There are a few questions and solutions that I have come up with to avoid taking that break or what not.

Solutions that my small brain can think of

\- There was a few weeks ago where there was a string of ""no-breaks"" that I took, yet they did not care. I could just go on with it, find the person who does the calculation of the hours and speak to them about it and see if it is alright. Along with this, I wouldn't mind spending my own personal time helping them calculate my hours to confirm with them before they give it to the next person.

* This is assuming, though, that there are three people in the equation (first being the person who writes down simply how much an employee gets, followed by the person who creates the check, and then the person who distributes the check)

\- Take my break at the end of my 6-hour shift. It's not the most optimal solution, but that basically means I get out of work 30 minutes early, since it is uninterrupted rest. I'll discuss this as an option with my manager first so I do not get in large trouble

Questions

When discussing this with my mom, she said to me that the employers do not care about their employees at all, they are only there to help them out. (Makes total sense, but is probably unethical, which is why employee morale is probably low)

That being said....

\- Is there anything that I can do in my power to help myself out in this situation, such as finding a guidebook that will state each rule in print of whatever I need to do.

\- Probably up to whoever, but is it even possible to get a raise in this job..? What is that dependent on usually? I know I'm not going to get one any time soon, but I just kind-of wanted to throw that out there.

\- Is there anything that I could say to make the head people actually care about their crew?

I am truly confused on what to do. I enjoy working here, but it really upsets me with the decision that the boss made that I don't even know if it is actually true or not.

I mean- I didn't have proper training and orientation, build sheets for things, or an actual handbook we learned through word of mouth and how to make certain things..

Just recently, the owner scolded to me about putting rags under the dispensers so they don't make a mess on a counter. Didn't say anything for a solution, just repeated that and then went on with whatever. Later, manager cleared up with me on why I shouldn't do that, and what I should do instead, but that was really it. (just a little explanation of what things happen)

Probably stupid question also, but who would I contact for broken machinery or whatnot? I am guessing manager, but they have done nothing about the problems that we have been having. Even so, some of the things that we have had been ""bandaged"" poorly or completely ignored. Also, there is always a foul stench from under the drive-thru counter coming from the water. Is there anything that I could do about that?

I apologize if this seems more like a rant post, and I hope that I could get some advice on what I could do to help myself out or whatnot.

Just to say also this probably won't matter since I'm going back to college in two weeks ( still working on weekends though so it does matter a bit).

Basically boss told me that I couldn't skip breaks consisting of 6 hours of work to gain more hours (.5) and had to take an unpaid break. I don't like unpaid breaks, and that wasn't even the main reason on why I got shortened hours I think. it just looks like They goofed up on their part but the boss got mad at it or something. I wish they would understand but I can't practically understand half of the things he says.",01Aug2019,1
806,"So I have to give a little background info in order to understand my predicament. (Sorry it’s long)

I recently applied for a new job with a different company in the same field of work that I’m currently in. The new job has 6 open positions for a brand new never been done before job within the company. My coworker and I both applied for this position only to find out that we were the only 2 people to submit applications. We both had our initial test to see if we qualified for the job. We both passed which meant we got phone interviews. We had a total of 3 phone interviews pretty much back to back with each other. Both of us had been recommended by employees of the company we applied too. All the interviews went well as the recruiter stated in an email to me after the interviews were completed. The employees that recommended us said that we both had very good odds of getting an offer and that they talked around to higher up bosses and heard no bad news thus far into the process. They also said the company wouldn’t have gone this far in the process if they weren’t planning on hiring us. Now about a week after my third phone interview my coworker got and email for a fourth interview. I was expecting an email since we were both getting info sent to us back to back. I never received anything but kept my spirits high. I recently sent the recruiter an email to see if they had any info going forward with the application process. I haven’t heard back from them and the email was sent 4 days ago. Today my coworker got a phone call from the recruiter for an in person interview with a manager. I then called the recruiter about an hour after they called him to see if my email ever got through and if I was still being assessed for the position. I have yet to receive a phone call back. However on the company’s website it says my application is still in process and hasn’t been terminated or closed. This makes me think that I’m still good but since I can’t get a response I fear the worst. Mind you this is only the second job I’ve ever had to apply for so I might be overthinking everything. 

I guess my question is what should I do if the recruiter doesn’t contact me like they should since it’s their job? I don’t want to seem pushy or annoying but I also don’t want to pass up a very good job opportunity by not potentially speaking up and getting answers. 

(Sorry for the long and potentially confusing post)",01Aug2019,0
807,"Hey guys, so this is my first post here and I hope I can describe my problem well enough. It's really hard to put into words but I'll do my best. It also might get a bit longer.

I'm 23 and I recently finished uni with a Bachelors degree in Game Design and I got a place for a Masters degree in Digital Management starting in September. Now the problem is that, for the last 3- 4 years, I'm interested in joining the Federal Police. I told my parents and girlfriend about that 3 years ago and they were not too keen about it, but I still applied. I went through the application process and unfortunately didn't get enough points for the higher service (which consists of a 3 year study). The Police Academy called me a couple days later and offered me to join in the ""medium service"" (English isn't my first language so I don't know the term for it, it's basically a 2 year apprenticeship). The difference is that the medium service is a lower rank with nearly the same duties but less management functions. 

With the offer for the medium service I got a lot of pressure from my family and gf not to take that offer since the medium service is ""bad and you just get to deal with idiots"" according to them. I rejected the Academys offer and continued my Game studies. 

Now recently the desire popped back up (well it never really left) to apply to the police again. It's just a feeling that it would be the right job for me. I always get fascinated when I see officers on the street or TV documentations about it. I would get to help people, do something physical with my body and do a job I can be proud of. Now another problem is, that my goal in the Police would be a job in a specialized unit, which has the maximum age to apply to be 34. If I apply to the higher service again, I'm afraid I don't have enough time to be under that age limit. So I would be fine to apply to the medium service and climb the career ladder when I'm in. 

If I tell my family and gf that I want to apply again, and to the medium service, they will most certainly loose their shit and be dissapointed. I know that I don't have to be best friends with my parents, but it's still hard to think about their reaction. Otherwise I'm quite certain that my family will support me in whatever I do at one time or another. 

I would probably loose my girlfriend because I would need to live and study on the Academy campus somewhere else in the country and she doesn't want a long distance relationship.

If I would continue my path in games on the other hand, it will be a lot easier. I don't know if the games industry would be too bad to work in. I'm not quite on the same page as most people from the industry I got to know, but that's manageable I guess. I just have the feeling that I won't be proud about that job, and for some reason that's really important to me.

I'm sorry if it's weird to read, but i really hope some of you might be able to give me some advice or a new angle to see things. Thank you for reading.

**TL;DR** Don't know if current career path as game designer is right for me and thinking about joining the federal police. Doing that I would probably loose my gf and dissapoint my family.",01Aug2019,1

814,"My previous relationship was long term, lasting years. We were the definition of in love. We were even trying for a child. But then I noticed he started acting weird. He would stay out longer than usual, would stop taking me with him to places, started being extremley protective of his phone and even demanding me to give him space to work on something on his phone. Oh so surprisingly, he was lying and cheating. He broke things off under the pretence that it was my fault bc of something he knows I was highly insecure of. I found out about itand it broke me. I ended up being hospitalized it was so bad. Well, I finally got to a point where I'm comfortable dating again and met this really sweet guy. We've been going together for quite a few months now. But there has been some issues. He told me he had role plays (both sexual and romantic) going on through various messenging apps. I talked to him and said it didnt feel right to me. So he supposedly ended them all. Then the other day, I found out a character of his is together with one of his friend's characters. I felt unsure about this but talked to him anyways. He apologized and said he should have told me about it. Now red flags are starting to pop up for me- he doesn't message me nearly as much as he used to, he's harder to get a hold of despite him being very active on social media, and when I was with him, he got a message but quickly tilted the phone away so I couldnt see it. I did however manage to see whoever he was talking to had called him sweetie. That wouldnt bug me except he's trying to hide it. Am I just being paranoid and insecure or should I definitely follow through with this?",01Aug2019,2
815,"So I am in need of some advice.

My best friend (17F) (lets call her Aliya) is going on a month-ish long family trip in a few days and we wanted to spend some time together before she left. We decided on camping since we both love camping and her dad was already planning this camping trip. The problem is, I doubt my parents will let me go with her.

They're what you'd think your average stereotypical Asian immigrant parents would be. They always had a hard time with me sleeping over at anyone's house, and even after four years, they still reluctantly let me sleep over at **my best friend's house** when I ask. They have obviously met Aliya's parents before and I don't see why there would be any problems since we are literally best friends. I feel like they are helicopter parenting me and wont let me do fun things in summer that the rest of my friends are. I'm literally home all day doing online courses and writing in grade 12 math and curriculum books that my dad forced me to do. I might be overeacting but come on, I'm seventeen already and I'm going to be leaving the nest sooner or later. Also this constant helicopter parenting is making me feel like I am missing valuable life skills and independence skills that I could have learned if they would just agree to me going out. And It's not like I'm doing drugs or getting drunk, I'd like to say I'm a good kid that gets high marks in school and I do competitive dance and art classes. So its not like a have a bad record of doing things that are *too* wild, yet sleeping somewhere that is not my house is still a touchy subject for my mom. If she can't even let me sleepover or go camping with even my best friend of four years at age 17, then why is she allowing me to go to universities (if I get in lol) that are literally in different provinces?

This is where it gets interesting, **I have actually been on a week long camping trip with her and her dad last summer**, but I kind of lied about how many people were going and I got busted when I got home. (please don't judge) That resulted in my mom not talking to me for a whole month. My dad wasn't as mad, and was actually even arguing against her when I cam back. So it isn't like I haven't been camping with her before and this time it would only be for one night. But I'm scared to ask about camping because it might trigger her about what unfolded last summer. I mean I understand why she got mad and wouldn't let me go because *I was 16 at the time.*But now I'm older and more mature.

Our plan was to go to Bancroft to visit the Gemboree and then we were gonna camp close to there for the night so that we could check out the meteor shower that's happening these few weeks.

**Long story short:** I want to go on a one night camping trip with my best friend before she leaves for a month and I don't know how to convince my parents (mostly just my mom because my dad usually agrees to these things) to let me go. I turned 17 early this summer and I feel like my parents are helicopter parenting me. Also it's not like I dont know how to camp since I've done it before.

So If anyone could offer some advice on how to ask my mom to let me go camping with Aliya, or if anyone could offer alternate excuses or well executed plans in order for me to go on this trip. I would be open to any suggestions.

Thanks for reading and helping a fellow 17 year old girl out lol.",01Aug2019,1
816,"I apologize in advance, but this is going to be long.

Hey guys. I'm a 20 year old female and my best friend and her boyfriend are moving out of state and I was presented with the opportunity to move down with them. We already figured out splitting rent and all that. My parents are hardcore against it. They manipulated me out of moving out the first time back in April. I regretted not moving, honestly.

Anyway, I tried talking to them about me moving down to Iowa a couple of weeks ago and they tried talking me out of going because they think that my best friend is manipulative and how she's only going to do stuff to benefit herself and her boyfriend is going to be the same way. They also say that they're gonna treat me like shit and how I'm gonna end up on welfare because I wont be able to afford to live on my own without getting the insurance through the state. 

My parents are also saying that if I move out, then I'm turning my back on my family and they're gonna be so hurt that they wont talk to me. They threatened to bring my dog to the pound and kill my cats and then threatened to kill the same dog I just brought up. They also told me that they would take me off of everything so then I would have to pay for everything myself (which I was kind of expecting to be honest), and they said that I would end up getting raped or murdered if I moved down there. 

I talked to my cousin about this beforehand. He's older than my parents and I've gone to him for a lot this year. And one thing he pointed out to me was that my parents started a family at 18 and got married, but I couldnt move out at 20? He thought they were being ridiculous about it. He also said that there are some thing that I have to learn on my own instead of trying to learn by someone telling me these things. Which I've pointed out to them and dad said he understood...which he obviously didnt. 

This is gonna be all over the place, so I'm sorry for the confusion. 

Another thing I brought up was that my parents always told me that they weren't going to be around forever so we had to learn how to do things ourselves. When I brought it up, he agreed.

My parents are so against me going to Iowa that they didnt, and still dont, even want me going down there to help them move. And honestly, I'm so fucking afraid now. I dont even know what to do. He told me that if I returned this weekend and lied to him about stuff again, not gonna lie though I did lie about things because I knew how they were going to take everything anyway, then I should have a bunch of cops with me because he would be beyond angry with me.

I know I dont have a job lined up yet but where I'm going, there are job opportunities where I'm going. Plenty of them. And if I get a job that I dont like, I could stay there until I found a better job. And if I move out eith these guys, rent is going to be cheaper. Granted, I'm not paying for much while being at home but I feel like these are important life skills I need to learn on my own. And if I find a really good paying job, I feel like i wont be struggling with money, you know?

I just really need some advice on this. I'm so fucking torn.",01Aug2019,1
817,"Insert throwaway account comment here.

I understand there's a rather toxic stereotype of men being pillars of emotional fortitude and badasses who never flinch from life adversity yadda yadda yadda. And then there's been a lot of people both men and women advocating that guys should be allowed to be vulnerable or like ""What people think guys want"" and then they show like a sexy bikini picture and then ""What guys really want"" = a hug.

Ever since I can remember I've always found solace and courage from a shoulder to cry on. I'm no crybaby, I've been working a lot more on building my, I guess... emotional fortitude? But I'm starting to wonder why I wear my heart on a sleeve as a guy but most guys don't. Should I not be? Is there like a fine line between being vulnerable and being needy?

Its a buffet and they dont tell you what anything is and none of it tastes good and there are no menus to order anything else.

On top of having food I honestly just dont want to eat, my husband isnt working and we are short on funds. I know people will probably think I'm a crap person for declining but I feel like it's stupid for me to go somewhere with food I dont like and spend money I need to save on it.

I sort of wish they'd stop inviting me but I feel like there is no way to ask that politely. We are living very hand to mouth right now so $15 here or there is a lot.

Now, I’m aware that I don’t help myself, but i can’t dig myself out of this hole I’m in. 
For example, I have a car and I drive it - but I don’t have a license. I hated my instructor so I quit after I failed a test with her, and then just got used to driving by myself and that’s how it started. I love to drive, and I have driven to tons of place by myself with no hassle, but my Dad gets angry with me - understandably, and I can’t talk to him anymore. I had a job back in February and it was inaccessible without a car, but I’ve quit that job now which I’ll get onto. 
I have a new instructor, but I can’t drive with her without fucking up, and I’m close to giving up and selling my car. I’ve failed three tests already, and I’m starting to hate my life because of this.

So as I mentioned, I quit my job which I hated so now I’m unemployed and I have no money. I had to pawn my camera just to get some cash, but I’ve spent most of that on financing my car. 

I also have no friends and I do nothing in my spare time.. which is starting to bring me down.

I hate IT but I don’t want to go back to college. I feel like such a loser.

828,"This is gonna be a long background story, mostly just because I want my relationship with my dad to be understood.

I have always had an up and down relationship with my dad. When I was young, he worked extremely hard. But with that he was not around very often. Around the time I was 9, he lost his job and fucked our family over. I didn't really understand what happened at the time. Within a few months we went from moderately (but conservatively) wealthy, to food stamp poor. I later found out it was because he embezzled from the company he worked for. It lead to terrible fights with my mom, once he really lost his temper and hit her. I will always keep that hate for him in me. It has lead to a lot of resentment. He was diagnosed with PTSD from being fired from the company (mainly because he was a rags to riches type and couldn't reconcile with the fact that he lost everything). After this he never held a job for more than a few months.

Fast forward a few years to high school. I was a shit head but I kept good grades. I kind of just did whatever I wanted because my parents weren't very hands on with me, even from a younger age. I started smoking weed and drinking, kind of a lot. I was always responsible about what I would do and who I was with. I never got in trouble at school, never with the police. My dad didn't really know how to be a parent. When he would catch me in a lie about where I was going or the couple times he found my weed, it got really heated. And in a few of those types of fights we actually would physically fight. There was a couple times where he choked me. 

I met my girlfriend junior year of high school. She's the only reason I am where I am. She made me apply for college, she helped me stay on task, and I generally steered clear of a lot of the sketchy stuff that I was doing. At the point of graduating high school my relationship with my dad was far better. I had pretty much reconciled with everything that had happened. Or at least was able to put it out of my mind. My parents helped me a lot through college by taking out extra loans for me. I just graduated 2 months ago. I now have a good job, live with my girlfriend, and am pretty happy.

The problem is my dad now wont leave me alone, ever. He is on disability so he sits at home all day. I get ranting and raving texts about his finances, questions about my finances, assertions that he needs to help me or else I'm going to end up in a bad place. It's almost every day, and if I don't respond he just send indignant texts about how I need to respect him and he can't keep ""Subsidizing my life"" (He pays my phone bill), and just trys to pressure, guilt, or bait me into responding to him. He tells me I'm spoiled, and that he had nothing and no help financially or emotionally growing up. And whether I respond telling him politely to relax and that  I am a responsible person and I pay my bills, I take care of my loans and all of my personal business promptly, or I curse him out because he's being disrespectful he always just immediately plays the victim. 

I'm just so sick of being anxious because he has to try to make me feel like I'm not doing a good enough job just being independent. Like I need to be doing more and spending all my time with him or helping them financially, which I'm not in a position to do.

How do I get him to respect that I am a responsible adult. I appreciate what he does help me with but I don't feel like I owe him anything. How do I get him to respect that I'm a private person and that he has no right to be involved in my finances. How do I get him to understand that if I need help, I'll come to him. Keep in mind, I've told him all of this.",01Aug2019,2
829,"Hi Reddit. I'm only here because I have no one else to talk to and I don't know if I'm making the right decisions. However, at this point, I am so full of anxiety and worry that I figured I might as well just suck it up and ask. 

I was previously on a fully-paid scholarship to attend my private university. I was not able to finish my Bachelor's in the two years this scholarship gave me, so I need to pay off my third and final year on my own. The FAFSA gave me a lot less than I expected (around $2,000), and I have a remaining balance of $21,000 that I need to finish paying. Since I will be an RA, I have free housing and my meal plan covered. I also will have a job on campus ($11 an hour), another job that is part of my degree that is $200 per semester, and the RA position will give me only around $600. I was counting on getting a summer job to cover the first $4,000 of my payment plan, but was unable to due to my family preventing me from doing so. I have a very hard time with my family and one of my family members holding money and what they do for me over my head, which is why I am kicking myself for getting into this situation.

I originally planned that I would suck it up and work overtime to just pay it all off while I work full-time during the semester, and to do my final semester abroad (it would be fully-funded, I would just need to pay for housing). However, that program no longer offers the courses I need to complete my degree, leading me to this difficult situation.

I have several options: I can do this one semester and work hard to pay off the bulk of the payment throughout, take the following semester off, and just complete my last classes over the summer. I could also just do the two semesters, take loans, and find myself in the hole around $40,000. The entire thought makes me feel like throwing up, especially with all the talk about how debilitating student loan debt is. 

What do I do now? Can anyone give me advice on what getting a student loan of $21,000 would look like if I decided on just this semester - has anyone been able to work and pay their tuition while attending school? I have been having a panic attack since I found out and I CANNOT ASK MY PARENTS for help. My dad is a no-go, and I could rely on my mom except that she is financially dependent on my dad and I don't want to take any money she is saving towards her own means.",01Aug2019,1

831,"Hey all,

Fresh college grad here with a Bachelors in Environmental Science, minor in Spanish.  Studied abroad in Costa Rica last semester, I have a pretty good handle on speaking Spanish.  

Anyways, besides study abroad and summer internships, I’ve lived with my parents my whole life.  The good is that I don’t have any student loan debt.  The bad is I feel like I’ve missed out on making friends and my party years, sort of. 

So, right now, I have a savings of about $1,700 (spent a lot while abroad).  I’m doing the thing my parents are telling me to do, apply for jobs while working as a sever part time.  I’ve been applying to different jobs within the government, as well as with private companies.  My dilemma is between the traditional, get a job route, vs the road less traveled if you will.  Seasonal waitressing in Key West?  Move to Europe? TEFL certification? The possibilities are endless, and for that I am thankful...

If you were in my shoes - college graduate, no debt, not much to my name, attractive but friendless female, stable family life, what would you do? I’m confused and sad and not quite sure what road to pick.",01Aug2019,1

833,"There is an old man who lives on the end of my street, and there is a decent amount of foot traffic in that intersection. He asks passerby if they could open his front door. He tried to get us to knock on the garage door. It’s not just pedestrians either. We’ve seen him flag down cars and ask them to open his door and look inside. Whenever we see someone doing this, they always open the door and look around inside. He does this multiple times a day. He asks children and teenagers to do this as well, which is very creepy, as the children are obviously scared/ uncomfortable. What I’m wondering is, does anyone know why he may be doing this? Is this some sort of mental illness, or something else? Is there anything we can do to maybe get him some help? Should we even do anything?

834,"Long story short my fiancé left her purse in a lyft on the way to the airport, and within 5 minutes of exiting, several charges were made to all of her credit cards to utility companies. Fortunately most were declined and she was reimbursed by her CC company. 

My fiancé called lyft to tell them what had happened, and lyft called her back saying not to worry because the driver said he did not have the bag.

We filed a police report using the drivers first name and license plate number from the lyft app, but lyft would not give us the full name or any other info over the phone.

Finally the driver called lyft to say he had found it, and lyft then charged us $15 for a lost bag retrieval fee!

My fiancé has left multiple messages explaining the situation but has yet to receive a response after 5 days. On top of this, I have the driver a $5 cash tip, and my fiancé left a $8 tip in the app (this was a $20 ride), so it wasn’t like we were rude to him during the drive - yet he still stole from her!

The police are asking if we want to press charges against the driver. As long as none of her money had been stolen from the purse (only credit cards), is it really worth it?",01Aug2019,1

They were finishing moving up and I had assumed they would get their shit, but alas I had a text subtly shifting the burden onto me by saying I was welcome to any of the dirty ass dishes and furnishings they had left behind.

A full fridge, half a room of laundry supplies, full bathroom, two tables filled with leftover food. I brought three garbage bags from my new place to clean up what I had leftover and that barely made a dent in the remainder. I hadn't realized what a disaster they had left until pretty last minute and didnt have a chance to make multiple trips.

836,"So a member of my family seems a little out of control recently. He is under 18, but was arrested a few months ago for throwing a bottle of water at my Grandad. He only escaped prosecution as the charges were dropped given that my Grandad very sadly passed away recently due to natural causes.

My grandparents (particularly my nana) have raised him and absolutely spoilt him - he has always has the best, and everything he wanted.

However, despite my grandad’s recent passing, he still treats my nana appallingly. He calls her a whore and tells her repeatedly to fuck off is she asks him to tidy his room. He is physically aggressive and has smashed tables, windows and doors at my grandparents house.

He didn’t speak to my Grandad for over a year before he died after he smashed a window at his house with a stone.

Is there anything that I can say to him that will try to get him to stop getting so angry?

This morning, my nana had a breakdown and was on the point of tears with it all. He doesn’t really leave the house and spends much of his time on the internet - often until 5am and then sleeping throughout the day until 4pm. He’s not really even leaving the house anymore, despite consistent encouragement from family members.

Family members have booked GP appointments for him, and he has went to A and E, but he won’t go or engage after it.

Is there anything that can be said to him before he either gets himself into serious criminal trouble, or pushes my nana to a breakdown?

I was was going to call the Police this morning when he picked up a knife and threatened to harm himself, however my nana told me not to, as she has went through all of this before so many times with him that she knew he wasn’t really going to harm himself. I think it would break her heart if it came to that, as she has gave him so much over the years.   


Me and my mum visited the Urgent Care Centre today on his behalf. They couldn’t do anything except direct us to book an urgent appointment with his GP, who she said had a duty of care to come out and see him, and to call 999 straight away if anything like what happened this morning repeated.   


He he has had so many family members support him and help him through the rough patch he is going through. My mum even booked him a double GP appointment so he had plenty of time to talk, but he refused to attend.   


I have offered to take him out for days away, but it is very difficult getting him out of the house and off of the internet. It seems as if he is addicted to the internet. The incident with my Grandad a few months ago because my Grandad turned off the WiFi in his house at 3am in the morning.

Is there any tips or advice for helping someone break, what appears to be, a very serious addiction to the internet? He says that he is speaking to people on various different time zones, meaning that he is staying up all night until 5-6am and then sleeping all day until 4pm, when he has dinner and goes back online. It is very difficult for any family member to get him out of the house. I have taken him to places like the cinema recently, and went for walks with him, but he always goes straight back on the computer when he gets back in.",01Aug2019,1
837,"I need some advice on what I should do in this situation. At day camp the other day, my cousin tried to take an extra Kit Kat bar at the lunch line. He was told to take only one, and that was it, until right after lunch. We saw the box that the Kit Kats came from, and I tried to take 1 extra. Unfortunately, my cousin tried to take **4** extra, and the lunch lady saw, and got upset. The camp counselor soon got very mad, and started to yell that in any other setting we would have serious legal consequences. I understand what I did wrong, and that I shouldn't do it again, but it gets worse. Today, my cousin and I were playing with a small ball of clay near the end of the camp day, and while I was subconsciously playing with the clay, I was trying to leave for the day. The counselor noticed the clay, and thought I was trying to STEAL it. She got upset and made us put it back. I was NOT trying to steal some crappy clay! While my cousin and I were waiting to be picked up by my dad,  the counselor walked over to us. She told us that because we tried to ""steal"" something twice, she has to report us to her boss, and she doesn't know what's going to happen to us now. She kept telling us that ""If there was a reason we were doing this"" she was there to talk to us. So, I'm not sure what's going to happen to us now that she's reporting us to her boss. I WASN'T EVEN TRYING TO STEAL THE DAMN CLAY. I may be confronted by some sort of authority tomorrow, or be on close watch. They are probably going to tell my parents about the ""stealing"".

841,"I've taken a pretty non-traditional route through life. I'm currently a 26 y/o male and have spent about 6 years as an EMT, some time running a (failed) business, I've worked security, and a couple other things.

Currently, I'm in school to be a financial planner. My school has a great program with tons of Alumni support. I'm set to graduate in spring of 2021.

I've done some coding work with and for my brother, who works as a data scientist. One of the failed businesses was making python programs for people. It failed mostly because we're both really bad at marketing.

There was an opening at my brothers job and I got hired as a data analyst. I work from home and set my own hours. Right now I'm on vacation, but still putting in hours. 

So far all my bosses are happy with me and my work, and I make $30/Hour (around 62k/year if I work full time, which I don't always because of school).

My plan had been to work this job while I'm going to school, and switch to financial planning when I graduate. My plan was to work 3-5 years as a financial planner, get my CFP certification, then start my own firm.

Well, on this vacation my brother told me I could probably double my salary once I get my Bachelors. My boss told me something similar. Most people on my team make $90/hour. This is way more than I could reasonably expect to make as a CFP until I opened a business.

I do like the data science job, especially because I can work from wherever. I've always loved traveling, and my brother travels all the time while still working.

If I worked in financial planning, remote working would likely be impossible, and vacation time would be much less. Most firms are also single locations, so I wouldn't be able to move around unless I hopped jobs. I'd also make far less money, until I started a firm where I'd have the ability, but not the garuntee, to make more. 

Should I stick with data science? Or go into financial planning like I was planning.",01Aug2019,1

849,"So, as the title states my family strongly believes that one of my siblings is suffering from untreated schizophrenia and is beginning to having suicidal tendencies. 

For some back story, he is a 21 year old male who frequently smokes marijuana and recently began messing around with mushrooms and PCP. He has always been rather quiet and kept to himself. He got into marijuana in the last year of high school and that’s really when his behavior started to have some drastic changes. He will lash out and have these outbursts of rage and hysterics that aren’t characteristic of someone in the right state of mind. While my mother and youngest brother were visiting him in a recent trip (he lives in Cali and we live on the east coast) he apparently had a hysterical episode while at a Dodgers baseball game because my younger brother made a sarcastic comment towards my mother. Hysterical to the point where my mother thought he was going to physically harm my brother. And this was only one episode of many from their trip of 5 days. He has also been creating phantom illnesses that he is convinced only marijuana can help. My uncle on the west coast paid for him to see a chiropractor for his joint and back pain to which the doctor determined was non-existent. The outbursts, phantom illnesses, comments about things that aren’t real/happening are all pointing to someone with borderline schizophrenia. And to top it off, recently he started making suicidal comments. Or comments that I would consider are something that would come from someone with suicidal thoughts. While my mom and brother were on there trip he apparently started making comments like, “I’m tired of being sick. I’ve felt sick my whole life and I’m tired of it.” As well as texts to my uncle like, “Hope to see you if I’m still around when you get back.” Frequent comments along the lines of “I want it to end.”

My parents, brother and myself are beside ourselves on what to do because he refuses to stop the drugs as he is convinced they are what’s “saving him”. One of his friends even called the police to go check on him after a phone call because they were so worried by his behavior over the phone. 

**TLDR**:
My brother M(21), a marijuana smoker and recent shroom/pcp user, has been having psychotic outbursts and phantom illnesses over the past 2 years. Recently he has been making suicidal comments, but refuses to see medical help to find a diagnosis. He is convinced that marijuana is the only thing saving him, but in reality it can be the cause of outbursts and more sever delusions from someone who suffers from schizophrenia.",01Aug2019,1

Global warming is so bad, an introved need to show up

*Annoying story:* When I was a young boy, I was hypersensitive and get bullied. I decided to isolate myself and finished for 16 year in a forest (with my home and my computer of course). It was my principal shelter with all the shit I wasn't able to deal with, especially social. By dint of staying with the trees, animals just know that they can't get ride of me and decide just to continue their life with me (they certainly got used to my smell). It allow me to see a lot of animals (especially boar, fox and deer) doing stuff even when I wasn't hiding. I remember that a wholesome couple of deer was shocked after saw me pissing, we stare at each other with a big embarrassment and walk away. Yep, animals are not so different from us...

So yeah, animals (with a good friend of mine and my parents ) was my social and I am ok with it.

But one month, I noticed that there was less animals than usual, and the next month, they was all disappeared.

With a lot of difficulty (I had to talk with humans) , I went in the nearest hunting center to check what's going one and learn that: water is no more. 

All the stream are dry du to a low rivers du to, you named it: global warming.

So for the next 2 years, I study what is global warming and starting little project to improve the forest life: pick up trash, make funny drawing and hide it in the trees so humans get interested by the forest, water trees, ect... But water don't come back and trees start dying.

He also plays the victim whenever he gets told off for whatever he does.

I met up with friends of mine and we smoked weed as we sometimes do. It took a long time to find a spot and I already started to get nervous. When we did we started a joint and someone took a few hits first and then me. As I was breathing it in I saw a flash from a phone to my right and a dark silhouette behind it. They then disappeared.

I felt nothing at first and we all got up and left the scene. As we started walking I felt an overwhelming sense of dread. I stopped talking to everyone else and tried not to burst crying. They tried to convince me it wasn't a big deal but to no avail. We half to walk in a public face and anyone who looked like that silhouette made me freak out more.

I went home early, desperately needing some alone time. When I entered home (we live in a small studio apartment during the summer) I was met with my mother who just arrived after 5 days of me being alone at home. I couldn't handle seeing her. The only reason I was kind of alright with her being here was the fact that she would bring some of my packages I ordered online from out pernamently home. I asked about them and she said they arrived and said she didn't bring them. She knew I wanted them. She was doing it on purpose to punish me. For what, I don't know. I bursted out of the apartment and started walking and crying.

Now I'm sitting in a forest with nowhere to go. It's midnight and I have work in the morning. I can't face her and I just want to be alone but that's not possible in our small apartment. I don't have anything with me, just my phone and headphones. Somebody help.",01Aug2019,2

A little of a weird question but:

I've met a guy. He is really nice and sweet. We get along greatly and like talking to each other a lot. For now, everything is going well.. I'm just curious (if this even can be asked) how can I keep things sweet and simple with him? I don't want to ruin a nice situation.

864,"After my (22F) first relationship with someone I suspect just wanted sex, I don't want to make that mistake again. I've had sex once but that was enough to set me straight. Obviously, everyone wants sex, me included, but I don't want to sleep with every person I date. I find that if you don't want to rush things, some men (or women) will just bide their time and ""wait"" for to change your mind. But, you also don't want to make them feel undesired especially if you're not willing to do ""other stuff"". 

It's just frustrating because to me sex has started to become too normalized to the point where everybody expects it. I've heard stories of men with women for like 1 or 2 years and she sleeps with him and something magically happens to where he doesn't want to be with her anymore. Someone ""leaving me"" isn't the issue but rather how easily someone can manipulate and lie to you so much that your blindsighted. Like two-faced people. It's like if someone pretends to be financially stable and you realize that they are money frauds, idk. You get the point.

Any tips? Do I just listen to my intuition or look for compatibility and someone who thinks the same?",01Aug2019,1
865,"
Long story short, I’ve (F20) been having an intense staring contest at work with another retail worker (18-20M) who works across from me for about a month, maybe longer?.. Every-time we work together he stares at me my whole shift, watches me up &amp; down when I walk around, moves to other parts of his store when I do so he can see me better, when guys come up to me he stops what he’s doing and starts staring into my soul, stands behind racks at his store so I can’t see him looking but I can still see his eyes watching me, his co-workers also always watch me when he’s there and when he’s not, sometimes I’ll finally look at him back and we will just hold eye contact for what feels like minutes. 
Should I just go over there and talk to him?? What should I say?? Or is it maybe just a coincidence that he’s always staring at me every day we work? 
I thought maybe I was just a nice ass to look at but if so, why so much eye contact???
I’d like to make a move, if he won’t, but I also don’t wanna emasculate him.  
I suck at flirting so any advice helps!
Thank you!",01Aug2019,1
866,"To start to this off, I’m going to give a little background on my relationship. I [f21] have been dating my boyfriend [m22] for almost 2 years in a week. Over the past 2 years we’ve had many issues. I would get jealous easily and feel insecure causing trust issues. In the span of our first month dating we broke up many times and it didn’t stop till we moved in with each other which was a little more than a year ago. I would always accuse him of cheating on me and these insecurities of mine stopped him from doing some things he wanted to do and same for me. 

Recently I’ve realized we both haven’t personally grown and our relationship has felt more like I'm a mother figure to him rather than me feeling like his girlfriend. I don't get as much attention from him because he works so much and lets out stress on me by being angry. And when he doesn't work and we have time together he is more focused on his hobbies than enjoying some quality time together. Another I think I realized was that I became very dependent on him and I want to become independent. 


We both have the same friend group and recently I had the chance to go on a trip with a couple of them while he stayed home because of work. During the trip I quickly connected with one of the guys. I was weirded out by it but I kept pursuing it. We got along so well and I was the attention i've been missing in my relationship. We flirted a lot and even spoke about the fact that we feel a connection. On our way back from the trip we got a little touchy over our clothes since we were in a car with other people. 


I feel extremely guilty and honestly can't believe I let it get that far and even pursued it in the beginning. I've spoken about all of this to my boyfriend so he knows about the situation and that I have feelings for the other guy. We had plans of getting engaged at the end of September. Now that all of our relationship problems came to surface, I realized we're not ready for that.
I want to take a break but that would mean he has to go back to his old living situation which isn't the best. I'm scared his mental health will get bad again and he'll go back to his old bad habits. 
I'm not sure if it would be a good idea to repair our relationship and work through it or part and go in our  own ways.",01Aug2019,2
867,"This week, my brother's dog got loose and attacked someone in their neighborhood.  For some backstory; this dog was not always aggressive, he was traumatized by a man my mother allowed into the house to dog sit while we were out of town. Since then he's been protective of my brother, which I'm glad for. His autism prevents him from identifying dangerous situations sometimes, and does not particularly like people though he's never been one to outright attack. My mother, before her divorce was finalized last year, moved her new boyfriend and his kid in with us. When I moved out last year, I told them both my siblings and my dog I was leaving with my brother were all I cared about in that house. My mother and I do not and have never had a good relationship. For many reasons. So this week when the dog got loose it was because, against my advice, she didn't check doors or anything and instead let him run loose. The people he attacked didn't file any charges and animal control has only said he'd be quarantined then returned home. But even with that reassurance, I can't help but feel a very deep rage that borders hatred for my mother and her boyfriend for being careless. I've had this dog and his sister since they were 2 weeks old and they'll be 3 this year.

873,"So this will probably be long, so apologies in advanced.  


So me and my husband have been together for 8 years and married 5 of them. In that 8 years up until recently he's always been as healthy as can be. About a month and a half ago I noticed he started acting a little strange, he stopped going to see friends, he seemed to lose interest in a lot of things. After a few weeks of this I could just tell he wasn't right, he would try to put on a happy face around me but I could tell something was up. So I tried to talk about it with him, and he played it off like nothing was up. Then about a week later I asked if I could use his computer because his desktop is way better than my laptop and it was making me mad because the fucker wouldn't stop freezing. So I boot it up, open chrome and type in my website but browser shows that he recently searched ""I'm feeling depressed and I don't want my wife to find out"". I was shocked, I didn't know what to think about it at the time, so I just let it go for a couple days but it just stayed in my head so I decided I should confront him about it. When confronted with me knowing about that search in his history he finally came clean that he had in fact been feeling depressed. I asked if he was willing to talk about it, and he asked if he could talk about another time when he is ready, which I agree to.

&amp;#x200B;

About a week later he comes to me and says he's ready to talk about it. So he tells me he feels like a shitty person because I make most of the income and he doesn't provide much and he feels like shit because he can't hold onto a decent paying job for long. For some background, it is true that he hasn't held onto a ""well paying"" job for long in his life. He worked at a grocery store for about 5 years including before I met him, then when he moved into me when I was still living with my parents, he tried to work all kinds of ""blue collar"" jobs so he could pitch in for us getting an appartment together and he couldn't hold onto one of them for more than a few months. However I ended up getting a really well paying job so it didn't matter, we were able to get a decent size house in a nice middle class neighborhood, we live comfortably and we still are able to afford to go on vacations and stuff all on my income alone. But he ended up landing a security job that he has worked for almost 3 years now. He doesn't make much money but it provides extra income we typically put to weekend getaways or vacations. Anyhow back to the point, he says he feels like a leech that can't even provide for himself, because he lived with his parents until he moved in with me. And he feels he just transitioned from leeching off them to leeching off me. I told him I don't give a shit about how much money we make because he's been the best husband I could of ever dreamed of. He could not work at all for all I care, he does more than his fair share of the housework, does all the cooking, and always has something fun for us to do. He responded to that I deserve better than someone who has to live of their spouses income. A few days later he also mentioned that his dad(who is an abusive dickhead) always laments that neither of his sons can support themselves and both of them are deadbeats who live on the work of others.(He has an older brother that lives with his grandma and works a min wage job and obviously can't support himself). He mentioned when he was a kid he wanted to surpass his brother but they ended up being the same.   


So here I am now, I don't know what the fuck I should do if anything. Should I try to support him as much as possible? Should I give him space to let him work through it? Should I encourage him to seek out a therapist? I really don't know because he's never been like this before in the 8 years I've been with him.

I also have a Switch with 6 games, all which I bought myself. None of my games were purchased with my parents' money, as I have an allowance and use it to buy personal items like games. Also, maybe it's relevant that I have most of The Sims 4 DLC (yes, I know, DLC is bad, EA is evil, but it is by far my favourite game and I do almost always buy DLC when it's half off), and he seems to not understand the concept of DLC and thinks they're all separate games, even after I tried to explain.

875,"I’m a 14-year-old female, and my brother and I go to this day camp every summer. Most of the counselors there are in late high school or college, so it’s easier for them to bond with all the kids. One of the counselors (the leader of my brother’s cabin) is loved by everyone there. I’m almost positive he’s in college, because he looks to be in his early to mid-twenties. He’s funny, cute, outgoing and caring, so naturally he’s quite popular among the campers and the other counselors. He’s totally my type, physically and personality-wise, and I’ve recently developed the biggest crush on him. I think about and look at him constantly, and I always participate in any activity he’s leading. He’s caught me looking at him a few times, too. 

I’m not super close to him compared with some of the other camp counselors, since the cabin he leads rarely interacts with my own cabin. We talk every now and then and he taught me how to juggle, and he even knew my name without me ever telling him what it is. This may just be because he knows my brother pretty well, but I’m not sure since I don’t really know him that well. I’ll be a CIT next year, so I might be able to get closer to him then.

I don’t really know what to do though. I know it’s unrealistic to hope he likes me back, since I’m 14 and he’s in his 20s, but I’m also not used to letting crushes slip through my fingers- I usually try to make a move. What should I do?",01Aug2019,0

Where do I start. So at the start of high school I basically was bullied and treated like shit to the point people won't respect me. Right now I'm 20 about to turn 21 so basically 7 years of problems being built up. I closed my self off from the rest of the world including my parents and lost all confidence in my self cause every where I go and meet new ppl I would get treated like crap and get used by everyone. Cause I closed my self off I lost sight in life and just played video games and went to school and gym and barely went out unless it's the movies. My parents basically forced me to go out and yell at me to stop playing video games because they won't take u anywhere in life. So I have decided to download tinder and chat with ppl but nothing worked after a year. One of my friends just told me to go hire a escort which will solve all my problem. I finally Listen to him. I decided to hire a escort cause I wanted to know what it felt like to have some sort close relationship with a girl. After that I felt extremely nice and felt like I was wanted in life again.

887,"In order for you to understand why I don’t want to go, I have to say the whole background story. 

Let me start off by saying, my mother has been engaged 10 times, and married 4 times. While she was engaged with her 3rd fiancée, my mother had three different one night stands (that we know of) and that produced me. She told her fiancée that it was his child. They got married, she cheated, went to court, got 50/50 custody (because no one didn’t a paternity test??). 

She proceeded to move around a lot, got engaged a lot, and then married again to a convicted pedophile (while she had a 2 year old daughter). She “didn’t know”, he was arrested again after molesting the neighbor’s 5 year old daughter. He’s serving a life sentence. She married again to a different man, and had two children with him. They decided to tell me that was my biological father, and had him adopt me after the 1st husband realized I wasn’t his kid. After two years, they divorce because she cheated on him with their mutual friend, and I rarely saw the man I believed was my father. I was devastated growing up because I thought my “dad” wanted my brothers but not me. I told my mom this every year of my life and she used to hold me as I cried. 

The man she cheated on him with was an abusive, diagnosed sociopath, bi-polar, and drug addict. She dated him for seven years even though he beat her and threatened her. They married, and it was her longest marriage. They married in 2012 and divorced in July 2018. Even though they have been living in separate homes since 2015.  She also cheated on him with our next door neighbor for years. 

After they divorced, my mom started online dating and went crazy overboard. She had two phones so she could talk to more guys. At one point, she regularly had 7 guys cycling out of her house daily. One of them was this guy we are gonna call “Ted”. They started dating in November of 2018, I met him, complete douchebag. I was there for one week and the entire time was a cycle. They would fight at night and throw things, the next morning she would be crying with him on the phone for hours because he would leave, then he would return with some fancy gift, they would cook dinner and be happy, and then start fighting again. He proposed to her on Christmas after breaking up 4 times. I wasn’t invited to Christmas because “Ted” spent 5,000 each on my brothers, 10,000 on my mom, and didn’t get me anything so they didn’t invite me. So, I didn’t know they got engaged, but my mom sent me a photo of the ring. I asked if they were engaged (because the ring was on the left hand) and she said no. 

Side note: when I met “Ted”, I just learned my “dad” wasn’t my “dad” and I had just begun the search to find my biological father. “Ted” told me to get over it and not be upset about it because it doesn’t matter. 

Fast forward, two months ago, my brothers were in Florida and I asked why. They said “oh mom is looking at new houses so we can move here after the wedding.” I called my mom, she insisted they were not getting married. She lied to her entire family (mom, sisters, me, etc.) for months. Then when she told everyone they were  engaged and had no plans, but everything had already been paid for in full. I told everyone the truth. She finally told me the truth, and I was upset because she constantly lied. Btw, she still had that second phone until last month to contact other men. 

She is getting married in 7 days, and I just learned this man has two kids and grandkids. She is also upset because no one has RSVP’d to her wedding (because she was constantly lying to everyone and they are mad). I’m her daughter, and I don’t want to go to her wedding because of all of that and she lied to me for 21 years about who my father was. She has made poor choices about the men she has married, and is rushing into it again while neglecting my brothers who will now have to move to finish their senior and junior year in a different state. 

I am angry, but I also don’t know what to do. I wish she would just see what she is doing is beyond stupid. I don’t want to go to this wedding, especially since I don’t even know the mans last name. Would I be wrong for me not to go? My family says I have to go because it’s “the right thing to do” even though they disagree with the wedding too. No one wants to say anything, and they all say “maybe this one will be better, if not then maybe the next one”. 
Is it wrong to not go? Even if my hotel is already paid for?",01Aug2019,12
888," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.iv seen dudes sit there and she seems different and happy and then she’s all bubbly then as opposed to her usually being snotty af


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",01Aug2019,0
889,"Me and 2 other friends (all 19m) went on a fishing trip pretty far away. On the way back I had my one friend J navigating while G sat in the back. We had no more cash so couldn't take toll roads, but J ended up putting me on one anyway by mistake. At this moment, I knew that I had no cash but assumed someone else did (no one did). So we ended up having to run through the toll without paying leaving me with a 60 dollar ticket. 

&amp;#x200B;

We were having difficulty with the navigation prior to me taking the toll road, but G didn't do anything to help. Considering that it is mainly the navigator and my own fault, I only asked G to pay 10 because while it wasn't directly his doing, he could've helped or at least mentioned he had no cash.

892,"Been married for 7 months. We got married quick. I do not and will not regret marrying this man. I love him with everything I have. We are both caving under the pressure. I pretty much started rebuilding my life when we got married. I have a 5 year old daughter. There’s some custody stuff happening that could get dirty and already has gotten really dirty. My husband went from single with not much responsibility, to worrying about me and my daughter and our finances are not good. We are both working a lot of hours, but only get paid $10 an hour. 

Rebuilding has been incredibly hard. We got a place. We should be getting a car very soon. My parents are now fully supportive (as far as emotionally and helping us with my daughter and custody and everything) we are figuring it out, but it can be really overwhelming. 

My life is way more to handle than my husband had expected and I can’t blame him for how he feels, but as much as I want to give up everything I know I can’t. He can... I know he loves me. But I don’t want to kill him with pressure. I try to tell him we are doing everything we can and even though it’s taking time things are slowly coming together, but with how much stress is involved it feels like they aren’t. I don’t want him to cave. I’ve always had the notion in me of fight for what you love, but I think my life may be too much.

And after them she came in touch with me. And i did (and do) like her. And after a while she actually became my girlfriend. My first girlfriend. 
I am so happy with her in my life but sometimes it hurts so much because it feels like i wasn’t her first choice. And i wasn’t.

And now. A guy she got rejected by likes her. And they talk a lot. And it hurts so much cause he says shit like: if you weren’t in a relationship now i would like to be with you. And my girlfriend does keep in touch with him. 
I am sk afraid to lose her. I love her with my whole hearth. But it does hurt. I asked her a couple of times if she wanted to stop having contact with him. She said yes. But after a few days i saw her speaking with him again.

About a month ago they broke up and she moved out, thank goodness. He can't get over her and so they just kept it as friends and she keeps coming over. We already discussed with him that her presence makes us uncomfortable. We don't come out of our room when she is over, this includes my mother. My brother has told us that it's his life and he can bring over whomever he wants, even though it's not his house but my parents. He says we need to change our mentality and get over being uncomfortable. I'm not liking the fact that its ALWAYS our mentality that is wrong, compared to his.

Someone thankfully picked up my shift on Friday, but not on Saturday or Sunday. Saturday it wouldn't be a problem if I called in, because there are 3 other people working that night (2 per station). However, on Sunday night it's only me and 1 other girl, so calling in would leave her on her own and cause them to have to put someone from another department on my station. It's not like ot can't be done, and that station is incredibly easy. I just don't know if I should call in for sunday as well as saturday or not. I also didn't realize until my schedule was posted that my time off request was never approved, and my manager left for vacation right after posting the schedule, and he's really the only manager that can do anything about it. I messaged him already just in case, but I doubt he'll get back to me. This is my first job, I've had it since March. I've never missed a shift or called in. I've only ever dropped shifts, and I always show up if no one picks it up. I also submitted a new availability request that was never approved either, which is also why I'm working sunday night instead of Sunday morning like I should be. I don't know if it's my fault for submitting the time off kind of last minute (although it was over a week ago) or for not following up, but I'm not sure what to do, or how to call in, since all of my coworkers know why I'm dropping the shifts, I can't just say I'm sick.

902,"-Heads up if i just start ranting in this it's because i'm very emotional at the moment.- My boyfriend (I'll call B) and I stared working at the same coffee shop. We started dating few weeks later. Talked to the manager, it is completely fine if 2 employees date but it cannot be a shift dating an employee. Has to be a shift dating a shift or an employee dating an employee. B and I have been keeping it very professional, he closes and I open. We made it that way so we didnt work together JUST in case anyone would get uncomfortable. We have kept home life at home, if we had an argument we'd text eachother on breaks. Honestly it would get resolved because we would treat eachother nicely since we're at work and it would make both of us feel better. ANYWAYS-

One of the shift leads, who I will name Mark,  was very nice and friendly BEFORE he found out me and B were dating. He's very cold and unfriendly to me now. On 2 seperate occasions he told me I could be fired. 1. That's a lie i made sure with the manager before, 2. It felt like a threat. I really felt my job was in jeopardy. He's overally nice to B, has called B cute on several occasions. Has made B cancel a date with me (even when B said NO) to hang out at our place. He didnt really give B an option. B felt intimidated because he is kinda above us so he tried doing what he felt was right. I'm not that nice i hate when people invite themselves over. (This all has happened in the last 2 weeks ok im very irritated) -Let me add, I was fine with him being friends with B, it didnt bother me I really felt he was just being nice. I wanted to believe he had no bad intentions. Mark is engaged also. - 

So onto another situation. I was working and about to get off work, Mark comes in for a drink, see's me and then goes outside to make a call. I get off my shift and start to head home, B calls me. (Dont talk and drive dont text and drive) i answer and he says ""Mark just told me he's on his way"" i reply with ""oh did you invite him over"" B says ""No, he just called me and told me and that was it, what do i do?"". Clearly B is a little uncomfortable so i respond with ""tell him you're taking me out at (insert location that's far out of the way)"" -B and i live 20-30 minutes away from work so everything is kinda out of the way for us but mark lives 5 minutes from work- B makes the excuse, Mark is clearly mad trying to butt into our plans again. The next day B was worried about going into work, i take him to work everything seems fine. Mark makes him do a bunch of pointless tasks, leads him to do it the incorrect way and B was kinda scolded by another shift. I everything seems fine after that. 

I was exhausted from opening, I pick B up we get food and I pass out while eating. Mark calls B very late at night asking ""Hey my fiancé is asleep want to come over?"" B says no. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Now today our manager tells us one of us has to get transferred and we have to decide which one of us. He and i talked privately and we'll both be leaving. I have felt harassed by Mark because he has been very awful and has threatened to have me transferred. B has also been harassed by him, he is very uncomfortable with him and he has to close with just him. It's all at once. B and i work as hard as we can, we get the most hours because we are always there when they need. I feel really sick about it and need to find the best way to approach this. ~Mark has been transfered before, his old coworker, who im friends with, was being sexually harassed by him and had to transfer, mark has also had a crush on another lead AND HE left a few weeks ago as well-

TDLR: mark (m23)has called B(m21) cute during work several occasions, asked him over at an inappropriate time, tries showing up to his house when he knew I (f21)wasnt there, has treated me like shit and threatened my job

Sorry this is going to be a long one. I am on a throw away account for reasons that will become obvious.  

My wife of 11 years we have been dating since high school been together for about 18 years now. We have four amazing kids together 12, 10, 8, 6. The problem is this she has been addicted to pain medicine of all types for the last 7 years the last three years have been the worst. She was buying them from dealers spending anywhere from 2,000 to 3,500 a month most of the time my whole paycheck. I finally got her to stop buying them and admit she has a problem but not after losing full paid off home three apartments. Now we are homeless for the third time. She is still addicted getting them form family doctors. In addition, she using muscle relaxers and gabapentin when she has them. If she high she wants to be close to me while slurring her speech and wants to be together which make my skin crawl. If she out she is sleeping or seconds away from losing he mind at everyone. I am working full time and making okay money but for use to get into a three bedroom apartment we need about 600 hundred more a month. She refuses to work calming pain but will walk 3 miles one way for pain meds or the chance of pain meds. I do not know what to do I am using all my will and patience not to go off on her. I just need advice on what to do or how to save my family at least me and at least kids. I have Nar-Aron a couple of times and it help a little I do not have the time or gas right now to go to the meetings. There a lot more I just do not want to completely overdo the wall of text.

To put it bluntly, she gets upset by everything. If I tell her I can't hang out one day, or I have plans with someone else she gets upset with me. If i try to rearrange plans or have to cancel last minute, she's passive aggressive and tells me it's ""fine"", but I know she's absolutely pissed. If I make plans with another friend, she asks if I can leave them early to hang out with her or if she can come. Quite honestly it's become annoying and it makes me not want to see her. I don't get excited to see her anymore because I almost feel forced into plans. 

She always asks for my opinion of things and then gets upset when it's not what she wants to hear. I think friends should be honest with each other but she immediately gets offended and becomes frustrated when I give her what she asked for. 

She also has the absolute worst habit of making EVERYTHING about her boyfriend. They haven't even been dating a year but she always brings him up in conversation, to there point where it becomes obnoxious. I feel like I can never tell her things about my relationship because she turns it into a competition almost and turns back around to her. 

Sorry for the rant but I feel so lost right now. I'm sad because I can feel the friendship slipping away but we've had some good times together and she's helped me through a lot of stuff. I'm more than willing to talk to her about it but like I already said, she takes everything to heart and would be absolutely pissed if I said anything to her.

907,"This has been an issue for pretty much my entire life. Food (eating) has been a problem for as long as I can remember but I don't know how to tackle it.

I don't have an eating disorder like anorexia. I eat, I'm not focused on calories or losing weight. I'm not afraid to eat sweets (quite the opposite). I can eat a whole bag of sweets by myself in just a few days. I'm underweight and don't lose or gain weight, anyway.

However; I can't seem to eat enough. I'm barely hungry and I'm full before anyone else. I can go days with just eating dinner and a cookie here and there until my body is weak and shaky and only then I'll realize how much I've not eaten. Somehow I can't get myself to eat breakfast (or anything at all) if there's no one around. If my family is home, its easier to do. They'll be eating so I'll just eat too. 

I have this mental issue that made it nearly impossible to finish my plate. I'd eat 3/4 of what was on my plate and my mind would be like; 'ok enough you're full now.' I wouldn't eat more. I simply didn't, no matter what. I once ran away from home because my father tried to force me to eat. This isn't really a problem anymore since my boyfriend is very caring and makes sure I eat and just sits there with me so I don't have to stress about finishing it fast, I can just take my time. 

I don't know how much of this really is an issue or if I'm just making it up. Does anyone recognize this? Does anyone have any advice?

909,"I will probably end up deleting this shortly out of embarrassment, but how do you handle being discouraged in your love life?

I am not necessarily desperately longing for a relationship, and am at a pretty good place overall in every other aspect of my life. I have a fun social life and a lot of really great friends, a good job, graduated college, live on my own, etc. I just feel like I'm finally ready and in a good spot to have a relationship and keep encountering stupid set backs. In the past few months I have been ghosted twice by two separate people that I was seeing very consistently, and was getting really excited about (even though I tried not to get my hopes up). It just sucks feeling like there must be something wrong with me.

I (25F) feel like I'm ready to 'settle down', not right now exactly but I'm ready to meet someone that I can build a future with and it's shitty to see that with someone and be ghosted with no explanation, and happening twice in a row has dismantled my self confidence. I've had serious long term relationships before, even living with an SO at a point but got out of there due to abuse, and in the 3 years since that bad relationship its been a consistent stream of seeing someone for 3-4 months, then it either fizzling out or now the past 2 have just ghosted. 

I keep deleting tinder because it darks me out, then I get lonely and bored and redownload, just to be disappointed again. The only IRL place I meet dudes has been at the bar, but that never goes anywhere good for obvious reasons.

I guess the advice I need is just how do you deal with dating and rejection without feeling completely hopeless about your romantic future? I get a lot of 'focus on yourself, have fun, enjoy being single!' but that's exactly what I've done for the last 3 years and I'm just so bored of it. I have several friends moving into the marriage and kids part of life and that's something I want in the next 5 years, but dudes my age or the ones I meet just waste my time.

912,"Both our first serious relationship, lost his virginity to me, he was in love with me. We were perfect for each other for a year and then we started fighting and I’m pretty sure it stemmed from me not saying I was in love with him.

I was young and uncertain.  I’m so embarrassed at how I handled it and that I never said it.  In my second serious relationship (several years later) I realized I was definitely in love with him.

We broke up and then had an on and off relationship for about 3 years.  He wasn’t perfect and was sometimes emotionally abusive, but for the most part it wasn’t directed entirely at me if that makes sense.  He was just so frustrated for the reason above.  I really don’t want to talk down on him because in hindsight I think I put him through a lot of hell.

I think he hates me now, blocked me on everything. The last thing he said to me was along the lines of “you don’t know what you’ve done to me”.

He wasn’t perfect, and I would never get back together with him.  But it tears me apart knowing he’ll never know.  I’m scared if I tell him he’ll think we actually have a real shot.  But we don’t because of the things he’s done out of frustration.

On one hand, I think he deserves to know and it might help heal him and show him that nothing was wrong with him.  On the other hand, it may make it worse and he’ll be angry at me for giving a chance of hope when there is none.

So me and 3 friends moved into a new fully furnished apartment. With it being furnished, we just moved in and saw our fortnite desks, etc. I need a desk that is large enough for my 3xl mouse pad and PC set up, and I need to be able to scoot my chair under it. It’s just what I need to have my set up. My desk doesn’t allow my chair to scoot fully under because it gets blocked by something on the bottom, and it generally just isn’t conducive to my set up. It’s a normal wood color, as is a lot of the furniture in the apartment.


My roommates desk does allow for chair movement fully under (Keep in mind, most people don’t need this). It also looks nicer because it’s slick black and more modern looking. His chair does fit under my desk all the way if he wants, and my chair fits under his. His does look nicer, but he only uses his desk to study or put miscellaneous shit on it, while I study and use a whole computer/monitor. He’s a good friend and this isn’t at all to call him out, but how do I convince him to swap?

He literally said to me “this one desk makes my room look nice and if I wasn’t selfish I’d swap.” But the kicker is, we random drew rooms and I got the room with the worst layout and it seems smaller, and all my roommates agree on this.

918,"Bracing myself for condescending comments ha. Anyway, I'm a 21 year old girl who for some reason is only attracted to guys who are 30+. I don't know why but a few years ago, a switch flipped in my head and ever since I haven't been into anyone younger than 30. As a result, I get myself into lots of pointless and even mentally detrimental situations. I know for a fact the guys I'm talking to will never date me. I know it's stupid, pointless, and a waste of time to entertain anyone that much older than me. I'm tired of getting used for sex. My problem is that I base my self worth on how much male attention I'm getting. I think I need to stop dating/having sex until I'm in a better place mentally and can be into guys my age or until I'm older. I just need to know if there's anything I can do to make it easier for me to get used to this. I know this is a problem best discussed in therapy (starting back up this month) but if anyone has any advice to share it would be greatly appreciated.",01Aug2019,2

920,"I have only a few real good friends in my life, and I value them alot. So much that if someone wrongs them, like really upsets them and is mean to them, I automatically dislike this person and distance myself from them. I don’t want to associate myself with someone who has hurt the people I care about. 

But my bestfriend is somewhat of a different view. When I have asked her about her opinion on this, she doesn’t think that you should dislike someone if they haven’t necessarily directly wronged you. If a common friend were to hurt me, she says she wouldn’t know if she could automatically distance herself from that friend. I know myself that if she was in the position to be wronged, distancing myself from that friend would be the right thing for me to do personally.

I know that the most grown up thing to do probably is to not be angry on behalf of others. And I wouldn’t ask my friends to unfriend someone on my behalf.. I just wish they felt like doing it either way. 

I strongly value loyalty when it comes to friendships, thats just how I am. I know that this might not be a priority to all, but to me it is important. But I feel like my views on this are problematic, and I keep overthinking it. 

How can I cope with these feelings? I am respectful of my bestfriend’s opinions, but it is still nagging me because to me, it feels like disloyalty.  

Writing this, I realize how petty and controlling I sound, but I hope some of you will advice me regardless. I am trying to better myself!",01Aug2019,1
921,"I just started a job working in a research lab and I love the people and what I do. However my coworker, who has only worked there for 9 months more, thinks she is superior. She constantly tells other people that I was only hired so she can take lunch and others have told me that that is what she is telling people. She also has said to my face that x tasks are now mine because I’m new and that she doesn’t have to do them anymore. In addition, when she is bored she will try to split my work for me so that she can do something (even though there’s no reason for 2 people to do it). She has also explicitly said I am not allowed to take a day off during the holidays since she has seniority over me, but my actual boss has never said that nor rejected my request for vacation. (I’m not saying I don’t understand where she’s coming from since I’m new but the tone is just off). In case you were wondering what she does with all her new free time, she sits at her desk and watches YouTube videos on her phone. 

I’m happy to do the tasks if she didn’t say it in that manner or I’m not busy doing a task my boss assigned. Are my feelings unjustified? Should I just ignore her? To my knowledge everyone thinks she’s super nice since they aren’t directly working with her.

I know I want to be in law for sure but I’ve also been extremely interested in being a freelance war videographer/documenting conflicts.

Never really thought about it as a job or way to make money more of a small hobby project and something to reflect on later in life, maybe something to put on my resumes.

927,"My father is currently 68 years old and after his retirement and one of his gambling friend(who would set up game day once a week) moved away. My father has been mostly at home, usually in his room. Rarely any communication with me or my mother(as we just don't get along). He will go out maybe 3-4 times a month to meet up with some of his friends or brother. 

I think within the last couple months I've noticed that he would talk to himself a lot when he was at home and no one was in the same room as he is. He would repeat how his voice/tone was weird/different than before; things are not the same like before, back then was different; no air to speak; this is weird. 

Should I mention this to him?

When I bring this up to my mother, she just brushes it off and says (rough translation) ""because he smokes(cigarettes) too much, and if he stopped he wouldn't be like this"".

Do I bring this up to his PCP? How do I convince him to go to the doctor? Should I meet with his doctor privately without him? I'm not fond of his PCP as I have had his son as a PCP who would brush off any issues/concerns about my own personal health and am sure his father is the same way.

929,"Quick backstory me and my best friend have been in a undefined relationship for about a year and a half, they have told me in the past that they would want more and I’ve always tried to say we are just friends. I’ve tried to end it for the sake of their feelings and wanted them to go out and find someone to give them what they were looking for and they have always told me no they wanted to keep it how it was between us. I’ve also always been clear that I deeply care about them I just don’t know how to be in a relationship, not because I want to sleep around or anything I just don’t know how to accept and be loved without feeling like I’m going to lose that person. 

Last December they went on a date with someone and when I first heard about it it bothered me but I obviously had no right to be because of our set up and what I told them was to just be honest with me if that’s what they wanted I’ll step to the side right now and let them be free they refused again and I said okay then we just have to be open and honest with each other so if they ever felt they wanted to go out and date again just tell me. So over the next few months we went on trips together out of state, we celebrated birthdays all that. On one of our trips in March we got into a discussion about the future during brunch. Now I was about 6 margaritas in completely wasted and I’ll be very honest I panicked and said we are just friends again and then said We don’t know the future let’s not talk about this now. Honestly I just have a fear on relationships and I am always afraid of losing people I open up too but deep down I knew I was in love and just wanted as afraid to make it official. With that being said during the entire time we been in this situation I have never talked to or even thought about another person and they have always been my number one. Then one day in May we got into an argument and we stopped talking because we both thought each other wasn’t in the wrong. 

During that period they set me up with a job interview and I got the job that I I started in mid July. When I first received news I got the job I was so excited mainly because I’d be working next to them and I knew this would repair our relationship. I was hoping that we would reconnect and then we can be together in an official relationship. However I learned that was not the case, during the 2-3 weeks we weren’t talking they started dating again and by this point have been on about 2 dates with one specific person they liked. 

When I first heard it I tried to be okay about it but deep down I was Gutted because it just hurt so bad. During that time we didn’t speak all I thought about we them and trying to figure out ways to fix it so to find out they weren’t doing the same really hurt. We both went on vacations (separately) me going to the other side of the world. And while I was there we both continued to talk and exchange sexual conversation/pictures/videos etc. and one day while doing that I got left with no response. So the next day I asked what happened and they told me they were on the phone arguing with the person they are dating. I then said okay I shouldn’t have sent you those things etc and all their response was “it’s okay for now” and that honestly hurt me because it’s like okay this has an expiration date and you’re also keeping me around while having this other person. 

When I came back from my trip and I gave them all the gifts I got them we started talking and arguing about the situation. I just told them how I felt about everything and I was honest that I couldn’t go back to just being their friend and if they choose to pursue that I will have to move on but things will end. I know deep down I can’t be around while they are in a new relationship because it will hurt me. So working together has been interesting because we can be fine or I’ll be super depressed and then I tried to plead myself and they are just so cold towards me. They told me “The door is closed for now” because they want to see where this goes with the other person and it just makes me feel like I’m like a back up. I told them I don’t want this to be something we both regret because they are choosing to pursue a “potential” relationship that may lead to nothing and then because of that there’s nothing between us when we both clearly love each other. 

Yesterday while riding the train I saw a text message from the other person and it just sank my heart we had been having conversations and I felt things were a little better but then it all went to shit and we started talking and they straight up said “I’m seeing where this goes because the door is closed on us for now” I just feel so pushed away and I know myself when I move on they will become a stranger to me and I’ve said that not as a threat but just telling them how I am as a person. So I walked away from the conversation with the thought that our friendship is over and when we texted they said to me they needed time to think and figure things out with a clear mind. Do I just hope that things between us will change, do I move on, I so broken up by this I don’t know what to do.

He got upset with me and was sarcastic about me calling him weird for that and basically said that he would delete them but I was being annoying and he wouldn’t do anything with them and can’t believe I didn’t trust him to do that. I told him no partner has EVER saved nudes like that and have always asked if they wanted to save one like a gentleman. He said he had forgot about the dating all and was annoyed because he showed me his phone to gain trust and this is what he got (I mean he showed me his spank bank and I saw his dating app— he opened the other apps but not this one)

I told him I’ll see you when you get back from vacation (he leaves tomorrow morning to go to another state for a week and a half) and I’m left on read.

I said: Hey! I was wondering if you could you delete all my nudes from your spank bank? I didn’t know they were being stored and it makes me feel highly uncomfortable for my naked pics to be a part of your files. Sorry, I should have told you that before sending them! 

He said: Sure. Guess it just makes me feel like you don’t trust me still I don’t show them to peeps or anything but I will 

Me: I don’t wanna be a notch on your list of women who sent you nudes. Makes me feel weird

Me: Mmmm sure. Masturbating to pics of exes when dating someone is not anything I am accustomed to but maybe I’m more traditional 

Him: I do not to old ones I guess I just still have them. But porn online is acceptable to more peeps so I will just do that. You said you wouldn’t text me about issues we have at work.

Mini Update:

So I'll go ahead and apologize for spamming this subreddit the past few days, but it seems like I can't find a break to just breath and think.

If you read my posts, you would know that I spoke to my mother a few days ago and told her that I did not think I would be able to support her anymore. Well it got brought up again today and she officially told me to leave. She said that if I am not willing to financially help her, that I need to leave. She said on multiple occasions that she spends all of her money paying bills and that I simply don't understand what it's like. She also repeatedly said that I'm being immature and letting other people (specifically my sister who moved out years ago) get into my head.

I don't know how long I'll be allowed to stay. Our argument ended up becoming a screaming match at the end and I don't know if she'll end up kicking me out later today, tomorrow, or if I can stay till the end of the month.

Either way, I'll have to drop out of school this semester because I won't be able to afford school and living expenses. I guess I did end up giving my education for her.

I can stay at my sister's apartment for about a week at most. Her apartment complex doesn't allow visitors to stay for long. I'm looking around for jobs and apartments that I can afford for now, but it's gonna be tough for awhile.

Thank you everyone for your support so far none the less. Hopefully, my next update won't be so depressing.",01Aug2019,2

Hi everyone! I'm having a bit of a dilemma here. So, I am currently running for a position within my student government at my community college. It's a bit of a lower position without much power and last I heard, I was running unopposed.

The thing is, I have been considering switching my position and running for Vice President instead. I wasn't giving it much thought until one of the higher up employees at the school who is in charge of student government stuff said that they think I would fit as Vice President, especially since I want to run for president next spring.

2 other people are running for VP, so I would have to actually win the election. I know nothing about these people and am not sure if they have a ton of friends who could vote for them. I don't.

I have been working closely with my school, responding quickly to emails, and even represented my school at a multi-state-wide event at a large university. I have some experience and some good things under my belt, that people might would like about me.

I'm just unsure of what to do. I really, really want to run for president in the spring, but to run for that position you need to have served on the senate beforehand. If I lose the VP election, then I probably won't be able to run for president. But if I were VP, then I could get more experience in what it takes to be a good president. I would have a hand in planning events, working closely with the current president, and being in charge of bigger things.

The other position, Public Information Officer, might just be handed to me by default, but it mainly just involves advertising school events and working with the graphics department. I would be able to run for president if I had this position, but I'm not sure how much helpful experience I would gain.

I talked with the employee I mention earlier and they basically told me I would make an excellent VP and just need to really sell myself if it's what I want. I just need some outside advice that's not coming from my family or people connected with the school.",01Aug2019,1

We are trying to pick someone's home to have the shower at (we live in Arizona so outside is still too hot for the end of September, and budget wise a paid venue or event space won't work) Jenn's mom has offered her home to host, which objectively is the most logical place to host it.

I woke him up and he said he didn't order anything. 2 rolls of sushi is sitting in my fridge right now. Lol.",01Aug2019,1
956,"So I contribute for a fairly popular blog and was approached by a clothing brand to cover the launch of their new collection, the offer includes free clothes. So I asked my editor for the okay and this is what she said:

***""If you get to have free clothes sent to you, it's required that you send another set to our owner too, so please email her for her size and address.***

***BUT since they're a known brand, we can't do partnerships aka you get free stuff, please send me your contacts information and we will take over the situation for you""***

I automatically felt like they were trying to get the connection since it's a fairly expensive clothing brand.

But in my case its not my responsibility to tell them who reached out to me and how to contact that person since they don't pay me to contribute to the site.

What would you do if you were in my shoes?",01Aug2019,1
