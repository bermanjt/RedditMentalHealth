0,"I am good at video editing, camera work, and production, that is something I seemed to go towards in life from a young age. Used to direct my own live action and animated movies way back in 2003!

I have had friends before but I lost all of them.

Mental health is a serious issue at times. I lost like all my friends from a few mental slips where my emotions get out of control and i just get really depressed and lose it. 

I should probably get a therapist but that has been such a pain in the ass to find the right one I stopped going to them entirely when one of them had me locked up for talking about wanting to hurt myself.

I have surprisingly experienced romantic love before and it was so good it is the only thing I look forward to in life. The problem is I did way too many mind altering and psychedelic drugs by myself and I dont even know what “normal” is anymore. 

I live in an apartment by myself and make like 8$ an hour working like 10-20 hours a week at a pizza place, nowhere else would hire me. 

I am overwhelmed with everything I want to do in life and when I try to sit down to get started I just get overwhelmed.

I am trying to get off kratom. The withdrawals are pretty much as bad as regular opiates for me and its horrible to get off of. My mind is not working well and I am going crazy.

People see that someone has some mental problems, they drop you.

Why dont i just follow suit and drop myself? like seriously nobody wants me.

 i just need money and a good life long relationship thats all i need. is this possible? do the women reading this think im doomed?",01May2019,1
1,"(Sorry for bad writing in advance.) SoWe’re in middle school but he’s older than me (almost 15) because he got held back when he was younger. He recently got in trouble one too many times and his mom said she was taking him out of school. He’s not trying to protest or anything and I’m pretty sure he could convince his mom to let him go back to school. He’s not even sure if he’s going to do online school. I’m stressing out on his behalf because he doesn’t realize of bad he’s messing up his life. Middle school dropouts usually don’t end up in good places life, unless they’re wealthy, which we are not. I want to tell him how bad of an idea this is without sounding like I’m unsupportive of him. I want him to be happy, but he’s not a kid who hates school, so he can be happy and still get an education. I don’t think what I’m being rude by not agreeing with his decision we’re middle schoolers and we’re offended by everything.
 
Any way what should I do/say I can’t just sit back and watch him essentially ruin his life. 

Ps. I know he still has a chance at a good life but it’s been substantially lessened by his decision",01May2019,1
2,"I recently had to break off a 4 year friendship, me and this girl were close friends and would spend almost every weekend together. I had to break off this friendship because my other close took her own life and she hasn't spoken to me since. They didn't know each other. For me this felt like I had just lost my only two best friends in the whole world.  When I went back to school it was very hard for me to face everyone and I expected that we would be fine. I tried to talk to her but she would ignore me or make excuses to not hang out. She would ignore my messages and in our shared classes not even look me in the eye. My mum told me she just didn't know how to talk to me after what happened. But at the same time I needed someone to talk to. My friend took her life in December. I haven't spoken to my other friend in 6 months. She's made new friends and I've made new friends but deep down I still want to be close with her again. I know deep down that if she was going to leave me in a time like that and not even ask me if I was okay, that maybe our friendship wasn't as strong as I thought. The new friends I have are very sweet and ask me how I'm feeling if I'm down. I just find it very hard to get close to them and I'm struggling to get over the two friendships I thought I would have forever. If anyone has any advice it would be appreciated.",01May2019,2
3,"Hey everyone. I'm gonna try to make this as short as I can. I'm currently 19F and very healthy individual which took me a long time. I come from a dysfunctional family which I think more people have than they would like to admit. I am studying Psychology and really believe in mental health but it is hard for me to talk about some things, and I feel very uncomfortable saying it.
I was first sexually abused by my brother since I was a young girl. He would ask me to give him back massages or rub my private part against his, kiss him, and things like that. There was no penetration involved but I used to ask for things or to hang out and he would say ""Only if you do x and x."" My parents were divorced and my sister didn't live with us because my mom got custody, so I did it. I was around the ages of 5-6. I was always a very depressed child and saw therapists for as long as I remember, as my parents went through an absolutely nasty divorce.
My step-dad then touched me when my mom was away on vacation while I was sleeping. I used to pee on myself at around the age of 10 (its embarrassing and I don't know why it happened but it did) he said he only touched me to wake me up or see if I had peed on myself, but I know he touched me down there. I remember it very clearly and woke up to it. He always said very weird comments after that, like ""you look great have you been going to the gym?"" or ""I went into your room and it was dirty, why are your panties on the floor?"" shit like that. I told my mom about it when she came back from vacation and I was in 5th grade at the time. She went ballistic and would wake me up in the middle of the night when they were fighting, I told a counselor at school and police got involved, but my mom got pregnant and so we just dropped it. I just lived with it and we all pretended like it never happened.
I was then a very depressed kid, especially considering my brother started using a lot of drugs and was in and out of rehab, I was also pretty fat and hated myself in middle school. So since the age of 11 I was always cutting myself and trying to kill myself which ended up getting me baker acted and I was constantly in the psychiatric unit. I then was sent to a residential facility because of how often I was getting hospitalized for overdoses, cutting, or threats of suicide. I then go to the residential facility and I tried to kill myself there, so my parents took me out and decided it would be best to send me to Egypt (my parents are both full Egyptian). Anyways I go there and stay with my cousins. I had one male cousin the age of 24 and I was 13. We hung out a lot and I was always with his sister. He would always act flirtatious with me but I thought nothing of it. I was always told I had a more mature ""woman"" body at very young ages and so he would say the same thing. He started to kiss me, which happened the first ever time I met him when I was 11 but I was there only for a summer so I never said anything to my parents (this is very very shameful in the Arab culture). Then this time as I went back when I was 13 and he came into my cousins room one day (his sister) and started kissing me in the morning when everyone was gone. His sister was on vacation when he came into the room, and both his parents had work and I didn't even know but this is where I was living at the time. He directed me what to do and he penetrated that day and I lost my virginity to that nasty purple lipped smoking motherfucker. Anyways, he continued to rape me for about another month and a half. I should have told someone about all the touching he used to do leading up to that, but I was really scared. My parents were already really mad at me because of my depression, they just didn't culturally understand it, and I know its hard as they aren't really taught those things in Arab countries back then.
So I went back home finally and I didn't tell anyone for an entire year. Then one day I was in the kitchen and I dont know what happened but I was talking to my mom and I just blurted it all out and I told her what happened. She called my entire family in egypt and I was asked to marry my cousin and I went crazy. So I reported it to the police and my parents finally believed me and helped me through the process. We tried to do something about it in egypt but evidence was too late, so my cousin is still a free piece of shit probably doing this to who knows who else.
Fast forward a few years, my dad leaves where we are to go work and provide support for us because he just wasn't making enough. I was really depressed living at home with my mom and my step dad so once I got to high school everything got increasingly worse. I met the wrong crowd. I did drugs, passed out on drugs so many times that my drug dealer actually had non-consensual sex with me and I woke up naked but once again, nothing I can do because I was too intoxicated and only have very faint memory of some parts of it. So, I had sex with whoever, I prostituted myself for some time, I dropped out of school, ran away from home, got arrested, and then got court ordered to rehab. I ran away from rehab where I stayed on the beach. On the beach I found homeless people and stayed with them, and they gave me all the drugs. I was really fucked up and this guy who I did drugs with followed me when I said I was going to take a walk and then raped me on the really dark side of the beach near the pier. When that happened I knew I needed to get the fuck away.
Fast forward a few years I grew the fuck up, got sober, finished high school, I'm now in a great school studying psychology but sometimes I think of what happened with my brother. Don't get me wrong, I am a stronger person and I went through alot and I know that but I got some counseling and have learned that it is ok and that shit happens and not to beat myself up for it. I struggled with very unhealthy friendships and now I have a boyfriend and we are in a very healthy relationship and I learned from the past and have better ways of coping. But some days I feel so weird, it's so weird to think of what happened with my brother and I never talked about it. I don't even know if I should be thinking about it, it's just overall weird. He still is a druggie and does so many bad things. I just feel grossed out by myself sometimes. I am an adult now and I have nothing but good grades, good physical health, good mental health that is relatively stable (I have my sometimes depressed times), and I have goals in life that I really believe I can reach and I aspire to help others in the world.
What should I do about my brother dilemma? It bothers me sometimes. And note: I am finding a new psychologist to work with as mine was male and found it very uncomfortable. But I would like to hear what you all did!",01May2019,1
4,"I was absent at school today (to get stitches removed), and I am honestly a really good student, (4.0 gpa, top of the class, never gotten a detention) and while I was out, my English teacher said to my class, “not to point fingers, but the room is a lot more quiet now that (me) is gone” (I know this because my friends told me at our track meet that happens after I got my stitches out) I am really bothered by this, because I barley ever talk.

5,"So I think this girl's pretty cute (this might sound cliché, but I think her red hair, her accent and eyes are great) but I'm not sure if I should ask her out.

I have a few doubts about asking her out, because there's another guy I know who asked her out before and went on a date with her already.

Maybe she already likes this guy, maybe she'd say ""no"" if I ask her on a date.

I'm thinking about watching a movie with her at a theater, then maybe buy some ice cream later.

I talk to her almost every day, she seems to enjoy my company (smiles a lot and she asks me how I'm doing every single day).

Which I don't know which way she loves me but either way it make some really happy to hear her say I also made ""friendship"" bracelets i have heard people talking about how it's weird that I call her mom and how close we are.

7,"Hello. I’m 20m. 

I want to preface everything by saying that I love my family more than anything. They have done nothing but raise me to be the man I’m proud to be and I have nobody else but them to thank. With that being said, my independent nature is becoming stronger and the curfews and the house rules are starting to conflict. For instance; I’m not allowed to date. It’s a long story as to why but I’ll just make it short. I can’t date anyone outside of the religion. I’ll leave it at that. I’m done with that religion and even though I haven’t attended the religion in years, for some reason I’m still bound to those rules but I digress.


But for these reasons I can’t help but feel guilt. I’ll be the first of the nest to move out. My brother is 26 and is still living here because he likes it so much even he makes enough money to live on his own but he’s more dependent than I am. Not a bash by any means, it’s just the facts. I have a job lined up soon and I am planning to make it enough so that I can move out. I need my own life that I can live. But this guilt is so heavy. I don’t want them to think they weren’t good enough, because it’s the furthest from the truth. 


Any advice on how I should handle this when I go to move out? Will their paternal instincts help them to be understanding?",01May2019,1
9,"I am happily married and we have a child together. We are actively trying to have another child. I love my husband so much and absolutely do not want to leave him. Or hurt him. But every time we hang out with this one couple, I feel super uncomfortable because I am unbelievably attracted to her husband! Our kids play soccer together and go to the same school. We live a few blocks away from them and see them pretty often for dinner and get togethers. I do not want to step outside my marriage and am happy with every part of my marriage -including our sex life. This guy is painfully good-looking. He's a good friend and we get along on a strictly friends-only level. It's so awful for me because we (the 4 of us) get along well as friends, but my completely inappropriate and purely physical feelings for him make me feel so uncomfortable. I don't know what to do about this. Our kids are good friends and I want them to be able to hang out. I really enjoy and value her friendship and would be utterly mortified if she knew what I was thinking about when I looked at her husband! Like it's so bad I have sex dreams about him! I will never act on these feelings, but I need to find some way to make them go away. Because it's getting out of hand!",01May2019,1
12,"Hello all,

I’m 25/F/living in NJ. I just failed out of a university program for cardiovascular sonography (ultrasound of the heart, the veins, the arteries, and some organs) where I was going for a second bachelor degree.  

I have gotten past the heartache of my failures, treading into the anxiety of telling my parents and other family members of my status. However.... 

I’m seeking advice on what I can get into job-wise in the healthcare field with the experience I do have. I have a bachelor’s in biology from a university and I completed seven months of the sonography program that included four months of clinical rotations with hands on patient care, typing reports, billing, informing doctors/nurses of positive results, and of course ultrasound scanning. 

I have also had four jobs, where I was a manager in three of them and a cashier and trainer in the final one. Tons of customer service and solving dissatisfied people’s problems. 

Honestly I’m not sure of the hospital jobs available that aren’t usual doctor/nurse/EKG tech/x-ray tech/techs. While I was at clinical, there were TONS of hospital personnel and I am looking to be one of them. I’m hoping to not have to get a certification for practice, as I am still freshly wounded with failing the med program, but if it’s absolutely necessary to get one, I’m open to a few months of learning for it. NOT another year of schooling. 

Would anyone know specific jobs at a hospital or in the healthcare field that I would shine at with the experience I have? 

I appreciate the help. I’m eager to move past my failures and actually join the field I’ve been trying to get into the for the last five years!",01May2019,1
14,"My mom is taking blood pressure medication and baby aspirin to deal with an unknown medical condition she contracted  20 years ago. Back then she has a seizure and was disoriented for a while and had to have a pace maker in. She's been having blood pressure issues and heart palpitations for as long as I've been alive because of it.

She refuses to go to doctors because she is convinced that they somehow created her condition and that because they couldn't name it or figure out what it was that they couldn't help her. (In actuality none of the doctors had ever seen anyone have this medical condition before and were trying their best.) She thinks all medication is terrible too and that she can fix all her issues on her own.

&amp;#x200B;

This came to a head over the summer when she had another seizure while we were on vacation that finally made her listen to us when we said to go to the doctor. My dad basically dragged her at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

The doctors still don't know exactly what caused the seizures but they put her on blood pressure medication and almost immediately she was doing a lot better. The blood pressure medicine also does something else that is meant to help with her condition but I don't know exactly what. Her blood pressure has been the best it has been in years and she hasn't been having the heart issues or been using her pacemaker almost at all since then.

&amp;#x200B;

I found out recently that she keeps not taking them. If my dad doesn't remind her she doesn't do it. She's convinced that if she just goes on some random diet her blood pressure will be fine and she wont need meds. She thinks meditation will fix her. Its frustrating to no end.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like she would just rather die then take simple medication that could improve her life. It feels like she would rather selfishly test her luck on things that don't work instead of taking freaking blood pressure medication.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in college, I can't be there to watch over her shoulder and remind her and I live my life with anxiety that my mom is going to die bc she won't do what is best for her.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to convince my mom to take her medication so I don't worry about her all the time?

TL;DR:my mom won't take her medication, what can I do to convince her to?",01May2019,1
15,"So, I've known this guy for about 2 years now. He's 4 years older then me, (which I don't mind). But we recently fucked, he's now kinda into me &amp; I've kinda liked him a bit.. But the problem is I don't like relationships, he definitely deserves better, I've never had an actual relationship before. (I mean, I have dated people before but it never lasts more than a few days. So I wouldn't know what to do) &amp; he makes me feel rather comfortable. Which is hard to do. Plus he's very caring, even before we fucked. I'll just fuck things up, he doesn't deserve the bad luck that comes whenever someone trys/gets close to me. Everyone we know, thinks we should.

16,"I just feel shitty and mostly for no actual real reason. I’m finishing up my first year in college and I thought I would be doing so many big things but I’m equally depressed if not more, compared to last year.

I don’t have any clue as to what major I should choose. I don’t have any real passions in life, I got denied by a job, the girl I’m talking to isn’t interested in me anymore, and life is just sucking. I feel like I don’t belong anywhere and I’m always an outsider every where I go, and there isn’t one person in the world who’s can 100% count on. I hangout with people but I’m not part of an actual group if that makes sense. I feel worthless and insecure, and I don’t know why I doubt myself for everything.

I’m literally have been overcome by negativity but that’s always what’s been around me all my life. I don’t have anything in my life that I’m looking forward to, I feel like I’m being controlled by these expectations and pressures. I’ve never been able to say how I feel or what I want in my house. There’s so many dumbass expectations and pressures placed on me by my parents and the people around me.

If it was up to me I’d probably take a year of school and get an apartment somewhere and get a job. That’s literally all I would want, to have the opportunity to fail, succeed, and grow, I just feel like I’m stuck here at my house. I want to be able to be in control in my life because right now I’m not the one making decisions. 

If I said any of this this to my parents I’d be laughed at and called foolish. I don’t even have enough of a relationship with them to talk to them about anything deeper than schoolwork. I don’t really talk to my dad even though we live in the same house, and while I appreciate my mom, I feel like she’s always just backing up whatever my dad says.

I also wanted to go to the doctors, but they don’t have an appointment for all of May and some of June, and I was finally thinking about seeing a therapist.

I guess that this is just a rant, but I just want to run away from everything and create a new identity that’s separate from the one that’s been placed on me.",01May2019,2
17,"I live in a small town and in elementary I was friends with most kids there and was kinda the class clown a bit, around the time I didn't care what anyone thought or whatever and was just trying to have fun.   


Fast forward to middle school and that's where it started to change.

My small group of like 6 friends splitted up into other groups.

 I heard so much about middle school and I saw the change in the people around me. It started to be about being cool and I wasn't cool  in anyway but I was friends with  the kids who were cool but I felt like the odd one out and kids who didn't know me looked at me like 'why am i there'.  The stress which i hadn't felt before was getting to me and I felt awkward and like I wasn't funny anymore which upset me being the funny guy in elementary. I kinda got through middle school and it was alright until the last year where I was sick and missed a tonne of it.  In this time I would be doing all kind of nerdy stuff and I started using the internet and discord.  My friends would sometimes message me and I would avoid it .  Around this time I had 4 or so friends.       1 moved away,    1 I hadn't spoke to in so long,  and my 2 best friends had a serious aurgument and stopped talking.

&amp;#x200B;

I went with my best friend who i knew the longest on the first day of high school and when  i was gone the group had changed to a bunch of kids I didn't know.  So i was talking to these kids and sometimes i would say something i found really funny and they would just have a blank expression or whatever . I'm interested in music and games but they arent, i had nothing in common.     

&amp;#x200B;

at my real small school I felt like I had nothing in common with anyone, I remember this friend group showing me a funny vine they saw on instagram and they talked about girls.  This is half the kids at my school

&amp;#x200B;

the other half is kinda nerd kids like myself except theyre real edgy and use 4chan which i dont fuck with.

I'll keep things easy

I'm a high school student, I have decently bad anxiety, more in the social category but generally as well, I also occasionally have depression episodes, but usually they aren't too major (both of these I just started seeing a counselor/therapist for :]). 

I overall just wanna improve myself and therefore my life in general, I tend to zone myself off from people due to not being comfortable, and I'm not super motivated to do anything, cause I don't find any of the things I do particularly enjoyable, only real things I already do that I enjoy are online gaming and playing an instrument,

really just looking for ways to improve, if anyone has any tips, I'd love to hear em, and if you're recommending things to do or get into (which I'd love, I really want something to enjoy) nothing too expensive to try, please, we don't have a whole lot to spend, as of right now. Though what it is isn't too big a deal

23,"Over the summer, I moved cities and switched campuses. It took me a while to find a group of friends I could really connect with. I met this girl, M, one day and she complemented me and made an effort to get to know me. I felt like I had a true connection with her. She welcomed me into her tight knit friend group that had been together since Day 1. I felt a connection with everyone in the group because of our similar passions. M and I hung out and went shopping back in December and it was very fun.  A month later, I saw a movie with the entire friend group which made me feel like I had true friends.

 M had followed me on insta and then I made a new account because I got locked out. She blocked my new account and when I confronted her about it she claimed it was an accident and said she fixed it but never followed me back. Her birthday was in the beginning of February. She had a get together with everyone in the friend group except me. I found it through everyone in the groups stories on IG. I was kind of upset but I was on a cruise that day so I knew I couldn’t have gone. I wished her a happy b day in the comments and figured out that another member of the group, L, had blocked me as well. I barely knew L though because I rarely talked to her. A, the “leader” of the group, sent me a text the next day saying “we’re a tight group and it takes time to invite someone new in plus M didn’t have enough space in her car so don’t take it personal but we’ll invite you to more future events”. 

Right before valentines day, the girls had a galentines lunch where everyone brought some food. I felt guilty that I didn’t bring any and that no one told me as they all texted on the group chat I’m not apart of. 

Flash forward to April, I start realizing that M is full on ignoring me or blowing me off whenever I talk. I confront her and ask whats going on you’re acting kind of weird. She says we aren’t “compatible” to be friends and doesn’t answer me when I ask why.

 I ask A if she knew about this and she said that “some people don’t pair well with others which is what some people in the group thinks of you but i’ll still be here for you”. She said that whoever plans the event is in charge of inviting so if she planned an event she would definitely invite me but also encouraged me to find another group for next school year. Some people try to add me in conversations more but 3/6 of the group (M, L and F) all ignore me. 

A’s birthday was this week and I thought I was going to be invited. I heard them planning it when we hung out the other day but kind of secretly and A and F were texting about the plans while I was in between them. Recently, someone I knew passed away and I wanted to be close to my friends more but A didn’t invite me to her birthday lunch even when I asked about it. I don’t know what to do

TL;DR Get invited to friend group by M, who believes we aren’t compatible after we had been hanging out for months. A, “leader” of the group, wants me to stay in group and hang out with everyone until August but won’t invite me along to anything. Also ignored by half the group even though I felt like they were my true friends.",01May2019,1
24,"I'm in highschool and there's this girl I'm friends with that I don't want to be friends with anymore. 

First, the situation: me and her slowly grew closer over the year, dated, broke up, and chose to remain friends. She's in almost all my classes. 

Second, why I want to end the friendship: ever since she broke up with me she treats me shitty sometimes and nice others and I don't want to deal with it. I don't know why she's suddenly acting like this. The relationship ended because she didn't have enough time, so it's not like I did something to start this. The attitude comes out if nowhere too. Sometimes I annoy my friends, so I can understand her getting mad at those points but I'll walk into school and she'll be mean for no reason. I could literally say nothing and read a book and she'll treat me shitty. It's gotten to the point where I hate talking to her, hate when she talks to me, and generally don't like being near her. She used to be really nice and fun to talk to but now I just want the friendship to be over. 

I don't know how to end a friendship because I've never had to do it before except 1 other time but that person did something so horrible I just stopped talking to then and go them the silent treatment for the past 3 years. All my other friendships ended naturally but I just want to end this one now.",01May2019,1
25,"Hi there. Thanks in advance for reading. I didn't know what to flair this as, so apologies if it's incorrect.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated about a year ago from community college into a niche field and my license in that field ONLY applies for the state I'm currently living in. I have not been able to find a job in this career, despite searching far and wide. I currently work part time for $9 and can barely afford gas to and from my job. My mother constantly complains, almost daily, that I need to move out because I'm 23 and still live with her. She moved out of her mother's house when she was 20 because she got knocked up by some dude twice her age. I have the opportunity to move in with a friend who can get me a well paying job at his place of work that has nothing to do with what I went to school for, but my mother keeps insisting I stay home and find a job in my field (that, honestly, I only got into because my family pressured me to go to college and insisted I go into this field) while she will continue to complain that I cannot find a job and can't pay rent. I think I should just make my own adult decision and move out and make my own mistakes and deal with the consequences, as an adult should, she thinks I should stay at home and continue looking for jobs in a field that's deserted. She also wants me to go back to school, when I have explicitly told her I don't want to. What should I do, and am I being irrational and immature?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Mom wants me to stay at home and find a job in a niche field I went to school for even though the job market is dry, I want to move out and take the opportunity I've been handed to get a job that has nothing to do with my field. What do?",01May2019,1
26,"So, the long and short of this is that my neighbor's kid (mid 20s I think) likes to wrench on his truck until late at night (2 AM is the latest that I have heard) with loud rap (read crap) music playing. Normally this wouldn't be a huge deal but my wife is 22 weeks pregnant. She comes home from work worn out and is usually in bed by 8pm. I don't want to tell him that he can't be out working on his car but between the air wrenches and the music, it is keeping my wife awake and/ or waking her up. He already isn't a fan of me because I didn't see his chihuahua in the yard and my husky jumped out of my car and chased it (my fault, I admitted it and steps have been taken to hopefully prevent future issues).

32,"Hey guys, I've been at a new job 2 months and had to move away from everyone I know. And im really really struggling mentally about my self image for a number of reasons:

(TLDR is at the bottom)

1. I live in a house share where the people I live with are really scruffy and disrespectful and one of them in particular is drunk a lot of the time and when he is, likes to be very touchy despite me saying no, which has made me feel very uncomfortable leaving my room at all ( hes a 42y/o male and im a 21y/o female)  cant move out for another 4 months due to that being the minimum contracted stay.


2. Im currently in my probation period for my new job but my boss is incredibly harsh and is stressed because of how much work the company is giving them and snaps a lot. I feel like I suck really bad at my job to the point I feel like my boss wont let me pass my probation either way since its up to them if I pass or not. They are not giving me all the tasks I need to pass my 6 month probation period which is fine since Im still struggling with the basics (art related field with no style guide and very little training, takes on average 3/4 months to learn everything apparently) i know ive still got time to learn but I feel like my boss is so unconfident in me, they'll never let me pass my probation period, I lack any confidence in my work because of her snappy attitiude because I didnt get the colour to her liking or the shape of something is wrong. Its fustrating to say the least.


3. Because I suck at my art job at the moment, I feel like I cant draw anymore. I have a hard time detaching myself from the art I produce for work from my own personal work which are in two different styles, different things and different programs. I feel like I shouldnt be so upset at myself and feel like this, but my boss has literally kicked all self confidence out of me from the constant harshness of her evaluation of my work.


4. I have no friends here and even if I do have someone over, they cant visit for more than two days and despite trying to keep in contact with my friends, conversation is very sparing since we're all so busy and I dont really have time to partake in clubs during the weekend. I am also so sad all the time to the point I just think nobody likes talking to me anymore because im struggling so much with things and complain a lot since im not comfortable at either work or where I'm living, my friends have reassured me its fine I vent since my fustration about things are reasonable but... I dunno, i just feel so horrid about myself. 


5. I also have a lot of family issues like my grandma being in hospital because of a really bad fall and my sister having to be in A&amp;E the beginning of this month and so on. It has been upsetting to hear some of the issues that have been going on but these are the main two things that have effected me family wise since the beginning of this month.


I feel so stressed out and sad all the time and my usual self care stuff just isnt helping. Ive tried blasting music, ive tried watching films or playing games or just trying to relax but I just cant. I cry almost every single day because Im just so sad these days, nothing is working and im struggling really bad. I have depression issues (genetic, runs in my family) which doesnt help but im really struggling to find any sort of peace of mind anymore and its making me keep awake and just miserable. If anyone has any advice I would really be appreciative of it. Im just stuck and I dont know how to help myself anymore.


Tldr: How do I make myself happy when almost everything in my life sucks right now and I feel like the people I live with and my boss hate me?",01May2019,1
33,"This happened over 5 years ago but I still think about it at least once a week.

In undergrad (like 8 years ago) I was kind of an emotional mess. I had  bad anxiety and this  contributed to my long term bf and I breaking up. After we broke up I just made some not great decisions dating wise. Through it all, my very close friend James was there for me. We met in college. He also has very bad anxiety and grew up in an awful home life. Every time I had anxiety he would unconditionally drop whatever he was doing and would help me feel better. I also did the same for him. We were each others crutches through college.

Well, James was in a long term relationship w someone else but one day he told me he had feelings for me and we hooked up. I had feelings for him, but I was not in an emotional position to be dating. I should mention I also am insecure and it was hard for me to say no and outright reject him (I know its not an excuse..I should have). He left his gf for me, although he *was* aware I really needed to be single, and we were ""together"" for a few months, although the entire time I kept telling him ""look I really need to just be single right now"". During these few months, I studied abroad and being away from everything made me realize alot about my anxiety and the way I deal with it. I realized I could no longer rely on other people to be my crutch when I was anxious. I realized that James was not helping me, and I was not helping him. They way we helped each other was not healthy. I started to realize this and became very very very frustrated with this pattern of support and started to back off from being there for James in this unconditional way. I also told him this.

James mom died of cancer a few months later. I still was there for him, but refused to be his crutch. I consistently told him I just could not help him until he made steps to help himself. His homelife was so bad. I told him he needed desperately to leave, and while I told him I was there for him, I was really trying to push him to start helping himself instead of relying on me after she died. He needed to be strong.

I did not talk to him much for the next few months. I heard from him finally in January. I found out he decided to take my advice after all. He was moving to LA with the girlfriend he had left to be with me. After not hearing from him for months, he finally messaged me back and told me this, but he had pent up resentment. He exploded at me, told me to go fuck myself for not being there for him after his mom died. Its been over 5 years and I haven't heard from him since.

I am now happily engaged and I have no feelings for James, but i can't seem to forgive myself. I felt I was doing the right thing after his mom died by pushing him to deal with it in a healthier way, and I too was not in the best emotional place to offer that unconditional support, but I can't help but feel I am an awful person for not being there for him unconditionally. I really need just some words of advice telling me to move on and it doesn't make me a bad person or something.

Thanks",01May2019,1
35,"This one is long, sorry! 

I (23m) am working towards my Bachelor's degree in Marine Biology at a university in Florida with 25 credit hours left. Throughout my college career though, I have been working 32 - 40 hours a week, and doing classes twice a week. Work has been pretty flexible with my schooling, and I am in a leadership position, non-salary ($16.50/hr). I've been with this company for 4.5 years at this point, but as I continue to knock classes of my degree program I keep running into a scheduling problem. Out of classes left in my core program, 5 of them require me to commute to school 3 times a week instead of 2. These classes are also the most difficult to complete if I am to believe the other students who have taken them before. I have a 2 credit hour study this summer with my professor, 

I hate most aspects of my job. It has been My goal has always been to complete my Bachelors without debt, but it seems better to go ahead and take a small amount of debt, expedite the completion of my program, and move into a Master's program soon there after at the same university. I'm considering just finishing out the summer at my job, and then focusing on school from there. I think a single $10,000 loan would probably cover me for the program, and overlap into my Masters with Pell Grant at least through the rest of my current program. 

Costs:
$0 for rent, I live at home still. 
$60.00/month for electricity
~$25.00/ month for water, no sewage. 
$285.00 minimum car note. There is just under $10,000 left on this. 
- I can get rid of a majority of my subscriptions like HBO, XM, Radio, and stuff like that. With student discount on Spotify, I could have Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, and Spotify for &gt;$20.00/month. 
Cutting my retirement contributions from $250.00/month to $0.00 while I have no job.
I have 6 months in savings, which would get me through the Fall 2019 Semester.
I have 8 months left in a contract for Jiu Jitsu training @ $120.00/month.


Note: At this time, I have looked into scholarships prior to considering a loan. As a part time student I qualify for LITERALLY 0 scholarships. I have looked all over my school for some, online, etc. There is nothing for part time students. For the most part, all the ones available involve me being in school for like  12 - 16 credit hours.",01May2019,1
36,"This is kind of lengthy, so I apologize. 

I used to be at a really low point in my life and within the past 5 years, I have really made progress and things have really taken off for me. I graduated from college, I am working towards my MA, I get to follow my dreams and passions. I have built a new life and I'm happy. But my now ex friend is still suck in the same spot they were 6 years ago. 

I live part time in another state and whenever I am about to leave, this friend would always try and guilt trip me into either staying or coming back earlier than intended. If I don't give in they lash out, don't talk to me for a few weeks and throws a temper tantrum. 

If I have a different opinion than him, I am being made out to be the bad person. If I don't agree with him all hell breaks loose and I am called names, told to ""stfu"" and so on and so forth. If they don't get their way, they throw an absolute fit. They refuse to take responsibility or take actions to improve their life. It is a constant game of playing victim and when other people try to help them, they get cussed at. 

This person doesn't have many friends and I was one of the few that struck around despite everything. They got jealous when I have plans with other friends. They are jealous and angry that people like me more than they like them. 

They kicked me out of their life because ""I'm a bad person"" and in turn I blocked them on every platform possible(text, calls, Facebook, Instagram etc). Now from what I hear through the grapevine they are playing the ""nobody likes me, I'm going to kill myself.."". I take the threats of suicide seriously, but when this person pulls this routine 20-25 times a year. 

It has been nearly 5 months since I talked to this person and am continuing to grow leaps and bounds. I have so much to look forward to within the next 6 months to a year. I do miss this person, but not the way they were treating me. I do worry about this person and I hope they find the peace and happiness they are looking for. Even though they are hurting more than before, do I reach out or continue to walk away?",01May2019,1
37,"Before reading/checking out my other posts: I think it's important to address my previous posts (on other sub). I have struggled a lot with anorexia in the past, had a few relapses and recoveries. My mental state regarding my ED has varied a lot in the past and will probably continue to do so  Recently I'm doing a bit better, eventhough it's still in the back of my mind.

I met my best friend a year after my first episode. Till this day, five years later, he still has no idea about my ED. I've told him about my depression etc. and he reacted fine, since he has had the same struggles. 

I've been thinking about telling him about my ED too, since he has no idea and I truly trust him. After my episode five years ago, I have told no one about my relapses and kept the 'aftermath' all to myself. I think it's perhaps a good idea to share my struggles with someone who is close to me, especially because I only notice I've relapsed when I'm already at my lowest point. At the same time it's a very personal subject which raises a lot of questions I cannot answer. And most importantly, I don't want to be a burden and I don't want to give him the responsibility of keeping me healthy/sane.

I've been in therapy for a few years and a few reasons, but it doesn't seem to help, so I've given up that.

I wonder if this is a healthy way to deal with my problens, or if I'm burdening someone else.",01May2019,1

45,"   So I've known this girl since the about September of 2018 because we're had history and math together (disclosure:im just a 13 year old asking for some advice so please don't judge). Let's call that girl Gaby. Since the first day I saw her I just couldn't stop admiring her face and just how beautiful she was. Later we became friends and since we were in the same bus, we started seeing each other in the morning with a couple of her friends. Few months went by and now I'm in January really wanting to tell her that I love her. Then one day comes and I told her that I liked her, she said ""I just thought of us as being friends"". Before telling her, I was really sure she liked me and my friends, cousins and parents told me she liked me back because of how she acted towards me. After I got ""rejected"" I tried moving on for months but I just couldn't. I kept on dreaming about her and just thinking about her during any free time. And then the other girl comes in, let's call her Jennifer. I knew her since 6th grade and we got to become friends in 7th grade (now we are in 8th). One day in math, Gaby started laying on Jennifer's shoulder and I really didn't care much about it. Gaby had initially told me she was straight but Jennifer was openly bisexual so I started kind of jokingly thinking if the two of them got together. as the days went by, Gaby and Jennifer got closer and closer and then came this one day where Gaby said she was bisexual and I kinda freaked out. Now they pretty much started dating and I still love Gaby, just as much as I did when I met her. Now Jennifer wants to take Gaby to prom and I'm speechless. What once was a joke is now reality and I'm stuck here trying to figure out what to do.


Here are the questions:
*Should I just move on, or should I insist on Gaby?
*I never told Gaby I loved her, I only told her I liked her, should I tell her that I love her?
*Me and Gaby were supposed to go to the same high school, but she ended up deciding to go to Jennifer's future high school. After we get out of middle school, should I just forget about her?
*most of the times I hangout with gaby, should I stop being friends with her and move on?

46,"I've always had a gift of premonition about people I meet. If I talk to anyone, both online and irl, I can immediately tell if there's something off about them, and I have always been right on the nose about it. I'm not saying that gut feeling can't be wrong, but I've learned to trust my instinct because every single time I felt the heebie jeebies about someone, they always revealed themselves to be malicious in some way. One girl ended up revealing an anger issue when she exploded on me and told me she planned to hire a hit man to come to my house and rape me. I should have nope'd out when I first got the creeps from her, but I didn't and that happened - so now I always listen to my inner voice. 

My problem is, I don't know how to... go... about this?? when I feel this way about someone. It's easier online to just keep your distance and eventually they get the hint that you don't want to talk or get any closer, but it can still be difficult. and when I know the person face to face, it's even harder to deal with.

Being around the person (even online) gives me immense anxiety and I'm always left drained when I do have to talk to them.

I can't just say ""look I don't think we're going to be compatible friends because I have a sixth sense that's telling me you are trouble, bye.""

Other examples like one day she was expressing loudly to other coworkers how she needs a husband and later said she was going to marry me. yelling answers to questions to me across the room at employee meetings. Very very heavy eye contact when talking to me and holding my gaze in silence. Recently she walked to the front of the store and just stared at me behind the counter for a while there was no customers around. She's told me she doesn't want me to go home because she'll miss me, that I'm cuter when I smile. She seems hesitant to directly touch me though but indirectly like bumping into me she does a lot (so much that I know it's on purpose). It seems like she wants to be direct and touch me but maybe shes scared or intimidated. She'll sort of flirt with guys she has rejected in the past and stare me in the eyes while doing it. Like hug another guy while looking at me the whole time or when she grinded on the gay guy while staring me in the eyes. I know she likes me but my anxiety still gets to me and makes me hesitant to do anything since I often seem cold or aloof to others and I think I've given off the vibe to her that maybe I do or maybe I don't like her when in reality I really do.

So my little bro got fired from a major gas station / food chain here in the south because he was only 9 minutes late because he had a flat tire (not lying). Granted it is his third time but this kid is a hard worker and honestly has been in trouble with the law once over a minor weed possession but that’s all he has (I’m an honest man might as well be honest). The charge was dropped as well btw. I’m an engineer myself but my brother is just nothing like me he’s not a white collar kind of guy but he’s a hard worker and he has potential.

The hr people said after 90 days he can re-apply but I dunno with this recession tons of people are hungry.

57,"This is a throw away account so obligatory apologies for mobile formating and all the usual. I'm not great at keeping things short, so tl;dr at the bottom.

My mom and dad had me pretty young, 22 and 25 respectively, and weren't together when they found out mom was pregnant. They split up when I was three and mom ""got"" custody. I hung out with dad on a week night and saturdays. My mom got married and had another kid (my lil bro, and the best thing that has ever happened to me). Step dad is awesome, treats me like I'm his, and I've never had any issues with him.

Everything was fine when I was little, I knew that mom and dad didn't love eachother and didn't get along. My dad isn't the most financially stable person, and he's got his issues, but he isn't struggling. The only big issue for me was that he was never on time, but I didn't mind so much because I was just as bad (what can I say, apple and tree). I wished I could see dad more often but I was grateful that I got to see him at all, because a lot of my friends only saw their dads once a year.

I don't look at all like my mom. Theres bits and pieces of me that are like her, like my hands and feet, but over all I am the spitting image of my dad. There is literally no way to mistake me for anyone else's kid. This shouldn't be super important but I think this bothers mom a little, cause the lil bro looks like his dad (but luckily for her he's  a mamas boy, whereas I was a daddy's girl).

Now that backstory is done, onto the actual issue.

When I hang out with dad (we've kept up the tradition s if my childhood) he is interested in listening to me talk about the things I'm interested in, how my week is going, issues that I'm going through, etc. Sometimes those issues are mom, and he helps me through it the best he can. He always starts off saying that he admires my mom and is really proud of everything she's accomplished. He tells me that he thinks she's wonderful before saying anything negative about her. He makes sure that i know that he might not get along with her, but that he isn't saying things to make me hate her. He's really careful about stuff like that because he grew up with a lot of kids who's parents purposely tried to make them hate the other parent.

On the other hand my mom has nothing nice to say unless she's about to say something really terrible about him. Ever since I started junior high, she stopped trying to hold back the mean or negative comments. Before she never had anything nice to say, so she just didn't say anything. Over the last 8 years or so, it has gotten worse and worse.

She tells me that dad is kind of a loser, that he could have done so much more with his life. She makes comments about his looks (which... see above to know why this is upsetting). Worst of all, she is constantly telling me to ""not end up like your father, you have such a bright future"". I get that she wants me to be better than him, to be better than her, but I can't do this anymore.

This morning she told me that when she got pregnant with me, she didn't know who's kid I was because she'd had sex with 3 people in those weeks (and hey, I'm not judging, she was young and honestly what are your twenties for?). This information is new, not even dad had told me about that. But honestly I'm not surprised. What came next was I think the most upsetting thing she's ever said. She nattered on before dropping this bomb: ""I feel like I was meant to have his (potential baby daddy #2) babies, but I didn't. I had you with your dad and your brother with some other guy (referring to stepdad, who she is very happily married to, I don't see a divorce coming anytime in the future). Sometimes I think that that's why my kids have so many problems (we both have learning disabilities, lil bro's are worse, and a whole slew of mental health issues, which she also has).""

I don't know what I'm supposed to do about that. I feel like she basically admitted that she regrets me, or at least regrets dating my dad. I hate the idea of settling down the way she did (nothing wrong with it, just not what I want), and I don't want a desk job, or to work retail my whole life, but that really only leaves the option of having a very similar lifestyle as my dad, and I don't want that because she has picked and picked for so long that I'm scared of being like my dad. I love my mom, and I know that she loves me, and doesn't regret having me, I know that the things she said this morning weren't ment to be as terrible as they feel to me, because she doesn't ever want to hurt me. This post makes her seem really awful, and she's not. It's just this one thing.

I can't talk to her about him without it turning into a bitchfest. I ca2nt tell her about my day, or about my plans. I feel like I can't do anything to make her realize that it isn't just about her and dad. That her words affect me too. I can't do this anymore, but I really don't want to argue with her, I'm not good at confrontation.

I don't have a specific ""should I do this?"" question, just would like some opinions and advice on how to handle this situation. Thanks, sorry for the long post!

61,"TL;DR Depressed, anxiety filled loner trying to turn his life around still haunted by missed opportunities and lack of action. 

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up I was a loner. 

I had some friends that I played video games with in high school but afterwards I was on my own again going into university. I was crippling shy, introverted (so I lacked any drive to be social), fair to say I was terrified of social interactions. I wasn't sociable until late of my final year. I now had friends, I was being invited to parties for the first time in my life, it was going well but I still had trouble forming lasting relationships with people. I never had female attention before so the hand full of times I might have had a chance I blundered and dismissed myself for not having a chance. Would any girl date an unemployed depressed virgin who lives with his parents? No, I don't expect them to. Now after over a year I only socialize with a small group of friends once every few months, I'm still a virgin that's never been on a date, and up until recently I played video games all day.

I'm slowly turning myself around. I get up in the morning, keep my room clean, trying to figure out where I'm going what I want to do because I feel like I've been asleep for over a year, 2018 is a blur for me. Making small steps to be more social and not be a depressed, anxiety filled loner who spends all day in his room playing video games. I'm taking responsibility for myself.

The one thing that still haunts me that I used video games to cover is the catastrophic feeling of having missed out on so much life and many opportunities. I'm in a hell of my on creation, with no one to blame but myself. I did absolutely nothing during my time in high school and university. While people were making friends for life, I was playing video games. While people were finding partners, I was jerking off. While people were laying foundations for their life, I was trying to render myself unconscious in the overwhelming face of life. I got a taste of what I was missing but didn't take advantage. I try to forget my life because it breeds doubt and unbelievable pain. Sometimes I forget how old I am only to remember and be thrown into self hate and hopelessness. As you can imagine birthdays are fun. 

How do I deal with such regret? How do I forgive myself, for my past and being to melodramatic in this post?",01May2019,1

63,"So I ""broke up"" (from being friends, we weren't in a relationship) with a female friend, let's call her N. She wasn't my \*best\* friend, but we were getting pretty close and she was one of the nicest people I knew. However, lately N had been doing some things such as lying to me and being a hypocrite, so I decided that she wasn't the same person I thought she was. One day we had a very small argument over text, but it was kinda like a tipping point for me and at one point I just replied with ""whatever"" and stopped talking to her both over text and in real life (we go to the same school and share all classes so I was basically ignoring her all day, not that she \*tried\* to talk to me though.)

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day she asked me over text if I was mad at her, and when I told her I was and explained the reasons, she got even more mad at me than I was at her (presumably because she didn't think she did anything wrong?) It's been almost two weeks now, and while I'm still mad at her, I'm starting to miss her, however I can't walk up to her and apologize because 1) I feel like that's her job to do, \*I\* was the one who got mad at \*her\*, and 2) I have a hunch that if I walked up to her she'd just ignore me.

&amp;#x200B;

We also have a friend in common who we also share all classes with (let's call her B), and it feels very weird that we both talk to B a lot, but we don't talk to each other. Before, we used to all walk back from school together, but now that we're mad at each other and B can't pick a side, sometimes she'll walk back with me, and sometimes with her. When she walks with me, I feel guilty because N has to walk back alone and it's totally my fault. However when she walks with N, I feel lonely. Walking back from school is just an example, there are many things that we're barely making them work because N refuses to apologize to me.

&amp;#x200B;

However N doesn't even seem like she remotely wants to apologize, I haven't said a \*word\* to her since I got mad at her, but just by looking at her and from what B tells me about her, she seems like she thinks she did nothing wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen plenty of situations vaguely similar to this one, and the advice I hear the most is that you should cut these types of people away from your life. It does seem on paper like that would make things easier for me, but ever since we stopped talking, I don't \*feel\* happier, quite the opposite actually. Add on to that the fact that if I completely cut ties with N, I'd also have to stop hanging out with B, who I would say is my best friend and has done nothing wrong to me, in fact I'd say she's handled being the ""Middle (wo)man"" like a champ considering how hard the two of us have made it for her.

64,"Sorry if the post is written badly, english is my second language.

Everything started with my first crush when I was 12-14. Oh boy I loved her. I thought she liked me too. At her 13th birthday, we french kissed and it was honestly the best experience of my entire life. I was in heaven. However, one week later, she asked her friend to text me that she only did that because she found me pathetic. I was extremely confused. Fast forward to the next year, I still liked her very much but she kept teasing me. Eventually, it got away. I moved on. First heartbreak happens to everyone eh.

Then toward the end of highschool I began to crush on someone one year younger than me. She was so beautiful. We talked maybe 2 times but it was more than enough for me to fall in love. At my afterprom party, don’t ask me why but she was there. We were both a little drunk so we cuddled during the night. Then i go back home and during the following month, I only had her in mind. Couldn’t see her because of thd distance between us. But then I saw her get tagged in a post that was saying « when you flirt with a guy just for fun and he starts to get interested » and there was a picture of a dog going away from something. I guess i got played with again but it’s find I’ll find someone in college right?

Then, I fell deeply in love with my step sister. We’re not related by blood. She dropped hints like cuddling with me during a movie or texting me “when are you coming back i miss you”. I thought I could tell her how I feel. So I did. She reacted very badly. Told her mother. Her mother told her father and I was extremely ashamed. Now she acts like nothing Happened. I think she’s conscious how that hurts me and keeps talking to me to tease me and keep me hers. She teases a lot of guy i noticed. I guess i’m one of them.

Ahhh it hurts so bad i’m literally crying while writing this. She has such a beautiful life she is beautiful funny social. I’m so jealous. I know I should be happy that shes happy but I just can’t get over it. I have to live with her and it’s torture.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened today a couple hours ago.

I was downstairs, eating my food. I took a sip of water and put it back down. I went on eating my food, and when I looked up to take another sip, I saw my mom staring at me with an angry expression.

&amp;#x200B;

Mom: Why did you put your water on that side?

Me: I dunno. It doesn't even matter.

Mom (now screaming): WHO ARE YOU TO SAY IT DOES NOT MATTER! IN MY FAMILY WE ALWAYS KEPT IT ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND THAT IS PROPER TABLE MANNERS! THAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD DO! DO YOU WANT ME TO SELL THAT DOG?

Me: Why are you getting mad at me?

Mom: WHO SAID I'M GETTING MAD AT YOU? YOU KNOW WHAT, FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO IS GET RID OF THAT DOG! HE DESERVES TO LIVE ON THE STREET!

Me: How is that even related to this?

Mom: HE IS JUST AN EXTRA TROUBLE! HE IS AN EXTRA HASSLE!

Me: Why are we even arguing about this? I'll just move the glass back.

Mom: No need. I'll just kick him out. Street dog. Street pig.

Me: NO! Why are you bringing him into this?

Mom: HEY! DON'T RAISE YOUR VOICE. Take a deep breath. Now take 5 deep breaths.

Me (now crying): But you're the one that STARTED THIS!

Mom: DO YOU NEED ME TO KICK HIM OUT? Calm down.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I had to go and calm down. After taking some time to calm down, I spoke to my brother. He told me that this type of thing always happens and he just avoids contact with her, but I can't do that because my day-to-day life involves interacting with her. When I spoke to my dad, he told me that she's always like this but I have to respect her because she's my mom.

69,"  

I need some advice on what I should be doing next for myself. So, I graduated in the summer of 2019 with a degree in Exercise &amp; Wellness at the age of 25. I had no idea what I wanted to do, and I randomly took an exercise science course. I figured I’ll just get my Bachelor’s in that and apply to Physical Therapy school after. Well, things didn’t work out, and now I have no idea what to do. I don’t think it helped that I had no idea what to major in. I still don’t know what I want to do, but I do know I need an actual job. I don’t know if it’s bad to say this, but I’m more than fine working at a job that isn’t my passion. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been working at the fitness center at the community college since then. It’s an easy job, but It’s not something I could support myself on. I’m lucky to have amazing parents that allow me to stay with them while I figure out what to do next. I don’t want to take forever, because I feel horrible that I finished college but have nothing to show for it. Since my job is simple, it allows me a lot of time to think about what to do next.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I took a lot of science courses, I had the idea of getting into some health-related field. My first thought was to go back to school for nursing. My second thought was respiratory therapy. Then I was thinking something like MRI or X-ray tech. The only issue is that everything besides nursing is taught at private schools. I know that I should steer far from those, but I don’t really know what to do. As for nursing, I was thinking of doing an accelerated program, but I know my grades aren’t very competitive. I barely have above a 3.0 gpa and know I would have to retake courses to be more competitive for those programs. Respiratory therapy sounds a lot more appealing to me than nursing, but it’s just that all the schools are private schools. They do have a community college location, but the drive would be more than 2 hours and then another 2 hours back.

74,"Hi, everyone. I’m 16 years old and I’m at a loss of what to do about my mom. When I was in elementary school, she started having these delusions that people were out to get her and everything. She was diagnosed with psychosis when I was in middle school and she started taking medicine for it, which helped a lot. However, I think she’s stopped taking the meds and the results are terrifying. Two days ago, she messaged all of her Facebook groups saying that she was in danger. Someone called the cops and four officers came to our house. They realized that there wasn’t any danger and said they’d send someone to evaluate her, but I don’t think that person ever came. Yesterday, she was begging my dad to let us move to another town to get away from these people, which we can’t do because we don’t the money to. Because she can’t really “escape” the situation she thinks she’s in, I’m scared she might do something to harm herself or someone else.

76,"I (18F) recently met this guy (25M). He was very open and honest with me, he was like this huge ball of innocence in a body of a grown man. And it felt too good to be true. He shared his unfiltered self to me, but I was so filtered out with him because I was afraid that if I became as honest as he is, I would get attached, and I swore to myself to never be that kind of person. Despite being filtered with him, I kept going back to his place. And at the time I was doing all these, I never thought much of it. But now, I'm realizing that the reason I kept going back was because I liked spending my time with him. I never truly shared myself to him, and yet I still caught feelings. What more if I did?

Point of this is, when we were together in bed, laying down, he brought up the topic of 'us.' He asked if I was seeing other men, and I asked if he is seeing other women. He said that *there is a girl he's been talking to*, but he wants to focus on what we have. And me, blocking any emotions, I abruptly said that 'we should end our thing, whatever this is.' He told me that I should give it some more time. The next day came by, I was still being hard on myself. I was trying to rationalize things, and I was thinking to myself that it's better to end whatever we have because experience has taught me that allowing my emotions to gain control has very disastrous results. As I was waiting for my ride, he asked me why was I rushing to leave, knowing that it's our last day together. I shrugged it off because I was feeling so many emotions, and now I regret keeping mum about it. Then, he started to act distant, and I took it as a sign that I am no longer welcome anymore. So, I left his place the moment my ride came.

This certain event triggered something in me. While I was on my way home, everything finally dawned on me, and it was like I was overflowing with feelings. Everything that I've repressed just came crashing down on me. I thought to myself 'why did I end things with this guy? All the signs were there, and I was too blind to see it. He even asked me out on a date, but because I fear sharing myself, I never gave him a clear answer.'

Hours after I left his place, I called him after I've thought about everything. I told him that I wasn't honest with how I was feeling because I feared rejection and relationships. I also said sorry for only having the courage to tell him these things now over the phone, and not when I was still with him. I asked him if he wanted to date, but he said that we aren't on the same page, and it's been a month since he tried to ask me out. I asked him if that means I missed my chance with him, and he told me that I should think more about it. I said, I wanted to hear his answer, and he told me that he'll let me know. Honestly, I was taken aback when he said it's been a month. I guess, I didn't realize how much I enjoyed spending my time with him because of my own fears to face my true feelings. It's true, you only realize what you have until it's gone. Now, I'm beating myself up for being so guarded with my heart, when all this time, I actually liked him a lot.

My question is, should I reach him out again? It's been two days. I'm trying to give him time because I'm still hoping when he said, he'll let me know. If he never reach out, I'll take it as a sign that I should move on. Or should I reach out for the second time and ask him again about it? It's just sad that I have to realize all of these only when it's too late.

I'm sorry if this was such a long post. I needed to vent out and I also wanted to hear your insights. Should I reach him out, and ask him if he's thought about it? Or should I wait until he is ready?

80,"Alternately, am I whiney ""safe spacer?""

I'm on a cruise ship and they have a hypnotist on board. I've seen his show two nights in a row and think it's hugely entertaining, it's what you would expect having people hypnotized do: telling them they're really worldclass dancers in front of their adoring fans, telling them they're goldfish swimming in a bowl, telling them they're an exotic animal of their choice. Hypnosis stuff.

There was one bit in the second show that made me briefly uncomfortable and it just generally seemed like it would be better to replace the bit with something else. The way it went was, whenever the hypnotist was speaking and said a particular word the hypnotized people (who were sitting in a row of chairs) would feel as if the person next to them had just pinched them on the butt.

It was pretty funny to watch them jump up and shoot dirty glares and yell at people. But then the hypnotist asked this one young guy, maybe about 20 years old, what was wrong. And he said that the man next to him kept touching him on the butt and he didn't like that, the man was like twice his age (he was actually about 60 and a nice man and actually doing nothing) and he didn't want him touching him. He sounded so sad and vulnerable, it just felt uncomfortable to me.

The hypnotist moved him to the other side of the stage which did defuse things (though of course he just started thinking someone else was pinching him). But anyway. It just made me think that it maybe wasn't the best idea for one of his bit as it seemed to touch on themes on sexual harassment, which could be potentially upsetting to people in the audience or to people who were being hypnotized.

Am I being overly ""safe spacey"" about this? If not, how can I express this concern to the entertainment manager without sounding like someone who just can't take a joke? It's not like I'm hugely upset, I still love the performer, I'd recommend the show to people -- I just feel like it was a little insensitive given the potential sexual harassment connotations of butt pinching. If nothing else, it seems like they might want to avoid the potential for trouble over it. There were plenty of other hilarious bits, I just wanted to suggest they consider replacing the butt-pinching bit with another more benign bit.

How do I say this without sounding overly sensitive? Or alternately, am I just overly sensitive?",01May2019,1

Now, there are 20 days of school left, but I just wanna apologize but I can’t. Lemme explain what exactly happened.. basically I was being an insecure idiot and played off as a sort of mean person. But I wasn’t that mean. Occasionally the joke of: You have friends??? But that’s not too mean. I really cared about her because she’s my friend.. or was. 1 or 2 months ago, (Ik, long) 

Basically I got a long text message that basically was this:

Hey, OP, I can’t be friends with you anymore. I’m going through a lot of crap right now and I’ve realized your influence isn’t anywhere near healthy. You may not realize it, but you treat me very badly. (LETS NOT FORGET I WAS HAVING LIKE A MASK ON) You have your own problems, and your talk isn’t healthy. I’m sorry.

Ok. Ok. Ok. So it took me ten full minutes to process: So.. she doesn’t wanna be my friend... no... of course after that my friend randomly face timed me and I was in tears. That was the first time I cried in front of someone who wasn’t my family. Basically... I want to apologize. She kinda just replaced me though and it makes me feel even worse. I just... i don’t know. I want to make like a song or something, because I’m a musical person, but I would have to send her the song and on top of that, idk any lyrics to write. Soo the only thing I will do in the meantime is sing: I am hiding but she’s out there, just ignoring all our history.. memories get erased and I’ll get replaced with a newer cooler version of me. Basically, she became more popular cus she was in the theater play and now she just replaced me... and maybe I deserve it... maybe I should’ve just been myself... so please, any advice??

86,"guys look look look. My friend and i have youtube channels. He started his in january of last year and i started mine in march late ish. point is, he gets less views than me, and ive recently been growing faster than him (im half his subs in already a few months). This is where he gets not totally, but kinda noticibly angry and pissed at me. We go to the same school. i recently gave him some constructive crtitism in one of his vid comments. no this is not me playing the victim i know what the difference between constuctive critism is and being a dick is. I wrote something along the lines of: dude i dont want to come off as mean but your edits have been getting kinda off point lately. Definetly changed for the bad in the past few months.(end comment). He responded with something sarcastic like its funny i give his critisim when hes been editing longer than me etc etc. he responded in a rude manner, which i was not expecting. Keep in mind he does these anime edits (im gonna be serious not really edits just anime scenes where he puts COPYRIGHTED MUSIC over. he just claims them as edits so i play along). I do these roblox and csnz gameplay edits, similar to the youtuber Ceeday, edited gameplay moments that are introducing a new update or just funny moments. Anyways the reason i just said this is because this is where it becomes important. he bashes my stlye of vods and says its not considered editing in the youtube game. i am genuinly mad at him now because not only 1) he is being a dick to me just because he didn't appreciate some critissim which was polite, and 2) making fun of my content. This is now too far for me. I try to be polite and tell him that, if he doesnt like constructive critisim, then i wont do any. He responds with how he has better edits and upload schedules than me,and that his edits are perfectly timed (and mine arent) just because I make roblox and video game content and he does anime???? yeah needless to say i didnt get his point and promply questioned him on how the genre of edit can affect timing and schedule. he responds with the fact that his vids are better than mine. Night passes and i go to school. at lunch he comes up to me and blatantly starts to say that ""my content is shitty and i need to stop harrasing him"". I am amazed by this. i walk away and after school i write down in the replies ""wtf was that for @ lunch??.""

he tells me i cant take a joke. Well, i start to feel 2 feet tall and think that my content is actually shitty, so i go to small youtuber subreddits and ask reddit to review my videos. To my surprise, they actualy liked it, and i thanked them. so its the kid being a jerk. i ask one of my closest friends irl on discord to review my vod, he likes it. i show him the anime editing ex-friends vid and he says as well, the same critisim as me. well, i can confirm its him being a jerk. The next day, i go to school and the anime edit dude walks up to me and makes fun of my content, which i stand up for my content and say that ""at least i dont steal anime footage, put music over it and call it editing."" he starts to sob and walks away blushing. After school he writes in the comment section about how i was being a jerk and how he doesnt want to be my friend anymore. Help!! What should i do?",01May2019,1

88,"This isn't nearly as heavy as some of the questions on here, just a warning.

When I was a kid, I was in an uncomfortable situation with someone way older than me who had (as he admitted) sexual thoughts about me. He also touched me inappropriately (but not something that could carry a sexual assault charge) on several occasions, for long periods of time, even when I asked him to stop. Think neckbeard territory. If you feel like it, you can read the post through my account, but it is by no means necessary to understand the situation. Essentially, he was a total creep to me, and karma owned him massively.

His parents got a divorce partly because of what he did to me. What he did just exacerbated previous issues, but it was still apparently brought up when the divorce occurred. For him, this meant losing any stable income sources at all (they were already living on unstable income). I am having trouble understanding how I feel about this, and whether I should post about it on a revenge sub.

My friend showed me chats they had with Ace where Ace told them to just fucking die (knowing my friend try to fight against suicide thoughts.)

Last thing Ace did was telling them how such of a horrible person they for manipulating, and making Ace look like the villains in the story, Friend said ''I'm such a very very bad person, you should not worry about me and live your life''.

I dont know how could i help him and maybe they just cut ties with me...I know is not my problem but... i care for them so fucking much that my life will feel more empty if they commit suicide. they say that ''will just keep on going and see how long can i put it up, but stop worrying about me and take care.'' 

I have even thought of working my ass off till I make enough money (the currency of where they live is lower that the one of where i live) to go where they live and fucking buy my friend a house/department where they can be free from their abussive family too, they erased all way for me to contact them.

97,"The title about sums it up. My best friend and I are both 18 years old. We've known each other for years but she's just recently confided in me about her childhood abuse. 

She told me that her 3 brothers raped and sodomised her throughout her childhood. She told me that they did this back in their home country and they did this whenever their mom left the house for work. The most fucked up part of this is that before all three of her brothers started raping her, it was just one of them (the oldest brother) who repeatedly raped her. She ended confiding in her youngest brother at the time and instead of telling their mother or protecting her from the eldest brother, he started to join in and rape her too. They stopped raping her when they all immigrated to the country I live in now. 

They all live together now and she says that she says forgives them, but she clearly has a lot of unresolved trauma and mistrust of men. 

When she told me about all of this I started crying and throwing up. I told her I was so sorry that that happened to her and she did nothing to deserve what they did to her. I don't understand how she forgave them or how she's able to stomach seeing them every day. 

In the heat of the moment, I told her that I would report them to the police and get them on the Sex Registry and I probably can't because it happened so long ago and there's no proof, but I was just so angry. She told me that if I ever did that, she would never talk to me again. 

When I asked her why she still has them in her life, she told me that her mom never knew and if she found, it would destroy her. 

I told my friend that I wouldn't say anything, but ever since she told me, I can't stop thinking about it. I can't sleep at night. I feel so guilty for not saying anything. 

The worst part of all of this is that the oldest brother just got married and there's a really good chance he's going to have a kid soon. What if he does the same to his kids? 

I can't stop thinking about this and I don't know who to talk to. If I go to the police anonymously, my friend will know it was me because I'm the only person she's ever told and she'll cut me out of her life.

More recently, he's been ramping up his bullshit. He told me I can't go to my first-choice college even after I got accepted with a scholarship and not giving any indication beforehand that he DIDN'T want me to go. He threw what can only be described as a temper tantrum and screamed at me and my mom at separately, made both of us breakdown crying then, left. Even more recently (literally 2 days ago) he had another violent outburst before I left to hang out with my friend in the city because I dared to bring a bag with me. He told my mom to shut up when she tried to calm him down and borderline called her stupid; I cried the entire train ride up and he DROVE to where we were (basically unannounced)  and took us home when we were supposed to take the metro back. 

He's becoming extremely paranoid, thinking my mom is conspiring against him, all that shit. He gave me a non-apology, saying he doesn't understand why I avoid him and even after MONTHS refuses to apologize to my mother for yelling at her and breaking a plate against the wall. She doesn't want to bring it up because she doesn't want to force an apology out of him/make him angry.

I don't for the life of me want to be around my father ever again (I'm even preemptively getting multiple jobs over the summer so I don't have to be alone in the house with him).

Hi, I'm new to this subreddit! :) (I had posted this stuff on r/huion, but only one person responded to it, this subreddit seemed more active :D)

Recently, I've been considering replacing my current art tablet, and after some research, the tablets GT-220 v2 (NOT V1) and GT-221 Pro (NOT V2) seem to be promising (and definitely cheaper than Wacom).

However, I'm now debating on which of these two to get... I want whatever one is better. I also wonder why a \~$200 price difference.

I do not use the express/shortcut keys much myself, but I might try to in the near future, since I imagine these will be blocking my laptop because both of these tablets are quite large.

(Small request that IF you do link a video, could it be where it's DIRECTLY comparing these models?)

Here's a small table kinda showing what I've gathered from videos. I'm still kinda debating...

(My concern is how well they work, mostly)

&amp;#x200B;

||GT-220 V2|GT-221 Pro|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Pros| Accurate (colors), responsive, has a pen holder, nice space for making art | Matte Screen (Anti glare), Express keys, improved over the 220(?), more accurate (colors and pen pos), responsive, comes with extra pen and a pen case, more stable stand, improved pen and firmware|
|Cons| **No Express Keys,** Glossy, Stand might be a bit flimsy, input (for cables) is on the bottom, colors not (as) vibrant, sometimes does not ""feather off"" when drawing a line, low brightness(?), can be reflective without screen protector, nub of pen feels loose (which may make smaller details or zoomed-in work harder) | Low brightness(?), No double click, Slight loss of sensitivity in lower left corner (possibly other corners?), a bit heavy|
|Price|\~$400|\~$600|

I'm buying it off their Amazon :) and I'm not really letting price dictate which I'l get.

Any help deciding along with input would help; I do request a straightforward answer, please! :) I am starting to like the 221 Pro better since it has the express keys and I heard it might work better??

I literally can’t express what I am feeling to anybody and it makes people think that I am disinterested or holding back from them but truth is I don’t even know what I am feeling.

115,"I quit my retail job because the depression part of my bipolar disorder has been very severe. I also was diagnosed with ADHD around 4 months ago. Because of both of these conditions, I found my ability to perform well at work has suffered. I am visibly in a bad mood, constantly stressed, cannot focus, and constantly forget things. My self esteem has been at an all time low. I feel as if I cannot succeed in any job given to me. 

However, in a couple of months I will be legible to be prescribed a new type of medication for ADHD (a stimulant) as long as I stay clear from drug abuse. In the past, I have abused stimulants for recreational use and studying purposes. I told my psychiatrist this and she told me that I can only be prescribed stimulant medication after 6 months of being drug-abuse free. I have been using non-stimulant medication to treat ADHD, but it has not worked as well as I would hope.

I am also hoping that the stimulant medication will help with the negative mood symptoms of bipolar disorder. I take lithium to stabilize my mood and it has helped but I still feel depressed.

In the mean time, should I take a 2 month long break from work until my medication is available to me? Or am I being too hard on myself and should continue to work?",01May2019,1
116,"I'm at a stage in life where everything is unsatisfying or doesn't align with my values. Mostly my job, which takes up most of my time. 
I'm basically a creative, environmentalist, hippie type person.
I've been employed at a Sporting Club for 5 years as a waitress and as of 1 year now I've been the receptionist.

The position of receptionist at this place is different from most. 
One of the main problems is that we have a membership &amp; sign in system. This system was imposed by our government many many years ago, and it's a hecking ancient and ridiculous law to the point that it's hard to understand the legal implications and reason behind what we do. 
Basically if you're not a member of the Club you have to sign in with your full name, your full address, and sign our terms and conditions. Every day. This is because we also have a Gaming Room (or casino).
There is a sign in book, and alternatively an ID scanner. Immediately for some people this sets off red flags (understandably).
We are told not to disclose that we keep a 7 year record of all information, and for the people who scan their IDs we are able to access a scanned image of their licence.
If this data falls into the wrong hands it could cause a serious problem in terms of identity theft. 

But the thing is, its standard, and THE LAW to record such information in clubs. 

Anyway, a lot of people hate this Sign-In thing. And I get accused by customers that the club is trying to steal their personal info ON A DAILY BASIS. And by accused I mean literally screamed at and ridiculed to a horrifying extent. I've even had death threats over this. And because we have a casino, it attracts people of all kinds, including people on hard drugs. So because if that, my bosses want me to at least sight everyone's ID when they come in. Which makes it hard because some people don't have one, so I have to deny them entry.
And this makes it even worse because aside from more threats, (I'm also discriminating against less fortunate people which is terrible because I know what it's like.)
And I'm a small framed girl with a knee condition, how can I protect myself???

I also do design work for them, and IT troubleshooting.
In my spare time I make art so they ask me to do advertising for them. A lot. And it's all using a 2010 version of publisher because the old ass computer can't run anything else. 
And I don't see any extra pay or bonuses for it. 

I fix any tech issues that arise, as I have experience building computers with my stepdad in his IT business. 
I also will deal with any customer complaints, I train new staff for waitressing even though it's not my position any more. I write the new menus, I program the registers with new menu items. I take marketing calls and organise functions. I do the product orders of all our stock. 
All while sitting at my desk getting yelled at by people 24/7. 
Almost every single interaction I have with people that walk through the front door is negative, and it honestly doesn't do great for my mental state. 

My biggest achievement is that on my contract it states I must increase membership sign-up rates by 5%. 
In under a year I have increased it by 25% by entirely redesigning our membership system along with the advertising. 
I still have not been shown appreciation or compensation for any of these things.

But I haven't left. The people I work for have given me so much for the past few years and my brain won't stop clinging to that. They allow me so much outside of what a usual employer would. Before I had a permanent position there I had a mental breakdown and had to see a phycologist, they literally have me paid leave to do this even though they didn't have to. 
I have an underlying medical condition that sometimes flares up while I'm at work and they always stick up for me and let me have time to recover. 
I guess I feel like I owe them something, or that I won't be good at any other job and leaving will be a mistake. 

I havent got a diploma, and I dropped out of school early. I have almost no qualifications and I hate the working world most of all. 
I just want to run away and live in a camper van haha, but that seems pretty unreasonable.
I don't know what advice I'm after, other than what the f*** do I do from here?",01May2019,1

119,"Sara and I have been best friends since we met in high school. We started an all girl band together, we did everything together. I was there when she was stressed out about having a strict mom, and she was there for me when my parents had a nasty divorce. We’ve been through rough times, we both dropped out of college, not because we aren’t smart we were top 5% in high school, but because we couldn’t afford it. I started spending my time making art and she started spending her time with her boyfriend Todd. Todd seemed cool at first but he and Sara would constantly break up and get back together. I convinced her to stay broken up with him after one night she got drunk as a skunk, kissed me, then told me she had an eating disorder because he would constantly call her fat... and she was a size 4. She later came back to reality and we joked about the mishap that was Todd. Everything was great, we would hang out with my other best friend Lucas and we kind of became a trio. Then I moved a couple towns over and things became less close but not by much. We didn’t see each other much due to conflicting schedules and her not having a car sometimes but we still talked every single day, on the phone with her every lunch break I got. We talked about making music together again because I started seeing someone new and I’m so in love so my music has been less depressing lol. 

I brought up the idea of having a party so one Saturday everyone came but, Sara picked up the booze and we all had a great time but the night was definitely off. Sara brought a girl she has been seeing named Alyssa since they recently became official. What was odd to me, and everyone else at the party, was Alyssa’s maturity level. Sara is a pretty serious, grown up person , but Alyssa acted like a high schooler. She over exaggerated everything she said, talked in a very excited pitchy voice, acted drunk after having one drink. I brushed it off , maybe she’s just quirky. At one point Sara left to go to the corner store so I hung out with Alyssa. It was pretty awkward because not only is Alyssa this explosion of rainbows and excitement, I’m an introverted goth. But I tried to be outgoing, I asked her where she worked, how she and Sara met, small talk. I thought it went well, but I also found out she was only 18. Everything started to click. So at this point I’m pretty drunk and for most of the night I’m hanging out with my other friend Lucas. Sara gets back and I mentioned like “wow Alyssa is a firecracker!”, Sara laughs and we go back to partying. Night ends, everyone leaves, I sink into the couch.

The next day I quick-pay Sara for the booze but she doesn’t respond, I didn’t think much of it. But the day after I am in a full blown panic, my period is late. I’m 21 ,and even though I’ve known the guy I’m seeing for a year it’s new, only 5 months, and he’s 30 so this is a state of emergency. Me and Sara used to joke about how she kept a pregnancy test from when she was with Todd even after she came out just in case I needed it. So I call her panicked, but trying to be chill and basically tell her I might need that test after all. She says I can pick it up from her place. I’m a little relieved so I start to chit chat and she stops me by saying “why are you even talking to me?”. At this point I’m confused af and this is basically how the convo went:

S “why are you even talking to me?”
Me “why wouldn’t I be ? Haha”
S “how drunk were you Saturday do you remember any of it”
Me “yeah like all of it, I was drunk but I didn’t get fucked up until right before everyone had to go home”
S” so you don’t remember”
Me “did I do something to make you upset?”
S “yes” 
Me “can you tell me what I did because i honestly have no clue to what you’re referring to”
S” you can just pick up the test”
Me “Sara, I can’t apologize or fix what’s going on if I have no idea what’s going on, can we just talk about it?”
S “you know my deal and how I am, you can come get the test if you want, then after that we don’t have to talk anymore”
Me “so if I’m correct, you’re angry, you won’t tell me why, won’t let me fix it, and don’t want to be best friends anymore” 
S “exactly”
Me (maybe a bit dramatic in hindsight “you can shove the pregnancy test up your ass, I can buy my own”
*i hang up*

I still have no idea what “I did”. I’m assuming it has something to do with Alyssa because Sara seemed timid around her and I know Sara is the type to care way too much about what people think. I asked Lucas if I was being weird since I spent most of the night around him, he said I was being my normal self. I was very friendly to Alyssa and I was nowhere near too drunk to remember how I acted towards her, I was trying to be a good hostess. I’m wondering if maybe Alyssa lied to Sara about what actually went down. Lucas said maybe Alyssa was jealous of how close Sara and I were and sabotaged it. That may be far fetched but stranger things have happened.

And I feel maybe I shouldn’t have reacted the way I did but is frustrating to be accused of something and not even know what I’m being accused of. I haven’t talked to Sara since that phone call, and I’m not pregnant. I’m a stubborn person and my circle is small because of it . I just feel if someone is willing to throw away a friendship so quickly and so blindly is that friendship even worth trying to fix? Lucas would never do something like that to me but Sara acted hostile towards me a couple times when she was with Todd too. She cares too much about what her significant others think of her and I’ve called her out on it before, but is that even really my place or should she learn from her mistakes? I’m every lost if I should even do anything or leave it alone. Even before the party she started to raincheck on me a lot, but I figured she was having fun getting to know Alyssa and I didn’t mind that because I know what it’s like to fall for someone , I’m in the midst of it myself. I miss my friend but was she even a true friend to begin with? Am I the one who is blind?",01May2019,1

Like, when I look back in photos, I don’t think I ever felt like the person I looked like. I don’t know if this makes sense.

123,"So this is not a revenge story yet, but I’m working on getting some revenge. I just need help figuring out how to get it.  

Here’s a bit of context to justify me wanting revenge on the person who ruined my life. I just want to get back at them for ruining my romantic life. 

Basically what happened is that I asked a friend how I should handle an intimate text between me and my partner, I asked because i’m new to the relationship world and was afraid to respond in a wrong way. 

The text was about how they wanted to have sex with me and other things.  I didn’t know how to respond and that’s how I ended up asking this trusted friend. 

When I showed them the text didn’t even try to help.  And earlier that day that friend went behind my back and told my partner, now my so wants nothing to do with me because of it.  

It might not seem like it’s worth revenge now, but this person has betrayed me several times on the past as well and has caused a lot of trouble within my group and my school. 

I’d also like to add that my so and I broke up earlier in the week and just got back together 4 days ago. We went trough a lot of tough situations within those few days and now this. I had really hoped that we would make up after that sad messy breakup but now my chances of getting back with the person I love most is gone thanks to this friend.

How can i get back at them for ruining my happiness and my relationship?",01May2019,1
124," 

This is my first time posting ever on reddit, but it’s a throwaway account so I guess it doesn’t matter. A bit of backstory: my little sister and I always got along, occasional fights but just normal sibling bickering. She was transferred into a different middle school than the one zoned to her, met some “different” people, kind of got into an emo/goth phase and cut herself (stopped a couple years ago but still sticks with the phase, she’s in 9th grade high school now). During her transition from middle school to high school, she “bonded” with her 32 year old tech guy at the school and they became very close, even texting through social media apps. He was fired from the school for this and she is now homeschooled. She convinced my mother that homeschooling would make her happier, but she now has no friends and never leaves her room or obeys our parents. She and this man have been talking/dating (for about a year now) through discord and my parents have such differing opinions on the solution that nothing is being done about it. My family is very stubborn, but my sister and father are stubborn in an aggressive way whereas my mother is stubborn in a blissfully ignorant way. Oh, my sister goes skateboarding a couple days a week for the whole day long, which my father and I know that she is most likely going to meet this guy. My mother does not want to believe this and thinks that if we are all nice and loving to her then she will change her behavior. My father believes that she needs to be put in a public school and have her electronics taken away to fix her extreme attitude. However, my father has given up all hope on my sister because she is hostile towards the family and anyone who isn’t her 32 year old boyfriend, and my mother’s constant babying her and protecting her from my father isn’t helping. I agree with my dad, but he is such a true believer in “tough love” that it sometimes comes across as just tough and no love. I have spoken with my grandmother (mom’s side) about it and she agrees as well. But my mom also has most control over my sister’s schooling and tunes out anyone who tells her what she doesn’t want to hear. My sister’s selfishness has led to bad family fights at least once per week. He has not been arrested because technically, he did not break any law, he just lives at home with his girlfriend (not my sister, this dude lives with his girlfriend that he claimed to my sister was an ex and they only still live together for money convenience). I am 18 in college while my sister is 15 in 9th grade. I have considered calling the local high school and enrolling her myself as step 1, but I’m pretty sure I will need a transcript and other paperwork from her online school that I won’t be able to get without her and my mother finding out. She plans on moving in with the pedophile as soon as she turns 18 and probably cutting off the family so I’m really hoping to solve this asap. Also really hoping my sister doesn’t browse reddit. It's weird to publicly post about such a personal thing, but I'm tired of this going on when it doesn't have to. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks",01May2019,0

 Me and this girl had on and off problems for months practically every week. Today we finally came to the conclusion that it just wasn't working as badly as both of us wanted to stay together. It just wasn't working she didnt take it all that good but I wasn't expecting a hug goodbye or anything. 

It just hurts so bad I literally have nobody anymore and nothing. I dont have any hobbies or passions. And I dont have the money to ""pay"" for one necessarily till I'm graduated. I bought a notebook and some pencils and stuff and started to vent and make raps to get my mind clear but it doesnt take away how stressed out I am. Everything is just crashing down around me and I'm all by myself holding it up.

I don't have anything against murderers, but I don't want the suffering for the girl to end. So the question is, should I kidnap and rape her?

I've since moved back in with them and its been a year and a half since I've been on my own.  
I don't go to college I just work. I'm starting to regret not going and that I'm gonna miss out on all the things kids my age get to do. But I always feel like I'm just wasting my time on everything and that its pointless to even try. I've always been given empty promises on so many things. I never got braces so I'm having to do that on my own for some reason. And I don't feel like my parents ever taught me how to be an adult. I'm having to learn all this shit on my own and it isn't helping.  


I'm so fucking depressed all the time. All I do when I get home from work is just go to my computer and work on music. And that's literally the only thing that keeps me going.  
Time just keeps creeping up on me. I remember feeling really anxious during the new year as if summer was already here. I turned 22 this past month and when the day came I cried for an hour and had a severe panic attack.   


  
I live in a place where there are really no kids my age but I also don't wanna live in the state that I'm living in either. For some reason it just doesn't feel like I'm supposed to be here, but I can't move out because I just don't know how. I was never taught how to do anything.  


I keep comparing myself to other people in other places. I feel like I was supposed to already know how to be on my own (going out and having sex and all that). I haven't gotten to be in a lot of REAL relationships with people. And I haven't gotten to have a lot of sex and I feel that means that no one will want me and that I'm not experienced enough for a girl who's my age to like me back. ( I know that's stupid to say, but it just feels that way). I feel like girls are gonna compare me to previous boyfriends and think I'm not good enough for them because I don't have enough relationship experience like they do.  


But I don't wanna just settle for someone either. I actually want someone I legitimately like. But every time I find someone I actually like (which has only happened twice), they end up trying to play games with me and are really manipulative.  


But now I'm also getting to the point where I don't even really find anyone attractive at all because of those last two experiences (both personality physically speaking). ESPECIALLY because of the last girl I came across.  


I never got to see a real healthy relationship up close. I've only gotten to see people get divorced and people cheating on each other so it makes relationships feel pointless. I don't WANT to go through that.   
I've been making attempts to take better care of myself. I was actually gaining a lot of weigh in 2017 and turned it around and I'm still running almost everyday and I'm as skinny as I was in high school.  
I'm also doing my best to focus on making more music. And I'm sort of trying to see more girls but they again all end up being mentally unstable. I'm not trying to say that to act like that's how all girls are (because thats obviously not the case I just don't understand why this keeps happening). It's making me not want to go after anyone even more because I feel like I'm wasting my time.

For many reasons we want a new start somewhere else.

We are open to other places.

Some preferences on where we might go.:

* Lower cost of living than South FL 
* Near a large city with lots of activity (festivals, museums, shopping, dining) 
* Good pay for medical professionals 
* Good schools 
* No (or at least minimal) snow
* And this one is sad but we just want to live around nice people. People in South Florida are just miserable. Young, old, white, black, hispanic, rich, poor.....all miserable and rude around here. I want to hear ""sir"" and ""ma'am"" or at least a please and thank you every now and then.

130,"Disclaimer: I’m a 15m with divorced parents and a generally broken family. Having an unusual amount of independence from a very young age mixed with being generally ahead of my age physically makes me decently mature for my age. Most of my friends are 17-18 y/o Juniors and Seniors. I go to a school with a shit ton of drugs in a depressing rural northeast area. 

I’ve been with this girl before for about a year and a half and we had a legitimate love connection. I really loved and cared about her but ended up breaking up with her because she was doing drugs and I refused to date long distance. (She had to go thousands of miles away for multiple months, and my mind was in other places; as I was working 8-12 hours per day and had new friends from my work). 

Since we broke up I had a (in retrospect) rebound relationship that lasted for a few months before realizing I genuinely missed this girl and was even really still in love with her. Knowing she had gone down a different path in life (I’m no angel, but I’m conscientious and intelligent in my own right and drugs aren’t super appealing to someone who is so) I thought the relationship would never happen. This was an extremely depressingly lonely revelation. I started talking to her again. A few days into talking I confessed that I still really missed her and she reluctantly confessed she felt the same way. The problem is she’s heavily into drugs. She mostly just smokes weed and uses THC dab pens but she also does more serious drugs like DXM (robetessin hallucinogen) on occasion. Unfortunately in order to follow this love I either have to get her to stop doing drugs, tolerate her drug use while myself not participating, or do drugs myself, and all seem equally bad and I have no intention on doing any of the three. Regardless, if I want to be with this girl, which I reaaaaallly really do, I have to make a choice.

He looked like he was about to have the best time with my Xbox because he had his pillows, blanket, food, drink, and laptop all ready for his time of relaxation. He must have noticed something because he said, ""You can have your Xbox back."" But I ignored him, and then he must have gotten mad because he yelled,  ""You're such a big baby!"" before packing up all of his stuff, putting my Xbox back in my room, and shutting himself in his room. 

First, I'm not a baby. Second, he touched my Xbox without my consent. Thirdly, am I the baby or did he overreact?",01May2019,1
133,My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly a year now. It’s been a rocky road but we’ve hit a bump and this one feels a lot more serious. We’ve been talking about breaking up. He’s broken up with me in the spur of a moment before but it never sticks for more than an hour. This time is different because he’s been talking about it all the time and not just when he’s angry. Does it sound like he’s finally losing feelings for good this time or should I hold on to hope that things might get better? I’m struggling to figure out whether or not I should keep having hope or prepare myself..,01May2019,1
134,"I’m 18, my husband is 19. We are living with one of my coworkers atm and her younger siblings were visiting for the weekend. One being a 15 year old girl. 
I came back from work one night and seen my husband and this girl cuddling. The next night, same thing. I’m angry and sad about it and he’s mad at me for feeling like this over that. 
Before we got met irl, when we were just dating online, he was 18 and had cheated on me with several girls, most of which were between the ages of 13-15 (I didn’t find out until after we were married). 
Are my feelings of anger and sadness reasonable and valid in this situation? Is it reasonable to be suspicious that other things happened between them? Or am I just being a huge melodramatic bitch?",01May2019,1
135,"Hi Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

This matter happened over the weekend. I went to park my car in a parking lot. Right next to a big SUV. After I parked, I realized that I had parked too close to the car next to me, and the driver had no space to enter his car. So, I backed up, and because I was so close to him, as I was backing up; I ended up scraping his left back door and back panel with my right mirror. :( 

&amp;#x200B;

Not wanting to be like the person who keyed my car, and left. I posted a note with my phone number, along with my name. The next day he contacted me saying that he would get a quote for his damaged car door and his back panel. A few days later, he texted me say that through the dealership he got an estimate for repainting his car, for a grand total of $2,990 (full body paint job). Despite, the fact that I only damaged his back left car door and rear back panel. The only catch is that this is through a very expensive dealership, and also in an expensive city. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, I do not want to have to file an insurance claim, because I am worried that it will jack up my rates. Also, I work at a place where my employment might be in jeopardy, if my employee found out that I got into a car accident, I could lose my job. 

  
Dear Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

What are you're thoughts on how I should handle this?",01May2019,1
136,"First and foremost, as much as I wish this was a troll post, it's not. I'm genuinely conflicted on what to do and would like serious advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently posted on AITA to the quick consensus that I'm not being crazy and that my mom has seriously got to realize some boundaries. To sum it up, here's what happened:

Tonight, after getting out of the shower, I (15) went straight into my room and sat down in my desk chair, which happens to be facing away from my bed. I, being a horny goblin teenager, decided to do some horny goblin teenager things in said chair. I start going at it for a solid minute until I hear a voice from behind me:

""*Yahooass...""*

I spin around and out pops my mother, who was hiding under my covers. Of course, I was embarrassed beyond belief and immediately screamed ""What the fuck?! Get out!"" to which my mother responded that she was hoping to surprise me and asked me not to kick her out of my room (not to continue watching me masturbate, but to hang out). Of course, I told her to ""Get the fuck out"" (perhaps not the nicest choice of words but can you blame me). She then got up, dragged herself out, complaining about how I'm always so mean to her, and slammed the door.

I know I shouldn't have screamed, but I was embarrassed out of my mind, and frankly pretty damn angry. I still am angry due to a few main reasons:

\- My mom knows I don't like being seen naked, yet she hid in my room despite knowing I was fresh out of the shower and obviously naked

\- She knows I hate being surprised, especially in places where I'm comfortable (I have a lot of post traumatic stress (which she knows about), so surprises aren't good for me)

\- She literally *watched* for a solid minute. To be fair, I wasn't facing her, but anybody with eyes and ears would know what was happening.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm obviously very angry and very shocked. By entering my room while I was showering and waiting for me to return, she obviously knew she would see me naked, which is already far out of my comfort zone with my family. What makes it worse is that she sat and watched me touch myself for a solid minute. I would hope that the boundary here is obvious, but apparently to her it was not. I don't believe she was trying to be predatory, but I've been made extremely uncomfortable.

Should I say something to her? If so, what? It'll be said over text because I can barely look her in the eye right now, but if something needs to be said (that wasn't made obvious by my clear embarrassment) then I would like to say it.",01May2019,3
137,"Not really that NSFWish, but this eating me up. I'm a recently 22 yr old female. I never really had any sexual encounters. My closest was when I was much younger and I barely dabbled in it when I found I wasn't that interested. And it's been that way for a while. This, alongside body image issues and the fear of pain, has kept me away from exploring in general.

 However, recently I think I've actually developed some kind of libido and it's aggravating. I'm not sure what to do. I can't get passed my initial penetration fears, even with a finger. Somewhat recently I had my first gynecology appointment, and I couldn't go through with it because it was too painful. So I'm also worried it could get in the way of my health. 
It seems I can't do it on my own either, because I chicken out or am too... stressed/afraid of it, that it hurts. Not only physically, but it hurts me mentally as well. It makes me feel like something's wrong with me. I'm not sure what to do. 

I don't think I can do it on my own, but I don't know anyone who I'm comfortable with asking for help and who would even be ok to help. My friend has suggested hooking up, but with someone I don't know... that scares me. Though I don't think anyone would be interested in me anyways.
 I was also suggested to try getting drunk but I don't really like alcohol nor can I drink much of it. Plus, as silly as it sounds, I want to be at least somewhat mentally present for the first time - even if it's not actually having sex, you know? I just don't know what to do or what steps to even get out of this. I'm pretty sure there is no lubrication issues, and maybe it's all nerves. I don't know...

138,"Tldr: when is it okay to talk about yourself, and what do you do when most of the things you have to say, the other person can't relate to?

I'm a person that deals with some social anxiety. I was thinking of problems I should tackle and one of them is that I never ever talk about myself. Even when things are bad I sum it up to when friends ask, I'm tired I'm just so busy with college and work lol.  There's a lot more than that of course.
 And not just negative stuff either, I mean I rarely ever talk about myself. And there's a bit of a reason. 
 I can't talk about my past because most of it was fighting abusive parents so in most scenarios where there's a conversation about family I have nothing to say without it getting dark. A lot of my interests are sort out of the loop... like I love hidden gems in anime. I'm an artist that draw furries, once again hard to bring up. [Not to mention I'm so deep into the technical art stuff like tools and techniques most of my friends would get super lost even if they were artists.] I like fashion a little, but most of my friends are nerds that don't care about it. I'm usually in my head dealing with things and thinking about my own mental health and that's fairly private too. So it's hard to bring that up. And the list goes on with excuses about why I don't talk about myself.
 Even friends that I could talk to admit that I never speak about myself for some reason. [Seriously if you ever wanted to meet the silent protagonist I fit that role.]
 I want to learn to be able to talk about myself a bit more without feeling odd because I'm certain some of these things I'm just making excuses.",01May2019,1
139,"Okay so this isn't as serious compared to the other post on her however I still would love some advice. 

Ever since I could remember I've been sensitive to clothing materials, I'm not allergic. 

It was mainly pants, and socks. Although I did manage to get over the uncomfortable pants thing I never could with the socks. It's not just uncomfortable no it's itchy and a burning tingly type feeling that literally causes me to freak the hell out. I avoided the damn things all the way until I turned 18 however my feet are now dry and rough and are starting to hurt. I have a treatment plan however it means I need to wear socks for an hour multiple times a day. I want to get over this damn thing so if anyone has had similar issues what helped you get over it?

I can pass off as white as I look predominantly white. I do appreciate native americans due to their technological innovations (Maya and Aztec) and their culture. They are the race of people I want on earth with whites; Mongoloids.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So back in August of last year, I bought a bank draft from my account in bank A in country B. Came back to Canada to deposit it at CIBC, got my money in 5-10 business days as usual, nothing out of the ordinary.

&amp;#x200B;

Then a couple months later, end of October, I received a call from CIBC telling me there was something wrong with my bank draft. Immediately I called them back and they told me that the bank draft was lost, and they needed an original copy to finish the process.

&amp;#x200B;

(It did cross my mind that it might have been a scam, I was very skeptical at first, but I went down to the bank myself to talk to the branch manager and verified.)

&amp;#x200B;

I essentially told them I would do my best, anything short of me flying back to country B I would try.

&amp;#x200B;

Some more background, I couldn't call bank A because I don't have telephone banking setup, that would have to be done in person, which means I would have to fly to country B.

&amp;#x200B;

Here comes all the trouble. I have work during the day and so I told CIBC to email me instead of calling.

&amp;#x200B;

After a lot of emails, bank A told me not to do anything because for all intents and purposes I have deposited the cheque, and it was out of my hands. They wanted CIBC to email them details of what happened, photocopy of the cheque, etc. I forwarded their request.

&amp;#x200B;

CIBC in all their emails have ignored me asking for a summary of what happened. I only got the gist they somehow lost it somewhere and now could not ask bank A for money because they don't have the original cheque. I was panicking when I got the phone call and it had been a while.

&amp;#x200B;

In a couple of the emails they actually implied I lost the cheque and they were ""assisting \[me\] to obtain a new one"". Every time I asked them to clarify they would immediately call me. I got the sense they didn't want to assume any responsibility and so required all communication through email.

&amp;#x200B;

They also kept asking me to initiate contact first with bank A because bank A would not talk to them as they were not me. Which I understand, but because bank A already told me this should be deal with between banks, and I can't talk to bank A (again, no telephone banking), I asked them to forward me their email to bank A and I would ask a friend from country B to physically go to the bank and talk to them. See if bank A is willing to reach out first.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened twice. They never replied.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now. I had a couple GICs in my CIBC account and they matured a couple weeks ago. CIBC froze the money.

&amp;#x200B;

I emailed them and they basically told me the issue can only be resolved through a meeting or on the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Called their call centre, talked to one of the supervisors, escalated the situation. The supervisor asked if I could prove the money left my account. I asked if statements would work, he said they should work since I can't call them (no telephone banking). I emailed them all my statements from August to now. Got a reply email that said,

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""\[...\] The back office finalized their investigation and shared the below results to me.

Their results suggest the item deposited in August was “non negotiable” meaning CIBC could not get the funds from the cheque. We will need either a confirmation from the issuing bank that your account at the other Financial Institution was debited and that the funds had left the other bank’s account, or another cheque or bank draft. \[...\]

What we will need to solve all this would be either a new cheque from them, or a confirmation from them that the funds both left your account and theirs. \[...\]""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not quoting the whole email because this post is long enough as it is.

&amp;#x200B;

So they basically told me the same thing again. And they couldn't get the money because they lost the original, not because my cheque was bad!

&amp;#x200B;

Am I supposed to take time off work, buy a plane ticket, and buy another bank draft because of someone else's mistake. Should I ask them to issue a formal letter? They haven't this entire time. What happens if in the letter they imply that I lost it and I get charged for a replacement. But I can’t get a replacement without going the bank A in person. Have I basically lost all my money at this point?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone who work at banks or just in general have any advice? Thanks guys.

So, in my absence. I found out my aunt almost burned the house down. She gets on these drugs where she bounces off the wall all night. She hallucinates. At about 3 in the morning, she decided to cook ham for whatever reason. Yes, big, Thanksgiving style ham. But she put it in the oven and forgot about it.

Later, our fire alarms went off, we woke up, the house was full of smoke. I don't know if they had to call 911, but the house was saved because they woke up. Grandpa and Dad yelled at my aunt. I got the frantic phone call from my sister this morning. She told me the whole story. If it weren't for my dad waking up, clearing everyone out and stopping the fire, we all could have died.

She does this a lot. She'll turn on all the lights and cooks. It always wakes me up. Sometimes she's hungry, but other times, she just leaves it on the stove and lets it burn. Thankfully, i've been awake to turn it off before it gets too bad.

I have an adolescent sister at home and i worry she may be in danger too.

This is worse and even more scary for me, because i sleep in the living room. That kitchen stove is only, a few feet at most from where i usually sleep. If i didn't wake up on time, i could've honestly died.

I feel very consumed by regret about my past because I keep thinking if I started this degree from the beginning, I will be so far ahead and I wouldn’t have to deal with this problem. I also hate the fact that I have to put up with another 4 years of uni and coursework stress. 

Any advice on how I can stop feeling so consumed my all this? I really want to get over it because my thinking has really impacted my well-being and ability of focus. I really want to work and improve on myself and I believe that changing my mindset will improve my life so much.",01May2019,2

He has made it so difficult to work with him. He has mocked me and several others. And it seems the supervisors let him get away withthis behavior. It was tothe point i felt itwas sexism because i am a five foor tall woman and he only did this to me. And i thought another female cowoker. Mainly because i had asked her if she felt she was treated differently because she was a woman. (Her response to me was ""everyday."" Her response to mamagement was completely different.)
Anyways. Nowitsto the point i am being singled out because i have brought these issues to their attention. And they blame me for them. Stating they have never had this issue in my deparment... Ever. 
They told me that no nody likes me and in fact everyone hates me and hates working with me.

Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school.

How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism?

175,"Hi all,

Right now I work for an IT services company that is contracted to a major hospital. The hospital has decided they will take things in house and kick out my company in August. They gave my managers and directors a shortlist of people they want to hire from our company and I'm on that list. 

I am in charge of a large operation, I do the bulk of the work with only 1 person to help, this is a 3-4 person job. Hate to toot my own horn, but at this moment, I am valuable to them. In August once the hospital takes over, I'll get around a 60%-90% raise and government benefits(Canada) automatically with my exact same position and I am very confident I can climb the ladder fairly quickly in that role. 

Now, waiting for the hospital to take over hasn't been easy. It's been almost 2 years of waiting and extending. This time is supposed to be set in stone and not extended again. I've applied to other roles but never got any offers.

Until I was contacted by another company for a more senior role with a ~70% raise, it seems like a good company and key point: it has younger people my age, healthcare is all older people and it's getting a little boring. Don't get me wrong, I like working in a big busy building, which this new job won't be, but I wish the people were younger. 


This new job would be very similar to what I do now, actually a little bit easier and it would be a team lead kind of role which I think I might get once the hospital takes over. I think I'm guaranteed an analyst position, not sure about team lead.

I know the decision is ultimately up to me, but I am looking for a different set of eyes to see if I'm missing something, etc so please excuse my rambling

TL;DR at bottom

I'm a 16yo (m) and I have no idea what to do. I just want to be a girl, but alas I'm not. I dont want to be that one guy that self diagnoses himself, so I have mixed feelings whether I have gender dysphoria or not. This has been going on for a long time, since I was in 2nd grade. I live in an area that not only has a low opinion of LGBT, but I live with semi-anti LGBT parents.
This is what causes fear for me to come out.

I've only ever told one friend, and he accepts me, which relieves me. What has been happening lately is that I've gotten depression. I wouldnt say it's a major depression, but enough for me to start damaging my body.

I have never tried crossdressing nor putting on makeup because of my parent's beliefs and fear of getting caught. Although my parents could have the slightest possibility of accepting me, I have an extreme fear of disappointing my parents.

I dont want to tell any teacher or counselor at my school for fear of having to also confront my parents (I dont know how guidance counselors work with private things like this).

I dont trust telling any of my friends except for the one I've already told.

It is slowly eating at me on the inside, what can I do that doesnt involve confronting my parents?

TL;DR: I possibly have gender dysphoria and dont want to come out to semi-anti LGBT parents and school, causing depression.

188,"I'm 23 years old, and this is my 5th year in college.

Before college I had no idea what I wanted to do. My interests were all over the place, and all I really was well-known for was how approachable I am, my athletic ability, and drawing skills.

I wanted to be a graphic designer, but was discouraged out of it because my dad said that profession wasn't the most financially sound.

No knowing what to do, I decided to just do what seemed like what they wanted me to do.

I originally came to my university under the major of Nursing, due to the pressure of parents who expected me to be like my older brother. Some family friends of my parents noticed my lack of passion and pure disinterest, and talked to me about what I was interested in, and *what did I really want to do.*

* I liked to tinker with things.
* I loved getting hands-on with stuff.
* I had a passion for cars.

My dad eventually understood how I felt and I changed my major to mechanical engineering the following semester. 

I came to understand that my parents really just wanted me to do the best I can, to strive well in my academics, and have a good job, good life.

Everything was smooth sailing until, come 4th year, where I constantly was *fucking up* calculus III of all goddamn classes. every class I did well but that. No matter what I tried to improve, it was only marginal, and still I kept failing.

I failed countless times, my GPA dwindled to the point of academic probation, then suspension for a semester.

It eventually came to the point to where I couldn't take the class anymore, and eventually, *cannot progress in the college of engineering any more.* Proceed to tell me how much of a dumbass I am for failing the same class *three* times, as many people have said that cal3 is loads easier than cal2. I acknowledge my inability to understand simple concepts, as others perceive them to be.

So I'm now here, coming to my 5th year of college, with absolutely nothing.

I don't know what major I can even do at this point.

*I need help. Advice on what to do, where to go, anything.*

I have no idea how my parents would feel about me if they were to discover how much of a fuckup I became.

Their two sons: 

One who went through 4 years smoothly, made his family proud, and is doing well as a nurse,

And one who's a complete fuckup, an absolute failure at basically anything, with no redeemable skills in possibly any sort of job field.

I wanted to make my parents proud, but how can I even do that at this point when I fucked up big time, made them waste their money on my tuition for just... **nothing.**

I've contemplated suicide. Multiple times. I eventually just welcomed the fact that suicide is basically the easy way out, and that it'll just do nothing but bring endless pain to my friends, my brother, and my parents. I couldn't do that to them, as I love them.

But at this point, I don't know what to do anymore.

190,"So in a friend's (private) discord server, someone I know writes a message something like ""I luv you all, you are the best friends I ever knew."" someone points out how she said ""knew"" and then she corrects it.

I send her a personal message, and she says she's not going to do it tonight, maybe tomorrow.  
Knowing what she means, and she also gave me some reasons why she is going to kill herself. Pretty much her best friend left her, she has about no friends irl, She screwed up her future, and she has nothing to live for anymore.

The advice I gave her was pretty much; the years will get better, I gave her the suicide hotline number, I said if her screwing up her future mean't failing school that there are other options other than going through school(and failing school isn't the end), She wants to do computer science, so I gave her some examples of people who learned coding without college and what not. I gave her my personal experiences with people committing suicide, and my suicidal thoughts, and some other stuff.

What else should I tell her? Where should I point her? what should I do?",01May2019,3
191,Hey guys! Just wanted some other thoughts. So I’m recently getting divorced. My husband does not live with me or my daughter. We live in the family home we purchased together for 250k he doesn’t want to sell it if I end up moving so he said we should get a home equity loan and split 50/50. But wouldn’t I be getting screwed? Like if we were to sell it and we split whatever’s left 50/50 vs the 80k we have in the home. I hope that makes sense.,01May2019,1

One of his ex-girlfriends just posted yesterday on her private instagram a picture in which the caption accused him of raping her when they were 15 and she also called out another person for sexually assaulting her. She claimed that these experiences still traumatize her. My ex boyfriend was sent a screenshot of this post by one of his friends. He sent it to me &amp; claims that it never happened and he has no idea why she is accusing him of raping her...he claims she must be crazy and asking for attention. I want to believe him but I don’t know what to believe anymore. Is it a bad idea to message her on Facebook and ask her if she would tell me her side of the story?",01May2019,1

I backed off, and I’m p shy too, but I can be loud when I get comfortable. He’s another level of shy tho... I decided to just try and be friends. It worked really well. The other girls got boyfriends and moved on. 

He’s really depressed too, and so am I so I kept talking to him about our journeys. Even as friends tho, I always initiate conversation via text. 

Recently he asked me to go watch a movie w him... but then he added a third person immediately almost as if to avoid any awkwardness. Then he came to my birthday dinner which... IF U COULD SEE HOW SHY HE IS UD UNDERSTAND HOW BIG OF A DEAL THAT IS.

So I started fucking liking him again, but this time I’m unable to just turn it off. But he gives so many mixed signals dude... like he still never texts first. He lets convos die...he complains bout his traumas then disappears (granted he is shy but DAMN can u just text first once??? Even as a friend??) 

Idk. and I have traumas of my own so now I just feel like I’m not good enough and it’s really hurting me. But the last thing I want to do is read too much into mixed signals. Also I wouldn’t want to ask him out and it’s awkward at work, or I push for it too soon and come off super desperate. Should I just stop being all desperate and stop texting him until he texts me? Even a shy boy would still try to talk to someone they like right? And texting makes it easy...

I’ve been using it since I was 12. I used to go on this one app a lot and to be honest, I feel like it’s what made me into the person I am today. ONLINE ONLY. 
As the years went by, I’ve always been quite popular. Like I always had my own little group. Ngl, in the past I was quite toxic. And I have a reputation of pissing people off. Not that I do it on purpose or want to, but I just don’t look before I leap if you get what I mean. People tell me countless of times, like I’m a child. I nod, I apologize and then it’s the next thing I do. I do/say some shit and boom, someone gets mad and I get blocked. 

It’s happened so many times, it becomes a meme at this point. Literally friends/past friends joke about it. I just kind of brush it off, because I deserve it and I can’t really do anything to stop it. Ive been memed other reasons too, but those are good reasons. 

I try my best, to calm down and not get too excited and say some shit that’ll piss or upset someone. However it always backfires and it comes off as if I’m insensitive. Then when someone blocks or ignores me, my heart/stomach (?) gets this weird hurting sensation and then I start getting these thoughts. I guess irrational thoughts? Like thinking of the bad and shit. Is that a panic/anxiety attack? Anyways usually it ends up being fine in the end and everyone goes back to being my friend. This is the luck, the luck I’ve always had. Or people are that nice enough to still continue to be friends with me. 

I don’t like losing friendships. Never did. I always like to apologize and hope I can get them back as a friend.  Anyways, let’s skip to the present. So I recently discovered Stan twitter a few... months ago? I loved it. Everyone seemed so nice and so open. I was on a certain side of Stan twitter too, so people who liked the same things I did, was nice. Recently, (like I said, I get really hyper and don’t know what I say/type in the moment) I’ve been saying things. People didn’t take it so well and got offended. My new friend on there tried to warn me that I should watch what I say, etc. I didn’t listen and kind of came off as a jerk. She felt offended and well i tried to apologize a day later. She forgave me and all was good. She’s not like the others on Stan Twitter. She’s nice and really smart too. 

Speaking of, Stan Twitter is very different. From what I know and from my time being there, everyone seems to just tweet about whatever they want. Not a bad thing necessarily, but some are stupid and just plain old rude. They’re also the type of people that if you get into a disagreement with, they’d probably unfriend/block you in a heartbeat. Even if you knew them for a very long time. At least that’s what my friend told me. I believed it. 

Now, skip to this week... this week hasn’t been kind at all. 

It all started this weekend. So I’ve been saying stuff on Twitter, this and that, and I was in a group chat. My friend (whom I mentioned earlier) had a disagreement and I said, “Let’s Just call it a day.” And we did just that. Then I go and tweet about it. My friend sees it, and I’m kind of a jerk to her. The tweets were mostly directed to her and our convo earlier. She warned me and whatnot, and I took it with a grain of salt. 

Of course now this following week, I’ve been on the edge. People have been kind of giving me a cold shoulder so to speak. Now I talk to my friend about that, and they’re all like “I tell you this for a reason. I care about you and if you don’t stop this blah blah blah, you can get into something nasty and ppl will hate you.” And honestly they make sense. So I decided from then on, to watch what I say. 

Let’s skip to now? I got removed from the group chat. I have no clue why, but I have a pretty good idea what it is. I think it’s because of well... me obviously. How I am, how hyper and non tactful I can be. How I say before I think and don’t look before I leap. My friend is offline so I can’t go and talk to them. 

I’m coming to ask, how can I better myself? That’s why I’m asking for advice. That’s why I’m here. How can I stop being such an asshole, without trying to be one on purpose? I genuinely don’t mean it. 

And also should I leave that side of twitter? And should I apologize? I like this side of twitter even if it can be stupid and toxic. I like the people that I follow, it’s cool. I like the friends that I have made too. Should I just go to my other accounts instead? I like to rp and the RP side of twitter seems really tame and the people are smart there too. Should I apologize as well? I’m nervous and having second thoughts, because well I don’t think they’d accept it. It’s not even worth it.

I very recently started to buy more clothing (I’m over age so obviously my parents won’t buy me clothing so I buy things myself), and I really like the clothing I buy. 

Apparently so does my sister.

Most of the time she doesn’t even ASK she just comes into my room in the morning (she gets up early for high school and I sleep in) and takes my hoodie or jacket off the rack to wear. 

It’s annoying because I tell her to stop, she says okay, then continues to do it. Every time she asks now I immediately say no because I don’t want her to wear my clothing as I have barely NOTHING compared to her. Her closet is full of clothing, as she gets whatever she asks for from my dad.

I go out, with MY money and buy MY OWN clothing and she just takes it, gets her long dyed red hair in it and then sprays perfume all over it. It takes like 3 washes to get that smell completely out.

Any advice on how to get her to stop? I can’t really lock my door because my dog comes in and out of my room and I think I have him PTSD from locking him in there while I used to work in the mornings. It seems whatever I say to her goes in one ear and out the other.",01May2019,1

I've worked my way up the chain, and performed the job duties below me for 3 years meaning I know the difference between what we can do, what we should do, and who's not performing. Also I was in the military with my own team who were high performers, meaning I know what good effective leadership can produce. 

Situation : one employee is not fit for employment with the position.  The employee was transferred to my department 3 years ago from a completely different department. The employee hS been tested at the position under me and failed, and are consistently making critical errors that is basic skills for the position.

The dilemma:  between termination and demotion. My boss does not let me speak with the employee fearing we would halt her progress of the disciplinary actions rolling in. Instead, my team, and more importantly I, have to continuously fix their error (which is multiple times each day). The person is gearing up for retirement but doesn't have enough leave to cover half a year to get there. 

What I want to do : tell the employee their mistakes are escalating enough to warrant major disciplinary actions. I fear, though, my boss would use it against me to dismiss me under probationary status (we have a past due to their neglectful, demeaning, and paranoid Leadership style).

228,"Hi. 

I’ll try to keep my background story short. I’m from Kentucky originally. Moving to Chicago was my dream as a teenager. I managed to get the highest merit scholarship offered by DePaul and was ecstatic. I finally convinced my parents to let me go, then had a mental breakdown after a bad breakup and had to return home at the end of my freshman year. DePaul allowed me to come back after an emergency withdrawal and even reinstated my scholarship but I didn’t last a semester before blowing it again. Years later I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, which explains all the volatility. I’m in intensive therapy for it.

I am now 23. I am about to graduate from the state school in my hometown. That is a big accomplishment, but I am filled with dread. I want to move back to Chicago. I felt more at home there than I ever have here, but I feel debilitated by my mental illness. I have no concrete plans, no career goals, just a near-useless undergraduate degree in psychology. I have almost no money. I do doordash almost every day trying to save, but it’s chump change. And even if I had the means, or something waiting for me in Chicago, I am terrified of screwing up again.

I don’t know how or where or what to look—for jobs, or apartments, or roommates. For affordable therapy once I’m up there. For anything.

I’m determined, though. Leaving Chicago was the biggest mistake of my life and I’ll never forgive myself if I don’t right that wrong.

Please, if anyone has any resources or suggestions—I’m all ears. Thank you.",01May2019,1

234,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is my friend told me that his Dad is in debt, a lot of debt, like roughly $50,000 in debt when converted to dollars. I remember his dad as a smart guy but I was told he took a lot of risks business wise with shady partners and what not and now he can't even get help from any of his friends or family members even though he helped them out when they needed it the most (His dad's siblings are basically the definition of r/ChoosingBeggars.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel the responsibility to help my friend, they're like a second family to me, even though I can't help them financially (I'm not in a good position myself) I at least want to give him some advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

**More insight into their situation:**  His dad used to be in a high ranking position at a Telecom company, but now he's feeling helpless because he can't find a job due to his loan, coupled with the fact that he's almost 60. I heard he's getting addicted to throwing money on online lottery tickets as a quick fix to solve his and his family's problems. Knowing them I know their Dad's intentions are in the right place, he's always been a family man.

236,"First time ever posting to Reddit, talked to a whole bunch of people that agree that I may be overthinking a lot of things going on in my relationship, but I just cant shake the feeling that there is something wrong. This past week I feel like my relationship with my boyfriend has been really strained. I'm not actually sure if I did anything to upset him. We had a small disagreement that went away after he slept but other than that nothing else. Things have been relatively normal, he talks to me everyday like everything is normal, the only difference is that he hasn't really shown me a lot of affection in the past week. We have been together 4 1/2 years and he never really was a big affection giver (its enough though, that I do feel something is different). I personally feel it was the way he was raised since he isn't very affectionate with his family as well and I don't think I've ever heard him tell anyone aside from my self ""I love you"", but usually he will give me small little hugs or ask me for a hug or kiss but he has not done that this week, nor has he told me I love you first. I still hug and kiss him normal and he kisses me back, also tells me he loves me back if I say it. He has always told me that he wouldn't be with me if he didn't love me and I've kept that in mind through all of that. I expressed my appreciation for him yesterday morning saying ""Hey, I just want to thank you for all the thing you have ever did for me"" and he responded with ""Are you going somewhere, why are you saying it in past-tense?"" So that confused me a little since I've been worrying about him possible all week and he was asking me if **I** myself was leaving, which made me feel better I suppose. I felt fine this morning (I actually feel like I should include that I recently started a new birth control that has me extremely hormonal) We had sex as well this morning which was like *phew,* but he woke up this morning he told me he regretted it last night because he is worried I might get pregnant and this is some ""elaborate plan to trap him"". I took this the wrong way I'm sure, but because I feel like he's been losing interest in me everything has me over analyzing. We aren't engaged, I'm only 22 and he's 27, but I have no reason to trap him and we have had sex plenty of times while I was *off* of birth control. He still texts me back when I text him, not as much but still I feel it isn't **as** different as he usually would but definitely noticeable. I haven't really talked about it aside from me mentioning that I've been feeling so moody due to the birth control and I apologized for being weird if I was and a small conversation that I did mention him not really hugging or kissing me and he said to me, ""Oh well, I've had a bad week"" and I didn't know that so I was like , ""Really?"" He said ""yes"" and I asked why but he didn't want to talk about it. He's been talking about maybe taking overtime because of money and I feel like he might be worrying about money since he has to spend a lot on fixing his car recently and hes worried about more things coming up that he might have to fork up more money to fix. He's been heavily cleaning out apartment in case we have to ""move"" (as am I to help out) which to me looks like he might be getting ready to kick me out possibly, I have no clue. I've been drawing my own conclusions and I guess I'm to afraid to talk to him about it in case he tells me something I'd prefer not to hear. Talking to him is hard sometimes because I never know what will upset him or not, plus its hard for me to regurgitate what I am thinking in my head. I wrote him a letter but I have not seen him read it yet. Its been sitting there for 2 days. I don't know. I guess a lot of smalls things that make me question things. Do you think I'm just overthinking it and he is just stressed about something or do you think there might be something bothering him that is related to me in any way?

242,"Hi, throwaway account here because this some real personal stuff that I hope no one I know sees. I just typed this out on a google doc and it's quite long, but please bear with me. 

It would be wrong to not preface this with that I not necessarily a good person myself. I have only managed to restraining myself in times of tension or anger. I have withdrawn when others needed me despite hardly talking to (usually former) friends during my own struggles. I could work a lot harder. These days I don’t completely try to give up on anything anymore, but I find myself not caring for the outcome of my education these next few years.

I will go through a series of events relevant to this situation/relationship.

So, back in mid-June, I broke up with my exe. I thought I was finally cutting a person I considered, and now do again, out of my life. I thought I had surpassed my inner demons and figured I knew who I was. Of course, this feeling of confidence in that turned out to be short-lived, and I cannot help but wonder how farther I could go down this path without a real hard turn again. 

I met my boyfriend nearly two years ago. At the time, I was still taken; if I hadn’t texted him during the school year to hang out shortly after moving into my dorm, we probably wouldn’t have been dating let alone seen each other much around. 

I was amazed at first being at the college I was luckily accepted into, however, I got disillusioned a few weeks into the semester. You see, it did not help that on top of seven classes (which I later dropped one and did fine), I started talking to my exe again once there was less tension and hard feelings between us. At the time, I was also still friends with someone who is pretty much dead to me. I was regretting having broken up with my exe and flirted with him over the phone while he told me about his search for a new partner. Everything then feels very blurry or foreign to me now, but I recall being really shook considering a conflict between him telling me he retained love or affection for me yet moving on with someone else. I pleaded with him. I let that and the dread of the direction of my life weighing on my mind. 

I cracked. I spent the better part of a day with “dead to me” and it led to something horrible. We had no real ‘relationship’. He caught me at a bad time and I told him I didn’t care what he would do to me. I then cried and he became uncomfortable and he tried to ‘make things better’. They were already worse.

I have continually struggled with mostly self-esteem issues, though there are also other things. I relied too heavily on friends to be like shrinks by dumping everything at once on them. That was not right of me. I thought it was all done by the time I decided to go through with counseling for the semester. I eventually was temporarily stable, but had a sudden spike in irrational thoughts that I cannot remember well now about a year ago. 

Until last summer, it really seemed to me that I was mostly passed the self-esteem problems for the most part. I was dead wrong.

Questioning your gender isn’t a fun time when one of the most important people in your life considers it a burden and thinks you are ridiculous because of it. He didn’t understand at all.

My boyfriend and I fought a lot last summer. He called me so many names after using sensitive information, demons from my past that I trusted him with to lay dormant, months after my disclosure of it to him. He didn’t understand as he has only been on the other end of unwanted advances in the past; I tried to explain how I felt. I did not know we would date when it happened. I didn’t know of his existence when I was feeling miserable, suicidal, and alone. I told him after his apology i would give him one more chance. I gave him so many ‘one more’ chances!!! 

I spent almost a week with him in his dorm (going back home once or twice to shower and get more clothes) before this last fall. My exe and I had gone back to talking (with my boyfriend knowing and with half-baked approval as we were on-and-off friends, I swear). My exe, as I mentioned, was flirtatious. I had confided in him how torn I was about my fights with my boyfriend, who even threatened me and himself when I didn’t respond to him when he was out of his right mind. 

He snooped through my phone. I couldn’t believe it. I changed my exe’s name originally out of shame so no one knew I was still in contact, and left it as almost a joke. My exe snapchatted me something, and my boyfriend swore it was ‘an answer’ to something and I had to tell him what. Now I was the one out of my right mind but hadn’t a clue what he could mean. I cried and was scared. I think he threatened to harm himself and my exe if I talked to him again. I told him to kill me. He said he wouldn’t but even now he knows that he can threaten to hurt himself to get to me, though to a far lesser extent.

My gender issues bled into our sex life and he couldn’t stand even the thought that he was in love with someone who might be another guy. I was on edge and called the suicide hotline since I felt I had no other way to find counsel on such short notice one night. I ended up going to the ER in the nearest hospital. 

We broke up for a week in October. It was after I spent fall break and everything with his family to boot. I was unsure about it, but this turned my mind around about my gender issue. One of my only current close friends told me not to get back together to continue a abusive relationship. I guess it was. I just missed him and was willing to see his good qualities, to focus on that.  

This semester has been going alright until lately. I neglected that there is one other person I vowed would never come into or affect my life again. I saw that person at a event on-campus while I was with a friend and some others. All they had to do was look at me before I bolted from the building. They had tapped my shoulder and smiled as if they hadn’t changed me. Hurt me by getting favors from me under the pretense of some mutual feelings. I hate that person. I cried about it days after on the phone with my boyfriend, yet he still had the gall to ask if I did anything myself. Implying I would just cheat. With someone who damaged me, left scars on me that clearly have not completely faded. My trust was so abused in that, like other offhand comments when he apparently can’t comprehend mundane things and jumps to the conclusion that I’m in wrong. That I’m dishonest all of the time. He’s gotten jealous of any of the few non-female identifying friends I’ve ever made in college. (Yes, when with a nonbinary person I’m not even absolved of the possibility that I will cheat.)

Lately I’ve noticed that he’s been using slurs more and more. It’s not like he hadn’t used them before, though not until we were closer to maybe a half-year into our relationship. He seems to harbor nasty feelings towards people who are LGBT+ (including me, I’m bi), mentally ill, and anyone who isn’t white or hispanic. It bothers me. I’ve tried to lean back towards Christianity to understand him and whatnot, but you can’t force beliefs on yourself so easily. We hold opposing social and political views. He’s alsro so pessimistic. 

I wanted to think a year ago I could help him as he would with me to change and grow as a person. I hardly see much change other than less of the bigger fights between us. It hurts because I really love him, but all of this bothers me. He wanted me months ago to set aside the past and forgot it all up to a certain point. It’s only now that I’ve consciously thought on much of this again. We’ve been planning to get married and live together years from now, but maybe I should’ve thought twice before letting it get to that point. I’m just so deep in and fear I won’t get out or he’ll hurt himself. I’ve had that in the back of my mind and it’s what keeps me from losing it. Sometimes it seems calm now. Like calm before the storm.

I don’t know what to do, or what advice I'm looking for. I gues the question is should we continue our relationship? Should we stop planning the future (he's been tailoring his academic path to suit our plans)? If it becomes urgent, how would I break things off? Can we fix things long-term like I hoped we were (we really haven't)?",01May2019,1

During the course of a mundane conversation I mentioned to my friend that my savings account makes around 2% interest (Simple) this is on the high end for a savings account, but is online and there are many others like it.

I should mention this is a major bank that is FDIC insured, I am a lawyer, prudent with money etc. It is not a scam. 

He cannot talk about anything else and becomes angry over text on it if I imply at all that it’s legitimate. His actions are bizarre.

247,"I posted this already in another sub but I wanted to post it in this one as well. I want to start off by saying that this will be a very long post where I attempt to explain what I’ve done and ask for advice at the end. I will try and include as many details as possible. The short story is that I’m a 19 year old that has lost around $4000 since I started gambling roughly two years ago. This is especially bad considering I’ve never had a job. I’ve stopped and I’m currently seeking advice on how to proceed. 

Long story: I started gambling in July of 2017 on a site called checkmategaming(CMG). This is a site where you can play against others in video games and wager money. I played for a while and lost quite a bit of money and a few months later discovered Bovada (an online gambling site). The combination of betting with my friends in real life, betting on CMG, and betting on Bovada lost me some money but it wasn’t too bad as I didn’t bet for large amounts. Fast forward to November of 2018 and that’s where things went to shit.

I bet on the Cowboys vs. Saints game for the largest amount I had bet before ($50). Obviously this wasn’t a lot but after losing this money, I started betting way too much. Losing actual cash feels a lot worse than seeing a number in my bank account shrink, which made betting large amounts not seem as bad. One thing led to another and in March of this year I made the dumbest decision of my life. I bet $1600 on the Lakers beating the Suns and lost.

From then on, I proceeded to chase this bet through online blackjack and parlays(also incredibly dumb of me) and the remaining $1100 in my bank account eroded into my current balance of $178. To grow up in the lower middle class and do something like this is embarrassing and shameful. I haven’t gambled since the start of March and I shut down my Bovada account but I still am haunted by what I’ve done. I’d estimate $3000 I’ve lost is from a college refunded scholarship and the other $1000 is from money that was given to me by my mom over the course of two years (though how much of that $1000 was lost to gambling and not just living expenses, I’m not sure). 

There are so many other things I could’ve used the money for including: paying off loans (I’m a freshman in college), rent for an apartment, textbooks, gas, paying off my car, food, and countless others. Outside of gambling, I’ve always been responsible and frugal with money and my parents always remind of that. But I’ve let my parents down this time and they will never look at my the same if I tell them.

I may need to borrow money from my parents soon, which means I would have to tell them about this because they’ll start asking questions. I’ve been debating telling them and I’m curious if you guys honestly think I should. I’ve always declined money my mom offered me, but she always insists I take it. It pains me to know I’ve wasted her money. 

My plan from here on out is to get a job for the summer and work to get the $4000 back that I lost. I also plan to tell my parents, but I’m not sure whether I should sugarcoat it or tell them bluntly. 

I am seeking advice on a) whether I should tell them b) how I should tell them and c) what I should do to make it up to them and get my life back on track. It feels good to get this off my chest because it has stressed the hell out of me and I’ve been depressed lately. Any advice would be appreciated. Again, I apologize for the long post.

TLDR: I’m 19 and lost $4000 gambling ($3000 from a school refund and $1000 from my mom). I need advice on whether I should tell my parents or not and how to proceed from here.",01May2019,0

Not that I do it on purpose or want to, but I just don’t look before I leap if you get what I mean. People tell me countless of times, like I’m a child. I nod, I apologize and then it’s the next thing I do. I do/say some shit and boom, someone gets mad and I get blocked. 

It’s happened so many times, it becomes a meme at this point. Literally friends/past friends joke about it. I just kind of brush it off, because I deserve it and I can’t really do anything to stop it. Ive been memed other reasons too, but those are good reasons. 

I try my best, to calm down and not get too excited and say some shit that’ll piss or upset someone. However it always backfires and it comes off as if I’m insensitive. Then when someone blocks or ignores me, my heart/stomach (?) gets this weird hurting sensation and then I start getting these thoughts. I guess irrational thoughts? Like thinking of the bad and shit. Is that a panic/anxiety attack? Anyways usually it ends up being fine in the end and everyone goes back to being my friend. This is the luck, the luck I’ve always had. Or people are that nice enough to still continue to be friends with me. 

I don’t like losing friendships. Never did. I always like to apologize and hope I can get them back as a friend.  Anyways, let’s skip to the present. So I recently discovered Stan twitter a few... months ago? I loved it. Everyone seemed so nice and so open. I was on a certain side of Stan twitter too, so people who liked the same things I did, was nice. Recently, (like I said, I get really hyper and don’t know what I say/type in the moment) I’ve been saying things. People didn’t take it so well and got offended. My new friend on there tried to warn me that I should watch what I say, etc. I didn’t listen and kind of came off as a jerk. She felt offended and well i tried to apologize a day later. She forgave me and all was good. She’s not like the others on Stan Twitter. She’s nice and really smart too. 

Speaking of, Stan Twitter is very different. From what I know and from my time being there, everyone seems to just tweet about whatever they want. Not a bad thing necessarily, but some are stupid and just plain old rude. They’re also the type of people that if you get into a disagreement with, they’d probably unfriend/block you in a heartbeat. Even if you knew them for a very long time. At least that’s what my friend told me. I believed it. 

Now, skip to this week... this week hasn’t been kind at all. 

It all started this weekend. So I’ve been saying stuff on Twitter, this and that, and I was in a group chat. My friend (whom I mentioned earlier) had a disagreement and I said, “Let’s Just call it a day.” And we did just that. Then I go and tweet about it. My friend sees it, and I’m kind of a jerk to her. The tweets were mostly directed to her and our convo earlier. She warned me and whatnot, and I took it with a grain of salt. 

Of course now this following week, I’ve been on the edge. People have been kind of giving me a cold shoulder so to speak. Now I talk to my friend about that, and they’re all like “I tell you this for a reason. I care about you and if you don’t stop this blah blah blah, you can get into something nasty and ppl will hate you.” And honestly they make sense. So I decided from then on, to watch what I say. 

Let’s skip to now? I got removed from the group chat. I have no clue why, but I have a pretty good idea what it is. I think it’s because of well... me obviously. How I am, how hyper and non tactful I can be. How I say before I think and don’t look before I leap. My friend is offline so I can’t go and talk to them. 

I’m coming to ask, how can I better myself? That’s why I’m asking for advice. That’s why I’m here. How can I stop being such an asshole, without trying to be one on purpose? I genuinely don’t mean it. 

And also should I leave that side of twitter? And should I apologize? I like this side of twitter even if it can be stupid and toxic. I like the people that I follow, it’s cool. I like the friends that I have made too. Should I just go to my other accounts instead? I like to rp and the RP side of twitter seems really tame and the people are smart there too. Should I apologize as well? I’m nervous and having second thoughts, because well I don’t think they’d accept it. It’s not even worth it. 

So yeah, what should I do? 

By the way, I have friends online on other places. So it’s not like I’m completely alone as well.",01May2019,1

Whenever someone brings up something negative about me, or something I did  that was bad or wrong in the past, I have an emotional reaction. I get defensive, I’m told. I have to prove them wrong no matter what it was. 
I don’t know why, but I feel like I have to clear my name all the time. Even over little things and arguments, I cannot stand to let someone say something that isn’t true about me or make assumptions that aren’t true. It drives me insane, and I end up making an even bigger mess.

251,"First, thing's first, and that is context, so here goes. So I have a depressive friend, he has been a good friend but I feel things are taking a turn for the worse. He has been deteriorating over the last two years and his depression has just become worse and worse. He tried ti commit suicide twice in the last two years around the same month in both.

So here is the issue. It is utterly impossible to go out with him. Every time I want to hang out with him, he bails on my plans or he just outright lies to me and then bails. He sabotages our plans all the time and he makes sure that if he doesn't go out then no one does. This pissed me off last week and I made an underhanded comment at him because of it, he got angry and hasn't spoken to me since. I apologized today, he hasn't responded and even if he did I don't know what comes next honestly. What I know is that nothing will change.

The only way to talk to him is through whatsapp, or by going on steam and playing video games. I am sick of that, I am sick of having to play at insane hours just to speak to him, I am sick of having to sacrifice my time to play with him but not getting the same level of effort from him whenever I want to make plans. Even after having apologized, I'm still angry at him. He throws his tantrums, whines all day long about everything and everyone, screws people over constantly and is often a hypocritical liar but when it comes to him behaving like a person he can't even do that. Now that's he is ""mad"" he is behaving like an immature asshole with the silent treatment bullshit and baiting me by inviting everyone out except me. 

I had to stop him from killing himself the last time around, and him involving me in that makes me angry. I hate that he put me in that bind, I hate it with every fiber of my being that he made me go through that. Honestly, next time he wants to kill himself, I feel like telling him to ask someone else to help him and I feel such rage toward him that I want to tell him that in person. 

I don't know whether this friendship is worth anything anymore. I have such pent up anger towards this person. He was a good friend once, but now I just don't know anymore and I feel like this has reached its end and it is time for something new.",01May2019,1

260,"I’m 23 years old and my mother has been all over my weight since I was about 9.  I’m 5’2 and about 185 lbs.  I can shop at regular stores most of the time- I’m about a size 12-14.  I know it isn’t healthy, and I’ve been working on it, I promise.  I’ve been working out and reducing my calorie and sugar intake and it’s working, which is part of the problem.  

My mother’s approval of me is in proportion to my weight.  She’s proud of me for doing lots of things (academically, musically, socially), and she’s a great mother, but this one thing gets in the middle of our relationship in a big way.  

If I work out and I tell her, she praises me.  If I eat something she sees as unhealthy, she glares at me and makes really vicious faces.  Then when I confront her about it, she denies everything.  

Some other things she’s done:
-said that it’ll be so much easier for me to get a boyfriend if I lose weight 
-said that horizontal stripes don’t look good on girls “like us”
-encouraged me to, and paid for me to, join Jenny Craig 
-hidden food from me so that my little brother (athletic and thin) can have it
-praised my friends and brother in front of me for losing weight 
-glared at me in front of my friends and family for eating food that she deemed unhealthy 
-taken me to Overeaters Anonymous meetings at age 14

She denies all of it, which really hurts.  I understand that she wants the best for my well-being but this is genuinely abusive in my eyes.  I’ve developed an eating disorder because I just want to have her approval, even though I know that it doesn’t work that way.  

So, what do I do?  I’ve tried so many times to ask her to stop, and to just learn to accept my body.  That’s what I really want at the end of the day, for my mother to approve of my body and think I’m beautiful (which she says I am, but she means my face).  How do I tell her that she’s really hurting me if I’ve tried so hard in the past with no results?

261,"It started not a while maybe a day before or so...when I was about to go home I saw my cat at the front door of our house, she looks different and odd, then I went closer to check her.. She looks absolutely thin and her tummy was like push down to her back legs and saw a big wound on it. Then I called my mom and my sister about it,  Then we seek help from our neighbors to help us so they did. We don't even know what happened to her like if she was hit by a bike or bitten by a dog nor my neighbors don't even know what was the cause that made her wound, she can even barely walk with her back legs. After we treat her wound we let her take a rest in our living room. The next day I went to my summer job then went back home, my sister told me to treat her wounds again and do some first aid bandaging... So we did when my parents told me to leave the cat at the front yard because if she might die in our living room maybe it would stink.


 But I disagree with them cause why would we leave the cat outside.. I mean maybe something would happen to her or maybe she would wander off the streets again and encounter some dogs or something?? Their mindset was just to leave the cat to die outside and make our house clean or smell good... Later that night I change my mind and I agreed to them because I didn't like to argue. Then the next day  I went again to my summer job then went home again just like the usual..when suddenly I didn't notice her anymore.. Not even in the living room or in my house even in our front yard. Then my mom told me it was my fault because why didn't I feed her and she wouldn't have been wandering the streets and not get hurt by something we don't even know. Then we argue because it is their fault why did they let her out at the first place she would have been not lost if she were to stay inside the living room.. Then she called me irresponsible. Then she walks out went upstairs. I'm so pissed and don't what to do in this situation...

266,"So, tldr: what should my friend do to navigate getting out of being around their family, when they use guilt tactics to control their actions? They are currently trapped at their family home. 

I live with my best friend since elementary school, and I am very familiar with their family. They suffer from multiple mental health issues, and some of these I’m sure have arisen from their treatment at home. They are consistently bullied out of anything they want, and their needs are swept aside, and have been since childhood. They are made to feel like their family be irrevocably hurt/won’t love them anymore if they don’t comply with the family’s wishes, and it’s extended to them being unable to tell anyone no and experiencing extreme anxiety when prompted with something they don’t want to do, as simple as random invites to go to a coffee shop. 

We moved 2 hours away for college, but they were guilted into coming back every holiday break, including the entirety of college summers, when they could have been making friends or traveling or enjoying their youth in general. This all, despite my friend’s room being given to another sibling — leaving their own sleep situation tenuous. The house is also anxiety-levels of filthy, the toilets and showers constantly out of order, and they aren’t given access to the laundry for various reasons, and I would often wash things at my parents’. They lived out of a duffel bag for months at a time, which would need constant supervision, because there are always unfamiliar people that have walked away with things before. 

While there, they are bullied by their family about their appearance, relationships, hobbies or mental health. They are yelled at for simply staying in whatever room they’re in and being on a computer, but given no direction as to what they should be doing. This is especially troublesome because their mother barely spends time with them when they are there, basically making their presence in the house pointless. When someone else does want to do something, their comfort and desires are constantly denied, so far as their health needs are ignored in favor of going out or leaving them in a hot car while they spend an unplanned hour makeup shopping. Anytime my friend expresses discomfort, sadness over these bullying tactics, or desire to do anything but what their family wants, they are treated as overdramatic. 

A fun example is when their mother and sisters wanted to all get a matching, large, tacky tattoo. Not only does my friend have body image issues that make it VERY hard for them to be comfortable with anything less than desirable on them PERMANENTLY, but it’s… a tattoo… that they had no say in the design of and did not want. The bullying about this tattoo has gone on for years and has gotten worse, especially since they got a tattoo they actually did want. The bullying is so bad that they consistently have thoughts of “I could just not look at it,” because they are treated as though not getting the tattoo means they don’t love their family. It’s constant emotional manipulation. 

Right now, they are staying in that town to get some dental work done before they age out of their parents insurance (yes, this person is nearly 26 years old!!). This was supposed to be a 1-day trip, but their mother is saying she won’t bring them back until Saturday, because we “visit everyone else” (we visited friends we hadn’t seen in years in a town farther away; meanwhile they are still back home for every holiday and birthday for several days). They don’t drive, they only brought one pair of clothes and only some of their medicines for their skin condition, and on top of all of this, they are being told they can’t stay at their grandmother’s where they actually have a confirmed place to sleep. 

I want to come and pick them up tomorrow night, but they are torn between the desire to leave and the desire to avoid the inevitable flood of guilt and abuse that will occur if they just up and leave without “permission.” What do you think? 

They have also been told (not asked) to come to their sister’s baby shower, which will inevitably turn into another “hostage” event, where they will be forced to stay extra days or be guilted for not “caring about their sister,” etc. Any advice for trying to avoid this trip?",01May2019,2

A little backstory
I(21f) has been in a on and off relation ship with my boyfriend(21m). 
We started dating when we were in highschool. And when i thought things were going great, I got to know from my other friends that he was cheating on me. I was devastated because who he was cheating on me was one of my closest friend. I confronted him but he denied and said that him and the girl were just good friends. But i knew there was more than ‘just friends’. After trying to talk him out of it, i realized that my efforts gave no results as he was still ‘friends’ with that girl.  I broke up with him. Almost 2 months before our 2 year anniversary. 
The breakup was too much and i was not able to handle it well. I started failing in exams and as it was my last year the burden felt too much. 
I somehow gave my exams and got decent enough grades to get admission in a university. After my breakup i devoted all of my time being alone, my friends tried to help me but i left them too. 
In the mean time i got a text from the guy i broke up with and he asked if we could be friends. I agreed even though my friends were totally against this idea.  
My ex and i started talking like friends. He told me that the friend he cheated me on with also went ahead and cheated on him and how sad he was. I said he deserved it . He went ahead to get back with one of his exes and even they broke up after two months of dating. He would ask me sometimes serious sometimes jokingly if i would ever get back with him to which i also said no. Then after sometime i got to know that my ex was now dating my other best friend. This broke me. My bff and i have been friends for 10+ years and still she went ahead and dated this guy who had treated me so badly. 
While my bff and ex were dating, she would tell him to stop talking to me, she would say she is insecure but my ex refused to stop talking to me  and told her that he still had feelings for me. He said that he just wanted a distraction from thinking about me. They broke up and my ex came to me and confronted everything that he had done and how sorry he was. I forgave him. 
This is how we got back together. He made amends and did everything possible to earn my trust. 
He has been an amazing boyfriend. And now we have been dating for 2 years and not once did he do anything that would hurt me. He has made it all clear that i am the one he wants for the rest of his life. He told me that that one year when we were friends he was a mess and made all the wrong decisions. He started drinking heavily and smoking he agreed that he whatever he did was wrong. 
He has been so food to me these two years. 
But i find myself having trust issues with his loyalty time to time because of the rocky past we shared. 
He knows about these issues and has been making efforts to earn my trust back. But it is just not happening. 
How can i trust him again?

I feel lost at the moment.

For starters, I really dislike my school. 
Just the other day, I got into a LOT of trouble for going to the guidance office - which the administration called me in (via the autocom) to do. It was such an embarrassing experience because my parents and teachers were notified that I was ‘skipping class’. I even got a referral to the disciplinarian about it. I didn’t bother explaining what happened to my teachers out of humiliation. 

This all happened because I wasn’t given a pass. I got no apology whatsoever and the administration told me to ‘communicate better’ next time. Not going to lie, that ticked me off so I tried to mention that having a pass would’ve cleared this all up. 

There are more instances like this that I’m willing to go into - but for the sake of getting to the point - I’ll keep it to myself. 

It’s embarrassing to say it - but I truly do not feel stable being here anymore. I just pulled up to school this morning and had a panic attack. The feeling of shame and betrayal won’t go away. It has been nearly two weeks. 

I’m just so fed up with all of their excuses and incompetence that I do not know if I could truly bring myself to attend here another here at this public school. I cannot go to a private school either. 

I often work 7 or 8 hour days alone at my house on the weekends. Do you think it is possible to argue that I could do all of the schoolwork at home digitally? I would say 95% of our work is done online - with the exception of a few written tests.",01May2019,1

It bothered me so much because that was the last thing I wanted to be (and the last thing I thought I would be), but when I asked colleagues I trust and worked closely with — I wanted to understand why and to see how I can change that even if it was just how I talked — they couldn’t see where this person was coming from.

Later on, a good friend of mine pointed out that it was crucial for me to consider that this person left the company we were all working for not too long ago very disgruntled, and whatever he/she says related to that should be taken with a grain of salt regardless of my relationship with said person.

Maybe said person is seeing something in me that others are not seeing. Maybe said person is really just being spiteful. I know it is something only I can decide.

279,"Hello,

Sorry this is a long one.

&amp;#x200B;

As the title states, I'm a 26 year old guy living back at home. I was out on my own for a couple years doing pretty well on paper but I had a battle with mental illness (diagnosed OCD), lost my job, racked up about $15k in debt across 6 months, tried to kill myself, and now I'm back at square one living at home and paying off my debts at an uncomfortably slow pace.

&amp;#x200B;

The only person who would help me and give me a place to stay was my mom, who has been diagnosed with BPD and can be extremely abusive when she is upset, which is more days than not. Because of her disorder she blacks out and forgets most of the terrible things she says and does. I don't know how much she actually forgets and how much is her avoiding her issues, but that's not something I can ever really know so I just have to protect myself in the situation. She also lies to her psychiatrist about her well-being to get ADHD stimulants instead of the mood-stabilizers she desperately needs.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to be as nice to her as I can and help around the house without opening myself up to abuse. It's like walking on eggshells, though. She fails to acknowledge and respect any boundaries I set, and will even break them to prove a point, and I find myself treating her like crap some days just to get her to leave me alone. It's really painful because no one else in my life is this challenging. I love her a lot and am grateful for the sacrifices she's made for me, but she really doesn't understand how hard it is to be her son.

&amp;#x200B;

She is two people to me, an overly loving person that I can't fully trust because she's unstable, and an extremely aggressive bully who wants everything their way. It's pretty rare that she's neither of the two. She is also both in the same day, often. It's not easy living with her and trying to go through my own treatment but I'm making progress.

&amp;#x200B;

I got on the right medications, reconnected with old friends who are supportive, am going through therapy, found a PT job, and I'm doing everything else I can to turn my life around. My psychologist says I'm surprisingly well-adjusted and he agrees I'm on the right track. Not trying to toot my own horn, it's just some people might think I'm a basket case having read all of this. My spirits are reasonably high in spite of all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I happen to live in one of the more expensive parts of the country, the SF Bay Area. It's a very make/break society here and because I don't have a college degree, most of the jobs I'm eligible for don't pay enough for me to live somewhere I feel safe. You might say 'well, yeah' but, I grew up here in the suburbs and houses are worth upwards of 20x what they were when my middle-class parents came here. Wages, on the other hand, have only increased about 3-4x. I've seen rooms for rent in my town go up almost 30% in the past 4 years alone. I don't mean to complain. It's a much nicer area now than it was before, it just sucks because I can't afford anything within 15 miles of here that isn't in a druggy and/or gang area. I'm also a white guy with blonde hair, which shouldn't matter, but in some areas it really does and I'll leave it at that.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

Being back at home has really put all of this into perspective for me because I'm at a major crossroads and these are my options as I see them:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I could keep living here, even though it's hell and I'm frequently told I could be kicked out any time I stand up for myself. It's the best option financially for now.

&amp;#x200B;

The pros are I could work, save, pay off my debts (Which are $500\~ per moth), and even go to school online and work toward a degree.

&amp;#x200B;

The cons are I'm constantly belittled and berated and emotionally attacked. I'm grounded enough to keep my chin high but in a day-to-day sense it really wears on my emotions and confidence. I can't study here, which is why I never finished my degree. She also frequently reminds me about traumatic experiences as a way to agitate me. A major part of why I attempted suicide was fear of living here again and going through all of this. My psychologist has urged me to move out of here as soon as I can financially.

&amp;#x200B;

2. I have a friend who will let me stay in his living room for $700/month indefinitely.

&amp;#x200B;

The pros are I would be closer to work, closer to other better opportunities also.

&amp;#x200B;

The cons are this friend casually does a lot of what I consider soft drugs; hash, pills, etc. and I really feel like I'm past that point in my life and don't want to go backwards. Aside from that I only make about $1000/mo after taxes at my current job, which is 1/4 of what I made at my last job, and I don't know when I will get another good opportunity to make more. Because of my already $500/month debt this would put me in the hole an additional $200+ per month that would continue to grow until I get a better paying job. I also would have to give up 90% of my stuff (which I may do anyway), or get a storage which is another $100/month. All in all this wouldn't be a good option it seems like.

&amp;#x200B;

   3. I have another friend whose family has land in the Sierras and said I could live there for as long as I need to. 

&amp;#x200B;

The pros about that are it's extremely peaceful there and I love camping and outdoors stuff. It would also be 100% free other than fuel and stuff from the store. I can grow my own food if I catch rain. There's a market nearby for anything I need. I'm not sure how I would ever get out, though.

&amp;#x200B;

The cons with that is it's about as off-grid as can be and there's no power, water, or anything really. Just trees and dirt. It's a little isolated. There is also hardly any work up there and I would easily be commuting an hour or two each way, if I could even get work up there. It also snows and freezes so I could really only live there part of the year unless I built a cabin or something.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  4. I could ask my dad if any of his family would put me up for a while. Staying with him is not an option, but we have a pretty good relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

The pros there are I would be with the side of my family that isn't completely batshit insane. They are spread across the US and Canada and odds are one of them would give me a place to stay. Most of their towns have really low rent costs but wages and job opportunities are nothing like what they are here.

&amp;#x200B;

The cons are they're extremely conservative church-goers and mostly live in rural country towns which would be culturally shocking. It would be cheap but many of those places are hard to get a job as an outsider (speaking from experience) and I really don't want to move in with someone I barely know and get stranded and become a burden to them.

&amp;#x200B;

5. I could try to find a job that would relocate me to a cheaper area.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros are they would help me find affordable housing etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons are I don't know of a lot of these opportunities for people without degrees aside from the military. I wouldn't do well in the military. If someone yells at me I yell back..and I have a cousin who was dishonorably discharged for that exact thing so the military doesn't seem like a good option.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

I can't think of many other options that would go well but I'm open to suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

Just for a little bit about my background- I've worked countless jobs since I was 11 (volunteered til legally able to work). Always was looking for an excuse to get out of the house, as you can imagine. My resume is a mix of customer service, sales, and electro-mechanical stuff, with some manager skills mixed in there. I took an easy retail job to get some income but I have a lot of technical skills in terms of repairing and maintaining electrical machines, some IT stuff, and I'm learning to build websites on the side.

&amp;#x200B;

What I can't do is heavy lifting over 60 pounds, because of an accident that blew out both my knees and lower back. So with my skills, resume, and physical limitations, I'm having trouble making a career anywhere. Most of the jobs I'm eligible for either require a bachelor's degree because they're technical/scientific or there's heavy lifting involved and they say it's 50lbs on the listing but then say 75/85/150 pounds during the interview and I have to turn them down for my own longevity.

Last year I was working in Telecom making great money but it was so hard on my body and I was working so much that I wasn't eating enough, which majorly contributed to my mental breakdown. Also some of the equipment was so heavy it was making my joints worse over time and I don't think I could take another job like that.

&amp;#x200B;

That's really everything I can think to share that's relevant. I'm sorry if it seems rambly at times, this is a majorly condensed version of everything that's going on.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

I could really use some insight on relocating, finding a good job, or anything else you think might help my situation. Don't get too caught up on the family drama or mental illness stuff cause I have a pro working on that, and I'm fairly at peace with the things I can't control. Let's focus on what I can actually do to move forward.

Two days ago I got into a fight with my landlords daughters, cursed them with all the foul language you can call a woman who's just a plain old gossiping skank. Now... Her shit brother...

The problem is that it's my FINAL YEAR of college and I need to focus. I'm also working on an online business that's been making progress, something I can actually see myself winning and I don't want to fuck up my chances at getting a better life for me and my mom because of a few pieces of shit.

281,"I'm having a bit of an existential crisis. 31 - Male - no kids, but in an LTR (5 years). I have a severe personality and mood disorder that I think is going to ruin my life. Honestly I don't understand why I can't change. It's pathetic. 

I've tried everything. Therapy, SSRIs, weed, exercise, diet changes, religion, apathy, psilocybin. I can't seem to take control and change the way I think and act. I genuinely feel like two minds in one body - the one who craves control (calm, logical, kind, positive) and the one in control (irritable, cruel, impatient, pessimistic). I'm vicious when I feel I've been wronged and I've been told all my life that I'm ""too sensitive"". At this point I guess it's true. I've just always felt it was really the rest of the world being insensitive. But if I'm the common denominator here I have to be open to the fact that there's something deeply wrong with me.

I cannot and will not commit myself. I've been involuntarily committed once because of self harm, and my experience there has left me fearful of ever ending up back there. It's a prison that does far more harm than good. I was severely mistreated and watched people far more helpless than I be abused. Yes, I did take this to a lawyer and that is all I can say for now. Committing myself is not an option. 

I genuinely want to get better. I tell myself every day to focus on self improvement and i do and I try so hard and still fail in crucial moments.

298,"To give some background info, my 2 best friends and I have been friends throughout our 4 years of college. We're very close, like 3 peas in a pod. However, in the last year I've been feeling less and less fulfilled by the friendship. I've noticed that I'm more mature than them and it bothers me.

Throughout most of my time in college I've been independent. I lived alone, worked, paid my own rent, took good care of my household, bought a car, and made a decent life for myself. I'm also in a serious relationship and plan on getting married and having children in the near future. 

However, I can't help but think that my friends have been stagnating. Not much has changed in their lives since we started college. One lives at home while the other's parents pay her rent. She refuses to work, her only reason being ""she doesn't want to"". Neither of them clean or know how to cook, which normally wouldn't effect my life...but when its my 10th time going over to their houses and there's no food and the place is dirty, it gets a bit irritating (imagine 1 towel for everyone to share, no soap, no toilet paper, no toothpaste, dirty sheets). On the other hand, whenever they've come over to my place I've always cooked them dinner. I've even cooked dinner at their houses because I can only go for so long on fast food and frozen pizza. 

Their irresponsibility also manifests itself financially. Since their parents pay for their expenses they have no idea how expensive life is. They have no problem buying drinks at the bar, paying admissions, and paying for activities. I often bring up the fact that I can't afford to spend much on entertainment, but then they call me a cheapskate. They don't do it maliciously, but they just don't have any concept of how frugal I have to be to make ends meet. They have this mindset that life is all really easy and they will never struggle.

Aside from that, they call me crazy for being in such a serious relationship at such a young age and planning on having children within the next few years. I feel like the concept of starting a family is so far off for them, they can't relate whatsoever. While one is in an immature relationship, the other has never had a relationship at all. 

Now the point of this post hasn't been to sit here and moan about how terrible my friends are. I do appreciate them and they are very important to me. They are the only friends I have. But its gotten to the point where hangouts with them don't feel fulfilling like they used to. I'm running out of patience for their lifestyle and their occasional drama and jealousy. I've started avoiding meeting up with them because I'm just not feeling it. Although I don't want to stray too far, because I know I'm the type of person who can distance myself to the point where I unintentionally end a friendship, and I definitely don't intend on doing that here. Basically, if you were in my shoes, how would you proceed?

TLDR: I've grown a lot throughout college while my friends are stagnating, and its leading to me feeling unfulfilled in the friendship",01May2019,1
299,"Hello, I'm Catholic and my dad is Christian.  He is a firm believer in almost every story of the bible, but I feel like he has completely glossed over the teachings of it.

He claims that all of France's problems are due to them allowing Muslims and that Canada is on the same path (we're American), he thinks that every good Arab that he or I have met were Arab Christians, he believes that every Muslim believes in the ideology of ""kill or convert"", and he often talks about Mohammed getting angry and starting his own religion because the Jews didn't make him a prophet.

I've tried telling him about Muslims I grew up with and even Muslims that I've served with in the US military.  I've told him that Jesus is positively mentioned in the Quran.  I've told him that Muslims are often persecuted by other Muslims who follow a much stricter interpretation of the religion.

She talks poorly about other people claiming they’re not worthy of their success or fame. That she could do better in a heartbeat.

Is there a way to transfer i20 without having this closed campus transfer it?

Based on google this is one of the steps to take to transfer and we are currently stuck in this step:

“Tell your current designated school official (DSO) your plans to transfer, and provide the name of the transfer-in school and proof of acceptance by them. The DSO at you current school must change your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record to “transfer-out” status.”

Since they are closed her i20 is stuck with them and she can’t transfer unless she gets a new i20 from her home country but even after that she won’t be able to continue where she left off. She will be forced to start from the very beginning.

At the first sign of a moment of peace, I try to sit in the living room or lay on my bed and I can literally count down the seconds until they tell me to go do something. And since we recently moved in, most of what I’m asked to do involves moving and building heavy IKEA furniture by myself, as well as taking huge loads of cardboard and trash in the elevator to the dumpsters in the garage, and bringing all of the new packages and deliveries upstairs - the cycle begins anew. Or my wife will make me do small things like she’ll hand me something and say, “Hold this” when she could just as easily have put it on the counter she was standing next to. It all adds up and overwhelms me. 

To tell the truth, when my wife went to the hospital, before she was checked into inpatient psychiatric care, she only went because I needed to go and get checked in and she didn’t want me to go alone. I was at my wit’s end and my meds weren’t working anymore. But they didn’t admit me. They admitted her instead. I was overwhelmed a month ago. Now I’m over-overwhelmed. 

If I’m not stable enough to work 40 or even 20 hours a week, how the hell am I supposed to be “on” 24/7 at home? I feel like a lackey. Completely unvalued. Unappreciated. And they make me feel guilty for asking for time to myself. 

I don’t know what to do anymore.",01May2019,1

310,"My Wife of 34 years recently passed away (less than 3 months ago...). She had been seriously ill for more than 20 of those... for the last 6 years, I was little more than her caregiver, as she was bed-bound.

I never 'strayed', because I honored my vows. The result, is that I've been completely celibate for more than 9 years. No physical contact AT ALL. Yes, it was an issue we discussed repeatedly, and she simply refused to touch me. Yes, she knew, from our first date, that sex was very important to me. No, it wasn't her condition that prevented her from having sex. Yes, those facts hurt me deeply, and made me feel unlovable. 

I am somewhat socially awkward, and have difficulty  understanding, often times, what is 'acceptable' behavior. I've adapted by simply being courteous, and NEVER making advances on women, for fear of being thought of as a creep...

311,"I suffer from anxiety a lot. It came from the fact that I suffered a chronic illness for 18 months, I missed school, and wasn’t seeing my friends or socialising at all. This caused me to develop major anxiety issues. 

I’m much better now though, and I started collage back in September (at the school I was at before, they were happy to let me back in as they understood my situation)

In lessons I would suffer major anxiety, although I pushed through them all and it was okay as I could come home, rest and recover. It got better over time to a point where I was barely facing any anxiety during lesson time. 

Over the last 2 months, my anxiety came back quite bad. I was ill with a normal viral infection and missed a week of lessons, except for one. 
Coming back was difficult, and in one of my lessons, Economics, I suffered anxiety the most. I was missing a lot of the lessons as I just couldn’t be in them, I have to revise after school everyday now for my exams, but if I would go to the lesson it the anxiety would tire me out and I’d come home unable to revise as I’d be way too tired to. 
I don’t feel like I can win at the moment, if I go to the lesson, I won’t revise, if I don’t go to the lesson, I will revise but the school will be on my back. Sometimes I have to miss other lessons due to the lesson tiring me out so much. 
The school have said if I miss one more they won’t allow me to take the exam, the lessons are not important at the moment as it’s just revision. 

I only have this week and next week left of collage, then I leave for study leave. My exams begin straight after I leave though. 

I’m going to begin seeing a psychologist next week, which I’m hoping will give me some support for when I (if I ) go back for my second year next year. I’m just not sure as to what to do for now. 

Thankyou.

316,"I don’t really know where to start, so apologies if this seems a little scattered. 

I have recently returned to work after having ten months off for maternity leave. I no longer enjoy my job, my partner and I are both looking for jobs in a new location, we then plan to get a house. My partner has recently been made redundant so is a stay at home dad until he secures a job, which with regards to childcare is ideal as I don’t have any worries or concerns about my son while I’m at work, this is a very temporary arrangement as my partner won’t struggle to find a job. I don’t want to enrol my son at the nursery of my workplace as it’s terrible. We are currently living at my moms house during the week while I’m working and then travelling back to his parents house for the weekends (3 hour drive e/w) There is a history of disagreement between my partner and my mom, so while I’m at work my partner feels awkward and confines himself and our son to the bedroom. My mom lives in the middle of nowhere and there is literally nothing to do, it’s very country.  My partners family live in a major city, my partner wants to go back to his family’s home and take our son with him. My mom can’t be fully trusted to watch my son and I don’t want to enrol him in nursery so I feel like I have no other choice than to let him go. 

We had an argument over this last night, I feel completely defenceless and distraught. The thought of not seeing my little boy everyday makes me feel sick to my stomach, and like I’m about to burst out into tears, it physically makes my heart hurt knowing I’m not going to see him for a week at a time. I get wrapped up in trying to figure out what he will be thinking/feeling when I’m not around, will he be sad because I’m not there? Will he think I’ve abandoned him? I really don’t know how I’m going to cope alone or what I will fill my evenings doing. I have been waiting to get a house with my partner for over a year now but this has been delayed due to no fault of mine and other personal circumstances relating to finances. 

My emotions have been a rollercoaster for the past year and a half, I’m at the point where I feel like giving up, I don’t feel like I’m a good partner or mother, I feel like I’m not good enough for either of them. I feel down on myself academically, like I’m too stupid to achieve any further qualifications and I’ll just end up lonely and miserable. (I have been subject to a history of verbal and mental abuse) I feel like I’m stuck in a dark tunnel, I’ve been putting all my energy and positivity into the fantasy that we’ll both get jobs in the same city and we’ll get a house, enrol my son at an outstanding nursery and be happy, but I’ve been clutching at that dream for so long now and there always seems to be something getting in the way, and now this, I’m going to have to go a week at a time without seeing my little 10 month old baby, my heart is breaking and I’m struggling emotionally, I don’t know what to do, who I should talk to, if I have an issue which needs treating or not.

322,"Okay, so I've been having health problems for quite some time. At first, I thought it was the water, so I had our filtered water tested and it came back positive for a plethora of microbacteria. I thought moving would help solve the case because maybe I was just allergic to spores and such after ingesting so much (I tend to drink a lot of water). 

I ended up moving into a 2 bedroom with my little brother, who I haven't had the best relationship with. My door is typically unlocked and such. So, I've suffered 2nd degree burns from applying face cleanser. Bumps and Grooves on my head from my shampoo. Tremors, Rashes, and Difficulty Breathing from just sitting in my bedroom. 

I figured perhaps he's the one poisoning me. And trust me, I know it sounds absurd to say. I tried to set up cameras but that didnt fly because he had access to the wifi password. I then decided to move away from my brother and have since moved in with my friend's house, which drastically improved my health. 

All the while, I kept getting mail for unpaid bills or nonpayment when I could have sworn I called in to pay the bill. When I moved, I received at least 30 letters that were being held for approximately 3 months. Coincidentally occuring around the same time I had started having heath issues. I also had problems with my cellular service. Someone had cloned my Apple Pay and charged ~4500 to my accounts. To this day, I'm still dealing with fraudulent lines being opened and equipment installment plans I didn't sign up for. All the while, I haven't had the health to work and my girlfriend and I broke up, my family thinks I should see a therapist, and my friends are the only ones that truly believe me. And so for the longest time, I even tried to convince myself that I was a pathetic, powerless, devastated human that couldn't keep himself or his shit together. 

Before I started experiencing any of these issues, I typically have a strong internal loci, meaning I try my best to make myself accountable before I pass judgement on anybody else. I did the 23 and me, negative for genetic factors, non-carrier for any pertinent disease, and my doctors couldn't find anything with their tests. Which helped me deduce the idea that perhaps whatever this thing was had a short half life and flushed out of my system relatively quick.

These past couple of months, I more or less stumbled to and froc trying to understand what this was. That's when I had an epiphany, there's no way somebody is this unlucky, this has to be directed. So, what could someone want from a 27 year old medical student with student loans up to his neck who has no genetic predipositions and has been otherwise and majorally healthy for the entirety of his life? 

I have reason to believe the possibility that my mother took life insurance out on me. I tried to order and MIB (which is like a credit check for your medical records), which came back negative. I figured it was probably because the agency that did the life insurance wasn't partnered with the MIB. So, I called my mother's go to insurance brokerage, gave my name and asked if I owed anything on my life insurance, they said they couldn't find my policy. I then asked them to check my mother's name. He began checking , as a woman in the back tells the guy I was speaking with to put the phone on hold. He then returns and says I have to present with either a bill or a policy number if I wanted any info. I figured that was fair and let the horse die.

Now, I'm very particular about my mess, so I notice random changes that occur in my car (an area where I frequently have difficulty breathing, left eye drooping, and numbness to my toes). And I've taken some photos of the underside of my steering wheel in my 2012 Honda Civic LX that I need some help deciphering. For only my family has had access to my vehicle during the duration of my dyingness. So, if you know anything about cars or have any potential insight, please DM or comment back. My life literally depends on it!

323,"I made this for my friend. Like the title says, my friends dad jumped off a bridge and took his own life leaving behind his wife and 3 sons. My friend is the youngest son. 

The mom, who is a very sweet lady, has moved to another state and gotten away from everything. 

The oldest brother is a monster and addicted to drugs. He recently stole 30 grand from his mom and bought a ton of wal mart gift certificates to give to drug dealers for money. He is currently in a halfway house. 

The middle kid is living in Cali living the life of a struggling actor. 

My friend, the youngest son, is now paying for the house and all the bills. His dad had a lot of debt. I suggested that he just sell the house and move on.

325,"TL;DR: At least 3 times a year my bf (25) shuts himself away when things get too much for him and he turns very negative. Negative to the point where he can look fed up, snap when he usually wouldn't, no energy, angry at small things and can't think about anything except what has made him so frustrated/angry which leads to him thinking of our things that make him angry. Advice on how to help and/or if therapy is an option.

&amp;#x200B;

It usually starts with one negative thing which has a knock on effect where everything else in his world turns negative. Two times it has happened is when he starts to hate his job. Sometimes its when his football team are in a bad position after a bad run of matches (happened once) but that did happen around finding a new job which is stressful. Others, it's when he blames himself for a silly, and easily done, mistake. Last year he broke his phone (which wasn't backed-up) and then tried to back-up but it swiped everything. That took about 2/3 weeks to get over and he still brings it up to this day. I can guarantee that he will be thinking about it when feeling down this time round. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's as if he doesn't know how to deal with his emotions in situations that are out-with his control on a larger scale. Last year when this happened I mentioned trying to deal with it more reasonable and realise he has other options and life goes on, but didn't go into too much depth cause I know it can come across as patronising. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm more than happy to give him space he needs and try check-in when I can but it's a bare minimum reply or ignored for a day. He still lives at home so I know he is safe and just needs time to clear his head. I've mentioned to him how I refuse to move out with him until he has this part of himself under control - mostly because it's so draining to be around the times that I've tried to bring him back to normality. Also, looking into the future I would hate to have kids around that kind negativity behaviour and thinking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just need outsider advice on how to go forward in helping him and if I'm wrong to suggest therapy? I've mentioned therapy to him before when he's back to his usual self but he doesn't think he needs it.

326,"So the first day of school, i went to the same workshop as him. I didn't know alot of people, but got talking to a few of the people there. At one point, i went into the break room, where the ""tough guy"" and another guy is talking. The moment i went in the break room, they just turn quiet. The tough guy starts staring at me very intensely, whilst i make my way toward the sink, to get a class of water. I look him back in the eye the whole walk over there (4-5 seconds), I then let go of the starring contest, grabbed a class, drank the water, put it next to the sink, and went on with my day. But then later at lunch he would keep starring at me. For the next 4 months... Skip to christmas, where our school had this thing where they'd pick a random name, and whoever got picked, could go up and collect a present. I had skipped workshops long before then, and i made some good friends, where i skipped to, and also where i'm at now. My friends have noticed this guy who kept trying to stare me down everyday during lunch, where i just stare back at him, other times, i just ignore him. When he went to collect his present, he was walking with his arms out (to try and make space for his big biceps. Btw he's a pretty small guy) and starring at me, like he wanted to kill me. I then commented on the way he walked to my friend, saying ""That moment when you're a wannabe gangster, but still wants a christmas present"" My friends laughed, and he overheard me, Skip to when we get outside and he confronts me about it (He's been trying to stare me down for 4 months at this point, but never spoke a word to me before), saying ""is it me, you're calling a wannabe gangster?"" Now, he was surrounded by friends, and i was alone as my friends had already left. I said ""yes"" and he said ""why?"" (whilst acting all tough and moving his arms further out to make space for his ""invisible big biceps"") And i said ""because of the way you stare at me all the time"" He then said ""You got a problem or something?"" I then just laughed, shaked my head and walked away. Then i felt a blast of water on my leg and my shoe, one of his friends had apparently thrown some water on me from his water bottle. I just kept walking away as i was alone and he was like 5 vs 1.

He then didn't talk to me afterwards, but kept starring me down as usual during lunch, to which i would just stare back at him, or ignore him. 

Skip forward till this saturday. I got drunk with a friend of mine, and during our drunkness, we decided to text him. I found him on facebook, and sent a message on messenger saying ""I should say hi from Marcus"". It was the middle of the night, when i woke up the next morning, i had forgotten about it, until i saw my phone, he apparently said ""who's this?"" followed by ""Don't message me you dog"" I then responded back and we had a conversation, where he would just insult me and i would keep on correcting his misspellings, and mock him. He would say ""your dead, you pig"" Where i would say him ""what about my dead?"" etc...

He then threatened to beat me up on monday and said ""see you on monday"" where i said ""yes :)"" We met at breakfast that day since he works in the kitchen. He then started staring at me and this time, i just stared back at him, the same way he looked at me, i would look at him. He finally after a few seconds ""What are you looking at?"" And i would mock him by saying ""You're not very clever are ya? Can't you tell that i'm clearly looking at you?"" he then said something rude and i said ""What's your problem?"" He said ""You're my problem"" I said ""Well, what are you gonna do about it then?"" Where he said ""I wanna kill you"" During this, he kept walking back and forth whilst starring at me intensely. I didn't break eye contant. I said ""Then kill me tough guy"" And he shouted that im a dog and a few other curse words, and then he left. Soon after i left to go to class. His teacher then came and talked to me (she's very biased btw) and told me to leav him alone. After i tried to explain to her about how he's been starring at me for the past 9 months ish, and threatening me and stuff, she just shaked it off saying ""that's just how he looks at people"". Me and his teacher then agreed, that if i left him alone, he'd leave me alone. Sounds good. Nope. He still ""tries"" to stare me down during lunch, to which i just brutally stare back at him, looking disgusted at him. This is apparently a fun little game we're playing???

My family owns a scuba diving shop, so I basically grew up learning about ocean related things. The problem is that I can’t tell if I’m actually interested in my major or if I’m just studying it because that’s all I really know. I don’t want to go into research and I’ve found that I’d rather not scuba dive professionally. 

I’ve never really thought to explore any other subjects before college, so I’m left with not knowing what would make me happy as a career. I’ve been wanting to check out some of the other majors at school, but I need to declare my major by the end of this quarter so I feel backed into a corner. Now I’m super unmotivated to go to my classes and spend my time playing video games and watching anime instead of studying or doing homework (though that’s probably a completely different problem). 

I’m thinking of just getting my bachelor’s in Marine Bio for now and figuring what I want from life after graduating, but if I decide to do that it’d be a complete waste of time and money if I don’t use the degree.

I received a request to produce all emails related to a particular subject, so I went through my email and copied all relevant ones into a folder for review with my boss.

When reviewing with my boss and my grandboss, my boss wanted me to not include one particular email.  I said that I thought it was relevant, so we should include it.  He agreed that it was relevant, but that he did not include it when responding to essentially the same discovery request from the same party a couple months earlier as part of a different regulatory case.  I said that didn't matter, that I was required to include all relevant emails.  My grandboss came down on my side and agreed that we needed to include it.  My boss warned us that we may get audited if someone finds the discrepancy between his discovery response and mine.

This is not the first time my boss has told me to do something unethical.  He also told me to testify that we had not developed cost estimates for a project that he had been circulating internally.  I relented in that situation, because they were his cost estimates and he said that they were not ready, even though he had been emailing them internally.  Other times, he has pressured me to fudge my own cost estimates.

I would like to go to my grandboss (his boss) and tell her that I would like to be moved out from under my boss's direction.  That we can make it as quiet as she would like.

331,"I can't believe that I'm actually writing about this, because writing about this directly translates to the fact that I'm actively considering it. But I suppose at this point I don't have much of a choice. 

I'm a 17 year old living in India. That's relevant because we don't have the greatest pet facilities here. There's no concept of certified pet trainers or therapists in my state. So please don't suggest things like that when you finish reading this. 

A year ago, after a lot of insistent begging, my mother agreed to get us a dog. She wasn't much of an animal lover, and found them dirty and disgusting, but changed her mind after we dragged her to a pet shop and forced her to hold some puppies. She instantly changed her mind. 

She was still reluctant, especially because we hadn't had the best experience with a dog. Around 8 years ago, when I was barely 10, my dad randomly got a doberman pinscher to our home without discussing it with anyone. This obviously infuriated my mother, especially because their marriage was very unstable at the time. Being a bit of an aggressive breed, he would keep biting us accidentally while playing. This made my father very angry, and he used to come home and beat our dog with belts. It was awful, and it only served to make his aggression worse. Then one day, when our dog was about a year old, my father came home drunk and threw him in his car. My mother, a very affectionate person, had gotten attached to him by then, and begged my father to not do something terrible to him. 
But my father ignored her, got in the car, and 15 minutes later he returned without our dog. He never told us what happened, and we never dared to ask. 
Soon after, my parents' marriage fell apart and they separated. 

Fast forward to 7 years later, after a lot of fights and reconciliations of unrequited love, they decided to get a divorce. I suppose that's part of the reason why my mom agreed to get my current dog, Oscar, since she thought it would brighten things up for our family. 

We got Oscar in April 2018, a gorgeous golden retriever, adorable as all hell. Our family was determined to do right by him, maybe to amend for our previous dog. 
And since my dad wasn't anywhere around, Oscar was never really hit much as a puppy. I'm guessing that's where everything went wrong. 
We did scold him but kept hitting to a minimum. I was the one responsible for training him and I'm the one he spent the most time with. Aside from a few flaws, he was turning out to be a great dog. 

Until about 5 months ago, when he bit my grandmother. He'd been eating some bread, and she just walked beside him which provoked him to instantly bite her. It was very bad, and she even broke a bone. 
The vet dismissed it as possessive behavior and told us to scold him more. 
We tried doing that until he bit my mother too. 
It was so surprising because he loves my mother the most, follows her around everywhere and never leaves her side. So we were all took by surprise when he bit her over something as silly as not wanting to get tied by a leash. 

This behavior continued for the next months, and he continued to bite the family members, including me, over small things. 

My mother kept telling me that we couldn't keep a dog like this and that there was something wrong with him, but she never gave him away because of how much she loved him. 

Recently, around 2 weeks ago, I broke my leg and was bedridden. Oscar's agressive behavior continued as he started growling and snapping at anyone who tried to get near me or touch my belongings. 
We dismissed it as protective behavior, until he tried to bite ME when I reached for my OWN shoes. 
We hit him for this, and he totally flipped out. Snarled and growled and snapped, he was almost like a wild wolf. 
Afterwards, his behavior worsened and he wouldn't let anyone enter my room, sometimes including me. He'd snap and try to bite anyone who tried to. 

Today, my grandmother was walking past my room, nowhere near the door, but he rushed out and bit her anyway with no prior warning. He usually growls before doing this, but this time he didn't even snap or act on a reflex. He deliberately rushed out to bite her when she was nowhere near him. 

My mother is at a lost as to what to do and so am I. She says that on every article she's read online, everyone says that there's no cure for dogs who bite their own family members. She thinks the best thing for our family and Oscar is euthanasia, because he can't stay in our home anymore. 
The worst part is, knowing how affectionate she is, I know she's not going to do anything until I give my okay. 

Only I have no idea what to do. Yes, I'm considering it because he's already bit my family members over 10 times, and I can't risk him doing something worse, considering how aggressive he's getting. But he's still MY dog and euthanasia is just a fancy term for murdering him. 

Is there any cure for him? Should I keep him despite the biting? Is euthanasia really the best option? Please help me out.",01May2019,1

337,"TLDR:
Boyfriend is friends with troublemakers which I hate. 
He got into jail because of these kind of people. 
Now it’s almost fucking impossible for him to get a job without fucking up. 
Is it wrong that I’m upset at him because of this?

There are 2 people I specifically dislike in the group. They’re a M/F couple and about a year ago brought a third guy into their relationship. Long story short, the first guy initially got kicked out of the relationship because he was abusive. Hits and calls his partners names. So it became a M/F pair with the second guy. Then the girl started seeing the first guy again. And told the second guy she “doesn’t have the energy to be in a relationship right now”. And immediately dates the first guy again. 

I know it’s supposed to be none of my business but I really hate that he hangs out with these people. They’re the type of people who would break into abandoned buildings and risk getting arrested for fun. And my boyfriend actually went to jail for it, while his friends got off scot-free because they were minors at the point of investigation. The worst part is that he was working for the police force at that point in time because of National Service in my country, Singapore. So he’s going to get jailed again soon under NS. 

They’re also the kind of people who stay out late a lot and run away from home because they have “broken homes”, skip school whenever they want. And they have a lot of friends for some reason. Somehow they manage to garner enough pity from people and shit. 

Because of his police case, it’s also really hard for him to get a job. He’s gone months without a job and I don’t know how to deal with it. I feel like it’s wrong of me to feel mad at him for not being able to get a job but I’m literally working my ass off everyday while he sits at home and plays games, and still has time to go out with these people. And he doesn’t even bother to ask me out. He always has time for them but not me. 

So is it wrong that I’d be so much happier if he’d cut off ties with these people? Or am I being unreasonable? Am I controlling? Abusive? Manipulative? I really don’t know. I think I am. But I can’t help it. I’d really be happier if he’d cut off ties with these good-for-nothings and find better friends. But they’re a huge part of his life. And I really can’t stand the joblessness thing. Maybe because my family’s poor. I don’t know. I’m just so frustrated at everything.",01May2019,0

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, my mum has been stalking all my friends on social media, whether that be instagram (the only social media I have), snapchat, facebook or twitter. Sometimes, friends at school would go up to me asking if it was really me. 

Now, I used to defend my mum, and say it was probably some random person, but it has happened so often that I just give up. Almost every night, my mum continues to call me stupid and fat, harrassing me every chance she gets. I hear it all the time with my sister (Now in university). Tonight was really bad, so, for the first time, she created a fake instagram account in the name of my sister. Of course, my sister didn't want an account so she calmly told my mum to delete it, however, it didn't stop there, it eventually turned into my sister hiding in my dad's room with my mum aggressively knocking and trying to get in, claiming that it was ""Her house"" and that she would ""Kick us out"". I can't do anything without her saying something completely offensive. She is impossible to teach.

I haven't  had the best luck when it comes to dating someone who is good for me but I really thought my current boyfriend may have finally been a good change. We grew up together and have really good chemistry. For 8 years before my current boyfriend, I was in toxic, manipulative, and abusive relationships. In fact, the boyfriend before him caused some serious trauma, more than I care to admit. Last night was when I finally came to terms with it. 
So my current boyfriend and I have been having small arguements which some have led to him sleeping in the living room or just walking to the opposite side of the house to cool down, which I guess I understand but last night he tried to leave my house and go home. He's attempted this before but I asked him nicely to sit down and talk it out but last night there was no stopping him. Quick backstory again;
Boyfriend before him used to leave or dump me after every fight and block my number or even cheat from what I was told but I was so brainwashed into staying everytime. So when current boyfriend tried to leave and go home saying he was gonna talk to me in the morning, I broke down and had a bad panic attack out of nowhere. When I explained why, he got upset yelling I'm comparing him and I wasn't! I just wanted to explain why I started breaking down and I was even super calm when doing so. I'm not used to someone walking away and still coming back to work it out. We were perfectly fine before last night. Ive never broke down like that, I'm such an easygoing person it's almost unreal.

355,"This is my first ever post on Reddit so I apologize if I break any unspoken rules.
Backstory: I (34M) moved away and started working as a Paramedic at age 22. It was a good job. Didn't pay great but gave me a sense of fulfillment. After nearly a decade I decided I wanted to do something more and thought about going into nursing. A profession that I can use my previous knowledge and experience and go even further with it. I decided to start an online nursing program that is all self paced. I thought I could knock it out super quick. After a few months I wasn't making much progress and felt like I needed a fresh start so I moved back home with my parents to save some money and took a job at the local hospital, which was a large pay cut, to get my foot in the door and obtain some ER experience.
Fast forward to now. 4 years in to a potentially 18 month program. I've developed a pretty fairly bad case of depression that I believe stems from:

1. The fact that I live at home in my mid 30's
2. The fact that my current job is fairly mindless and I had so much responsibility in my older job. Even though I know this is temporary. And a large number of the nurses that tell me what tasks to complete are younger than me making me feel even more ""less than"" and behind in life.
3. I want so bad to complete this program but everytime I have my days off I fill them rationalized excuses. (ie, my sister and nephews want to hang out, my friends want to meet up, I should exercise, I should clean up the house) the list goes on.

To make it worse I've started to lie about how far from finishing the program I am to interested parties because I'm ashamed of how long it's taking me.
I'm in this perpetual cycle of getting psyched up and motivated when I'm working my long stretch, like, I'm gonna just dominate this class on my days off. Then my days off arrive and I don't do a damn thing. FYI I work a string of 12hr shifts so attempting school on those days is near impossible just due to such a short turnaround. 

I guess my ask is has this or something similar happened to you and how did you gain the discipline required to overcome?

Thanks to you all if you've read this far.

360,"I’ve kind of hit desperation point so here I am lmao! Sorry in advance for poor formatting, I’m on mobile! Also sorry for length, I’m a wordy rambler.

In short, I’m [21F] currently finishing up my third year of university—so I’m mostly asking for advice for fourth year rather than right now because I’ve got to study for exams. My problem is that I’ve had a really hard time making friends at university, so for context here is a quick summary of my friendship troubles: 

My first year I was part of a group of people, but in the grand tradition of freshers friends, I realized second year I didn’t actually like any of them and they were kind of all dicks to me because I’m somebody who is easy to pick on (mostly because I generally find it funny so I don’t mind). So when I moved out of halls ditched three of them (two were what I consider very nasty people, one is a straight up manipulator) and as a result I only really had two or three friends by the end of it (including my boyfriend). I joined the committee for a society I’m incredibly passionate about, made friends there and all was peachy! 

Third year, a girl I actually got very close to graduated so I was very sad to see her go. A different girl I’d grown close to is going through a hard time and just doesn’t reply to my messages anymore, so I can’t even arrange to meet her. I became friends with these two people (let’s call them Richard and Bella), Bella was a new committee member. I got really attached to them and hung out with them constantly. In October I decided I didn’t like the remaining friend from my freshers group so stopped hanging out with her. Then in February, Richard cheated on his boyfriend and that basically ruined everything. I tried to overlook it (I’ve been cheated on and it sounds dumb but it traumatized me, i find it incredibly triggering to be around cheaters) but I wasn’t able to. I realized that I would never be able to trust him again, so I distanced myself. But I still had committee so it was okay. But now, we have a new head and a new committee. I got the role I wanted (deputy), but the head appointed a bunch of his friends to committee (they are genuinely actually good at their jobs and passionate) so the chance to make friends with them is so small, because they’re already secure in their own little groups. And because life is sadistic, Richard is now on committee too. So Bella and Richard sit together and chat together and I constantly feel like they’re talking about me (Richard texted me a few weeks ago demanding I explain why I wasn’t talking to him and I was honest and clear that I wasn’t going to be able to be friends with him, he took it well but that was just to my face).

So this is where I’m at. Committee is already cliquey, so it’s hard to get talking to new people. I have literally no one except for my flatmate and boyfriend. Honestly, I don’t actually mind it because I’m a firm believer of quality over quantity. I have really bad trust issues and I find it almost impossible to be vulnerable and openly attached to specifically friends. I’m very open to my boyfriend, and I really love and care for my flatmate who is one of the very few people I’ve been able to open up to. I’m always afraid that friends will use personal information to hurt me or manipulate me, but I don’t fear that with my flatmate. 

What sucks the most, is probably just the knowledge that I have no friends—it just makes me sad for myself. I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong to still have not found the right people. Everyone else seems to have best friends and tight knit groups and I don’t. I feel very rejected, even though I’m the one who has made these decisions not to stick with people I don’t wholly trust. I’m starting to feel like, because I’m the common theme in all my failed friendships, maybe it’s my fault I’m in this situation. I know my actions led me here, but my boyfriend says it’s not necessarily my fault (although I can be quite judgmental and I don’t change my mind easily at all) more that I attract the wrong people and I don’t really choose my friends for any particular reason—more just because they’re there and want to talk to me. I’m considering quitting committee because of how alone and awful committee events are making me feel, even though I love the society, love working for it and want to go into that field after I’m done with my education.

This whole situation has made me really really down, and it’s brought about really nasty body issues as a fun little bonus. I’m making this post because I would really like advice on what the hell I should do fourth year to make new friends and actually have successful friendships. I don’t want my friendships to fail!!!!! I really really want maybe two new friends that I can be totally open and vulnerable with, and have them be vulnerable to me in return. Right now my course of action is just to spend more time with my flatmate (my boyfriend and I only see each other on weekends), and learn to be a better friend (as I can be quite distant especially with my emotions and displays of affection) and girlfriend. I should also note that my flatmate (as well as my bf) has encouraged me to spend more time with her friends, and I do like two of her friends a lot (they’re fantasy fans like me) but they’re not available right now and I need to study anyways.

TLDR; I have no friends now and it’s not entirely my fault, but having no friends at uni seems to have become a theme and I’m not sure if it’s my fault. How do I make real friends that I actually like and trust next year lol",01May2019,1
361," 

My friend (he is straight) and I have had a really good friendship, but I made the mistake of catching feelings. It was the first time I’d ever had feelings (out of the closet late... yay!!) so I didn’t address it and eventually the friendship soured. In hindsight, probably because we were both quite naive about the repercussions. Eventually, after a friendship that was once really nice turned sour for both of us.

He was extremely accepting of it and never made me feel like he was scared of me. I know he isn’t homophobic either.

I was heartbroken and it was difficult for me to be around him. I was awful to him and he became resentful. (I talk a lot about me here because I don’t like assuming what other people think)

This was about 8 months ago. We have been through quite the rollercoaster. But eventually we sat down and talked about it all.

I’m someone who is really good at talking about my emotions and feelings, and he is someone that NEVER talks about it. But we both spent about an entire day talking about how we both feel and cleared as much up as possible.

But nonetheless, I had hoped that while it wasn’t going to ever be forgotten... it was something we could move past.

It’s now been about 6 months since that talk. From a friendship that even pre feelings, we used to talk constantly. We used to want to see each other.

I can tell with certainty that I no longer have feelings for him. He’s always been a friend that I could confide in, so I told him that too. I also have grown so much as a person and I understand what it means to have feelings and what to do when they aren’t... appropriate (lack of a better term but yeah)

But the friendship... sucks right now. He maintains really close friendships with all of my friends. But when it comes to me, he still resents me. I strike up conversation on text, and it dies pretty much instantly. I organise stuff for us to do, and he says he’s too busy. He and I used to go to the gym together but now he goes with one of my friends instead.

I have mentioned this in a smaller context and he says there is nothing wrong.

When I bring up things with him, he hates it and thinks I’m attacking him. But what else do I do here?

I don’t want the friendship to end. I know that it might if I bring this up.

It sucks right now yes. But it was really good. It makes me really emotional thinking about how happy we both were at one stage.

It’s getting to a stage where being treated like this fucks me over.

Am I in the wrong for wanting to sort this out?

I can always provide more info if needed.",01May2019,1

363,"This is a long story, so I'll try to keep it as short as possible. 
I live in Indiana, and my best friend lives in Virginia. I went to visit her last month, and the day after I went back home, a guy messaged me on tinder. He asked why I was so far now, I explained the visiting etc. We hit it off instantly, and things got romantic really quickly. We didnt sext or send nudes etc, I mean texting all day and then ending some nights with a 3 hour phone call. We both have a 4 year old child each, same sense of humor, intelligent, kind, similar interests etc. We decided that I should come and visit to see how we got on in person, and since my.best friend lives literally 8 miles away from him, I felt safe and comfortable that I wasn't trapped. 
So I got to VA on the 19th, and after a solid month of build up, and him telling me that his intention was that of seeking a long term relationship, even a long distance one etc. We met and everything went fantastically. We both look the same in person, out chemistry is amazing, and we are attracted to each other. I went home with him and we were intimate. We spent a few days together and then I went to my best friends to give him some space because I don't like to crowd people. 
I could tell something was off and he is very mature ( I'm 25, he is 46 for crying out loud). So he leveled with me and essentially he was in a bad breakup 4 months ago, which he told me about already but didnt seem to have any effect as he told me he wanted to pursue a relationship beforehand. However, no he seems very afraid to let me in emotionally and said that being intimate with me would make him feel like a jerk, because maybe he would be taking advantage when he doesn't know what he wants emotionally.  This was all very sudden and a total 180 from the last solid month of talking and 3 days of great chemistry in person and genuinely treating me as though he was very emotionally invested. 
I decided to leave, because the whole situation didnt sit right, even though he wanted me to stay and behave as like platonic friends who cuddle and kiss? Too much for me, emotionally. 
Now I'm in purgatory waiting to see if he can work out his emotions, still hung up on his ex it seems. So I'm just crestfallen. It was such a swift change of heart and I'm at a total loss. 
Should I try and pursue any further, or let him come to me? 

Tl;dr: Met a guy on tinder, talked for a month solid, intentions for a real relationship ensued. We met and things were great, and now he's unsure of his emotional hang ups from a recent break up and I'm left high and dry.",01May2019,1

365,"So I'm having roommate issues, well not my roommate somewhat but more of his booty call / gf.  It started out with him building a shed to live in my yard and he would just pay electricity and eventually I keep the shed.  He did that for a summer then he asked to move in the basement room we agreed on $300 a month.  It's been over a year or so and hes kinda loud/ always drunk/ but works so hes not home alot until late.  When hes home hes pretty loud, falls asleep with music / TV loud and this is right below my bedroom.  Not always an issue but atleast one night a week I lose some sleep over it.

He stopped paying me monthly about 7 months ago and has been cutting down trees for me. One tree a month.  But sometimes skips a month.  I don't need the money as I make a decent amount and I know hes going to court issues 2x DUIs court fees, leased 30,000 truck...

This summer I was going to have him do my roof and I help him along with the front of my house to make up for the missed payments.

But it's his booty call that drives me nuts, she sells hard drugs (never out of my house), is loud and pretty much the definition of white trash.  Recently she cheated on him and he burnt all her shit in my front yard.  Cops and fire dept came and lucky charged him with arson.  They were ""done"" but now shes coming back staying the night and stuff.

Lately we’ve eve been arguing every week because I guess we still have feelings for each other even though we are just friends with benefits. I am starting to realize that she is absolutely poisonous to my mental health and I just want to be honest with her about everything. I have caught her in lies but I never mention it because I know we’re “just friends” so every time (even today) when I try to mention something about not talking to some guy or to not follow a guy on social media, she will tell me “don’t tell me what to do we’re just just friends” or “you let that one girl touch your thigh and you almost had sex with her” YEAH HUH.

376,"Hi. So this is a bit of an awkward question but regardless I am asking. Recently I’ve started to look back on my childhood (I’m 20 now, female) and remember taking showers with my mom and sister. I washed my own body most times. Now I don’t remember if she also helped me wash myself (like my butt lol) or if that’s just my imagination. I don’t remember exactly when we stopped showering together, my guess is somewhere between 7-9.  Anyway is this normal? I’ve never thought of it to be weird but idk the thought just popped in my head. I also remember my mom checking my vagina after I showered. It made me feel a bit awkward and shy but I was never scared or anything. I’m almost positive she was truly just checking to see if I was properly cleaning myself and nothing else but I’m freaking myself out to believe it might have been something else. ( ps I have ocd so intrusive thoughts are a thing, and this could very well be one). I also want to say that she never made me feel uncomfortable or like anything wrong was happening. I love my mom so much and I know she loves me too and she has otherwise been a normal and caring mother.  I just want to know if this is normal behavior. I’ve never thought much of it until now and idk I think it might just be my ocd obsessing over. I would talk to her about this but I’m too embarrassed and I don’t want her to know I’m having these thoughts about her :(",01May2019,89

379,"I took my 2008 Charger in for a fuel pump change to a reputable shop in my city, as the check engine light was on. After pulling codes, it pointed me to the fuel pump. The shop waited for the part,  installed it, I was charged to the tune of $900 after 5 days. Picked up my car, and immediately knew there was an issue as the check engine light was still on. I asked the front desk guy that helped me from day one to simply reset my computer codes as I had plans. He said no problem and whisked my car to the back. 30 minutes passed and i told him i had to leave cause i had plans, and to call me when it was done. I recieved a text 2 hours later stating they pulled out my instrument cluster, and now the car wont start. Mind you, I never authorized them to do that, I wanted my codes simply reset. The next day they called and told me the tech bent a pin in the female connector in the harness that plugs into the instrument cluster, but not to worry as he fixed it. I picked up the car, and again the check engine light was still on. They pulled the codes and I demanded to be right there. Codes still showed fuel pump issues, and they reset it at my request as it's obvious they still didnt do it from the day before. Next, the fuel gauge began to read incorrectly and was just flying all over the place, from full to half, half to 3 quarters etc etc. Took the car back, and demanded they fix it. They ended up sending in my instrument cluster to be fixed, got it back and the dome lights didnt work, my on dash trunk button and dash signal lights didnt work. So, they replaced the cluster from a 09 charger that's a little different. When they installed the new dash and I picked it up, still had a check engine light for U1403 and U1411. I was told the BUS computer system needed to be reset. They reset it, no check engine light, but the fuel gauge still doesnt read right. I can sit idle and it will move almost a quarter tank to the left. I dropped the car off again on 4/30, showed the tech my video of it moving, and before/after pics of it moving. All I got was a ""it didn't move that far"" comment which i replied that I have never seen a car do that without their being an issue. 

I'm lost. I'm afraid to take the car anywhere else for a second opinion as the shop that broke may try and say it's not their problem as the other shop could have done something while looking at it.

381,"Hey there,

So earlier this year I moved away from home to study for the second time. The first time was last year, in which I moved away in February and returned home mid-semester in September. I ended up changing universities to be closer to friends I know in the city. I should note that I had to move about four hours away from home to study, as my family lives in a small-medium sized country town far from the nearest university.

The thing is that I enjoy uni, and it is something that I have always wanted to do. However I’ve found that whenever I’m away from home, my mood is always down unless I’m with my friends, which usually can only happen on weekends. I find myself constantly missing my family as much as I try not to. 

This year I challenged myself to go 2 months without going back home and I managed that, however I was only meant to go back for a few days and ended up staying 2 weeks albeit I did catch the flu while I was there. I left earlier today and my down mood is already setting in. When I stay home, I sleep in my younger brother’s room and we stay up late playing video games, watching movies and laughing together. I also have two younger sisters that I adore and miss a lot when I have to leave. There’s also my parents that I could not live without, they call me each day to talk and help me with how to cook and do things now that I’m living away from home. 

I carry this constant worry that something bad is going to happen to one of them while I’m not there, and if it did I know that I would drop everything without a second thought and go back home. This probably stems from the fact that I had another little sister that died when I was younger. 

I don’t know how much longer I can deal with it, considering how I’m struggling to make it through one full year and have to study for 4+ years. Any advice would be much appreciated.",01May2019,1

I’ve been left heartbroken more times than I could remember which left me quite confused because I always thought one of the things everyone wanted in life was for someone to be nice towards them so why throw it back in their face after they’ve been so kind ? So now I’m debating if it’s worth it to try and remove that kindness that I have in me and become more ‘heartless’ as it were to people from now on( not be rude towards them but just not be as nice if you get what I mean), I mean it would save me a lot of heartache would it not ?",01May2019,4

We have been together for 4 years and things started really well and I fell in love, 11 months into our relationship, he said he loved me and I was over the moon. The same day, I found out he was cheating the whole time. It tore me apart, and I didn't know what to do, i just said I loved him so I gave him a chance. (might have been stupid I know) but we were good from there on, he helped with my trust issues and we felt amazing. However, about 2 years later, I lost a baby and he wasn't there for me, his priority was to go out and do drugs which he knows I'm not happy with, I won't have him in our home like that. I first thought that it might have been a coping mechanism but when I asked he said a miscarriage was probably for the best and he just wasn't as bothered as me, he didn't understand why I was 'moping so much'. It broke me.
Now on to today, I recently caught him deleting messages with another girl, I saw the messages that were deleted and they weren't sexual but he's known this girl for a while. And when I confronted him he swore on the baby that we lost that he didn't delete anything. I then said he chooses between me or her if he's going to do this and we have been fighting ever since

392,"Before you think it's a stereotypical relationship
issue, it isn't, this is one of those times where it's a
legitimate thing where I want to know who is in the right before I pull off the revenge

My ex, I'll call him blue, because that's my
nickname for him, is a female to male transgendercurrently aged fourteen. He sent nudes to half of my grade (year ten) without permission, but because he is too young to get surgery they consider him a she. Blue has dated half my grade and more of his grade, so it's logical to consider him a whore. He dated me three times, the first time he cheated, the second time he just wanted to get laid, I declined, because he is physically female and if anyone's getting put on the sex offenders registry it will be me, so he broke up with me then, stupidly I gave him another chance, we dated for two weeks and then he broke up with me again because apparently he was too stressed But during the third relationship I told him a closely guarded secret. And he decided that because he had a crush on another person, once we broke up he told them everything about me, including that.

I have about seventeen of his nudes, he sent them to me to get into my pants, I don't delete
messages, and I did so in this case because if I was found in possession of them or whatever, I have proof that I wasn't consenting to it, relevant later.

The first time he fucked me over I forgave him, he
messed me up for months because I was convinced I wasn't good enough. That's how it goes when vou are cheated on. But I am a good person apparently, and gave him a second chance. Three months later on new year's we hook up again, and when he doesn't get sex, he dumps me. A month later, I've forqiven him aqain because I thought he deserves another chance.We dated for two weeks, and split.

Well I took his excuse for breaking up with me, I understood, because being in a relationship is
stressful to some. Well this was at the end of
January this year. Yesterday I found out blue went
to the boyfriend of my best friend and told him all
my secrets as an attempt to get into his pants too I had warned blue that if he fucked me over like
that, I would use his nudes against him, which
would really fuck him up, it would seriously mess
with his dysphoria and if his parents caught wind he would be in deep shit

Well although it seems like wanting revenge puts me far into the right, I'm here to make sure, because he thinks that all I want to do is spread them around, and so he could get me arrested.

Well I actually have them on a thumb drive and I intend to hand it into the school claiming that he sent them to me, and I've waited to make sure he won't think it's me, and now I'm reporting it because I'm ""concerned that he will get hurt by someone spreading his nudes, and I'm morally obligated to report it for his protection"" 

The school will notify parents and he will lose his ability to date or talk outside school. He is dating another friend of mine, she didn't know about any of this and I told her today that blue will happily tell people her secrets, so I've put a wedge between them, I honestly did that not for revenge but ti protect my friend. But blue will be forced to be a hermit, and that will really fuck with blue. I will also report that he has admitted to sending nudes to a lot of people, and I will release the information that he is a cheater, a liar and he tells peoples secrets for no reason aside from he wants to impress whoever he wants to fuck. 

Now I did give him a way to redeem himself, he just has to apologize. And he has one week, now six days. But the thing is, he blames ME. he legitimately thinks that it's my fault for trusting him so he shouldn't be blamed for doing what's in his nature. So he won't apologize, and I will use the perfectly legal way to use his underage nudes against him. He cannot get back at me, because if he does I'll just release all his secrets, including sending a letter to his parents containing screenshots of him admitting to want to fuck his cousin (this is after I lost interest, if I had known he was into incest before I dated I wouldn't have bothered with him) 

So the issue is on one hand I could teach him he will never succeed in life if he is like this. And on the other hand I might be going way too far. And what I'm asking is should I follow the plan or should I consider myself the asshole in this situation",01May2019,0

I have found a",01May2019,1
394,"Please go easy on me because this is difficult to write, as it's difficult to say out loud that I'm a doormat. I'm a young man who tends to do anything to please people, bend back and forth to suit to their needs and let them walk all over me because I'm so terrified of being abandoned and scared to face them when they abuse me. This stems from begin abandoned as a child, I've spent my life in foster care jumping from house to house, I've never had any role models and I feel I'm very lost when it comes to navigating life.

I've managed to study, get a decent job and be independent. I'm trying to work on bettering myself, but I know I let people use me because I fear if I confront them and stand up for myself they might leave me.

Once I realized what's wrong with me I decided to change it, and an opportunity has arisen where I should stand my ground and grow a backbone but I don't know how to go on about it.

I moved to a new town for work and decided to take up a certain sport. I found the only person who teaches it in my area, the only other person I found is 3 hours away so it's not viable. I've spent quite a chunk of money buying my equipment, and practicing this sport is the only thing that's taken me out of a years long depression.

It's helped with my self esteem issues, it's gotten me fit and it just makes me happy, which is a new one for me. So it's fair to say I'm very invested in this and it's something I don't want to quit.

The issue comes with my coach. I pay him to train me 3 times a week. The problem is he usually cancels one or two classes per week. It wasn't this bad at the beginning, but after 6 months of him being my coach he's just getting lazier and I feel I'm paying for a service I'm not getting.

There's always some excuse, when it's not the weather it's him being busy, having other plans, or even 'being too tired'. Other times he's straight out forgot about me or didn't show up at all. Some times I call him and wait for him till the very last minute, which interferes with me making other plans. Other times he shows up very late or cuts the lesson short because he has to get somewhere else.

When I jokingly say to him he keeps forgetting about me he plays it down, and when I suggest that I take the classes he missed some other day, he never can because he has 'prior commitments'.

This month I decided to keep a record so when I confronted him I'd have proof to show him and not just my word. So far he's missed 7 classes out of the 12 we should have had and I paid for.

I fear if I confront him and say I either pay him half the money next month, or we catch up with all the lessons I've paid for and he hasn't give me, he might just say 'no' and then I have nothing to do. I'm very anxious about it because this sport is very important for me, it's taken me out of a very dark place and I don't want to quit because I can't travel 3 hours each way 3 times a week to the other coach. So that's not even an option.

I fear if he feels I'm confronting him he might get mad and say he doesn't want to coach me anymore. But at the same time I have to stand up for myself and stop allowing him to walk all over me. I'm paying for a service I'm not getting and I feel very disrespected.

How can I do it? What do I do if I offer to pay him half the money next month and he says no? I know 100% he'll refuse to catch up with all the lessons he owes me because he doesn't seem very motivated to work, and for 6 months, whenever I ask to catch up with the missed lessons he never has time. So that's a no. Then, if I offer to pay him half and he refuses, what do I do? How do I proceed?

This situation is giving me a lot of anxiety, when I get nervous I tend to stutter, I go blank, start speaking incoherently and my hands even start shaking. So I don't know what I'm gonna do when I confront him. What if he says if I'm not happy I should quit because this is how he works? Basically what if he says 'no can do'?.

Please help me, I want to respect myself and stand my ground, I want to solve this conflict with me because I want to keep practicing this sport, I don't want him to take advantage of me and charge me for a job he isn't doing.

Ps- Quiting or firing him are not an option, he has the key piece of equipment needed that costs a shit load of money, so I not only need him to train me but I need him to get access to the equipment, otherwise I can't do this sport at all and it's too expensive for me to buy it and there's no way I could store it in my house.",01May2019,1

I’m not a good student, I’m going to summer school already, I get why that can be stressful for a parent. But she causes ME stress from her being stressed. My father doesn’t listen to logic and backs up my mom no matter what, and I don’t have a good relationship with him really. So why I’m writing this is because I wrote a personal narrative for English and it was supposed to be very personal and only the teacher would see it. I usually show my mom my papers cause she’s good at English and enjoys seeing my work. I guess I somehow made it sound like my parents were to blame for everything I said (didn’t even mention them), and according to my dad she cried all night for nothing. Then my dad said that I am going to change it and I’m not going to tell my mom he told me any of this. They also said that what happened in my narrative wasn’t real and it fucking was. I told them I don’t tell them everything and they still don’t believe me when they were there right fucking next to me going through what I did.

400,"This is going to be a long one.

I’ve been holding this post off for months now, but I realized I’m in need of help. I'm guy 18 who has just graduated high school, and I’m not sure what is the “best” plan given my circumstances. But let me give you the full rundown, so you guys can give me other opinions.

This “story/issue” starts my junior year of high school (2016-2017) year. My parents tell me we are going to move at the end of that year for financial reasons (taxes are high, poor in a wealthy community, a family of 7), I’m feeling sad as fuck that I’ll be leaving all the friends. 

So we move I’m in a new state 2 hours from my old house. This is now the summer of my junior year going into senior year of of high school. My mom who’s very catholic brings up the idea that we should me and my other 2 younger siblings should be homeschooled (for the first time in my life). I personally wasn’t sure if I wanted that, but on the other hand moving to a new school senior year would’ve been ass. So my mom forces us to be homeschooled, in addition to this going on I work on marketing this game my 2 older brothers are working on. (Not to be confused with my 2 younger siblings, there’s 5 children including myself).  

So my older brothers who haven’t found work yet decided to work on developing a game, I said I wanted to learn marketing, so I did tons of research and applied t to the game they were making. I grew the social media accounts with 0 dollars and followers to over 6k, we had people who were interested....but no game insight since the coder we were paying for, in a paid/rev share Deal was taking forever since they had personal issue going on in their life. So this was an issue the entire senior year. 

In addition, this senior year I was learning some 3D art skills. I was originally thinking of joining the VfX industry, but this changed more recently. I went to a couple of colleges touring to see which was the right fit, but ultimately given my family’s financial situation, my parents were not going to give me any money for college which I understand some they have 5 kids, and me knowing debt crisis right now I did not hop on to any University loan train. 

So now to present time, I finally finished up school. I’m 18 currently, you’re probably wondering what happened to that game you’re working on? That game is still on hold, the dev didn’t take the money we paid him yet, but as of now we don’t know the ETA, (it will cost us $500). Given that I had a years worth of marketing knowledge for a game that didn’t launch, we decided to become a marketing company for the indie games. 

We have 4 clients, we are promoting their content, but remember, we are running on a zero budget...so marketing is very creative with us. We have made money technically but it’s very tiny ad revenue from each game since the service we provide is “we will market you game for free and you give us 10-25% of sales of your game”. So we’ve gotten downloads and I’m seeing progress and we have some bigger strategies to put into play, but the issue now (do to time)  is do I go to college or do I stay working on “real” business for the next year (as a gap year).  I have to make this decision in the next 3 days... so I’m not sure.

Here’s the info on the college deal, so I’d be going to community college which I’d have to commute to, it would be paid for with scholarships, and If I do go their and I maintain a 3.2 GPA, then I’ll get $5k from some rich donor (BTW I’ve always been a B student so...). 

The other part of me says no, I may never have this chance to work on a business on my own, even if our business fails it’s still good information I’ve learned that most of people my age have never done. Also I’d basically being high school again since that’s what you do in your first 2 years of college. 

You’re probably also wondering to what happened to my desire for 3D art and becoming a VFX artist in the industry. I did some soul searching and more research into the industry and found out that it is not what I thought, and I’d have to be obsessed with art to even make it and I realized I’m more of a hobbyist anyway.

Back to the big decision on what I’ll do this fall 2018. I want to make the decision that will probably benefit me the most (obviously), my dad is in support of me and my older brothers working on a startup, my mom, all of my extended family believe we are crazy for trying our own business. They think I should start college immediately this fall, also I haven’t told all my friends that I’m doing this company. Tbh I’m a little embarrassed because they make think I’m not totally “serious”. Besides from that a lot of the people I know think I’m going to school this fall, but I really need to see this through. 

Some extra information, I haven’t been working any part-time jobs recently. I’ve been very busy working on marketing related work. It doesn’t take up 100% of my day, but it does take up random chunks of time. As I said before about money, our company was started this June 2018, and our income is revenue on our clients games, so it’s been very tiny, we are trying to grow, and our biggest issue has been money. We do have plans to try to do bigger deals with YouTubers.

Me personally, I’ve never wanted to be a 9-5 worker, so going entrepreneurial is something that I really enjoy. I do understand risk to reward ratio, and I do know that this company could very well fail. Knowing that this might be my only chance I can try this out, I feel that it needs to be finished, I want to see us win or lose and I don’t want regret. As I said before, I could skip a year and if our company bombed, my tuition at the community college would be paid for and I could go next year. I’d go into marketing since I do have minor experience with and I kind of enjoy it. Like the only thing holding me back from just going straight to the gap year and saying fuck college, is that all of friends/extended (who will now be at different colleges) will think I’m going to fail. In addition, if it does fail I’ll be a year behind going into school. Also this year since I was homeschooled, I literally didn’t make ANY new friends. (This would require a whole other post), so yeah homeschooling should pretty ass, and seeing people at a college would make me feel in “reality” again, but I’m sure I could find some social group if I do go for a gap year which I’m leaning towards.

405,"I went to an ""elite"" school in the US and dropped out because of the tuition. I got accepted to another school with less prestige, registered for classes, and apparently forgot to drop them because I decided to work full time. Now I have a 0.15 GPA. My previous major GPA was 3.8. I'm saying this because I busted my ass, spent almost $150k out of pocket, and earned 70+ credits in the past few years. I submitted a backdate withdrawal request as soon as I was aware that my tuition balance could be turned over to collections, and after almost a month later, I finally got a response after reaching out multiple times via phone and email.

My backdate withdrawal request was ineffective. I was informed that because of university policies and that I somehow got a C in a class where I did absolutely NOTHING, my failing courses will turn into Ws, except for the C, and I will still have the same GPA. I was told that I am highly likely to get kicked out of the university. Also, the university is still trying to charge me for tuition. Because of the delayed response, I have/am accrued/accruing finance charges.

Now that my postsecondary education is off of the table because of the inevitable expulsion from the university (has not happened yet) and the extremely low likelihood of being accepted to another university, what should I do? I am BEYOND pissed. I am joining the military specifically for assistance in funding my education. I feel like, although there may not be any recourse, the university cannot ruin my postsecondary education and charge me tuition (and expect me to pay finance charges because of their unprofessional delayed response - really? almost a whole month!). I expressed the urgency of response at the beginning of the month because I am shipping out to basic military training.

Is there any recourse for my postsecondary education and/or the tuition?

My plan is to write a formal letter and send it to several people above the person I dealt with and potentially others. I am not sure if there is any leverage here, but, after talking with friends and family, a friend sent me a news article about the university purposely failing a certain percentage of students in certain courses specific to my degree program.

406,"Hi everyone

There might be a better place to ask this but I figured I may as well start here. 

I am based in Sydney, Australia. I received an offer last week to join a company who’s head office is in the US. They are using an external company to do the background check which is based in the Philippines.

The background check company are not competent imo. They keep sending me requests to provide information which I have already given them, saying they don’t have a record when I can see it in their portal. They have also asked me to sign a document giving authorisation to one of their third parties who requires my handwritten approval. They won’t tell me who or what for.

They have asked me to upload paper copies of my employment records and education transcripts. I originally provided them the phone numbers of HR and two former bosses for employment check, plus the head office number for the TAFE I went to. Upon checking, they have made no effort to call any of the numbers I provided for verifying my education and work experience. 

I have never had to have this much input on a background check before. With other roles it has been only to give my permission for them to use my passport ID/driver licence number to do a criminal check and give them my past employers information for them to check. 

The recruiter says I shouldn’t be concerned. I feel this company are being really lazy. I have seen online some complaints about this company incorrectly flagging problematic information and people have lost their offers because of this. Do I have the right to request another company to do the check? TIA

Today, I was literally on the verge of punching him in the face and I'm willing to do so if he ever hits my mom. He used to hit me as a kid (he hasn't hit my mom fortunately but throwing things is as abusive) so I've been holding some kind of grudge against him. I guess..

413,"So I am turning 23 next month and have a somewhat weird relationship at home. Somewhat of backstory: My parents are from south of asia and my mom moved here a few years, bevore I was born to europe, just because the marriage with my dad was arranged. My dad moved here a few prior to that because his parents were afraid, that if he stays there, he would have to join the army, since there was a war in the country. And I was not always a wishfull child, as I almost dropped out of school, and had trouble with the cops. But all of that is now more than 8 years ago.  
So I have this problem, that I am still not allowed to do anything without asking my parents for permissions. And most of the time, if I want to do something else than work or study, the answer is no.

I got into my first relationship about two and a half year ago, and it took me about a year, to tell it to my dad (as he is the more relaxed one from my parents) and he almost freaked out and he then somehow managed to tell it to my mom when I was not home, so she could calm herself down, bevore I got home. And I am not allowed to bring my girlfriend home or stay at her place over night.  
After that, I wanted to get a tattoo, and as I asked if I may, the answer was no. I had to argue almost a whole day, bevore they just said yes, so I would shut up. 

I thought it would get better, when I get older, but last week I was staying home and playing video games, as I had holiday from work. And my mom is pretty religious, and at the afternoon, when she went to the temple, she asked me to go with her. I refused because, I simply don't believe in religion and stayed in my room. After a while, sho came to my room door and ask if I wouldn't just spend one hour of my time, to got to the temple with her. And I just said no, I am not comming with you. And as I said no, she would just repead the question, and start tearing up more and more until she was crying. And then I finally agreed to go with her, just because I wouldn't have to see her crying. And there are really a lot more examples, where I just do things, because I am scared about getting screamed at from my parents or my mom starting to cry.

I am currently searching for an apartement to finally be able to move out. But I am still too scared to tell it to my parents, because they might freak out or start crying. Last time, when I was joking about moving out (I was not really looking to move out) they  threatened me to disown me and that I would never ever be allowed to enter the house anymore.

416,"TLDR at the bottom. Sorry if this is all over the place im just trying to collect my thoughts. I have been studying pre vet for the past 4 years and will be earning my bachelors in it this coming June. I applied to a few vet schools because I had the intentions of maybe taking a gap year to explore different interests, but still wanted to apply as a 'why not' type of thing. I only applied to 4, one of them being my state school and my top choice, the others I didn't do too much research into, and mainly picked them based on how close they were to my house or what doctors that I've worked with have told me to apply to. I received an interview for a school in November, to which I heard back in March that I was placed on the wait list. When I interviewed I also toured the school. The location and the school was amazing but I thought the vibe of the people there kind of weird and it threw me off. The school is also about a 9 hour drive from my house and is a lot farther than my undergrad which was 1.5 hours. 

So basically when I was placed on the wait list they said I would not know what place in the list I was, and that it could be until August until I find out, but when I do find out I have 24 hours to decide and place a deposit to hold my spot. I haven't heard from them yet, but I want to make this decision now so that it's fully thought out and so that I can have more than 24 hours to decide. So now I'll explain the reasoning for why I'd choose both answers:

Why I'd choose yes? Because vet school is very hard to get in to, let alone even get an interview for. I'm afraid if I don't take the opportunity I'll regret it, or I won't be able to get in the second time around. (and yes that's very possible because what and who they are looking for changes from year to year) Another reason is a lot of my friends got accepted and have plans to go, therefore I feel obligated to accept the offer if I'm given it. I also have been applying to jobs, and have not gotten any luck yet. I feel like I need to figure out my plans soon because I'm graduating at the end of this month and I'm scared if I don't take the opportunity it will be a decision I'll regret.

Why I'd choose no? Because I didn't like the vibe of the people there. Because I can apply next year, and hopefully go to my top school which is also in state (lower tuition). I spoke to the admissions board of my top school (that I got denied from this year) about my application and how I'd be able to improve it. She said she thinks I have a very high chance in getting an interview next year, since this year I hadn't completed all of the classes they required so it couldn't factor into my gpa. But my main reason for saying no would be because I want to work, make money, and get experience working with exotics. I want to be independent and financially stable, and I know I can't do these things if I go to vet school. 

So I'm asking for advice on what you think you'd do if you were in my shoes. If I say no, I'm taking a calculated risk but if I say yes, I'm playing it safe and potentially missing out on different opportunities.

TLDR: I am on the waitlist for a vet school and if I am accepted, I will have a 24 hour window to make my decision and place a monetary deposit. I want to say yes because it's a once in a lifetime opportunity, but it's not my favorite school and I also want to explore different jobs. I am conflicted and need advice on how I should make my decision.",01May2019,1

I emailed the AP a couple days ago but he never got back to me and this guy still stares at me and walks around the hallways..?! And the AP has to have got the email because he got my others ones.


So what do I do? Talk with another AP in person? I’m not good with words so that’s kinda a last resort.. Email the principal? I am angered easily and this guy is your average creep, scrawny, short, defenseless, weird.. I have been trying so hard lately to not just go up to him in the cafeteria and bang his head on the table and  sock him.

424,"I received 15 out of 40 points which are for the teacher to give based on tests and research durning the term. Most teachers give 2 tests with 4-5 questions at 15 points per test.   

&amp;#x200B;

However, this teacher gave us 1 test, which had only 3 questions, on everything we had learned, maybe 2 weeks before the half-term exams. I think the points were: 25 for the 3 questions, and 15 for a different test on a project.     

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to do is ask him to review the tests; I know for certain I got 2 out of 3 questions right in both tests, and I know I got the 3rd question wrong, which is a bad score, I know, but not as bad as he gave me, I should have received at least 25 points based on this, I hope to get 30.  

I want to mention the amount of questions on the test, and how close it was to final which reflects my actual performance whereas this test does not. I cannot talk to him in person, so I will send an e-mail, and if it does not work I can talk to someone higher up to request that the teacher reviews the grade, but there is no guarantee that it changes.

428,"Here's is my background:

I went to University for 3 years. The first two I majored in Neuropsychology, then in my last year I switched to straight Psychology. I didn't do poorly (78 average), but I was young and felt out of place. So I didn't return for my fourth year (I had 1.5 years left of undergrad) and switched to college.

In college, I completed my three-year course in Construction Management and I've been working in a relevant field for the last four years. The pay is okay and if I get certain certifications, I can make decent money in 10-15 years. However, I find the job very unfulfilling and not enjoyable. 

Few things to note...I always enjoyed the subject matter in Psychology. It's always been a hobby/passion of mine and I find it very interesting. I fell into depression in my final year and I had this feeling of helplessness and that something needed to change. I was surrounded by people in University who seemed to love being there and I just didn't have that feeling about school itself. When I went to college, I never found the content interesting, but I felt stuck. I had already changed and had to just tough it out and hopefully it would be different when I started working. But it's not different. Four years later and it feels like I'm just working for my pay cheque. I'm not helping anyone except my millionaire boss who spends most of his time down in Florida. I want to feel like I'm accomplishing something. 

So here's my plan: I want to go back up and wrap up my undergrad. I'm 27 now and much more focused than I was at 20 when I switched. From there, I would get my Masters in Psychology or Neuropsychology. With all this involved, it would take three years and part of one semester to tie up. My earning potential would be about 15-20% higher with this route, but would set me back a lot financially over the next 3.5 years before I start working full time.

The advice I'm seeking is:

1) For those who have gone back as mature students, how did you pay for it?

2) How long did it take you to offset your student expenses?

3) Was it worth it from a general well-being perspective?",01May2019,2

I have had only two encounters with this woman and both were extremely negative. The first time she came to our apartment she got so wasted that she spent an hour on the toilet with her pants down, vomiting into the tub. 

The second time she demanded my husband aquire an Air BnB for Christmas. She was racist and hateful the whole time. I came into the experience open and honest. In confidence I told her I had been kidnapped and later that day in front of children she brought it up and goaded me into a panic attack. She went hard for me. I tried to get up and leave the conversation, but she followed me and berated me until I was crumpled in a pile of tears in the back of the cabin. 

I also found out later that she took the liberty of going through my belongings while husband and I were out getting supplies for the cabin. 

I could let all of this go, except my heart has a younger sister still within the rights of this beast as far as custody is concerned. 

This woman tells my baby sister in law that she will kill herself (the mom) and it will be Sissy's fault (my underage sister in law).  

These things are slowly but surely coming out.

434,"I am struggling. This is a bit lengthy, so please give me your patience...

Where do I even begin...okay. I used to play in a band with 6 of my friends. They're all dead now. Last one died several months ago. My Mom died when I was 8 years old. Since that point in time, in total, 41 friends and family members have died. Not acquaintances, not mutual friends, people I cared about.


Throw on the fact that I've been battling depression and anxiety disorders for years, and losing, with and without medication, and the feeling of grief tends to amplify. For me anyway.

So, I am trying to fight my own internal battle when my girlfriend and I are drifting apart. I believe it began when we pretty much stopped having sex. Initially it was because she was insecure. So I was like okay, I'm not gonna even try to initiate if that's the case. I waited. And I waited. And I waited. Anytime I brought it up she accosted me. Furthermore, anytime I tried to talk to her about my struggle, that I was trying to fight alone, she would end up criticizing me. So I stopped trying to talk to her about my grief. Stopped trying to talk to her about the absence of sex or intimacy of any fashion. Why try riding a bike when it has a flat tire? You won't get anywhere.

I was low. I pushed things away because it was too painful for me to deal with. I became numb. I was desperate to feel something. Anything. So when this girl texted me out of the blue, I replied. Initially, I was just talking to her about how I felt about my friends, she knew a few of them. Then, she started getting flirty, and while I didn't reciprocate, I didn't shut it down either. I had no intentions to do anything with this person. They don't even live in the same town. We texted back and forth for 2 days. Girlfriend found out and flew off the handle, with me trying to explain it had nothing to do with her. Also, despite her doing something far worse earlier in our relationship, which I forgave. That is not to minimize my mistake. I fucked up. And I own that.

She didn't talk to me for a week after that. Then, we started talking. She said she could maybe forgive me, and that she was open to trying things out. I told her that I didn't want to rush back into anything, and that since she isolated me for a week, making me believe there was no chance, I tried to move on emotionally. So I asked for my time to decide whether or not it was healthy for me to try again. She gave me 2 days before deciding that I was taking too long and clearly didn't want to be with her--which, to be honest, could not be further from the truth.

So, now, here we are. And here I am, barely holding on to my fucking sanity. Trying my best. My best isn't good enough, because I don't feel like being alive.

I own my mistakes to their fullest extent. But what happened js something that is extremely out of character for me. Something that I wouldn't have done if I were in a better place. But I wasn't. I understand that I fucked up. She has every right to be upset. But she is not innocent. I made one mistake. A mistake that she has already made, and I forgave. I guess I thought that 6 years of time, effort, patience, and passion wasn't worth throwing away for a singular mistake.

And to be clear, I'm not trying to convince her of anything. I didn't expect her to forgive me. If she were to, that would obviously take time and work on both ends. Nonetheless, it seems like it's gone past this point.

I know it seems like I'm just bitching, and I probably am. But this is hitting me so hard because it's hitting me all at once. The grief I never dealt with properly. The mental illness I haven't been able to cope with. The destruction of my relationship by my own, unintentional, hand. 

Oh, one more thing. I'm still living with this person. 

Hell is real. It's a place in your mind.

I’ve been talking to this girl for a while and eventually we’d told each other we like one another and I was stoked, we’ve gone on a couple dates and it’s been very easy to talk and I’ve had fun and I think she has too, the dates aren’t the problem. In between these and at the moment I’ve been having extreme anxiety about whether or not she actually likes me or she just feels bad, the thing is I don’t really believe that. A lot of our communication happens over text and she seems engaged and stuff so that’s cool, but I still have this lingering feeling of doubt in my mind and I’m not sure why. A lot of people have also mentioned me overthinking other things and I think that could be happening here.

I’ve had one experience dating before and it was pretty rough on me, there was a lot of pressure by peers because it was a smaller environment than I’m in now and I didn’t actually like the person. There was a bit of pressure by the girl too to be cool or act all couple and it was very unnatural and wrong. I eventually broke up with that girl and I was bullied a while for it.

439,"I’m 17. My school does an internship program at the end of senior year for students to get a head start before college. I decided to do one at a local elementary school.

I was there for two weeks, and had a wonderful time. My supervisor was always kind and encouraging, I felt as though I always did as she asked without question and that we had a good relationship.

On Friday, she even said she’d see me on Monday as I left for my class. However, that afternoon she called my vice principal and he worded the call as a “stream of consciousness” from her. What she told him was this:

1) I questioned her, which I have no recollection of ever doing at all. I followed her instructions without hesitation at all.

2) I was too close to the children. I also believe this is untrue as I never went to lunch/recess with them and only spent time with them when she asked, with the students she asked me to monitor/help.

3) I caused disturbances in the class. Yes, having a 17 year old in a room full of 6 year old children who look up to you like you’re a prophet does get distracting. I discouraged bad behavior such as talking during lessons and hugging me as much as possible and overall thought the class behaved generally well for 19 young children.

4) I gave a student a snack. She had none from home. I’d thought she’d forgotten it, so I bought her one when I got one for myself. When I was in school, we had no rules against sharing food. Apparently that had changed along with the child having some behavioral issues in that area that I wasn’t aware of. This was the only issue she EVER confronted me with and I apologized, saying it wouldn’t happen again, which it didn’t obviously.

5) I was like having another student, and she disliked having to teach me. I’m an intern and 17...I’m not supposed to come in knowing exactly how to teach and control a classroom. I was learning fast, but apparently she didn’t like having to explain any of it to me at all.

My vice principal and I both agreed that this was a strange and sudden occurrence, as she didn’t give any specifics and acted like everything was going great to my face.

I attempted to get some closure my emailing her, asking for some feedback to take from the experience so I can improve for the future (both the vice principal and my guidance counselor looked it over before I sent it) to which I got no response. I’m completely dumbfounded and it’s taken a major blow to my self-esteem.

447,"Hi all, my partner and I were adopted by a stray/feral cat. Until yesterday we lived at a walk -up on a busy street, where we were visited every day by a pretty little calico. On Halloween 2018 we didn’t get any trick-or-treaters and as we chatted on our porch, this girl came strolling up the driveway. She sat looking at us for a while then disappeared. I bought a bag of treats in case she came back... she did a few days later. She wouldn’t let me near her, but she took a few treats and after a while I started keeping food on hand. She started waiting outside the door, hanging out on the mat, or lounging on our porch. When it started to get cold, I built her a shelter out of an Omaha steaks styrofoam shipping box and stashed it under the steps. We were hit by a pretty nasty polar vortex a few months ago and leading up to it, she still came to the porch every night... I was horrified by the thought of her out in the elements, even in the shelter under the stairs, so I built another shelter and rigged it up with a heating pad and started keeping it outside the door so I could plug it in inside the apartment. She stayed there all winter, dashing out when she heard us coming, dashing back as soon as the door to the apartment was shut. When the weather broke we started hanging out outside again and she still was extremely skittish, hissing, hiding, etc. A couple weeks ago we decided we were going to move into a bigger place, so I asked a neighbor to take over feeding her and she said she would. Yesterday, when we were packing the last of our things into the car, I crouched to say goodbye and this cat, who hasn’t let me touch her since I met her six months ago, started rubbing herself on my legs, circling on her tiptoes, and head-butting my outstretched hand. I sobbed.

448,"Hi, Reddit! This is my first post and I’m not really sure how to go about this. It’s sort of long. 

So I’m graduating college this weekend, while part of me is proud I am very down on myself over my grades. I know that a lot of terrible things happened to me which caused a lot of this but I can’t help but feel like a complete failure. 

For some backstory I chose to go to a college that was close to my parents so that I could save money. The first semester was alright, I didn’t do amazing but  I took 18 years and came out with one C and the rest was A’s and B’s. I also joined a sorority and worked two jobs during this time. At the end of the semester my parents hit me with the news that they would be moving 3,000 miles away. I was devastated. I was finally forming friendships that I had been longing for. We had moved from my home state in high school and I had a hard time fitting in, my parents always pulled me out of public school to be homeschooled multiple times throughout my education so I never really had a chance to get close friends. After they moved I was living in a small apartment. It was my first time on my own and I was terrified, I had just turned 18 two months prior. During this time I went to parties with my sorority sisters and drank, unfortunately someone I trusted took advantage of me and I ended up pregnant. I was devastated. I was a  virgin before this and even though I know that doesn’t mean much I grew up in a very religious home so it was hard to let go of what I was taught. I was mad at this “friend” for taking advantage of me when I was not in a coherent state. I ended up miscarrying and he got very mad. He started showing up at my apartment at 2 am banging on my door, calling me names, and got physical a few times. I finally gave myself some credit and filed a restraining order that was granted and have not had contact since. 

I thought I was over all of this and never took the steps to go to therapy and talk it out. After that incident my grades plummeted a few semesters. I would pass but I would get a lot of C’s. I just didn’t feel like I was here. It all felt like a daze. Eventually my parents had to stop paying my rent and told me to drop out of school. This was my junior year. Since then I’ve worked full time to pay rent, tuition, and all other expenses. I’m 100% on my own. I just can’t get it out of my head that I am a failure. I have done better and made A’s in all of my upper division classes and the ones within my major. I’d love to go to graduate school and be successful but I’m just not sure if my bad grades will prevent me from doing that. I guess I’m just looking for advice to see if anyone had rose from a terrible situation for the better... I know I have what it takes to lead a successful life but I don’t want my college gpa to loom over me through the rest of my professional career.",01May2019,2

I genuinely really love my friends, and it breaks my heart that I’m hurting them, but it’s so much easier to isolate myself, and as a result, that is what tends to happen. It doesn’t help that my work is very high stress, and so I basically sleep whenever I’m home. A huge part of the issue is that I make a lot of conflicting plans simply because I hate telling people no, and so I end up having to bail on someone no matter what.

450,"So I am currently studying a two year sports course at college as I thought that I wanted to get a job in that field as a sports coach. However after doing the work experience I realised that this is something that I do not want to do for the rest of my life.

Every day I go to college I find it boring and not exciting at all. I’m doing quite well on the course but it doesn’t fulfil me.  That might be a little hard to understand. Okay to put it into perspective imagine if you find a task easy but you feel no drive to do it would you still want to continue the task?

Over the Easter break that’s when I was having a serious think about what I wanted to do with my life after the course. I then tried out a few different ideas but the one that stuck with me was rapping. I showed some of my raps to friends and family and they all said that I am very good and that you could really do something with this.

So fast forward one month later I am back at college and feeling that frustrated, this is a waste of my time feeling. Over the Easter break all I was doing was writing raps. Now that I’m back at college I haven’t been putting as much time into rapping as I would have liked.

My main problem is I have found something that I am really passionate about. I am nearly halfway through a two year course that I am not passionate about. I want to drop out at the end of the first year to pursue my passion. However I don’t know what the backlash will be from my family as they all think that I like studying and that I want to do this course. Which is not how I feel.

I feel like if I left I would be able to put a lot more time into writing raps which is my passion. I know I’m halfway through and some people think I might as well just finish it, but I know that it’s going to be another frustrating unhappy year for me. I don’t want to waste another year if my life in college to be honest.

My plan is to finish this year then not go back so not enrol onto the second year. The main issue is my family as I know it won’t be what they will want to hear. But at the end of the day sometimes you’ve got to do what makes you happy and I know that if I left at the end of this year I would be happy as I know that I don’t want a job in the sports field.

I don’t want to be someone that is studying just for the sake of studying as that’s what their family wants them to do not the actual person themselves. College doesn’t excite me it’s not a challenge to me the information comes into my head then goes out by the next day. 

I believe that if I drop out I will see in my family who really has my back through the bad times not just when everything is going well and if they will still support me. (I’m not just dropping out for that reason by the way) 

TL;DR - I’m currently studying a sports course I want to drop out to pursue my passion of rapping. I know I will get a lot of stick from my family and not sure of what they’re reaction will be. But deep down I know I’m  that this will give me happiness within and peace of mind.",01May2019,2

He even meows at her when she's on the phone with me and I'm the only person he does that to. He's my brother's cat but he's way more attached to me.

He's still eating and he's limping but it's hard to tell if he's suffering from just limping or if he's suffering a lot.

I don't think he's got more than a week and I'm supposed to visit on Sunday but I'm not sure if he'll be alive then. I'd feel horrible if he died with me there and I'd have to call my mom while she's working.

I think it'd be best to put him to sleep but I asked my mom to video call me when she can so I can get a current look at him since she lives 1.5 hours away.

When he didn't eat for a day my mom got worried and took him to the vet where they gave him fluids and steroids. I think it's time for him to go, but... He's declining... How much longer does he have or would be putting him to sleep be the best option?

Then just one day she stopped talking to me. I didn’t think any of it. Then I get a text on a Sunday morning at like 2am. She tells me she’s sorry she has been distant but she doesn’t want to lead me on and doesn’t wanna ruin our friendship. (One thing I should I mention is that I thought we were friends the whole time and I was just being nice like how I treat all my friends, and I guess she thought I was coming on to her?)

I am flawed in all of my aspects and I have no friends. I have never had a girlfriend before not even been so much as crushed on. I am 16, short(5'6) I am very ugly, stupid, annoying, weak, rude, gross, and many other bad things. I've been told many times that I have a small penis or that I have small dick energy which doesn't feel good to hear. People of all walks of life without knowing each other or anything all consistently tell me the same thing about all of my various flaws and go out of their way to show their resentment toward me. What may be another person's small mistake is my fatal mistake whenever I make any kind of mistake that a normal human would make. I am a hideous nuisance and a terror to the world. I am not human. I have been out of school all of my 10th grade year and failing ultimately because of my social issues and not doing well around other people. It all makes sense since again people go out of their way to sabotage me and show their resentment toward me. I know none of you guys are even going to bother actually reading this. Which one of these flaws stands out about me most? Do I have small dick energy?

469,"Hi Reddit, 

Post may be long but I'm trying to do justice to the magnitude of the situation. 

I've known a very, very close friend of mine for over half a decade now. He has had it extremely rough. Very verbally and physically abusive childhood/ household. He has confided in me quite literally everything that has come across his mind for his entire teenage life. If he couldn't bear something, he'd tell me. If he was confused on how to do something, he'd tell me. I put aside everything in my life to listen to him because he had no one else. All of the people he has ever considered friends don't truly care for his well-being, so no matter how busy I was, I always made time for him. Things have mellowed out between us, I think, in this last year. He still comes to me whenever he needs anything, but our interests don't overlap at all, and, since he's become more awkward around EVERYONE, he has become more awkward around me as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to this week. We went to see Endgame together (with one other friend, someone close to me but not so much to him), and he's okay with the movie. He is incredibly awkward the entire time. After the movie, he looks at his phone and starts messaging some online friends on Discord, where me and my mate are literally right beside him. This is all permissible, I suppose; I can attribute it to social anxiety. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later that night, we chat for a bit (on Discord) and he starts mocking the way I speak/ my mannerisms. He says I'm now who he remembers, and deletes me. I can't understand what he's referencing, since I've made a tremendous effort my entire life to be consistent about one thing, making people happy. I felt my character was insulted, I felt it was horrendously rude of him to pull the plug on our friendship and I was also saddened. He's not a man yet. He's all alone in the world, and can't speak to anyone. I spend the entire day out of it, a crying, fumbling mess. 

&amp;#x200B;

He adds me back a couple of days later, and boils deleting me down to a lack of sleep and wanting to see how much of his shit I could possibly put up with. It's a horrible reason, but he's not quite in a state where I can judge him. He's been immensely suicidal for the last month, more so than he ever has been. He finds something comforting in it (that he can't describe, and I'm not sure I want to). He boils deleting me down to me being apart of his wasted high-school, where he made no friends, became socially anxious, and missed out on all sorts of social events. He loosely attributes it (and he admits the irrationality in this) to me, and thinks cutting ties with me is what he needs. He is ready to buy a noose and end himself, and it could happen at any moment. He doesn't think there's anything to live for. He doesn't want to father a child since his family history is (very) plagued with severe genetic abnormalities. He's okay dying a virgin and never having been in a relationship, he just wants to end it. He doesn't want to see the world, try different things, or anything. I couldn't even get him to listen; he abruptly cut me off and said he's scoured reddit to no end with this. I wanted to tell him that he just needed to try everything once, but he's a boy at his wits end. He REALLY, REALLY needs to see a therapist. There's nothing I think I can say. He is in the worst mindset he's ever been in. Even if it's just for an authority figure to say what I'm saying, he needs an appointment. He has 2 more months of school left (where he'll be free to see a therapist or whoever else), but he's very, very likely to off himself before then. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't care that he doesn't want to be friends anymore. It's irrational as hell that he wants to drop me to cut ties with his past, but if he feels that's what he needs, I'm okay with letting that happen. But he doesn't need that now. He needs someone to confide in until he has new friends who can do that for him. He needs me right now. I am very, very uncomfortable leaving him alone in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I to do? He doesn't want to listen to anything I have to say about what the world has to offer. He needs to see a therapist, but he also needs to graduate (but he's too unstable to even guarantee he'll live till then (2 months from now)). He is okay with seeing one. The rational thing is to just hire a local one for a weekend when he's free (I don't know the rates but I can probably afford a few sessions), after asking him, but I need to make sure he doesn't commit suicide or self-harm before then. How do I make sense of this whole ordeal? What can I say to him in the moment that he won't shoot down? I'm lost for the first time in my life.",01May2019,2

I care a lot about and am very interested in academia, and plan to attend law school after graduating from undergrad. Hey depression and anxiety has prevented me from performing well in school. Many days I cannot convince myself to get out of bed to go to class, do homework/study, and often times shower.

472," 

My dad separated from my mom when i was 6 year old. Since he left he sends money h so i could use it for whatever i want ex: to buy cloths, go to the gym , for my braces etc.

When i did 18 year old my mom said my dad to stop giving her money directly and asked him to send it directly to me so i could use it as i want.(I'm19 now)

The problem is that he sometimes doesn't send money each month skipping months sometimes until he sends again.

I don't talk to him, don't have a close relationship ( he went to another country since im 6) so i'm embarrased to ask for help because i never had a solid talk on a phone experience habit with my dad and his wife and i only see them maybe 2 times a year.

Now that you have some context, since i'm 18 old my mom askes me to help at home so i learn about the responsability of having to pay your bills when i leave their place one day. I give her the money my dad sends to me but when i don't have money to give her she gets mad and the enviroment gets heavy at home.

To help i start working with my stepfather boat oficine from 4pm to 8pm and he gives me 250 euros for month and i give 150 to my mom so i get 100 euros for my braces,gym and cloths and food. I make sure i always have for gym and my braces. These two are fundamental for my mental and physical health.

In the start of april i saw a last call mechanic car course, one of the best mechanic school of the country where they pay for my bus ticket-pass ( that takes me to everywhere for 40 euros) and mylunch (refectory) and gives me work after i finish the course.

I talk to my step to say i'm interested in the course and i talk to him about the content of the course and he says it would be good for the oficine if i learn maybe i could even get a raise if i got real good at it because while i was working with him i was just an apprentice i know just the basic.

My mom also is happy that i found something to study because i didnt went to uni this year ( i decided to make a gap year to acquire skills and experience in the real world) and because also i couldnt afford to go to uni now and don't know what i want to study in uni now.

I stoped working with my step father because my course starts at 9 am and finish at 5 pm and my bus and boat take 1 hour and almost half to get to work. So it would be impossible to do 4 hours each day. I tried to convince him to let me work at saturday by the morning because i want to spend the rest of the day and sunday with my girlfriend and friends but they think it isn't enough working time for the money he's giving me.

Now i'm waiting for 2 company responses to see if i start working part time next week so i could work and study at same time if not i will have to quit school either that or i'm afraid they will kick me out of home.

Thank you for reading!

TL.DR I'm i spoiled by wanting to have a better salary then my stepfather gave me 250 ( 150 for my mom and 100 for me) and for thinking my mom should not asking me for money while i study to start my life? Am i wrong and i should help at home? What do you think reddit?",01May2019,1

I feel a little bit better and decide I’ll just wait til Monday and contact my bank and let them know of the situation, Monday comes around and the bank tells me I have to come in to file the claim which is not great because I work 12 hour shifts and can’t do so until I’m off on Thursday. I check my Ebay account today and see that the seller still hasn’t cancel, i do a little bit more searching then realize the shipping address is MY HOME ADDRESS, i contact the seller and he tells me he can’t cancel because there’s a hold on my account through PayPal. my PayPal account is temporarily limited even though i’ve completed the steps to get the limited status off Sunday.

477,"I'm going to try to keep this as short as possible because if I wanted to, I could write a short story on this saga so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I am a student from Louisiana that applied to both Tulane and LSU. I got into both universities, and my family and I ultimately decided that I should attend LSU because it is cheaper and closer to home. So, a couple of months ago I paid my enrollment deposit at a campus visit. End of story, right? Wrong. I never formally declined the enrollment offer to Tulane, and I received an email from them in March with an application for the Tulane Legislative scholarship, which is a full-tuition scholarship that is offered by a state legislator in Louisiana. I filled it out and submitted not thinking anything of it, and lo and behold, a day before the Tulane enrollment deposit is due, I find out that I have a chance to receive the Legislative Scholarship. Basically, my legislator offered the scholarship to a student in his district whose parents said he was admitted to Tulane, when in reality he was waitlisted. This made the legislator very mad and he straight up told me if he could he would give it to me outright, but the waitlisted kid has the first right because he is in the legislator's district. So, if this student doesn't get in, I receive the scholarship. Now, I have until 11 pm tonight to pay a $750 enrollment deposit to Tulane, knowing I may well not receive the scholarship in the end. Not to mention we would most likely have to borrow money from family members/others because my family doesn't have $750 lying around.

480,"Hey there Reddit, I’m a 20yr old female looking for advice on what I should do in this situation that I suppose I inadvertently got myself into.

&gt;Here’s some background&lt;: My coworker Mike [24M] and I recently started seeing each other/hooking up. We go on dates after work and I’m starting to really like him. We’ve been *trying* to keep our fling on the down low by keeping it professional at work and not telling anybody. However, a friend who used to work with us saw us hold hands on a date, and I guess asked about it to one of our other coworkers (because afterwards she asked him about it). 

&gt;present situation&lt;: A few of us including Mike were invited to another girl from work’s birthday dinner. Since it was her 21st birthday, she wanted to have a drink. So everybody except for me and another girl had something alcoholic because we both aren’t old enough to drink yet.

So I’m sitting between Mike and the birthday girl, and across from me are Tabitha and Sarah, who I guess Mike and them have been having beef especially with Tabitha because he doesn’t want to be friends with them anymore. Regardless he told me he wouldn’t try to start any arguments.

So Tabitha and Sara are about one drink in when they started giggling and making snide comments about my age; things like “Are you even 18 yet?” And mumbling that I was still a child when they noticed that I left the vegetables I got on the plate. Mike got a little bit snappy with them back but we both ultimately bit our tongue for the most part. I could tell that he was fuming about their degrading comments towards me; especially considering I wasn’t the *only one* who was below 21.

I played it off like it was a joke but it honestly did hurt me a bit. After all, I didn’t do anything to them and was always friendly while we worked... Why all this sudden hostility? (I even offered them a hit off my dab pen!) I paid for my meal, and the group eventually left Mike and I behind to go out drinking.

I can’t stop thinking about last night and how I don’t know if I can work with them the same again. I was baffled as to why they’d be so rude, but my best guess is that they found out that Mike and I are going out and since they don’t really like him anymore, that I’m guilty by association.

The advice I wanna ask is what’s my best course of action? I’m naturally non-confrontational, and everybody told me to let it go but don’t let them walk all over me either. I’m thinking of maybe changing my schedule to avoid either of them at worst, or keep pretending nothing happened.

I’m still in the dance program and next year if I stay I still will be and I’m scared that if I leave then I’ll regret it because of this one program. But I also feel like I’ll regret not leaving as I’m feeling quite lost in this school as it’s very different compared to my old schools. I’m not sure if I should leave the dance program and my 4 friends 😂 to go to this other school to do sports which I miss and the vibe or stay at this school for my last year 😕,01May2019,2
482,"I have been debating on whether to put this on here... but...

&amp;#x200B;

So my mother and sister get into a lot of fights. My mother has mental problems she can not control, but my sister is not. They would usually fight about how messy the house his. My mom would know it would be my sister because I am always in my room and my father would be asleep for night shift. My mom would usually have trouble understanding things and  mostly forget to do things, and its getting worse. My sister doesn't seem to understand that and usually acts selfish. For example, she complains that I sit in my room all day the one time I refuse to take here to the store to get food for dinner (I drive her to pick her up from clubs and such all the time). Is there anything I can do to help my sister understand my mom's problem and help my family be happy, or is it too late? My sister is almost 18 if anyone is wondering.",01May2019,2
483,"Here is my situation if anyone cares or wants to help a brother out. I threw a TL;DR at the bottom too.

I am a junior in high school and there’s this girl in one of my elective classes that I have grown a pretty strong crush on. I am generally well known at school so we already happen to follow each other on social media but hadn’t really ever talked. I don’t usually have any issues approaching people and talking to them but I’m in a tougher situation this time. In this class, talking is strictly prohibited. We also sit across the class from each other and there is no plan for seat changing. I have coincidentally made a new friend that knows her but not well enough to set anything up. But I have found out that we like a lot of the same things and are very similar people causing me to like her even more. She doesn’t seem to have any interest in me currently but I haven’t really gotten a chance to talk to her at all. I am kinda stuck and I’ll take all the advice I can get, thanks guys!

I’ve already googled basic do’s and don’ts but still have some questions.

1) How early should I arrive? 


2) How do I find out who is opening? 


3) Are there breaks over the course of the concert for things like bathroom and drinks? Or


4) If I desperately have to use the bathroom, or want to get a drink, how easy is it to leave and get back in without bothering everyone around me?

486,"Ive been friends with this girl for a year now, i started liking her around the time i became friends with her ( she was kind of my gay awakening). I confessed last summer and she liked me too, though at the time she was in a relationship with two different people, then she broke up with them, and a lot of things happened after that. She never treated me badly, at the contrary i do believe she cared about me, maybe still does, but it still doesnt recount for the fact that she hurt me multiple times. Maybe i became a little tiny bit obssessed with her, but thats how it always had been whenever i started liking someone. I asked her out once and she said she wasnt ready and i happily accepted that, all i wanted and want is for her to be happy. A couple of months later she started going out with this dude in her new school, which was cool cuz at that point i knew we were never going to be together, and i didnt wnat to come out as clingy so i just got along with everything she did and said. The one time i came out as a little bit obssessed when she rejected my offers to hang out multiple times was ""to calm down"" and that ""it s no big deal"" and id just apologized and i still hate every inch of myself for it. She gets pissed at me for the smallest of reasons and never texts if not very very rarely, not that she doenst want to, she just has this policy where she refuses to send a msg first, and then when i send a text she responds very poorly, and whenever i ask to hang out she refuses because of her mom ( she came out to her last year and being in the homophobic community we live in it was not the best decision she had done) and i understood that. I never asked anything from her, if not very rarely and it would be small requests like "" will you listen to me rant but u can tell me to stop whenever u want"" just for lack of anything to do and to have a conversation where neither of us felt awkward. But the thing is, im alrdy not fine, and she kind of makes it worse, like sure she makes me soo fucking happy sometimes, but i rarely see her or talk to her and there was even a point where i was sure i was completely over her, then she just popped out of nowhere in my brain again, and she never lets me leave, everytime she does a littlw something that makes me stay, and after the day she said she actualy cared about me i dont think i ever could leave, but its killing me, im so tired. I tried to get over her by getting closed to this mutual friend of ours, who s actually her ex but  who is an amazing person, but im pretty sure she never saw me that way, and i dont know what to do anymore. Just a couple of days earlier i was completely over her then i started dreaming about her again and i keep rememebring her smile and her scent and how goos it felt to hold her and it kinda kills me inside and wow im worried im getting a panic attack.

487,"So this is what feels like an extremely long and detailed story but it might only feel that way to me because i tend to over think everything. I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. Hoping to get a straight forward, clear answer. 

I was in a relationship with this girl for about a year, she cheated on me 3 days before our anniversary. Had no problem telling me about it, we’d contact each other for about a month or so meanwhile she was still seeing the girl she cheated on me with and eventually we cut off all connection with each other. Fast forward almost a year and a half later, they’re married and she’s been contacting me because she’s fallen into some legal trouble. Now, I’m only a student. I won’t graduate law school for another few years and she knows this. My ex ran into trouble with the law in August last year. At the time, I referred her to a good criminal defense lawyer yet she’s just texted me 5 months later asking me for advice about something else? 

I’m not really sure how to write this all down but I want to know why? Unfortunately, I’m still in love with her. I think I always will be and it took me awhile to admit that to even myself. The end of the relationship and everything that came after it was extremely painful and traumatic for me, especially because she completely cut me off, never once asked if I was okay and actually ended up marrying the girl she fucked while still with me. I want to know if her contacting me is an attempt to speak to me just because or if she’s just genuinely asking for legal advice and nothing else? 

This might just be me wanting to hear that yes, she does still love me and yes she does miss me. I know deep down she never really cared because you wouldn’t treat someone the way she treated me if you love them. I just need something to clear my head because it feels like every time I tell myself I’m finally okay with it all, I’m over her, she pops back into my life. 

Side note: the girl she’s with now also has spoken to me back in August. She was being really friendly, thanking me for helping my ex but I could tell it wasn’t genuine (she admitted she had a lot of resentment towards me which I’m not sure why) and I noticed she slowly started dressing and talking like me. I cut off all connection with her and my ex because the whole situation just didn’t sit well with me. It gave me a really bad gut feeling, almost felt nauseous every time I spoke to them and not to mention the anxiety I get every time I talk to me ex. 

I’m not one to let myself be used like a doormat and I have never let an ex partner or friend use me but like I said, I am still in love with her and I want to make sure she’s okay. Stupid of me, I know. 

Basically, I just want to know why they continuously reach out to me every once in a while. My ex hasn’t mentioned much about anything else except legal issues she’s going through. I’m not a lawyer, she has her own so? Why?",01May2019,4

489,"  

Now, I’m writing this post to try to explain how I am feeling and ask what y’ all think the best thing I can do to help myself. I have been pretty unsure about what I want in life recently(past 4-5 years). I am currently in college studying to get a CS degree. To be more specific, I am almost at the halfway point. I find CS interesting and became a research assistant in an AI research group at my university. Which has been one of the coolest and hardest things to happen to me. This puts me on a promising path to become an AI researcher, which is a career that I am seriously thinking of pursuing. Now herein lies my inner battle, I’ve struggled some with depression and anxiety and as I have worked to become happier one thing has stayed with me is a kind of existential dread. This feeling like an anxiety has been a big motivator for how I view myself and others in the world and how what I believe in. Recently as I have been thinking about what I want to do with my life, two big things come to mind: What do I know I want to have done before I die and what can do to make the world a better place for my children before I am dead. When I look at big tech companies today that my peers are working really hard to get a job at, I don’t see them doing good things(Apple’s ads about security, facebook and google’s harvesting of data to name a few) and I do not see them living up to the same moral code that I hold myself to. It's hard for me to picture myself working at a place like that and not resent myself in some capacity. I am thinking of doing the peace corps when I graduate to give myself some time to think about what I want and to also do some good(I heard that they could use people with CS degrees) but that would only be temporary and after I would need to get a job to support myself. There are a lot of things I want to do and places I want to visit around the world, and I don’t really see myself being content with myself in an office while I am still young and curious. I would like to live abroad for a little while and become fluent in other languages and learn about other cultures. So, I guess I am asking y’all what you think? There is a lot on my mind and Its difficult for me to sort it all out. I’d appreciate any thoughts tbh",01May2019,3

Another time on the way to class, a random student who I don't know from the year below me said ""Do you ever smile?"". Even yesterday, as I waited for class, a classmate said ""What's wrong with you today?""

I've been literally pulled out of classes by teachers to ask if everything is okay, one even asked me if I need to go home. The most extreme case was at karate, where a group of people came over to me to ask me very specifically if I had depression. Another girl (not apart of the group) extended the question to ""Have you seen a therapist before? Maybe you have a chemical imbalance?"" followed by another girl (who was really nice) asking if I wanted to go for a walk outside with her to clear my head. I sat through all this like ""Is this a prank? Is this a joke? Is there cameras recording this for some YouTube channel? Why are these strangers asking me all these weird and specific questions?""

I have seen a therapist (that I didn't want to see)

499,"So to make a hectic long story and short and simple, I'm 20 years old right now and have been couch surfing up until last year when I landed a bedroom at my best friend's mom's house for absolutely zero cost to me. I've gotten news that they will be moving out soon in four, finish months and I won't have anywhere to go once they leave, because family problems, pride, and other stubborn yet valid reasons.

On the upside after busting my butt looking for jobs I finally landed some work at McDonald's starting next Monday. It isn't much, but my other friend who as recently kicked out, said he, a mutual friend of ours, and my girlfriend should totally get an apartment soon and it all works out with how things are gonna end up within a few months time. Even if it won't be those specific people, I'm determined to save up as much as my paychecks as possible to have enough to lease and own my first apartment when my best friend's mom moves out.

The thing is, I'm set on getting my name primarily on the lease and I'd like to have enough to afford the first month cause I have other people in mind that'd be my roommate in just a few days. The thing is, I'd like to save enough to where I won't be overwhelmed if let's say I were to only be the only one getting the apartment at the time.

I don't know about my credit but I'm already about $500 in debt, so I don't think it's tremendously bad, or good. Probably still just nuetral or null. Anyway, I'm looking for 2 bedroom apartments I don't care what part of town so long as we won't be exceeding $700 a month. What's the process of owning an apartment like?

I try to be subtle about all this because I don't want him to think I'm paranoid or weird, but I can't help myself. I just think about how easy it would be for someone to videotape us or me alone, and then blackmail me or just release it to the Internet. I think about how my life would be ruined and how anyone who knows me can just Google my name and see that. I think about how it would follow me forever and I wouldn't be able to get a job because they'd find it right away.

I also get nervous whenever I'm in public and i know security cameras are on me. I worry that I'll do something embarrassing and then it'll end up on the web for everyone to see.

506,"Some background: I had a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction and need monitoring of my ovaries 2 to 4 times a year, which is done by vaginal ultrasound. 

I moved in January so I thought it was smart to find an additional gynecologist closer to home to do the monitoring. I found one in a hospital about 20 minutes away so I was pretty happy with myself.

So I went there yesterday to meet, go over my file, do an ultrasound and a PAPsmear. My first impression was good, I felt like he knew what he was talking about regarding my situation. He took the PAP and the ultrasound and all looked fine. I did notice he was “overly friendly” but I thought he was just like that. Some people are *just like that*. So he said all was well and I could sit up. I was only wearing a small top at this point, no cover on me or anything. He asked me if he could see my breasts because he was a breast surgeon as well and he was interested in how they looked. Since I’m so used to doctors looking at them I was fine with it and lifted my top. He started feeling them, without asking. Said he was checking for a certain kind of lumps. He then goes on to stroke my nipples, only his index fingers and he started asking about the method used to reconstruct them. I was fine up to then, because I’m kind of used to this way of “professional touching” if you will. 

*However*, he then goes down my sides with both his hands while taking a deep breath and let his hands rest on my thighs, saying “you need these exams at least twice a year. Come to me for them.” And he winks. 

The thing is I am on edge on filing a complaint. The whole “vibe” felt *so* wrong but on the other hand I’m thinking this is just what happens. People cross lines. Not always with bad intentions, and I don’t want this to become this big ordeal that can’t be taken back.

509,"To make a long story short, my Dad got married to a second wife, my Mom divorced him and had him sign a contract. 

Problem is my dad and my mom have always been extremely financially irresponsible and I often have to pick up their tab. My dad is supposed to pay my mom $150 a week. He does this, but at the end of the month there is a $690 insurance bill not paid, guess who pays it? Yours truly. 

My dad makes about $800 a week (if overtime) and pays all the bills. 

My mom gets $700 a month for her disability. 

My dad is usually short $600 because he has a second wife and life to attend to, my Mom somehow manages to spend over $1500 a month on clothes, food, subscriptions etc.  After looking at her credit card history about 1/4 of her bills come from necessities (groceries, gas, etc.). 

I tried helping her manage her credit card debt in February (total debt was $3K) but she insisted she was paying her bill and wouldn't use her credit card. I checked her credit card and now the running total is $5200. 

This is the most recent disappointing discovery, and it is similar to all the other ones. 

My intention is to tell my Mom to give me her credit cards, set a payment plan, and then AGAIN cover costs for necessities. 

I could go on and on about how this isn't the first time. I could write an entire saga of how I now have to figure out how to balance their books. How one or the other has mad some stupid error. How I have to fix their problems and pay their bills despite have my own student loan (Could have paid it off by now)

I'm so tired of being the fall guy. I want to so badly go out for a pack of cigarettes. 

But I know if I do this my mom will garnish wages from my dad, my dad will drop bills that he pays for my mom and family, and EVERYONE will be worse off.

So, for example I was talking to my friend about how delicious these cheese puffs were and blah blah.  The next day he sits with me and I see in his bag the cheese puffs (very specific type I was talk to nf about. This was the same type). Then I meantioned how crows are my favorite bird, and the next day, he has a crow pin on his bookbag.

511,"I'm a part time student pursuing my masters.

The professor for one of the classes that I am taking this semester is really bad. He's a nice person, but absolutely terrible teacher. Every class, he just reads the slides. It's a computer science class and we learn technical things and he does not offer any examples. In the beginning of the semester, he told us he doesn't provide the slides as a PowerPoint because he doesn't want people to change them. Come to find out, they're slides from a different professor at a different university. The material for the last exam came from a textbook that is not on the syllabus. And on the last exam, he gave us questions that we had never practiced. The only materials he has ever assigned us were those slides that do not go into detail at all (as is typical of PowerPoint slides).

The final exam was scheduled for a Tuesday. The Wednesday before, he posts the topics that will be on it. He also assigns us homework that week that is due Monday (the day before the test). He tells us he wants to grade it by Tuesday so we can prepare right before the test. We also have a final project due that Sunday before the test.

Most of the class found this ridiculous so he moved the test date to the week after and informed us at 10 pm on Monday night before the exam.

I would really like to complain to the Dean or someone. I spent $2500 out of pocket for a subpar class that I could have taken for a better experience at a community College. This professor does not deserved to be hired. Most of the people in my class are international students so I know they won't say anything. But I have privately talked to some of the students and they all agree that he is a bad professor. If I wanted to learn the subject by using Google, why did I pay that absurd amount of money?

I am expected to put in time and effort into this class when it is clear the professor wants to not even do the bare minimum to teach the course. 

I've never done this before, so I was wondering if it is appropriate to bring this to the attention of the dean of the college? I have proof that he has taken slides from another professor. I have proof that he did not list the textbook in the syllabus. I have proof that he has not provided sufficient material for anyone to actually learn anything.

When I hang with them (and this appens at least once a week, since we are all part of a kind of a volunteering community) I feel ""out of place"". I don' t want to sound arrogant, but I feel like I outsmarted them. When we are together, I always think that I would have felt bettere staying home alone.
Don' t get me wrong: I often have a good time with them, and they' re amazing people, really. They' re kind, gentle, funny ecc.
But the problem is that I don' t feel like I could talk to them about my Personal problems, my thoughts, my deepest dreams. I feel like it would be embarassing, i feel like (and I know it' s almost true) they wouldn' t understand.
Everytime we meet, they always talk about TV series, celebrities, or other subjects that I really don' t think are THAT important, or I don' t care about.
I don' t know how to behave. I see four of them everyday at school. If I cut off with them, it would be embarassing. I don' t think I would neither be able to make new friends: I don' t really find anyone in my class that could want to be my friend, and I wouldn' t know how to make new friends outside my school.
I get very depressed about that: I feel like everyone is able to have friends, and have a beautiful life, while I overthink a lot, and can' t relate to quite everyone due to the fact that I don' t find them ""enough smart"".

525,"So, last year I (20M) got into my first ever relationship. And while I was really into her, one of my biggest fears and insecurities was that she wasn't as into me. (Which basically turned out to be true given the way we broke up but that's beside the point). I was in a lot of pain when it ended, but eventually I dusted myself off and got back on the horse. Since our break up I've been on a few dates, even had my first casual hook up (which was awful btw but hey, I tried it). I was kind of bouncing back and forth between wanting to be back in a relationship and enjoying being single. 

The few dates I had been on were fun but tbh there was never a significant connection. I kinda assumed whatever relationship I'd find from here on out wouldn't have quite the same spark for me as the last one, because the last one was my very first. And it's hard to find something as exciting as it was the first time. That being said I was still optimistic, I was talking to cool girls and still living that swipe life on Tinder and Bumble.

Then one day, a few weeks ago, I match with this amazing girl. Right of the bat we started bouncing jokes off of each other's. We have very similar senses of humor. We both like musical theater. We both love sitcoms, and we like a lot of the same movies. Honestly we have a lot in common, like a spooky amount in common.

We went out and I had a really good time, we both did. We talked for hours, and we were getting along really well. When time came for the first kiss, we both really enjoyed it. Which I'm glad she did cuz she informed me it was her first kiss. It was her first date.

After that we continued texting and went out again the next week. On that date things got a bit more physical.. we went to a movie and things escalated. (I'll spare the details).

After that date we continued texting, and she was talking like she's really into me. And my fear is that I'm not quite as into her. 

Then it hit me, I'm basically in the same position my ex was in. This girl has had no experience in dating or relationships, so now that she's with me it seems like she's really into the whole thing.

I feel really guilty that I'm not as into her, and I'm really scared that the way I feel is going to hurt her. That's the last thing in the world I want, she's a really sweet girl. But, the feelings just aren't there. At least not yet.

I wish I could just snap my fingers and be head over heels because honestly, on paper, this girl is perfect for me. But for some reason I can't feel the spark she feels. 

I was thinking it might be because I'm afraid of getting hurt again. When my last relationship ended I spiralled off into a deppression, and maybe that's why I never felt any real spark with other first dates, and that's why I might be keeping her at arms length. So I guess the part I need advice is, how do I take down these walls? How do I stop letting the past determine so much of my life?",01May2019,0

528,"Greetings Reddit, 

So, I met a person of the opposite sex while playing an online MMO and we have been talking via online messaging for the best part of a year now.  We get on really well and recently this person has indicated that they are attracted to me and wish to start a relationship.  The feeling is mutual from my end. However, several things have made me suspicious of this person true motivations:  First, they are often reluctant to share personal information but other times are very open about tragic events from their past including past relationships. Most of their social media accounts are almost empty and have gone unused for several months. They often disappear for several days at a time with no communication. Finally, within the last month, several events have happened in their life that, at least in my mind, strain credibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am afraid that this person might not be who they claim to be and that I am being scammed. I am also afraid that I might risk a potential relationship by confronting this person directly.  I acknowledge that subterfuge and deception is probably not the best way to start a relationship, but I need to be sure I can trust this person.

531,"Im not sure where to post this but basically, we know we’re going to eventually have to put our dog Zipper down. She’s 14 years old and so eventually the time will come. The decision we’re faced with now is basically this. Zipper is constantly drinking water from anywhere she can get it. The toilet, condensation, the water bowl, glasses of water we get for ourself. Anywhere. She also has 0 bladder control so we’ve had to put her in doggy diapers because even when we let her outside, as soon as she gets back in she has an accident. We’ve taken her to the vet and done full work ups and they haven’t found anything wrong with her other than a UTI which she’s had and been on antibiotics on and off for a year or so now. It goes away, we take her back to the vet and it’s come back, or the antibiotics didn’t work. 

She doesn’t seem to be in any pain and she’s still energetic and happy and she’s going deaf a bit but that’s it other than the constant peeing and drinking water. 

So my mom is thinking it’s unfair of us to not put her down because she’s so thirsty that she must be uncomfortable. I see her point but at the same time when Zipper is happy and energetic still I just struggle to want to put her down. I get that she’s so thirsty all the time but I just can’t get past the fact that she’s happy and full of energy and she’s not lethargic or sickly. 


I feel selfish too because this dog and I have literally been to hell and back together. We got her when I was 9 and since then she’s become my emotional support animal and friend. She got me through the toughest years of my life from when I was being abused at my dads house, to when I was bullied in school, all through the therapy I did for PTSD. This dog has been by my side through all of it. I can’t imagine her leaving my life yet but I also know that she’s old and eventually she will have to be put down or die naturally. If she really is uncomfortable and in pain of course I would do what’s best for her. But right now, it doesn’t seem like she is in pain, maybe just uncomfortable. I struggle because again she’s still happy, responsive to us, and full of energy. 


We’ve taken her to the vet again and asked what we can do for her and they basically said keep her hydrated but they didn’t bring up putting her down. Nor did they mention her seeming to be in any pain. 


I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be selfish but I also don’t feel she’s at the point yet that she needs to be put down but I worry my own bias about the situation might be clouding my vision. I’d like to know what other people think so any advice would be good.",01May2019,1
532,"So, I'll just cut to the ugly truth of my problem.

I have suddenly found myself to be extremely ugly.
I actively work on losing weight. I just hit a healthy BMI again. I try to take time to groom myself. 

But I mean... Everything, EVERYTHING I used to find pretty or even beautiful about my features has plummeted into a dark ugliness within just a few weeks. 

I don't know what to do.

I know, looks aren't everything. But they're something. And I don't know what to do, how to live like this.

I live with depression but this is something new... My husband asked me today why I was so damn sexy today. I shrugged and said it must be because he fell asleep horny last night.

I didn't even consider that I actually looked good for him because I looked in the mirror this morning and had a mini panic attack with what I saw.

I... I experience getting checked out when I go to the grocery store (I don't get out much) I know that some people find me at least mildly attractive.

But, I don't care about those people expectations of me. I care about what I think of myself and what my husband and my kids think of me... I want to be proud of my features and I'm not. At all.

I don't know what is happening to me.... Why do I suddenly look so hideous to myself?

 Has anyone experienced this? Something so sudden and severe? 

A few months ago, I got a few messages from people on r/amiugly (which I followed) they asked me to ""rate"" their photos... Which is common on the sub. I did and they thanked me. I wanted some unbiased opinions and I asked some of them if they could tell me if I was ugly or not... I just wanted a general idea of what the majority of people thought of me... They all replied back to me saying that they could and so I sent them a picture.

None of them replied back after I sent them the pictures. 

I tried not to read into too much (internet being internet) but.... Well, I'm writing about it now so..

543,"I started smoking when I was 15 and I just turned 27.

At some point, he just gave in and literally looked me in the eye and said “I’d rather you be a smoker than a bitch so busy go pack of cigarettes” and I did. 

Fast forward to about age 23, I really wanted to quit. For me. I bought a girl worked with the same kind of cigarettes she smoked and only allowed her to give me so many a day. I also had a buddy at a gas station by my house who would bum me one if I had a craving at home. It was kind of the perfect set up that I could never recreate and worked perfectly. I was down to 1 or nine a day and when I did have one it wasn’t satisfying and I remembered why I wanted to quit. 

I understand this isn’t a great excuse but it’s what happened- I was pretty much done and that weird system I made really worked! Then my roommate at the time accidentally caught my house on fire. It was big fire. I moved in with my parents while my home was being remodeled. About 4 days in my roommate told me she wasn’t moving back in and I had a panic attack that I wasn’t going to able to sustain myself without a roommate and bought a back of a cigarettes. 

I haven’t tried to quit again since then. But I want and need to. I’ve recently been focusing on my health more and I’ve lost 36 pounds since January so this is the last piece to really taking care of myself. I have no idea where to start.

Church is a source of depression and anger for me personally so attending is out of the question. Over the years (between my transition to adulthood) she has gradually reduced how much she irritates me about this to the point where she brings it up in passing somewhat dismissively. 

She uses her guilt trip method despite the fact I get along with her, do the majority of housework, driving, and provide a listening ear when she has problems. I feel that I do enough for her on command whilst dealing with my own problems on a daily basis.

I'm currently under *a lot* of stress from school as well as dealing with the anniversary of an extremely traumatic event, and the emotional baggage that comes with it. An argument with her over this would be an emotionally draining waste of my time.

545,"This morning when I moved my car to go to work I didn't notice the neighbor's cat under the right front wheel. Immediately after I moved the car in reverse I heard  Chloe ( the neighbor's cat) meowing. She is a super sweet cat, she spends more time in my property than in the owner's house ( We'll call the neighbor O) . We pet her, when the neighbor travels we feed her, she poops ( and other stuff too) in my driveway, she tries to enter the house, she has spent nights inside our cars because she sneaks in, she sleeps under the wheels of our cars, etc. ""O"" knows about it but we have never complained. The cat used to be inside the owner's house for a long time but they kicked her out. She is not used to be outside and other cats take advantage of her. 
After the incident happened, I couldn't stay to notify O but I called her right away. ( I'm a teacher and today we have standardized tests in Florida) She was not happy and asked me why I didn't stay, and I explained it to her several times. I honestly thought I killed the cat. Then O texts me at 10:30 to tell me the cat lives and is receiving treatment in a clinic. She asks me to cover part of the expenses, over $ 700 because they don't want to put her to sleep because love the cat as a person. I honestly don't think that I have any moral or legal responsibility, but maybe I'm wrong. I agreed to pay something because I love animals and feel really guilty.

He was talking slow, and while on the phone with the delivery guy, it was an honest miscommunication with our order, but he took it way out of proportion and because verbally hostile with him because our order was incorrect. I intervened and apologized for the mishap and asked to reorder the food and waited another hour for the delivery. Meanwhile, my bf dozed off and when it was time to get to the door, I couldn’t wake him up to let him know what was going on; he was sleeping so heavy. After I came back with the food, I attempted to wake him up again and he didn’t seem to know the time or what just transpired in the last couple hours. He kept asking where was the food we bought and what did he order, and I repeated myself several times to him. At this point, I knew something was wrong, the Xanax really made him out of it. He then became upset because I didn’t wake him up in time, NOT being aware of how much of a deep sleep he was in. He then decided not to go to work anymore and called his brother and cursed him out. After he left my place, he texts me disturbing and disrespectful things, to break up with him and forget about him. I tried to understand his reasons but he continued to call me out of my name and said “fuck you.” Hours later, he sobered up and still wasn’t aware of what happened, but after I explained everything he wouldn’t stop apologizing. He said the hurtful things he texted me was feelings he had with his ex because he really hated her. The whole time he was high, he never knew where he was, he didn’t remember what happened, and everything he said was never intended for me and wasn’t real. He swore he would never treat me like that again and never even touch Xanax again. He went to work this morning and is still apologizing to me through text.

That was back in February, since then I've seen him in the halls almost every day. I might be unconsciously seeking him out now, idk. I do know that up until February I had no idea he existed. I've been quietly admiring him for 2 months. But since I started on the backdrop for the drama club play it's been getting overwhelming. Me and one other girl work on it during lunch time and he sits on the other side of the stage to eat his lunch by himself. I don't know if it would be appropriate to approach him because I literally just learned his name 2 days ago. he probably has no idea that i actually exist. I also don't know if he's dating someone else.

sorry if it seems like i'm rambling, I just don't really know how to explain how i'm feeling and I'm super tired right now. I haven't been in a relationship for nearly 2 years and I don't even think that last one should count.",01May2019,1

550,"I got into a fist fight with my older brother about 1 hour ago and i won, the fight was over him being too loud as we share a room. I was joking around at first and initiated the fight by saying “wassup wit it” but i didn’t strike first, my brother knew i was joking around and went with it but ended up getting serious so i had to pin him down. In the process i broke a piece of his artwork, apologized and told him i’d try my best to fix it. He started yelling profanities at me, locked himself in the garage and called our parents. I texted my parents and apologized and explained my side of the story but how do i explain to them that it wasn’t my fault as i was joking at first but he started taking it too seriously. My brothers the type to say anything to get me further into trouble so i have no doubt he made up a little white lies to support his case, but i was 100% truthful to my parents also.

551,"A few days ago, my friend gave me her card because she didn't want her, she was planning on going to the club that night. I knew that there was $200 and she told me not to spend anything. I wasn't planning on buying anything with her card and all I needed to do was to return it the next day.

After receiving the card, I was walking to my apartment and that's when I dropped the card but I didn't notice until much later. I spent hours looking around for it but I couldn't find it. It's a prepaid card so I was able to contact the company and I try to deactivate it but turns out there was only 0.20 cents. I had just lost $200...

The worst thing about this is that when I tried to find out what was bought, it was $120 on Party City costumes and the rest on online shopping. I knew I couldn't pay back $200 in one day, I only had $100 on me.

The next day (which is today), I needed to confront her about it and I told her on what has occurred. I told her the story, offered the $100, and told her I was planning on paying back the next $100 next week. What she said next... Shocked me..

She said, ""I'm not a peasant, I don't want your money. You just lost my trust."" and then she said she was going to leave.

I understand why she was mad at the time but I honestly don't understand why she wouldn't take the money back and how I can gain her trust again.

559,"Hello advice givers! We are proud to announce that we will be testing out a new system soon. You will be able to earn points for providing advice, and earn flair levels too. 

Right now, we think that on average, threads do not receive enough helpful advice. There is no incentive to be helpful! Many people ask for advice every day, and a lot of these requests go unnoticed or ignored. We also think that thread creators don't respond enough. We want to encourage both for a more vibrant and robust community. 

## **So, we are introducing our Advice Point system!** 

The details will come when the system is ready to launch in Open Beta. 

OP will be able to give you a point if your comment was helpful. Your number of points will be recorded in your flair, so everyone can see how many people you've helped. You will also receive cool titles for being helpful. 

Our system will be a combination of /r/changemyview's delta system and /r/amitheasshole's user title system. Please take a visit to these subs if you want to see examples of how it works. It won't be exactly the same as either. 

## **So what's the point of this?**

Well, nothing really. But we have found that people generally like to be helpful. We want to give recognition to the people who have helped our community. These people deserve to be commended and praised for their help, and this is how we want to do it. 

There is no monetary benefit, and having a higher rank title doesn't make your advice any more important than anyone else's. However, it will show the history of your helpfulness. 

## **We will roll out this system soon. Exact date is TBD, but we will let you all know once it's been implemented.** 

Please be patient with us, as this will be an Open Beta test, you may experience minor bugs or issues. Please feel free to let us know if anything goes wrong. If people are not happy with this system, we will remove it and return things to normal. 

Finally, feel free to include any suggestions or thoughts below. Happy advice-giving!",01May2019,16

I agreed because it looked like a project for school.

Two days later a friend that was with me told me he saw the guy on instagram and apparently he was a pretty big youtuber in my area, and especially the series he was filming was very popular. 

I send the guy some dms that I didnt want to be in his video, he didnt reply

Fast forward to now I got a message from another friend that I was in some video. 

Before I clicked on it I already saw my face on the thumbnail with the text ""nut in her then run"" and some emojis under it. 

I havent said anything like that and I dont want my face to be associated with a text like that.

I am also in the video itself, which I dont like, but for me the thumbnail is the main problem.

The series is very popular and will very likely go on trending in my country, causing many people I know to at least see the thumbnail, and I dont want that. 

He doesnt reply at all to any messages, which i understand since he probally gets a lot from fans

I walked out of both stores feeling great about them. From the beginning I did always want one job more than the other and thankfully, that’s the one I got!

I got a called 2 hours after the assessment to say that they were giving me the job. About 10 minutes ago I got a call from the manager that interviewed me at the first store, he told me that i was unsuccessful.

My confidence really is dented i won’t lie. I don’t feel that upset that I didn’t get the job bc as i said, i favoured the other role more, but now i’m doubting my ability to do the job for the role i was successful in getting the job for....

I have to be honest, dealing with these types of people and this behaviour on a regular basis stresses me out and distracts from my mental energy that I reserve for work and learning, and I just want to live in peace with others.

570,"Hi!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm new here and I would like some advice. This is gonna be long. 

Let me start by saying that my brother, Barry, is selfish. I have known it for quite some time and sometimes, he does nice things for others. Generally, it's all about Barry. 

Barry was married and his wife passed away a few weeks ago. She died of cancer. Barry had been cheating on her for the entire relationship. He didn't allow me around her because he thought I would tell her. I probably would not have because she was dealing with enough fighting the cancer but that makes me feel like an awful person.   


Anyway, Barry had said some time ago before the wife passed, that he would get everything. I was hoping that she got better and that she saw him for what he truly was. I think he may have spoke highly of me to her and her family, because, according to him, they like me.   


So the wife passed and one of our other siblings called and said that Barry wanted to talk to me. I called him and he said he had something very important to talk about and he'd need my help. His wife passing hurt him deeply and there's some stuff he has to get in order. 

&amp;#x200B;

We met on mutual grounds (with his mom \[we share a dad\] and my moms best friend) to discuss whatever this important ""stuff"" was.   


According to him, since his wife passed, the house (read MORTGAGE) passed along to him. Barry cannot afford the mortgage, the car notes, the bills, etc. on his own. He especially can't handle the mortgage. I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

So he presents me with this option: pay the mortgage and stay in the house (obviously) and once it is paid off, the house is mine. 

  
Now Barry knew that my end goal would be to own a house. I'm 24 years old and I make  enough now for a down payment on my own home. The thing is, my credit isn't up to par for a good rate. I didn't always have this job and working as a waitress...paid my necessities but it didn't leave room for much else. 

I was thinking about it and thinking that living here would cut my costs since he only wanted me to pay the mortgage. I would save money, continue paying my student loans on time and raising my score. Open up a few lines of credit...

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the situation:

He said that the lady has owned the house for quite some time and the mortgage wouldn't take long to be paid.

Something just seemed off and I thought about it and the positives of going and decided to try it. I have been looking for a lawyer to get something drawn up and to schedule a time with him to get my name on the deed. 

I've made the first payment on the mortgage, because it was due and had not been paid and I was thinking the house would be mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I moved in, he had his girlfriend there. I call her the Lady of the House (""Lady"") because that's who she believes she is. She knows of Barrys recent widow and was seeing him while he was still married. She was planning on redecorating and changing things around and it just gave me an awful vibe. 

&amp;#x200B;

So fast forward a few weeks. Lady has been in and causing a ruckus about how she may be moving in and stepping into the life of Barrys wife. Talking about redecorating the house, having children, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to talk to Barry about when we can get this squared away and he's dragging his feet.   


Last night after I ordered pizza for everyone and we were talking. Barry and Lady decided that they want to downsize and move and prepare for starting their family.

They so graciously say that I am more than welcome to move in with them. They've found somewhere and plan on moving within 2 weeks. 

I decline and say that no, I'll just stay in the house and continue to pay the mortgage. 

&amp;#x200B;

Barry then brings up the wifes mother and says that she will rent it to me and now I'm confused. According to him, even after he brought up the mother, he owns the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if the house/mortgage is in his name, why would I have to talk to them mother at all?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like honestly, he isn't being honest with me and I would like to reach out to the mother and learn what exactly I have gotten myself into. However, I feel like the mother is still grieving and I feel that reaching out to her about this would be in poor taste. 

  
There's been so many red flags and this was just the icing on the sh\*t cake I was served. 

  
I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'll be able to get my money back for the mortgage. I need help :/",01May2019,1

573,"Hi All,  I want to post this out to you all and see what you think about the situation.  My new boyfriend says that most guys would behave completely different than how my ex handled the situation.  I was curious if that is true.  Quick background.  I worked for my mom and my step dad in their business.  My mom pretty much was only there once a week.  I worked all day with my step dad.  After I had been there a few years he got really talkative with me.  He would spend an hour almost everyday talking about himself.  I'm a good listener and I'm empathetic so I would give him validation and empathy.  He was struggling with being sober and I thought I was helping him.  One day I was in the hallway putting mail into everyone's mail boxes and he came by and put his hand between my legs and grabbed my private area.  I jumped up because I wasn't expecting that on any level.  I didn't want it and I didn't expect it.  He reached in grabbed me and went into his office and closed the door.  I stood there stunned for a bit thinking I did something wrong.  Did I lead him on? 

That night I told my husband at the time what happened.  He listened to me and I asked him if I did anything wrong.  He told me I didn't and basically not to worry about it.  The very next day I was in the breakroom getting coffee and my step dad did the same thing.  He reached in between my legs and grabbed me.  I was stunned again but I didn't say anything because I thought still that I had been leading him on somehow.  He simply grabbed me and went into his office.  I again told my husband that night what happened.  He again told me that I did nothing wrong and let it go.  I asked him if he thought I should tell my mom and he said no.  

A few days after all that happened my step dad apologized and said he shouldn't have done that.  At the time I accepted his apology and tried to move on but he became mean to me and it was like he was looking for things wrong with me.  I can only assume that he was looking for things wrong with me so he could feel good about himself.  Almost like, yeah I know I did this to her but look at all the things she does wrong.  I had a falling out with him and I refuse to have anything to do with him.  

When my boyfriend asked about normal things about my life and he wondered why I don't have anything to do with my step dad I told him about what happened.  He told me that he puts a lot of blame on my ex husband because he feels that he should've told my step dad after it happened the first time that his behavior is not acceptable, and basically put him in his place.  My boyfriend said that most men would do that.  I've personally never run into that behavior.  What do you guys think?  I figured it was just my battle and I didn't start a big war or fight over it at the time.  I was trying to keep the peace since it was family and I didn't want to rock the boat for one and for two I figured that it must've been my own fault because I was being empathetic to his struggles with addiction and he got the wrong message.  My boyfriend really thinks that my ex husband should've stepped up.",01May2019,0

I’m 22 and just moved back from living on the west coast. Always been working at restaurants and here and there doing freelance photography. It’s a cycle that’s horrible and not fulfilling at all. I spend all this time learning high end restaurant and fine dining all for nothing but a simple job. I would rather spend that time investing in going to school for tech. Always be a tech savvy person in my free time, but never took it seriously. 

I have no problem going to school, in fact I want to, but,

I never took my SAT, only did alright in school, and do not have parents who have any money to pay for me to go to school. 


I just enjoy the thought of working for someone who supplies me good pay, benefits and like, a normal life of not stressing out over dumb stuff or working weird restaurant hours. I’ve found I always put my employer above a lot of my own personal business because it’s for someone else, which is why I think it should be what I do, but in an industry I actually enjoy and can move up in.

Is it too late or not a good idea? I live in CT and I’d love to go to school in NYC and live there, but if that isn’t the best idea then I get it. I like to study now and work hard, unlike how I was when I was younger.

580,"I live in the US and during St. Patrick’s Day a friend and I drove out of state to visit another close friend who is in college. During a fun night of partying we stopped at a bar and I was waiting outside while my friends got us drinks. The bar had a live DJ outside so I joined in dancing with the crowd. While dancing a noticed a guy dangling a scarf off the balcony above a woman’s head, teasing her as she reached for it. Me being a fairly tall man, I took advantage of my height and snatched the scarf from him and gave it to the woman. We smiled and had a very brief exchange until my friends returned and we off to our next spot.

As time passed, my friends and I eventually ended up the same bar again where, lo and behold, scarf girl approached me again. This time we had an amazing conversation and she ended up putting her number in my phone. Eventually she told me her friends were leaving and she had to go with them because she too was visiting from out of state. We went our separate way after a quick peck on the lips and a flirtatious smile. For the rest of the night scarf girl was on my mind.

Eventually I told my friends about scarf girl and they told me I should reach out to her to see if she wanted to see each other again. I did, and her and I both agreed to meet up to spend the night together at a spot near her (getting to the spot was an absolute shitshow for me). 

Once we finally met up again at the hotel her and I would be staying at things between us were what I can only describe as magical. The physical chemistry between was everything but lack. Even after things settled down we laid together talking and cuddling for hours before finally falling asleep in each other’s arms. It felt almost as if I had known her for years. 

Inevitably, the morning came and both of us had schedules to stick to in order get back to our hometowns. We exchanged pleasantries and a kiss one last time as I walked her out to her friends who came to pick her up. 

During our travels home we continued to text each other. Everything between us seemed so amazing almost as if it were “meant to be”. But I was soon overcome by a feeling of doom in regards to the relationship we had been piecing together. We both lived multiple states and if it ever did get to the point were we wanted to continue to be together it was unrealistic that I would be able to move to her and, although I never mentioned it to her (it’s only day 3 of us talking at this point), I couldn’t expect her to pack up and move to me.

As politely as I could, I explained to her that I thought it would be best for us to not continue talking to each other in order to preserve my own sanity. She seemed to understand and we amicably went our separate ways.

Well, here I am. Nearly 2 months later I still find myself thinking about scarf girl and wondering what could have been. I can’t help but wonder if I screwed but letting such a strong connection go and I want to reach out to her to see if she feels the same way. But, when I think about sending her a message I don’t want to seem creepy or stalkerish. 

Would it be inappropriate to attempt to contact her again when all this time has past after a one night stand? If I did, how could it be done without me coming off as a creep?

TLDR; met a girl and shared a great connection. Spent the night together and briefly continued talking after returning to our respective homes. I broke it off after a couple days because the distance made things seem impossible between us. I still think about her 2 months later. Should I reach out to her again?",01May2019,0

Fast forward to now, I am 23 and a friend who is married keeps hinting at becoming the third to their relationship or at least messing with her husband, and I have said no very clearly multiple times. 

Her husband is still trying to befriend me and I feel like it is a ploy to get me more comfortable with him so I will agree. Idk how to tell him I dont want to be friends without hurting my friend's feelings or creating bad blood with me not liking her husband.

I even explained the relating trauma and why I am not interested to her, I dont know if her husband is talking to me without her knowing. I am also super open about my mental health and stuff and I feel like I'm at a very vulnerable point in my recovery.

More background:   


I was turning left on a yellow arrow and driver in the next lane (non-turning) tried to shift over and clipped my passenger side wheel area. No injuries, and the damage to my car is cosmetic - few scratches and a dent. It's an old car so it doesn't bother me. Dashcam footage reveals the other driver was at fault, which is a relief to me because I got pretty shaken up afterwards and wasn't sure.   


At the time of the accident, I had no idea who had hit me. I got out of my car and looked around and didn't see anyone else stopped. I stayed there for a few minutes, then left. Now that I've replayed the footage, I realize the other driver DID pull over, and might possibly have wanted to exchange information.   


I've never been involved in an accident before, and I'm unsure of what to do. I'm fine with letting the incident pass because my car is barely damaged. However, it feels like the honest thing to do would be to turn the footage into the police, in case the other driver needs it (even though they're the one at fault.) But I'm worried I'll get in trouble for leaving the accident, or running a yellow/almost red light, or etc.

She's only 11 and she acts like a bratty teenager and mom rarely does anything to counter her behaviour. My sister talks back to my mom almost all the time, she never cleans up after herself, she doesn't eat properly and barely shows any respect towards herself or anyone in this family. The worst part is that my mom is always being apologetic towards her behaviour and sometimes straight up enabling it by cleaning up her mess, making her food, letting her be lazy, doing chores that she should do, not disciplining her when she has done something wrong, not encouraging her to do things other than sit inside and by providing her unhealthy foods and snacks. She also lets her have all kinds of stupid shit like a smartphone and a laptop which she spends most of her days using when not at school, she has no interest or hobbies. Arguably both of these were birthday/christmas gift from family but it's still moms decition to let her have them. I personally don't think any 11 year old should have either of those items.

One time she did it right in front of the guy she likes, so I was asking her why did she have to do it in front of him(i was embarrassed for her, also he was my bf's friend, so it was kinda awkward). So my friend (we'll call her K) Was talking to her friend (who well call bitch) about how I was mad at her for being dramatic (I wasn't mad, I just always look mad). And then Bitch asked why K was being so dramatic, and K said ""Because she hit me"". Bitch didnt even let K continue or explain and started bitching/asking about why didnt she hit me back, and saying how she needs to cut me off.

So today I was talking with K and another friend, D, when Bitch comes up and starts talking to K. Ok, so I dont say anything and just continue to talk to D, when Bitch calls me a fucking dumb whore and that he's gonna cut me and threatened me if I hit K again. Nobody says anything and he just walks away, K ask me if I'm ok, and I say yeah. Five minutes later I put on my headphones and cry into my arms until lunch is over.

Eventually Me, K, and our two other friends(C and A) talk more about it at gym class as we play ping pong. K then starts to tell me about how Bitch talks shit about me and my boyfriend(who doesn't even know Bitch. Speaking of, Bitch actually asked me one time why I was even dating BF cause he had no personality, me and Bf's friend were fucking pissed), tells K to cut me off.

Basically I am a full time nanny Monday through Thursday, and do extra babysitting for a little over, to a little under $200 part time every weekend for two other families. Right now I have been full time with a new family for about six weeks now and did some regular sitting for them before. I let them know before they hired me that I have a weak immune system and get sick easily and violently. So, if their child is throwing up or has a serious illness that is highly contagious, as in more than just a cold, I would have to wait until they are no longer contagious since I am watching an infant for another family and will lose a lot of money/time with them as well. Plus this puts other children in danger of being sick. Well this weekend their five year old started to feel sick and they told me it's just seasonal allergies. ""Okay"", I thought, since I just took care of their youngest with a cold and it's no problem. Well Monday night going into Tuesday he has a fever of almost 103F and they do not tell me until I come in the next morning. I took him to the doctor and it turns out he has had strep for days and needs bedrest immediately. I didn't notice since I only see him in the morning and briefly after school. Since I took no extra precautions to disinfect their house, keep him contained to a couple of rooms, and didn't worry about my own health, I am now feeling very sick and am losing over $200 this weekend, while letting two families down who already made plans, because they were not honest with me. They even joked about how everyone is going to get it now after I told them I really cannot afford to get sick and do not want strep myself. They haven't even finished their contract I need to sign for legal proof of work and for taxes. How do I tell them this cannot happen again and we need to put full illness disclosure in the contract? Btw he does not have seasonal allergies since the doctor told me he only has one allergy and it is to a medication. I need to fully imprint on them I am asthmatic and this is causing me huge discomfort and is taking away income. I could have stayed home the 24 hours he needed on antibiotics and it could have been avoided. Especially if they took him to the doctor over the weekend.

•My grandmother is not related to me by blood. But she took care of me when I was younger.
•My grandmother is in good heath and full capable of living alone.
•I was in foster care for sexual abuse 
•I have disowned my family. 
•my boyfriends father is in poor heath.

Other then getting into debt over the car accident I was doing ok. I was sorta financially stable with 2 jobs and living in the city. Keeping my head above water.

Then my grandfather died. So I left my life in the city to live with her 600 miles away. I figured this would be beneficial for both of us. She needs someone to stay with her to keep her company and this could be a way to save up money while living with her to stop struggling financially.

I got a job and was saving up really well. Eventually, things went south when she retired 6 monthes into my living with her. She wasn't going to be able to pay the bills until her retirement came in...in about a year. She got a job where I worked and we got by. I would help her with bills if she asked, while putting my money on my own bills and a large amounts into the medical bills. 

Then she got the flu which later turned to pneumonia. She was out of work for 2 months. Then I got the flu with her for 2 weeks. Around this time I got a boyfriend and he took care of me until I was able to take care of my grandmother. 

My boyfriend moved it with us and she oked it.
(I know we moved fast.) Because my grandmother was sick she lost her job. So my boyfriend and I agreed to take care of the water and electric bill. This is only temporary anyways. It ranges from $300-$400 a month. My grandmother normally has every light on in the house even in the day. Because we are paying it we regularly turn the lights off for the empty rooms. The house is already paid for and she had money saved up to pay the cable bill.

Then about 3 months from getting her retirement money she put the house on a second Mortgage. So now she has a house payment again.

Once she finally gets her retirement she goes on a spending spree. She buys a brand new car first thing. And then buys new furniture and other odd thing she doesn't really need. She even called her children to tell them all about it. Now her phone is constantly ringing because they want something or they are suddenly very interested in how she's doing. Her sister is the worst. 

My boyfriends truck breaks down and since my grandmother has 3 cars she lets us use the one she promised to me when I was in middle school. So we add on the insurance payment to our bills. His insurance was $25 now it's $90. But between the 2 of us we are still ok. I stop paying my medical bills to be able to save more money. 

Then it starts. Her sister tells her we need to pay for these things since we live there. We shrugged it off because fine we do use the utilities. So we keep paying the bills. Then her sister convinces her I'm not treating my grandmother good enough. Because since I got a boyfriend I stopped making dinner at 5 but at 7 because that's when he comes home. And I am home less. I can't drive so we will be gone for 12+ hours due to different work schedules.  My grandmother threatened to take the car away because I mistreat her. I shrug her off and hide in my room.

I lost my job. So I'm home all the time. Because I'm an artist I dive into that and make a few commissions. I have enough money saved to float for a few months.
Then she starts to talk behind peoples backs. She tells my boyfriend now fiance about how I'm just like my mother. Just letting a man do everything and pay everything for me. And she trys to convince me a he needd to take care of me and he doesn't appreciate the work I do at home. Thankfully he and I tell eachother everything.

Now to bring in the latest development. Her son is struggling. He is in and out of the hospital and can't work. She lent him the 3rd car she owns. I resently found out she is paying his bills. That puts a damper on trying to talk her into cuting our bills. Then she tells me he is moving in soon. I don't know when.
I'm angry because she continues to make decisions without regarding the others who live with her. (She's been giving things away that we use like pans I cook with and my laptop charger.) So I look up her son. He has been arrested 9 times and is on the sex offenders list. After getting my courage up I bring up in conversation you can look up peoples crimes. So I look up her son in front of her and show her. At first she is shocked. But then she said that the boy lied and he isn't a sex offender. But I know he is. You don't get on that list with no evidence. And I have memories of his when I was small watching porn while babysitting. 

I don't want to live with him. I have told my fiance and he asked his parents if we could living with them in their basement. They said no not unless we are married. But they don't want us the rush to get married because of this. And if we do thay will turn us away. On top of the fact my fiance is $50,000 in debt and if I marry him his debt is mine too. 

I have reached out to a friend to take us in. But my fiance won't leave his family or hometown. So I have been searching for cheap living solutions yo both pur speculations and I can't find anything. 

What do I do?",01May2019,0
618,"First off let me just ask if you think I should make this post on another subreddit suggestions are welcome!  


TL;DR: My family is sort of abusive and I need to find a way to deal with them because I can't move out just yet.  


The actual post:  
Dayum I don't know where to begin. OK let's go.  


So I'm 17 and I'm kind of the outcast of my family. I don't get beat or anything but my parents treat me kind of aggressively and my siblings don't help either. Basically I'm slightly different than my siblings, not in a major way, I do things a bit differently, nothing major, but they and my parents see it as a problem. It's in things as simple as they way I prioritize my homework to the way I judge people when I first meet them.  


To give you an idea on the kind of aggressiveness level my parents are at, my mother threatened to pull me out of my private school (the one I now attend because the teachers on the public one were giving me unfair grades) because I didn't do 2 pieces of homework. All this and I even upped my score on the second test of the term and improved by 3 points (out of 20, from an 11 to 14) my final score on that discipline.

&amp;#x200B;

It gets worst than that but I'm not here to complain. All you need to know is that I even saw an Psychologist that especiallizes in teens because of my problems and on the final session before I was discharged she said that I wasn't acting or doing anything wrong and that my parents, although they love me very much, unknowingly bully me at home in an effort to toughen me up for life. I know they're not bad persons, just bad parents, at least when it comes to me.  


So with that out of the way, and with a very mature mentality for my age, I know this is temporary, but I'm really strugleling to keep it together after all these years! Especially when I'm approaching the end of my school year and the tests and exams are all bunched up together and I'm under a lot of pressure! I'm finding it really hard to ignore the unfair words and actions that they say and suject me to. Sucking it up has worked up until now but I know my limits, and I know that if I don't find a way to release this anger and frustration it won't end up well for me. I used to game as a way to distract myself, but my GPU has blown and I don't have money to fix my PC until next year. I have really limited free time because of school, it's especially bad because I'm on the hardest year of highschool in my country.  


So I'd like to ask if anyone can give me some genuinely GOOD advice, so that I can overcome this obstacle in my life. I've endured a lot, and I know when and who to ask for help.  


Thanks guys! ;)",01May2019,1

626,"A few years ago I was spending some time in the US and I went to this same salon 2 or 3 times. But I don't remember tipping my hair stylist....at all. I am almost certain that I didn't tip in cash, but maybe if at that salon they gave you like a percentage to choose from that they'll just add to the credit card payment then maybe...Do they even do that at salons? 
The thing is that I'm not sure and I feel super bad about it if I didn't leave any tip!! I can't believe that I would forget to tip, especially many times! But I was new to the country and its culture and we don't have any kind of tipping culture in my home country, so it is possible that I could have forgotten or had a misunderstanding about it. 
Is there any way that the salon can check it years later? And how weird would it be if I contacted the hair stylist and just asked her?",01May2019,0
627,"Hello! This is my first time posting on this sub and im stuck as to what to do in this situation.

So my bestfriend (we’ll call her L) came up to me the other day saying that my friend (G)’s boyfriend (B) has been snap chatting her, i asked her why she was telling me and she explained that he had originally asked for a rate and then when she gave him a low one because she doesnt really know him, he asked if sending a picture of this genitals would help raise the number.

When she first told me i was shocked because B and G had been going out for a year and a bit now and they seem like those stereotypical school sweet-hearts and B has always came across as a nice guy. So i didnt believe her until i started paying attention more, he would say good-morning to her, pat her on the shoulder, say goodbye and such which is weird as he never did this to the rest of us.

I also found out the other day that B texted L asking things such as ‘if i wasnt dating G, would you go out with me?’ and ‘you know i fancied you before i started dating G’ and stuff like that.

I still havent seen any snapchats to prove this but he is very touchy and talkative around L and today G and B had a massive argument as she believes he has been linking with another girl (not L) and was getting upset. Since this hes been alot more protective of his phone where he would usually let her have it over lessons in school.

I was also told that B gives G’s bestfriend (K) kisses on the heads and hugs and pinches her hip and calls her ‘sister’ and such.

Me, K and L are the only people that know that B has been contacting L and we wanted to tell G but we dont want to make her sad as shes also going through family issues and doesnt really have anyone to turn to, we also have GCSES in a week and everything is really stressful.

Im sorry this was long but im stuck on wether i should tell G about B, just tell B to stop talking to L or not say anything at all.

SHORT: a friends boyfriend has been contacting my friend and asking flirty questions, hes been accused of talking to another girl and im stuck on what to do.",01May2019,1
628,"Sooo before I didn’t want to go to prom, but then after I saw this beautiful dress at the mall, that was when I decided to go. So I bought the dress, and I was way too excited (Mind you, 85% of the reason why I wanted to go to prom was because of the dress). I was all excited about my dress so I showed all of my friends the dress, until one girl told me that she has the same dress as me... so that kind of got me not wanting to go. I know I can buy another dress, but that dress was so pretty and I immediately fell in love with it, the moment I laid eyes on it. I eventually got over it and decided to keep the dress, still kind of disappointed that someone has the same dress as me. 


Fast forward to a day after, I went to buy my prom ticket, and the person selling it told me that I still have a textbook that I didn’t return from last semester, and that I couldn’t go to prom until I hand in the fees. Prom already costs 100 dollars, and I have to pay 125 for this textbook. That means I have to technically pay 225 dollars to go to prom. This kind of made me lose interest in going. 


Another problem is that my best friend isn’t going to prom because of her little brother’s confirmation that she has to attend (to those who aren’t catholic, confirmation is some kind of Catholic thing where god can finally accept u or some shit like that. Idk exactly what it is, I don’t really know much about Catholicism, but that isn’t important right now, just know it’s some catholic shit u do). So because of that, she is throwing a little movie night with two of our friends that also weren’t going, and she said that she would be realllly happy if I came. 


The thing is, I reallly wanna go to prom but the whole dress thing and the stuff that I mentioned above was bothering me. So I asked a good friend of mine who was going to prom if there is a reason why I should go. She tells me how I should go because I make everyone feel happy, and that my presence makes everything fun. She told me that if I go to prom, all of my friends that are going will be happy.  
So now, I have this dilemma where if I go to prom, my best friend will be disappointed, however if I go to movie night with my best friend, all of my other friends that will be going to prom are gonna be disappointed. 


Next is my parents. They told me that they don’t care if I go or not, but I know that they secretly don’t want me to go because of the money. They said it’s my choice, but I feel really bad if I go because my parents are already tight with money. I don’t have a job, nor do I have my own money because they always take my money that I save up. So I feel like going to prom will be a burden to them.


I kind wanna go to prom because it’s a once in a life time thing, and people say that I’ll regret it. But with this situation that I’m in, I really can’t decide. I have to decide by tonight and just thinking about it is killing me.  Reddit. Please help.",01May2019,2

I told her that I don’t feel like getting her the gift she wants because it’s kinda expensive and I would rather buy her a toy as a prank gift to get her back. She promised me to get me something on my next birthday. However, she is going to study in a college outside the country before my birthday.

633,"As I've gotten older with a job, girlfriend, place to live, etc I found that creative things I used to enjoy in the past feel like a waste of time now.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent 4 years doing music production, and had a small resurgence to try it again like 3 months ago (after a hiatus of 5 years). The first 30 days were pretty good, but I definitely had an 'addiction' problem with it, because I could not balance it with the rest of my life and basically screwed up my routine because of it. Eventually this addictive binge just went away and killed off my liking of doing it. I even finished a few tracks that turned out really well, but when I look back at those projects, I can't help but feel it was all a pointless endeavor. The main driving force behind that work was imagining immediate success and fame and glory. Of course this is delusional thinking on my part, but when I really think about my motivations for pursuing it, it was always about impossible fame and glory. Now when I try to go back to it, it reminds me how much I hate the creative process and the amount of suffering it induces.

&amp;#x200B;

I also spent 4 years doing music composition. I don't have many fond memories of it now. It always felt like I was inducing suffering onto myself whenever I was writing. Grappling with impossible high standards of fame and glory (again) and understanding my real motivations for choosing this path took me to some very dark corners of my mind (and definitely made my depression far worse). Ever since I quit composing it felt like saying goodbye to a drug. There was a sense of loss in myself, but I also feel a lot better emotionally since quitting. So clearly this hobby was destructive to my well being.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent the last 2 years designing a crazy big coding project that involved modding a game, talking to a database, showing real time data on a website. I spent unhealthy amounts of time on this (literally 6pm to 2-3am every day after work) and when I would wake up all I could think about was the code. I couldn't function or do anything else in my life except this one thing. I neglected my girlfriend, health, and friends because of this. Eventually I burned out about 6 months ago and haven't touched it since. It's sad because it's like 95% functionally complete, yet I just don't care enough anymore to complete it. I feel like I wasted 2 years of my life doing something that caused me harm.

&amp;#x200B;

And this is the crux of my problems with creativity. It feels like this destructive drug that creates unhealthy habits, addiction, suffering, and delusional sense of grandeur. I hate it so much. I don't understand how people can continue down this path and not have these problems. I have never been able to balance it out with the rest of my life or not have it turn into a destructive habit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to learn how to integrate it into my life again, and instead of hating the process actually enjoying it. Would love to hear anyone else's experiences and how they dealt with this.",01May2019,1

I (32M) was taken advantage of by one of my sister's friends (~38M, lets call him Adam) back when I was 8 years old. I kept this a secret for almost 20 years and have only discussed it with my therapist and my dad, never revealing who that person was. My sister (lets call her Annie) never knew about this and I never got in contact with Adam again thanks to moving to a different city.

Last week, I found out that Annie let her son (1yo) with Adam's mom for babysitting and Adam decided to stop by to meet him. I have no details of the encounter but this really upset me.

I'm not very open with my sister and am afraid to talk to her about what happen to me. Also, I have no idea how Adam grew up; I do not know if he just went through some complicated phase when he was a teenager, or wanted to experiment back then, or if he actually was and is into kids.

The only thing I do know is that Adam is gay (sorry if this sounds discriminatory, English is not my native language) and has kept it a secret to this day. I know this from Annie's comments regarding his social media posts, from what little I remember about his personality and well, what happened to me.

I care a lot about my nephew and I want to make sure he does not go through the psychological trauma I went through, and just the possibility of having Adam near him scares the shit out of me.

I'm troubled between confronting Adam (I do not have his contact information yet) and respectfully asking him to stay away from Annie's son, coming forward to Annie, doing nothing, or talking with someone else (maybe Annie's husband or my dad).

641,"Hello fellow redditors! 
I am a newish Leadhand who got promoted back in October. Im far younger then the rest of my coworkers, and inexperienced but I try my damned hardest. I have a few key issues on shift that I could use advice with, something that I am having problems with, in part due to my young age. We are a warehouse based company dealing with shipping software, forklifts and a sorting machine. 

   First and foremost, is motovation. For my shift 2 of the 5 of us core workers have high motovation, me and Brendan. Brendan is just naturally highly motovated, and wants to be the best at everything, and it shows. Incredible work ethic on this man. He makes the shift easier. Second, is ofcourse me. My name is on the line as well as the fact that I want the shift to succeed, i go so far as to skip my breaks if I need to, which is often.  But sadly I have trouble motivating the other guys. 


  My next issue I have would be productivity on my shift. While part of the productivity drop is because of the lack of motivation as well as a newer employee that's getting trained up to speed, we still have a ways to go before we're matching the other shifts. We have improved greatly since I've become the lead hand but I want to make more of a mark and turn this into the best shift we can be. My big problem is breaks slow us down a fair bit. Productivity has two facets: docks and sorting machine production that are the real focus. We have improved but again, we are not near my targets and goals. 

   The other issue that I have is teamwork between employees. There is a cultural difference on my shift and sadly that has created a rift between certain employees, especially with different languages being spoken in the lunch room, excluding some, as well as my guys focus more on themselves and not helping each other out. I also don't know if my guys trust me fully. I'm not sure how to solve any of this, and could use some help/advice.",01May2019,1

Even though I left on bad terms with the other employees, I really want to reach out to the family if they need any help or support. I feel extremely bad that he died as suddenly as he did and part of me is wishing I could've reached out to him and at least let him know I didn't think he was a bad person despite the behavior of his employees.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I want to at least send flowers or something, would it be distasteful to attend his viewing? I don't think I'd go to the funeral because I wasn't super close to him.

645,"I used to be friends with somebody for a couple years before realizing he’s not a good person to be around. By now I’m fine with not caring for him anymore, but my mind has associated him with certain things we had in common (a movie we watched for example). My anxious mind makes me feel that if I enjoy said movie nowadays it means I miss the guy or some crap like that; sometimes I avoid the subject entirely because my mind associates it with him.

I feel better knowing that I don’t have him in my life anymore, but whenever memories of watching said movie with the guy come up I feel like I’m sucked back in. How can I enjoy these things without associating it with the person I used to be friends with, and how can I get over those memories and feel sure that I don’t still like him or anything?",01May2019,1
646,"sooo...I participated in a tv show some weeks ago and took part in a bunch of interviews where i was very nervous and said alot of weird shit and obvious shit like Earth is round, where i danced weirdly and other stuff, which at the moment i thought was funny. basically whatever came to mind. the tv people has the rights to cut the video however they want and almost make me say everything out of context. I dont know what to do? should i kickstart a youtube career as a crazy person has been on my mind sometime now as then maybe i could use the publicity for something good. or if i should denounce it. or say it was all fake. Im wondering if this maybe will make it difficult to find a job later on in life as i probably will be highlighted on tv and immortalised on youtube. it was for Idol. and my audition to sing and whatever is not what im worried about but the interviews. im hoping they show me in a goodlight as a funny dude but i have a feeling that they might make me into something else as tv producers do.

647,"Hi.   


I live in the Mtns. of the southeastern US.   
Things I don't have:

* No car
* No drivers license
* No cellphone (extremely little phone experience as well)
* No GED (Even though I've been studying for 7 years; the time limit for the Essay is against me, plus I have no money to pay for the GED)  


Things I do have: 

* 3 days worth of real job experience as a grocery stocker. However, I quit because I shook too much during the job.   


Between 4 and 8 years ago I had applied to many jobs within a 10 mile radius of me. I had few interviews but ultimately, no one officially hired me. 

Should it matter; it would take me approximately 3.5 hours (one way) to get the nearest town or 6.5 hours (one way) to the second nearest town, on foot, respectively. There aren't any public transportation options available here either.  


I have looked into online jobs such as U-Haul or Amazon but I never heard back from them.  


Does anyone on here have a suggestion?",01May2019,1
648,"So I want to be a wardrobe stylist. I currently know a guy who is a celebrity stylist. I live in the Midwest and he is currently in LA. He texted me asking me to make a store run for him to see if I could find these items and then over night ship it to him. This was the first time he's ever asked and I've ever done it. I left my 9-5 job &amp; went to the store. I found the items and then told him the total. He then said ok go ahead and pay for it and I'll reimburse you because I'm in a meeting. I just paid my rent today so I'm pretty broke at the moment so I literally didn't have the almost 200 bucks to pay it. I told him I would, but I literally don't have it I'm really sorry. He said it was ok and sent me the money via cash app. I went to FedEx and over-nighted the items. I then sent him a text thanking him for thinking of me and giving me the opportunity and if he ever needed anything else let me know.  I told him I had to run back to work to a meeting so if he texted me again I promise I'm not ignoring him. He just sent a thumbs up sign. He never really said thank you or anything. So I feel like maybe I did a bad job or something lol? He did send extra money for the items so I asked him did he intend to do that or should I send him back the difference. He said no need to send back (assuming that's my compensation). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know in that paragraph it sounds like it went ok. However I may be over-analyzing but I'm worried I made a fool of myself. Saying I would pay for them, but I don't have the money was a sting to the ego and a little embarrassing. I am too old to be living pay check to pay check. Number two since I'm not experienced and have never done this before I felt stupid as well asking him should I go to USPS or FedEx (duh FedEx is faster) and then from the initial conversation I was freaking confused why he asked me considering he knows I live two time zones away. However, did not realize people will pay for people to do things like I did today. I also feel like did I look too eager/thirsty for this opportunity. Leaving work and saying I would foot the bill but I just didn't have it. What if he was testing me to see if I was that dumb because it was for a celebrity to pay for it myself on the strength of his word he would pay me back? I wonder if I should've just said no please send it now and not explained my current financial situation.

650,"I'm a 25-year old male and I'm thinking about joining the military. There are few reasons for this consideration. 

First, I have a significant amount of student debt and I have made some bad decisions so I still don't have a degree, not even an associates. I'm currently a college student, but I'm still struggling with school. My ultimate goal is to have a bachelor's degree+ but I am in a lot of debt already and I don't know where that money will ever come from. I figure if I can commit to the military(either active duty or reserve) for the designated time period, I can come out of this around 30 years old with very little debt. Opposed to my roughly \~50k in debt right now. I have no idea how I am even going to pay for my university right now if I don't go to the military as I have exhausted a lot of loan funds.  The job I ultimately want to have after college is involved with film and creative writing, so while the military doesn't exactly teach those skills,  creative writing and film degrees aren't worth much either.  The military seems like a good option to put me in a financial place where I can thrive throughout my life, at least in comparison to where I am now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I lack discipline. The reason I am in so much debt is because I severely lack discipline. I'm not struggling with college because I am stupid, it's because I just get overwhelmed with anxiety and run away from all my responsibilities. I'm not sure exactly how truthful this is, but it's believed that the military helps people grow up quite a bit and I need that if I want to make anything of my life. I have spurts where I am responsible and seem to act like a typical adult, but then I get stressed and I fall apart as a person. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are other reasons, but those are the primary ones. My only concerns are that there is a large time commitment, people tend to come out of it miserable and alcoholics, I had a stroke in 2013 but it was not really a serious issue so I don't know if I would even be eligible, and I don't want to sign up and find out my outstanding student loans wouldn't actually be covered.

653,"Before I get into the full post, I'm just going to set up a bit of a background. I'm a slightly introverted freshman and there is this girl in my Spanish class who's been acting very weirdly lately and has acted drastically worse over time. Normally she  says these things to just get a reaction out of me, like ""your looking so sexy today"" or just commenting about my clothing and how good I look (but in a really exaggerated tone)

This mostly continued every day I had Spanish as well as going home on the bus. I normally responded to these with that one laugh you would make to a really bad and  embarrassing joke someone said, or I'd flat out tell them if they could please stop. This continued until very recently when my sister stayed after school (we usually sit and talk with each other) and the girl decided to sit next to me. Immediately, she gets super close to me (I know there's not much space on a bus, but I mean laying on my shoulder and even occasionally touching my hand/arms) She goes to the point of saying things like, and I quote, ""[name] I REALLY wanna see your ass right now."" and ""would you be okay if I raped you?"" 

I'm almost positive she is joking (or at least I hope so) as she always laughs and takes glances to her friends to see their reaction of my reaction. I've tried telling this to other people but they usually just say I'm super lucky, as many people agree that she is one of the best looking girls in the school, but I couldn't feel any more uncomfortable.

I know the title might seem a bit misleading as I think she's just joking around but it still makes me extremely uncomfortable and I've tried telling her so many times to stop but most of the time she just responds with ""Oh, so your playing hard to get are you?"" I've told my brother about it too but he just says I'm a wimp. Even if I am a wimp, how do I make her stop?!?",01May2019,1

Thats when she started to tease me with her friend and i felt so uncomfortable. 
I thought she didn’t want me anymore, and wanted me to be with another person. 
I got tired of her teasing me so i finally approached her and talked to her about it. 
I told her that i was uncomfortable whenever she brings it up and it made me feel negative and she just said she was jealous and thought that I didn’t deserve her because she was just being a burden to me. 
I told her that i never would think about her like that and told her i am sorry that i got her jealous.

657,"I'll try to make a long story short. I'm 18. All my life I've heard ""surround yourself around positive people, people who want to see you succeed"" and things like that. But I've never had that at all, but I want that more than anything. 

Over the last two or so months, I've lost contact with a majority of my friends, the people I graduated with. They started leaving me out of things and what not. 

They weren't the positive people I needed in my life anyway. All we did was sit around, crack jokes, and talk about drama. I've always been more goal oriented and focused on improving myself then they were anyway but yeah, we don't talk anymore but I guess we're still cool.

Anyway, I follow these three guys that are my age on Instagram and it turns out they live right down the street from me. I've known of them for a while but it's like now I'm finally realizing that they are the types of people I need in my life. 

From the stuff they post, I can see that they have dedication, they're into fitness (like me), they're extremely positive, they uplift each other, they read books (I like to read too but my old friends were really against it), and they're extremely focused on self-improvement.

I look up to them in a sense for all of those things and I'm looking for a way I could reach out to them. I need more people like them in my life. I need genuine people/ friends like them in my life. I see myself as a genuine person too but I've never been too good at making friends/ talking to strangers.

Context: I am a girl in high school, but my voice tends to sound older than I am (I look older too, but the guy couldn't see me)

I was playing a game Saturday night with some random guys I met a few weeks back (not irl, just from a previous group). In the group, I wasn't being singled out for my gender or anything, the guys were pretty chill and nothing was out of the ordinary until one of the guys sent me a dm. He asked me if I wanted to duo queue with him, just us two, and leave the group. 

I didn't think anything of it at the time, so I politely declined his request. He left the group and I didn't hear from him for a while. It was about an hour later when he send me another dm. It asked, ""Are there any open spots in the group right now?"" There weren't any, so I told him no. He continued to make small talk with me and he sent me a couple more dms later that night. At this point, I was kind of suspicious about his intentions. It was obvious he wasn't sending messages to the other guys in the group, so I assumed it was because I'm a girl and it was a weird (a.k.a creepy) way of hitting on me. 

Now, this is where the sketchy part starts. He starts sending me dms when I'm not even on the game. So since Saturday, I've gotten a message from him everyday. I tell him that I have finals next week, and I don't have much time to play. He says okay every time and doesn't reply anymore. Until the next day and this whole thing repeats over and over. Until yesterday. Yesterday, out of absolutely nowhere, he just asks for my snapchat. I'm in class, and immediately I start freaking out. I have no one to tell because all of my girlfriends don't use voice chat, and my guy friends wouldn't understand. I have no idea who this guy is, and he sounds at least 5 years older than me. I told him that I don't feel comfortable giving out personal info, and he just says ""okay. tell me when you are able to log on.""

I have always gotten weird comments when I talk in voice chat, but no one has ever gone to the extent to ask for my snapchat and send me dms everyday. I did get one this morning, but I didn't reply.

669,"Some background so that you can picture my workplace: I (woman in her 20s) work at the front desk of at a recreational facility that sees a lot of daily foot traffic from people taking various classes that we offer as well as outside rentals. Because of the dozens of classes and ever-changing renters, it is almost impossible to tell who should and should not be there. I am the only person who sits at the front desk (in an isolated area away from other employees) from 8:30 AM -5:00 PM, and I am the only person in the building from 8:30 AM-9:30 AM.

I have been personally robbed once when I left the desk to walk someone to a rental space and their accomplice took my purse from inside of the cabinet next to my desk. The experience left me extremely shaken, especially since I was alone in the building and I worry that much worse could have happened. It left me feeling vulnerable, as I had never even fathomed anything like this could have happened where I work.

Since this incident, my employer has moved a small monitor with a video feed of the parking lot to my desk area. Because of the angle of the video monitor, I have to turn my body completely around to look at it, and it honestly is of no help. Cut to today, a man came in, asked where the art class was (which I directed him to from my desk) and then proceeded to walk around the building searching for unattended purses/ bags. He then exited through the back door, smashed a customer's car window and took her bag from inside.

After we realized what had happened and looked at the security footage of the parking lot, we saw that the man drove off with one of the people from the last theft incident. I'm worried that my workplace has become an easy target for these types of thefts and I'm extremely anxious that these people will return again and things could possibly escalate as there has been no real consequence thus far.

I don't feel like my employer is taking this seriously. I've brought up the fact that I'm uncomfortable with opening alone as well as the possibility of installing some kind of buzzer/ verification process so that people have to check in before gaining access to the building, but both have been ignored. I've started to dread coming into work and I'm constantly swinging around in my seat in order to look at the video monitor, so it's affecting my productivity as well. Is this an issue worth quitting over? Does my employer have any obligation to ensure that I feel safe? Thanks for any advice!",01May2019,1

The college I was obsessed with while we were friends. I know for a fact she isn’t going there. I’m taking this super personal. She doesn’t know anyone that goes or went there. I don’t know why she went out of her way to wear it. It’s not even a school close to us or even popular in our area. Should I text her and say something or just ignore it?? Pls help I am angry and hurt I feel like she did it just to spite me.,01May2019,1

What's wrong with me? P.s.

I’m quite sure he likes me back (but I’m not sure and might need some advice with that too). I have my reasons! E.g: Last New Years he sent me a snap trying to say hi or whatever and when I didn’t reply he first time (because I’m a pussy) he sent ANOTHER snap (which I also didn’t reply to even tho I liked him back then because I’m a HUGE fucking pussy yes I hate myself) and I promise I have other more valid reasons but I don’t want to bore anyone and just want advice lol.

Here’s the big fat kicker that’s making me so nervous about acting on how I feel; apart from starting at each other, we don’t communicate. It sucks! I really wish I had the guts to talk to him but it just never seems right, I feel like it would be weird to just suddenly talk to him and I have no idea what I would talk to him ABOUT. 

I know this is a really dumb and lame ass problem to ask for advice for but I feel some kind of spiRiTuaL cOnnEcTioN between us and I really like him (we also have a lot of common interests) and want to at least try talking to him before we leave and never see each other again and am sure I’ll regret it if I don’t, but idk if it’s appropriate to talk to him or get anything started.

682,"So, some background info- my car's front driver window doesn't roll up all the way.  It's been raining recently so what I've been doing is taking a trash bag to cover it but there is this small section that isn't covered.  I was getting in my car this morning and I noticed a bird was inside the vehicle- I didn't think too much about it- just opened the door and stepped out so she could fly away.  I got back in my car and drove to my friends house about 20 mins away and It just now occurs to me that I should check for nests in the backseat to be sure she wasn't making a home back there.  Sure enough, I have a small box in the backseat of my car that the bird made a nest in and it has eggs inside.  I took my car back home and left the small gap in my window open so the mom could come back for the eggs but what do I do about this situation?  I can confirm the mother is back inside my car now- but I'm not sure the proper way to move the nest to make sure the mother and eggs will be okay.

The thing is it's been a while, we got back into the routine of things without changing anything, so how do I do it?

693,"First off. English is not my first language so forgive me if I get CONFUSHON and make mistakes.

Okay so I'm 19 and I've wanted to be an animator since I was like 12. I went to multiple comic courses (Because in my city we don't have variety on course) and traditional animation when it came to town. I was the artsy girl in school and when I turned 18 I followed my dreams and moved to the capital to study animation (Which is not normal in Chile, here you're supposed to stay in your parent's house until you're 27 or so).
Everything went downhill from there. I realized I was in the bottom half of my class, that I struggled a lot more than my peers. I cried a lot. I got really frustrated. And It wasn't just me. A teacher told me ""Well, some of us just don't have talent. It's okay. You can persue a career in publicity"" and in my finals a helper teacher stood up for me and my horrible proyect saying ""I saw that she really put effort. She struggles with this more than her classmates"" 

Well. It all came down to my father offering me to stay in my city with my family to study plastic arts with the promise of sending me to study animation in USA someday.
Now I'm studying art and it is all the same. Except that now I'm the worst in my class. It seems like I can't do anything right and that it is so easy for my classmates. I know they maybe practice a lot and their talent is not the only thing that makes them good but I put effort too and I haven't improved a bit.
I had another option. The option I would have settled for If my parents didn't let me study animation. And that's psychology.
My score in the PSU (The only way to enter college in Chile. Which measures knowledge in maths, language, biology and history regardless of which carreer you pick) was enough to get me into psychology, I often find myself watching videos about this topic and I'm really good at recognizing patterns in people's behavior and why they act the way they do. My dad is a Psychiatrist. So I would also continue a path similar to his.
I don't hate psychology. Quite the contrary. It's something I'm really interested in and always want to learn more about... But animation is my real dream. A dream that I'm afraid it's fading away because of my frustration and my lack of talent. I've simply reached to the conclusion that I'm not made for art. Inside of me there's not an artist but a psychologist. I want so bad to be that talented animator I always pictured in my mind but I'm not... what should I do? How can I keep going if I know I'm not suited for this? Should I just give up and persue a carreer that I'm good at and would give me more money in exchange for my dreams?",01May2019,1

697,"I'm 19 and have amounted to nothing in my life.
Now, more than ever, I need to get my life together because I'm about to have a baby. But I cannot function properly. I don't know why. I've been diagnosed with PTSD (from childhood sexual abuse), depression, anxiety and agoraphobia. 

My parents pulled me out of highschool at 14 because I hated it and got to a point where I was on the verge of suicide. It wasn't the learning, or the tests or even the teachers. I actually very much enjoyed school when it came to that. It was all the people I was around. I don't know why, but I hate being around people. I don't know if I'm scared, embarrassed or if I just hate people but I cannot function around people. When I'm alone or with my dogs I'm okay but even being around my boyfriend and/or his 9 yr old son, or even my own family I get tired and I want to be alone. I really like being alone more than anything but I'm also too scared to be alone.

My psychiatrist said with my problems I would be approved for disability and he would advocate for me but I honestly don't want to be on disability. I want to be a normal person and be able to work. I have a really great work ethic when I have a job where I'm not around people. So far I've worked laundry &amp; housekeeping and had one job for a year and another for 8 months and I had no trouble working. I loved it. I would come in early, leave late and work overtime and I would work my ass of. But all my other jobs like sales, retail, fast food and delivery have been nothing but hell for me. I can't do them. When I say I can't do them I mean I can't. I go into full panic mode as soon as anything goes wrong, I get anxious and shaky just from ringing someone up at the cash register and I have full blown anxiety attacks during the day. As for doing housekeeping/laundry, I can't do it now because the doc doesn't want me to, but also scheduling is much more strict with housekeeping and it's a schedule I can't do. 

Honestly I'm just lost. I have no idea what to do. I'm having a baby and I don't know how I'm supposed to make a living for my child if I can't be around people. I want to be a normal person and not feel so weird and I want to be able to handle stress like a normal person. I've tried exercises and putting myself in situations I'm scared of to try and ""cure"" my anxiety as per doc's orders but nothing has worked. I see my psych again soon, but maybe someone out there is like me and can give some insight as to how they manage.",01May2019,1
698,"So, I’m 18 weeks pregnant and living out of state with my fiancé. My mom is over the moon about getting her first grandbaby. 

My mom and I are best friends and always have been, she’s the best mother anyone could want and I hope I’m half as good to my baby as she is to me. 

My problem is, both of my parents smoke heavily and smoke inside their house. I don’t want my baby to be around smoke/smoking like I was when I was young. So I told her that if she wants baby to stay at her house, she has until baby’s born to stop smoking inside and get her house aired out. I didn’t think that was too much to ask but she got very upset.

She also thinks I’m being “a little extra” by going ahead and establishing my rules that no one can kiss my baby’s face and everyone needs the recommended vaccinations to be around my baby. And that kind of bothers me, especially with the measles outbreak and the growing number of people that don’t vaccinate. 

I’m not looking for anyone to bash my mom, she’s wonderful in every way, she’s just almost in her 70s and kind of set in her ways. I guess I’m just looking for some support and validation that I’m not being too much. Or if anyone knows of ways I can help her quit smoking or at least change the habit of smoking inside.

714,"Sorry in advance for the long post!

I (22, f) have known my best friend (26, f) for a little over a year. We met online on a dating site, went out once, and ended up become close friends instead of dating. We have gotten significantly closer over the last few months, and I came to see her as family.

 

I recently purchased my first home, a two bedroom condo, and asked my friend (we’ll call her Nora) if she would like to rent the other room from me. She was in a difficult position with her roommates at the time and was ecstatic to live with me. I was unable to move into my condo for about a month, as the floors were being replaced. Nora got into a huge fight with her roommates and ended up staying with me at my sister’s house until the floors were ready. After that, she moved right in, but was still stuck with rent at her old apartment. Since I try to be a good person/friend, I told her that I would be okay carrying the mortgage alone for a few months. I did not anticipate the fact that she would take this to mean that I would be supporting her.

 

I am not a confrontational person. I am generally quiet and can be a pushover, especially when it comes to friends. I know these things and I have been working on them. Nora was out of a job for a few weeks and borrowed $1500 from me to cover her rent and expenses. Then, when she found a new job and began working, everything went well for a few weeks. But she started calling in sick to her 30-hours-a-week job at least once a week. I don’t care what she does with her time, this is not an issue. The problem was that she would run out of money, ask to borrow my card or money for gas, for food, ask me to buy her dinner, etc. I have a hard time saying no, but I realized once my credit cards began to rack up that this would be unacceptable. I tried to talk to her about some of my financial and personal concerns, but nothing changed. The next time she mentioned that “we” needed to get groceries, I told her that I couldn’t spend much, since my card was maxed out and I’m still juggling finances from my home purchase. She went to food banks in the area and brought food home. I do not agree with taking donations meant for people in need, when she has a perfectly good job and simply spent the majority of her check on a new bong. I would have been happy to purchase groceries for the both of us, though definitely frustrated, but she acted like we were both destitute and didn’t mention anything about it to me until after the fact. I told her no offense, but I would not accept any of the food. She didn’t seem to mind, but now my fridge is full of (in my mind) stolen food that she still has barely touched. I was embarrassed and surprised at her seeming lack of integrity. I was raised proud, what can I say.

 

I’ve been taking some space from her, hoping for my feelings to calm a bit before I need to confront her about anything. But this last Saturday, she was pulling my car into the garage and scraped a good 18-24 inches across and all down the door. When she came in to tell me about this, she acted blasé about it.

“We need to get a quote for the paint on your car. It scraped the garage when I backed up.”

I was flabbergasted and didn’t really say anything to that, because I didn’t know how bad it was or what to even say. I checked it the next morning, saw how awful it looked, and I was pissed. I stewed for a while, but finally worked up the courage to confront her. I told her how frustrated I was, not only that she damaged my property, but that she hadn’t even apologized. She claimed that she had apologized and felt awful about it. I told her that I never heard the apology and that she owed me one. She apologized and said she was very angry at herself about it. I accepted her apology and took some more space. Since then, she has not brought it up once. She hasn’t spoken with her insurance, she hasn’t asked me how I’m doing with it all, etc.

 

This girl is my best friend. She’s been here for me, and I’ve been here for her.

720,"I hope the title is fairly self-explanatory, but to add some context I applied in April to attend a foreign summer school scheme operated by my university in London, and to my pleasant surprise I was picked! The exchange is to Hefei, China, and the flight time is 12 + 2 hours (the longest I’ve ever been in an airplane at once, as of writing, is about 4h 30ms).

Not only is it my first super long haul flight, but also the first time I’ll have to make a transfer at the airport, or a layover, or whatever it’s called. On the flight back to London, that layover is 9 hours long, making the trip 2.5hours + 9hours +12.5 hours for a whopping 24 hours, not including airport transfers or time milling about in departures. On one hand I’m looking forward to the new experience but on the other I’m absolutely dreading this, and additionally, having to do it twice in the space of 11 days.

723,"Hey guys, there was a girl that I used to talk to daily from late 2014 until early 2017. We grew very close, it was safe to say we eventually became each other's best friends. I developed feelings for her about a year into our interactions and made them known to her. She rebuked me gently, and things weren't weird after that. I didn't take it hard at all. But eventually we got close enough to the point where she would start flirting with me, asking me to stay up to text her, talking on the phone for an hour or so at a time, and it all led up to her asking me to come visit her in Shanghai, where she was studying at the time. I was so excited about the prospect that she might reciprocate my feelings,  so I agreed to save money to go see her.

&amp;#x200B;

But when the time came for me to buy a plane ticket, she stopped messaging me. I figured she was just busy, or that she had just changed her mind about wanting to see me, so I left her alone for about two weeks. This was the longest we had ever gone without talking to each other - we had been that close. Eventually I texted her to find out what was happening. She had removed me from skype with no explanation, and I wanted to know why. She gave a non-answer about how it wasn't a big deal. She then implied that I was some sort of rapey creep, out of nowhere, and told me I was being manipulative when I explained to her that I felt stuck. I was blindsided because I had never been talked to like this by anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

She then made fun of me for being depressed when my father had a heart attack. She would go months without any contact, and then send me GIFS or links to songs, as if nothing had happened. Whenever I brought it up she would just snap at me and shut me down, saying really hurtful things about what kind of person I was, to the point where I actually started to believe it about myself. We had a particularly bad argument in late 2017 and she blocked me for good. This period was very difficult for me, because I was left feeling confused and without answers, and I was left spending almost every waking moment examining myself, looking for the terrible things she said she saw in me. I kept thinking how easy it would've been for her to just be honest with me, instead of treating me like trash and hoping that I was the one to leave so she wouldn't have to take responsibility for what she wanted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually we started talking again about a year later, and she claimed that she didn't remember any of the things she said or did. She casually called me a doormat during this conversation, and told me how she couldn't be sympathetic to doormats. We had another argument because of this and now she has me blocked again.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do? It's pretty clear that I am never going to get any sort of clarity from her. I am tired of asking myself if she is evil or stupid. I still feel light-headed and used and misled whenever I think about this. There is still no closure. I used to go to therapy but I stopped - I get so angry every time I go to my therapist's office because I feel so humiliated about having to spend so much energy into dealing with things that were so casually inflicted, things that she supposedly doesn't even remember.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been almost 8 months since we last talked. I'm still occupied with this, I keep re-examining everything that's happened in the past few years, and I can't stop. What do I do? I have so much anger and resentment about how unnecessarily painful it had been. I just want to move on.",01May2019,1
724,"Struggled a lot with this. Since November. Got really bad but since April ish thought I had it under control and thought I manage to get everything under control through positive self talk (being my own best friend).

Really don’t want to go into too much details because that’s what makes me feel worse.

But I’m on holiday been having fun but today it all just hit me like a truck mentally and I’ve been trying to resist. But nah it’s 1am and I can’t take my mind off things.

Now I feel like I should just accept it because it comes and goes.

The things that make me lack self worth/feel hopeless include:

1.)My body and fitness - I’ve been going gym since I was 16 but my 4 years of lifting = a failure. I’m skinny fat and yeah. (Let’s not talk about this please ive made loads of threads on fitness subreddits and I think im finally making progress in the gym). It’s just something that will take a long time to fix and it’s making me hate myself atm. As if I need to be skinny or muscular to be happy 

2.) Feeling like an outsider. I have maybe 1-4 friends. Everyone else is just an acquaintance. I have no friendship group. I also have never been in a relationship. Just makes me feel like an outsider compared to everyone my age who talks about hooking up and relationships etc. I also dislike clubbing which makes me think that something’s wrong with me as most my age group like that type of thing

3.) Anxiety about the future. Not liking university as much. Also conflicting cultural values.

I seriously don’t know what to do/how to deal with these feelings.

726,"My parents have been married for 22 years. I moved abroad to study 4 years ago, still come back from holidays. 

My dad is a terrible person to my mother. He is manipulative and takes advantage of her. He’s a shitty father as well, but that isn’t pertinent to this topic.

He calls her a “fucking bitch” as if it’s nothing, has called her an “ugly old woman” countless times. It makes me fucking sick.  She is essentially his servant, but she gets treated far worse than a servant would be treated. I can go into more detail if necessary but to be honest I don’t want to unless it is absolutely necessary. 

She’s an incredible woman and she deserves so much better. And yet she hasn’t left him, despite all this. I told her a year ago that I just want her to be happy, and that she should leave him. If she is staying with him because of me - please don’t. I just want her to be happy.

On the other hand I don’t know what she would do. She is almost 60 and they have a prenup. 

I am really lost. It makes me so fucking sad when I’m abroad knowing that my mother is alone, on the other side of the world, being absolutely mentally degraded by him. She was in a very unhappy marriage before this. My mother has been unhappy for so long. I can’t stand it. I don’t know what to do.

728,"Hey, all. Half a lifetime ago, when I was a teenager, my first romantic relationship with someone was a true teenage drama - intense. True love, we will die together, all of that stuff.

After a couple of years (still teens), I ended it in the worst way possible. I near ruined his life. I know that he made through it and bounced back and as far as I know, has done well over the years.

I on the other hand, spent the next decade of my life continuing a crash course of destruction (you can see on what side the ""drama"" of the relationship originated). It took a few years after crashing to finally wake up and try to grow up. But still, even now, sometimes I'll still dream of that person and spend the next day in a storm cloud. If anyone has ever seen Westworld, how the Hosts' lifelike personalities are formed around a traumatic past memory, what I did to this person is my broken memory. But nothing broke me, rather, I broke someone else. And this has eaten me alive with guilt for a long time.

I'm here because of this: this weekend, I'll be working a shift with this guy's brother, who before recently, I hadn't seen since back then. We do shift work for a large organization, so I have only seen him twice in several years. The first time, it was pleasant - the interaction was based more on surprise, and I'm not sure he fully registered my place in history at the time. The next time I saw him, briefly, the recognition was there, but the pleasantness was not.

This weekend, we are scheduled a full day together. I am way better at dealing with social uncertainty and anxiety than I was back then, but I am still very anxious about this upcoming interaction. I am scared of continuing to reflect the selfish, repugnant beast that I was when he knew me last. I am scared of facing the person I used to be (and still am, but tempered, maybe). Essentially, I'm facing a representative of a past situation that was a major turning point in my life, in the worst possible ways, and I'm scared.

I'm having trouble coming up with a specific question to ask, but I am looking for any advice on how to ground myself in this situation. Because of anxiety, I have a tendency to lose control and start acting unlike myself, and then I see myself doing this, and then my behaviour amplifies further rather than settles down. I would like to know....how not to do that. In a specific situation like this, or in any, when socially-related anxiety gets the better of me.

731,"So, some backstory: I grew up with my sister wanting to be her own person since we're twins. This was completely okay, until she got a new best friend that she didn't want me to talk to. Let's say her name is 'L'. It started off as little things, like L calling me a bitch when she would pass me in the hall, but eventually escalated until she was spitting in my face in the locker room, shoving my clothes into the toilet, and telling me to kill myself on a daily basis.

I told school counselors what was happening as well as my parents, but it didn't really help. My mother hates her and doesn't allow her over to our house, but my sister doesn't really care for the rules my parents set and sneaks her over anyway. The only thing that happened with the counselor in HS was she put us in a room together and L screamed at me, blaming me for my mom hating her, as if her actions weren't what did it.

Now I'm in college and I thought it was going to be a fresh start. I'm joining clubs and making friends, but L keeps popping up to destroy what I'm trying to build for myself. I was voting out of president position for my favorite club because their friend group elected my sister and they took up every other executive spot by voting for each other. It's gotten so bad my parents are pushing for me to go to a different college.

Most recently, as of five minutes ago, L dumped a bunch of condoms in a plastic flowerpot outside my room. (the pot was free, and I was trying to get rid of it) The whole time my sister just stood and didn't say anything. She knows that if she speaks up L will lash out at her, and she won't have their friend group anymore because L is the ringleader. My sister is like a parasite, that needs someone to thrive off of cause she can't live on her own. Pushing L away is impossible for her.

The worst part? I can't even do anything. I filed a complaint earlier this year against L's friend group, and if they do anything against me again it'll most likely mean expulsion. This means my sister gets expelled too, and as much as I hate her siding with that monster instead of me, I don't want to get her kicked out of college for it.

 This summer I'll have a repreive, but then its back to the constant bullying. It's like I'm back in high school, nobody to turn to, my hands tied behind my back. So what can I do??

""The part Harold Hill (lead in the music man) was perfect for him, it allowed him to express his rapey charm.""

I always want to butt in to defend him, but I feel it would be wrong to do so since *he did rape someone so he freaking deserves to be shat on by others*.

737,"I just don’t know how to handle this life transition. I’m 22f

I’m graduating college and a lot of my friends are moving away. I’ve spent all of my memorable life in school. Surrounded by people with things constantly to be working on or events to go to. And now that’s all over. I don’t know anything other than being in college or grade school. I’m terrified.

My boyfriend of 2 years just broke up with me. It was sudden an unexpected and he was supposed to be a constant in my life, and knowing he was staying in the same city after graduation brought me a lot to comfort because we’d see each other a lot. But now that’s gone too and it’s exacerbating my fears of social isolation and my life generally just going downhill.

Because I got a scholarship to my college, my parents graciously decided to pay for my rent during school and so I lived in an amazing high rise for the last 4 years that is in walking distance to all these fun restaurants, bars, parks and all my friends. I definitely can’t afford that now, and now in 3 months I’m moving out of my apartment to the “suburbs” of the city and all of my friends will be a 15+ minute drive away. I at least will be living with 2 friends.

A lot of my friends have accepted amazing jobs where they are making $60-75k/year right out of college! And it seems their lives are upgrading. They all get to stay in the beautiful city in fancy apartments close to everything fun. Their lives are beginning. They have direction.

But I want to apply to PA school which requires thousands of hours of patient care experience prior to application. So I have to work a job that pays little money ($14/hour) for at least a full year to earn patient care experience. I’m applying next spring and my GPA is on the lower end and I’m terrified I won’t get accepted and then I have a useless degree in biology and I likely will just reapply next cycle which prolongs this standard of living that doesn’t excite me. Money is going to be tight.

Recently hes been helping about the house, redoing the bathroom, repainting the walls, gardening, etc. But other than that I don't think he does much. The only times he leaves the house is to meet with his probation officer, and for driving lessons.

So my friend forgot one of her belongings while staying over at my place. She asked me if I could bring it to her, and so I did. I didn’t think much of it and brought it with me and delivered it to her. A week later she messages me to say she had discovered it broken, and it probably happened while I was carrying it. She told me to pay half of the price for reparations, and I agreed, but I still feel somewhat annoyed. 

The backstory is that I feel this particular friend generally values materialistic things over friendships. She’s always been like this, and I have always tried to be the supportive and understanding friend, so I of course agreed to pay half of the price. She spends a lot of money on things and treatments, and is generally a lot more loose with the money spending than me, while still not being the person who buys christmas gifts or birthday gifts. Point being, she generally uses money on herself. 

My relationship with money is really difficult, and I am really careful with what I use it on. I never spend alot on myself, but I always buy my friends birthday/christmas gifts. The fact that I am so overly careful with money definitely colours my whole feeling of the situation. 

Now, I tried to put myself in her situation, and ultimately felt that I would probably ask the same from her (in a scenario where I wouldn’t, it would probably just be because I really doubt she would do the same for me). So I understand why she wants me to pay half the price. But I still feel annoyed, because it will be about $60 and I am really careful with my money, so having to spend it on this feels so wasted. I never tried to harm her belonging on purpose, I just wanted to deliver it to her since she forgot it.

I need advice on how to not let this influence our friendship. I feel like this is a waste of money, but I of course value our friendship over money. I just have a hard time dealing with it because I’m very unsure if she would do the same for me, and it feels so sour because I was just trying to help her by giving her back what she forgot. But I have already agreed on paying half, so I pretty much just need advice on how to deal with this myself on a personal level. How to not overthink, and how to just let it go.",01May2019,0

754,"I'm not good at coordinating my paragraphs and words and shit like that, but I'll try to explain this the best that I can.

My girlfriends family hasn't been perfect, not in a long time. The father tried to leave many years ago, but the mom begged him to stay. She needed him, and wanted her children to grow up in a normal household. He stayed, but somehow him staying turned out to be a bad decision.

He leaves every weekend and doesn't come back until he has to go to work on Monday morning. Everyone thinks he has been seeing another woman, and that's probably true. He spends money on random shit that he doesn't need (including 200 dollars on a mobile game **in a single day!**) when his kids don't have a decent meal half the time. He has his own fancy food that the kids get yelled at if they eat, while the kids only have ramen, sandwiches and spaghetti five nights out of the week. Refuses to cook. The mom has to bust her ass working and the stress is going to her head, and it's not looking good. She's trying to save up money so that the family can leave the dad, but the dad spends it all or gets pissed when the money is missing, and that's with the little money that she can save.

A few months ago, the mom got in a car accident and he refused to come, saying he was too tired to get up. He left her there alone. Didn't even ask if she was okay.

All this time my girlfriend and her sister have been stressed to the max, leading to them fighting with each other. They're no longer the sisters that they used to be. The stress is clearly wearing on them, and they both have had multiple mental breakdowns.

To make matters even worse, my girlfriends sister already has a bad past. Her uncle took nudes of her and her little sister while they were sleeping and pulled a gun on her dad. He was sent to jail, but her grandma got him out as soon as she could. The grandma has been abusing the kids ever since, and the dad still talks to her for whatever reason. She's been pushing him towards a divorce.

Last but sure as hell not least, things got really bad last friday. My girlfriend's sister (screw it, let's call the sister S, my girlfriend K, and the dad POS, because why not) was listening to K-Pop in the living room when POS came home, got drunk, and proceeded to tell her to turn her music off because it wasn't English. She did so, but he started yelling her for talking back and giving him attitude even though S didn't do anything. This resulted in a screaming match between the two, where he threatened to beat her head in and spanked her with a belt, causing bruises. K got hit with the belt on accident. POS screamed at her more, saying that he was going to get a divorce and it was all her fault. Keep in mind, this was when me and one of our mutual friends were there. The mom came home and put an end to things, but he still lives there and they can't leave.

K's family has no options, not enough money, nowhere to go. Stress is tearing the family into shreds, and I'm worried for their mental health. I don't know how to help or what to do.",01May2019,1
755,"Hi all,

I’m currently 18 years old. I graduate from high school in a few weeks, and I will be attending college.

However, I have been very privately working on creating my own business. My passion has always been sneakers and streetwear. I have been flipping streetwear since I was 15. There’s nothing I’ve ever enjoyed as much as doing what I do. I would like to take the next step, and sell through my own store and an online store as well. I have a clear vision, although I understand the risks. College could always be an option if I fail as well. 

However, I know my mom would be furious. I’ve slightly mentioned the idea in an optimistic way, and she immediately shuts me down. She will not care to listen to the idea for a second. If I were to tell her I don’t want to go to college for sure, I know that she would be livid at me. She will not listen to me. I really would prefer to not get onto bad terms with my mom like that for the next year.

Last few years have been a little tough for me. Between multiple surgeries, a marriage and subsequent divorce, my outlook on things hasn't been the best. I started a business in the middle of all this madness. I consider myself a rational person that understands life is not always great and bad things happen to everyone.

So, I emailed one of my instructors earlier in the year asking him if he’s teaching any classes in the upcoming semesters. He told me about one (1) in the Spring and said to check back about the Fall/Winter. 

In the meantime I registered in the Spring class, just in case there would not be opportunities in Fall/Winter. I don’t know if he knows I registered or not, but it’s 5 days before the class begins and he should have access to his class list as of now. 

I emailed again him recently to check back on Fall/Winter and he said there were two (2) classes. I said “Thanks” and he said “I would be glad to see you again in the Fall.” 

Now, this teacher knows that I am a student with an academic disability and that I have trouble managing my course work in a regular semester (4 months). The Spring course is really short (6 weeks)! 

Do you think by him saying to me “I would be glad to see you again in the Fall” he was essentially saying that he’d rather see me in his class in the Fall? 

Or do you think it’s just the case that he isn’t aware that I registered in his Spring course? 

Sorry if this is really silly, but it matters to me. He is a key instructor in my degree program, and I’d hope to be in line with what he wishes (or what makes his life less difficult, as he always has to work a little extra with me to get me through a semester).",01May2019,1

TL;DR  How to get to know a girl better that I rarely see in person but have her Instagram (but would rather get to know her in person)

&amp;#x200B;

So, there's a girl at my university that i would like to get to know better but I'm not sure how to go about it. I met her once at a party (although at this time I was with my ex), and for obvious reasons at that time I wasn't interested in her but I did think she seemed like a really cool person. Maybe a month later my ex broke up with me, and obviously I had a rough patch for a while (we had been together for a year and a half and we broke up in december), and while I'm still not 100% I'm feeling better now. So, back to this girl, shortly after the break-up I had a short course and guess who was in it? honestly at first I was still really down so I was just keeping to myself, however towards the end of the course I started sitting next to her and chatting to her a bit, but, even though I wasn't completely down, I wasn't really looking to do anything else, just chat. Fast forward to now, I've run into her at uni maybe a couple times and had nice conversations, however, I also added her on Instagram and I've replied to her stories maybe a couple times and there's really no conversation there at all (I'm not taking this as a negative indication personally because some people just don't enjoy messaging - myself included - and because when we talked in person it really seemed to well). 

&amp;#x200B;

So, what it comes down to is that I rarely see her in person so I can't really count on that to just happen, but I would like to get to know her better and I can reach her through Instagram, however if I just ask her to go for a coffee or something I think that'll come off too strong/direct and would thus probably not work in my favour.",01May2019,1

I honestly don't even remember any of the words we exchanged, but I do remember she was an asshole to me too, and yet I'm the bully? I don't know. I completely forgot about all of this until I was checking my old FB messages and saw hers. These days I like to think I'm a much different person. My friends tell me I'm the nicest person they've ever met, and that I go way out of my way to help people.

So I saw her messages and decided to apologize to her for the mean things that I said to her. Even if it happened so long ago. But for some reason I'm still indignant that she thinks that the bullying was one sided. In my message I left out all that she did to me and my friends and just apologized for my own behavior without pointing out all the things she did to me. It's been a year and she hasn't read the message yet, I think she's blocked me. But for some reason I'm pissed that if she reads that message she'll still think that she was innocent in what happened.

I try so hard to be a good person and help people and it would piss me off if she's spreading rumors about me being a bully. I mean, I'm not in school anymore, and this happened in grade 3, I barely even remember it, so why am I angry still? How do I let this go? It's been pissing me off for days.",01May2019,1
784,When I'm with my friends alone we always get awkward silences. Never when I am with my friend group but when we are alone we get that. It never got awkward when we were kids. Why does that happen now? Is It because we are too aware of it now or what? How do I stop this??,01May2019,1
785,"I apologize if this isn’t organized as well as it could have been and the length. 

I graduated from college with my bachelors degree in 2016. Upon graduation, I had accepted a job offer with a company 5 hours from my home town. I didn’t have a ton of friends back home, but they were all close friends and I saw them on a very regular basis. I took the job knowing it was going to be a challenge, but I was looking for a fresh start and decided to give it a shot. 

A little info on my job, I travel and work on computer software systems. I’m on the road pretty much M-F, 45 weeks a year. I live out of hotels in cities all over the country. On the road, I explore the city, go hiking, workout on a regular basis, and just enjoy seeing these places my job allows me to see. I work from my apartment when I do not travel. 

During my first year on the job, I made some close friends while in training. I joined company sports leagues, as I was not traveling yet, and had the time. Things were going great and I was loving it. 

I spend my free time working out, though I hate cardio. Going to watch sports, and nothing beats a concert or music festival. I like to hike and golf and play any potential sport there is. But things are less enjoyable by myself constantly. 

Now over the past 2.5 years, all of the friends I have made through the company have left for positions elsewhere. Most of them have moved away or just lost contact. So I’m seriously lacking in the friends department. I have also had no luck dating, I’ve had a few short term relationships that have lasted anywhere from 2-6 months, but nothing that seems to stick. My work usually is something they cannot adjust to. 

A few days ago the girl i has been dating for 2 months ended things. We had met on tinder. I had a strange feeling over the weekend as she started talking less, and downloaded tinder, and it showed she had updated her profile and placed new pics up that she had previously sent me. I felt betrayed that she was still using tinder, but she said it was just because she was “bored and curious.” After I asked her about it, because I was confused and hurt, she ended ended things. Her reasoning was “I just don’t have the time right now.” She also is graduating from college this weekend. The last few weeks when I have asked to hang out, she had been saying “I’m just too busy right now, but I’ll have much more free time soon.” So I was fine with it. We texted all day, and often times until late at night (1am or later) and easily send 200+ messages a day. When she ended things she also said “can we still be friends? I really enjoy talking to you and still want that.” She also said “it’s just not the right time and we can maybe revisit it in the future” 

I definitely didn’t handle the situation as well as I should have. I kind of had a bit of a meltdown and was upset. I feel like she found somebody else or better than me. (I’m an average looking guy, but on the chubby side, but I love lifting weights.) by she still claims I’m the only person she has been dating or talking to for the last 2 months. I want to believe her, because truthfully I don’t want to lose her friendship, she helps me feel good about myself, and I really have never had a bad time talking to her or spending time with her.  But I just don’t see a way to stay friends with her because I’m so hurt right now. This is just one of my issues. 

The last 2-3 months, my work has been extremely slow. I have been working from my apartment pretty much every week. This is a huge change of pace. And the longer this goes on, the more I realize how depressed I feel all the time. I rarely, if ever have any plans or anyone to hang out with. I feel lost and depressed constantly. Right now it may just be worse due to the recent break up. 

I’m not great at making friends as I don’t like bars or really drinking at all. I don’t know this city well enough to even know what to do or where to potentially make friends. 

With my lack of friends, I pretty much lay on the couch all day watching Netflix or playing video games. And then my usual 2 hours at the gym. I just feel so lonely all of the time. Also, none of my friends from my hometown have ever visited me in the 2.5 years here. Yet I go back home usually once a month to visit all of them. 

Today I had a performance evaluation. Things went well and I got high grades in everything. But I got some news I wasn’t too happy about. Last year, I had requested permission to move back to my hometown. I can pretty much live anywhere near an airport. My supervisor told me today that I cannot move back to my hometown, but maybe to a town that’s about 2 hours closer. Now this is nice and all, but I would be basically starting all over again in a new city. 

I have slowly started reaching out and looking for other job opportunities, in my home town, and maybe other positions that involve travel, but let me move back home. I honestly love my job and I am good at it. The lack of friends and people around me is starting to take a major toll on me. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m sad and depressed all the time, yet I act happy when needed. I haven’t been able to eat in 2 days and literally have cried myself to sleep once. I’m ashamed of that, like I feel so pathetic. I have no friends, and none of my old friends ever visit, or keep in touch. I’m hurt my friends don’t even really seem to care about me anymore. I just feel like nobody cares about me and I’m all alone in life. I’m worried things will just keep getting worse. 

Should I look for a new job that doesn’t involve travel or one back in my hometown? Should I stick things out and hope they improve? I just feel so lost in life and feel like things are getting worse and worse. 

Any advice about any of this is greatly appreciated.",01May2019,2
786,"My girlfriend and I have been together for a year. We often have tickle fights to be fun and playful. During the tickle fights, we often tickle each other’s feet. I always have bare feet while she always wears socks. We are often at her house where I do not have socks to put on, and removing socks is less work than getting socks to put on. I asked my girlfriend to remove her socks to make it fair, but she did not and she got annoyed. Was it wrong of me to ask her to remove her socks during the tickle fights?",01May2019,0

789,"So I ride the train to school everyday then after the train a bus. Sometimes in the morning I see this girl. Same girl almost everyday. I always recognize someone when I see them more than once but I don’t if she recognizes me. We make eye contact a lot but that’s because I stare at everyone (creepy I know, I was diagnosed with aspergers in 8th grade and I can’t really approach people unless it’s an emergency or really urgent. And I did research after I was diagnosed and it said people with aspergers tend to stare like me. My doctor confirmed it) so should I approach this girl and say hi? I don’t really know what to say. We usually are near each other boarding the train and exiting the train. We have the same getting on station and getting off station. And I’m pretty sure she is around my age. What do I say? Do I say anything at all?",01May2019,1

792,"For the past two years I’ve liked this one guy. For the first year, we became friends and talked everyday in our classes together. Then, he transferred schools. We never talked outside of school so we didn’t keep in touch. For the most part I got over my crush, but it was still there in the back of my mind. The next school year, he’s back. As soon as I saw him I could feel my feelings for him come back in full force. We still haven’t talked in person since I’ve seen him. I don’t even know why I still like him. I assume it’s just because I’m so used to it but I don’t know. How do I get over him? I’m sick and tired of liking someone I never even interact with anymore.",01May2019,1
793,"Hi so I was talking with my other friend at this table, where this girl I’ll call her “Sammy” She was putting her legs on my seat (nobody was sitting there, she was doing it as a joke) and she’s done this before and i put her legs off my chair and she fell, assuming it was on purpose. No, it wasn’t. 
 She didn’t break any bones, nothings hurt or damaged. But she went to the nurse for no reason though. 
 Anyways, my other friend “Tamya” Said that I should give her brownies for that, because she gets mad easily, so I did. (65 cents each, and I bought two) 
I went to the nurse and gave it to her, where she was sitting in a seat reading(no ice packs or anything)  and I gave it to her trying to gather my words, whilst she was saying “I already ate,” and “I had enough candy” (me being that social awkward kid I gave it to her without really saying much and left) 
 So after lunch was over, we went to french(yes we share the same schedule) and she ignored me and talked to Tamya the whole time.
 I know I’m overreacting when I say this, but she broke my arm,(5 weeks of the cast) and should I be offended? Or am I just overreacting?",01May2019,1
794,"To me it feels that when ever I date someone I have hesitation and some reservations I put aside and kind of put on a good show.

This happened with my first girl friend. I got to know her, we went on a few dates, and that was really it. I broke things off after a month and a half. I just never felt like she was the one for me. I had a crush on her for the longest time and during the first few weeks of dating I felt on top of the world, like I hit the highest point in my life. But four weeks into our relationship I started to not feel the same. I just felt different in a way, I don’t really know how to describe it but just felt different. We continued dating for about two weeks and I had put on a good show. But after that I told her how I felt. I had said I lost interest and just didn’t feel the same about her. I still wanted to be friends but that never worked out.

Now me and my sisters best friend are together in a way (we’ve know each other for about two years). It hasn’t been long enough to be called dating but I know that she does like me. At first I was all for it, she seemed like the one for me at the moment. Now keep in mind our prom was all of a week ago and we’ve hung out a few days since then. So that moment was not too long ago. Personally now I just feel like it’d be better off to just be friends. I feel like I’m going to lose interest like I did with my first girl friend. I don’t want the same thing to happen where she can’t look at me the same and that we can’t be friends. This is the thing my mom had kind of warned me about. That if we started to be together that stuff most likely won’t be the same if something changes. Nothing note worthy has really happened. We’ve cuddled and that’s been about it. Don’t get me wrong cuddling is great but it’s not too far into anything. But if I were to get out now it’d probably be best to do it sometime soon. 

What’s your advice? Should I ride it out and see if it changes or do I just cut it off before anything really serious happens?

796,"I'll try to keep it as simple as possible...

I have been friends with my ""best friend"" for about 10 years. Over the past few years I have gotten married, bought a house, and had a baby. She lives on the other side of the country with her boyfriend, so we have been living very diffrent lives the past few years. She recently became engaged and asked me in many ways including elaborate gifts to be her maid of honor. In November, she came to visit me at my new house that I had spent the past year renovating. She did not include her fiance in this trip, but I figured she wanted to spend time with me. I spent the trip trying to cater to her while she acted stuck up and as if nothing was good enough for her. The next weekend I took a romantic trip with my husband to vegas, the first since the baby was born. On my last day she sent me a text message saying that she doest not want me to be the maid of honor, in the wedding party at all, but I can still come to the wedding? She has not spoken to me since and its may.

We have all the same mutual friends and it would be weird not to go socially, but personally I feel so hurt and confused. I have to RSVP to the wedding by the end of the month. The wedding is a 3.5 hour plane ride away and 2 weeks before I take a family trip with my husband and toddler which will be a 13 hour plane ride and a month long trip. 

Should I go to the wedding or count this as the loss of a close friendship?",01May2019,2
797,"I just moved cross-country to a place I've never even visited before, tonight is my first night here. I don't have a job yet, I don't know how I'm going to find roommates. I don't know why I did this. I don't know why I do the things I do. I literally had a panic attack and decided to move instead of repairing the relatively minor things I was dealing with and that's it.

I had to end things with my partner, which is probably why I'm so upset right now. It's definitely why I almost just started crying when I realized they don't sell the brand of beer he drinks here. We weren't even together that long, but it was just so nice to feel cared for and now I have nothing and I did this to myself and there's no going back.

I don't want to kill myself, I have before that's not where I'm at right now, but I do want to have never existed in the first place.

800,"This isn’t as serious as most posts here but I’m a little lost on what to do. My car was broken in to and my laptop and mouse were stolen. It was only about 2 years old and a $1000 asus ROG.

Recently my drawing tablet broke though rendering drawing on my laptop useless. 

I’ve been considering getting a second generation iPad Pro 10 inch over a new laptop and drawing tablet since I’d been considering one before. And the iPad is only $500 versus the $1000 laptop and new drawing tablet.
