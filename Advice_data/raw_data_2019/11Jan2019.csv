0,I graduated college and I have a great paying job and a house. But I'm so fucking anxious 24/7. My legs are numb all time with a tingling feeling shooting through my body. I cant pin-point what's causing it. Anyways I want help and I'm a little nervous to tell ny family for help. Anyone know the best way to go about this? ,11Jan2019,1
1,My bf(21) got really drunk after a fun weekend and before falling asleep he wanted to confess everything. He told me when he was 15 he had groped one of his friends and still regrets it. After I heard this I was completely taken aback because he's so nice to everybody even though he comes from a very abusive past and now I don't know how I feel about it? I feel disappointed but can I assume that he really changed?,11Jan2019,1
2,"Im 21 now, still living at home. Since high school, I've been bouncing around to different jobs with low pay and no growth opportunities; either getting laid off, fired, or just bailing and moving on to another dead end job. I want to move out and progress in society, but I honestly don't know where to start. My parents have coddled me my whole life and never pushed me to do anything. I look at my peers, the ones who also never went the college route, and see alot of them excelling further than I have. I don't want life to pass me by. :(",11Jan2019,1
3,"Hello, thank you for reading. I work at a nursery on an apprenticeship and I kind of want to leave but kind of don’t. 

Firstly, my boss can be really nice or horrible. I panic on my way to work as I know that for the first hour she is bitchy and makes snide comments and remarks. 
But on the other hand, she will give me bags and clothes and occasionally buy us food 

This isn’t where my problem is. My minimum wage is £3.70 an hour. She wants to set a ‘flat rate’ for my hours and pay me £600 a month. The problem is; I worked 200 hours in one month and only got paid £600 for it. That is £3 per hour. Everytimw I mention is she says we will discuss at another time , or that that is the rate I am paid at as I’m ‘not on an hourly rate’. 
Second problem is school runs. I am on a mileage based policy with my car set for 6000 miles a year, it may not sound a lot but is all I need for work commute and rec use. 
She will send me in school runs 2x a day and dropping a child off before going home. She never offers petrol money. I feel like I cannot ask for this money however as she will be off with me for weeks as it has happened before. It must cost me £80 a month in petrol and at £3 an hour I just cannot afford it. I will also have to pay extra on my car insurance to cover extra miles travelled. 
Third problem is her laziness. I will literally- and I mean literally- do EVERYTHING for that woman whilst at work. I change, feed and settle every child, I wash up, vacuum, you name it. If I was to do much as leave one dirty cup out I would be sent a text that evening with a remark like ‘thanks for leaving this for me’. She will sit on Facebook all day or claim she is tidying the office- (which she has been doing for 3 days now)

I am getting to the end of my tether. I don’t want to leave as I enjoy my job but cannot deal with her constant attitude and moodiness. Some days I feel like crying because of her temper and mood. 
I am at a loss here. Please could anyone advise me on anything to do. Thank you ",11Jan2019,1
7,"I'm 17 so I like to sleep a lot and also am always tired. Therefore in the morning, when it's cold (I'm always cold EXCEPT after a night of sleep, so it's a unique feeling that I know I will feel again in only 24 hours) and the bed is so comfy, I usually stay in bed until I have to run to get dressed, organise my things and run to school (I usually skip breakfast which is not a good idea I know) 
I just wanted to ask if anyone had tips on getting up as soon as the alarm goes off? How do you all motivate yourself? The sleep temptation and warmth of the bed is just so hard to fight, is motivation really all you need? I'm too weak!! ",11Jan2019,1
8,"I, 21F, recently moved to the same town as my youngest sister (32) and my oldest sister (34) who has a husband and two children. 

I did this because I felt depressed and rootless where I was before. I lived with my best friend, who rarely was home. I was lonely, ate a lot and cried a lot. I, quite impulsively, actually, signed a lease, took a loan and moved closer to my family.

My oldest sister had for many years talked about how it would be amazing to have the whole family in the same town. I looked forward to seeing them more and I felt like that might help my mood a lot. However, I quickly found out that she didn’t want to see me more than she used to. She actually thinks I spend too much time with her, call her too much, etc. 

The thing is, I don’t call, I don’t write her.  I spend Christmas with her and the family and then New Years like I always do. Apparently, that was too much for her. That makes me really sad and makes me feel even lonelier than before. I feel rejected.

My oldest nephew (14) don’t want to see me at the moment - apparently he’s tired of me. I took him to see Fantastic Beasts 2 in November. His “quota” is now used up, he says. Fair enough, I don’t push him to do anything and I never write or call him. I really don’t have any contact with him. 

However, my youngest nephew (11) is absolutely over the moon that I moved closer to them. He visits me in the weekends, we watch a film and he gets a cup of tea before biking home. He is always the one to ask if he can come around and I never write him nor call him out of respect for his mother, who is afraid I’m being too pushy. 

This is where I’m torn: I’ve decided that I want to move again. I feel out of place where I live. There are no young people and the school I go to is filled with older people or young people who has children. The city I live in now is a city for growing up and growing old.  Not living your life as a twenty-something. The city is dead, is what I’m trying to say.  So I want to move closer to my friends, change school so I can make new friends maybe, who knows?

I’m just conflicted, because my sister says I’m being selfish and egotistical for moving closer to them, mostly the children, and then leaving them behind. My youngest nephew is autistic and might take it harder than other 11-year-olds, she says. Am I being a bad aunt? Should I stay? 

I feel like I’m giving away an opportunity to grow as a person and getting to know new people by staying. Here, I primary am alive for my family. If I move, I might want to be alive for myself. 

Reddit, help, please.. What do I do?",11Jan2019,1
9,"I've been dealing with low self esteem for most of my life (mostly due to bullying in early years for being the fat kid in class) and with depression for about 4-5 years by now. 

One of the main issues according to my therapist is that I actively dislike myself both in terms of how I look and how I act (I have a serious case of the people pleasings, to the point where I go out of my way to tell people what they want to hear instead of what I want myself). She tells me I need to pat myself on the back every day just for being me, but I feel weird doing that and usually can't bring myself to it.

If anyone has been in a similar situation, what did you do to start liking yourself for who you are? And if you haven't been in the situation, any tips and advice is hugely appreciated nonetheless.",11Jan2019,1
10,"This is my first niece and my first time being an aunt so I’m super excited! We planned that when she was going to be induced or in the hospital I would housesit and watch her dog for her (he’s less than a year old and a little bit of a rascal but i love him lol) 

Anyways I’m here to ask you what I should get them:
My plan was to get a few balloons and put them in the baby’s room and something that says “Welcome Home (insert baby name)”. And then I wanted to possibly get my sister something that she can use post pregnancy to help? Blankets? Coffee anything? 

That’s why I need your help! I want them to come home surprised and already have a small nice gesture to feel a little less worried about being new parents. But I’ve never had a baby myself and was hoping other moms or dads or even anyone who has seen someone go through pregnancy could have me suggestions of things that both she would like and that the dad may like?

Thankyou all! ",11Jan2019,1
11,"Yesterday I downloaded the gmail app on my phone. I was just looking around in the app, and I stumbled across “recently used devices.” I recognized all of the devices as mine, except for the very last one, which caught my eye because it said it was accessed on December 23rd from a location 300 miles away, however, it was a location I immediately recognized as my ex-roommate’s hometown. Before that, the device last synced to the gmail account on December 13th from the location in which I used to live, and where my old roommate still lives. 

I know it has to be her, and I know this because in SEPTEMBER OF 2017,  I borrowed her computer to send a few emails, as I was applying for jobs but my computer was broken. I thought I logged out on her computer, but it didn’t really even cross my mind all that much, as we were good friends and I trusted her. Unfortunately, the living situation turned extremely toxic last year due to the influence of another roommate, and long story short, I was essentially vilified and bullied in the household by 3 of 4 roommates. I was eventually able to get out of the lease and I moved to a nearby city in May, and cut all contact with the 3 roommates. I blocked them on all social media, and I blocked their phone numbers. I haven’t spoken to, seen, or interacted at all with any of the girls since then, and quite frankly haven’t even thought all that much about any of them. 

My discovery yesterday made me extremely uncomfortable. I have a lot of very personal information on my google account, including pictures, emails to my ex-boyfriend, medical information, job applications, and things like that. The idea that someone who dislikes me might’ve been reading my most personal information and conversations for months is really bothering me, as well as the fact that it was so recently, on December 13th and then again on the 23rd, which indicates to me that it was probably a regular thing. The nature of their friend group is so horrible and toxic that I can picture them all sitting around, reading my emails and laughing about it. Actually, I think it’s probably very likely that was the case. 

I don’t know what to do now. I did change my password, obviously. I feel pretty stupid now for not changing it sooner. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt, because reading someone’s personal conversations months after you lose contact is pretty creepy. Is it possible that because my account was still just in her computer, and that’s why her device would show up in the recently active devices? Is it worth pursuing the issue further, and requesting to retrieve the login records from google before the last 28 days? Do I confront her about this, or even go as far as pursuing a case, or should I simply let the issue go altogether and take comfort in knowing that I’m the bigger person? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and let this serve as a reminder to change all of your passwords if you haven’t in a while! ",11Jan2019,1
12,"So after living the last couple years of my life with a cynical outlook and having a toxic and shut in personality, complete with self hate and hate for others, I have finally been able to see what I did wrong and turn my life around. I started to improve my own life by fixing my weight and body image and have been able to repair relationships and gotten rid of negative or pessimistic thoughts. One problem that still remains is my lack of emotions from that depressing period of my life. I realized that while I fix these things, I still lack the ability to feel empathy,sympathy, or even true sadness and happiness.

13,"so this is a really serious topic. We broke up yesterday after about 8 weeks of dating because she’s so stressed out that she doesn’t think she can handle a relationship with a lot on her mind. i’m a 15 year old (M) and I’ve liked this girl alot ever since I met her 3 months ago. I don’t want her to think that she has to leave this planet in order to be happy. She tells her parents what’s on her mind and ‘they don’t know what to say’ is what I heard from her. She says that she’s toxic to me and I don’t see how as I genuinely care about this girl and I don’t wanna see her like this as I would towards any other person. We broke up over a FaceTime call yesterday and she said she “needed time to find herself” and so I let her go. she’s still in my life as of now but I don’t want her to kill myself and to be honest, I don’t know what to say either.

14,"I'm currently working a co-op with a company I really like in my current field. Great. Issue is, I can't seem to stay awake at work. Now this isn't a new issue-I've had trouble with it in college, high school, and outside of school(to a lesser degree). At certain semi-random intervals during the day, my brain decides it's time to sleep, which means my head droops and my eyelids demand to close(or my eyes start hurting until I close them).   


How can I avoid this?  


For the record: I get about 8 hours of sleep a night. I fall asleep pretty quickly and don't wake up in the middle of the night(if I do it's a rare occurrence). I also have a deviated septum which significantly blocks off breathing on one side of my nose(surgery is gonna happen soon). I do drink coffee in the mornings, however this problem can occur during the mornings. It happens at all hours of the day-mornings, in the car, at work, even at home while I'm gaming sometimes.   


Anyone got any recommendations? ",11Jan2019,1
15,"There's this one girl who I've been friends with since last year when we both had the same Algebra class together. We were then and still are to this day. However, since the beginning of the school year, we've actually become great friends, we've gone far enough to claim that we're best friends. We talk to each other almost every day and are typically gregarious of one another. We get along tremendously well and always enjoy being around one another despite our obvious quirks (her ADHD and my Asperger's). However, I feel something's been off recently. I don't know what it is, but it's nagging at me in the back of my thoughts. I keep thinking that I'm not good enough and that I've seen despite recently. Nothing's really changed in terms of how we interact with each other. We still have genuine and companionable conversations. I don't know, I just feel as if I'm being too clingy and maybe pushing her away. This has happened many times before with other girls. We start out in a friendly way and then I become too pushy and end up separating us. It's happened with two girls who I now rarely speak to because of how far apart we've grown. I'm afraid of that happening again. I don't want to lose this friend, I already feel alone despite having many close friends. There's just something at play here. Is it my intuition telling me to stop or am I just worrying myself to death? Should I talk to her about how I feel? I feel that might make it worse.",11Jan2019,1
16,"So my friend draws pentagrams for me and my brother saw them and told my mom. He ripped up the drawings that he spent tons of time on, and his is how the conversation went:

“We will NOT allow that in our house. I should ground you right here and now but because it’s your first time I won’t.”

23,"I am 20 years old, in university, and increasingly tired of being around my parents, who insist I leech off of them and do nothing. They say I’ve always been lazy and revel in comparing me to my younger brother, who is basically a good old country boy.

I got my first job when I was 15 and have almost always had one since. I want to be a journalist and started writing for newspapers when I was 17. Last semester my parents urged me to not work so I could focus on school and make all As and Bs. I wound up making Bs and Cs.

I’m home for break right now. I’ll call my mom asking for money every now and then so I can get some food. She gets really angry at this, but I don’t know what she expects. I have a month and a half off from school for winter break and didn’t bother to get a part-time job. No one said I should and I’m not sure who’d hire me for a month. 

I try to do the dishes and keep the house clean since I’m at home all day while my brothers are at school and my parents at work. There’s not much to do. I do the dishes and take out the trash. They still insist I’m lazy and do nothing all day.

Another point of conflict comes from me asking for her to do something for me; for years I’ve had gynecomastia (basically man boobs) as a genetic condition. I’m really skinny and go to the gym every day, so it’s not fat. Surgery is the only way to deal with it. Last semester I nearly shot myself in the head in part because I was tired of people talking about my chest, and my parents, when they found out, agreed to pay for the surgery. It’s been months and nothing has happened to set it up. We’re a relatively wealthy family. My mom tells me she’ll call, but when I ask if she did later she screams at me and says I’m a leech because my bank account has gone over or something like that.

I’m increasingly convinced I should drop out of school so I don’t have to rely on them anymore, get a job, and not speak to them.

27,"Hey guys! Bear with me as I JUST got this phone call from my daughter and I myself am still trying to calm down. A little background: My daughter is the best. Everyone says it but I mean it, I have been blessed with an amazing kid. Selfless, loving, caring, respectful, amazing manners, maybe a little weird, but I love her weirdness. This past few months alone, she has won ‘student of the month’ for her entire school. She got to meet the mayor and obviously was a big achievement for her. She won an Art Award with her artwork displayed downtown and awarded at our town hall meeting, also a very proud moment. And just last month she won her school spelling bee. Huge deal being a 4th grader and beating all of the 5th/6th graders too. Regardless of me being a “teen mom”, I’m obviously doing something right. 
Of course, here is the bad thing, I cuss. I cuss a lot. Not directly TO her, or AT her, but I do cuss. She knows not to cuss, and she’s never gotten in trouble for cussing and I’ve never heard a bad word slip from her tongue. My precious daughter still considers ‘stupid’ a bad word and was raised not to say ‘hate’. Because we don’t hate anything, maybe dislike something, but never hate. Anyways, here is where I need advice. I need to know how to approach this situation tomorrow in front of her teacher and principal. Here is the situation: My daughter calls me crying, barely able to breathe so I know something is wrong I tell her to calm down, just talk to me. She literally can’t calm down. I say “ OK, take your time. Let me know when you’re ready”. After a few minutes, she begins to tell me “I know I’m not allowed to cuss. I’m so sorry Mama but this happened to me at school today” All while still sobbing between every single word. She goes to say “this boy has been following me, taking my bus and after we get off the bus he says things like ‘you want to fuck? want me to fuck you? you want to go fuck? come fuck me!’”and she literally is breaking down sobbing. I don’t know what to do next. I tell her to calm down and not to worry I’ll be home soon and I’ll take care of it. I asked for the boys name, I ask her if he is in her class, where he lives does, he live near us? I’ll be home soon and will take care of it. Tomorrow I’ll be down and speak to her teacher and the principal and make sure that boy is nowhere near her anymore. She says okay, we say our I love you’s and hang up. My poor daughter. My daughter doesn’t even know what that fucking means and I am on fucking fire!!!!  If I were to be anyone right now, I am anger from the movie inside out. I am in flames!!!!! I’m thinking “I want to beat this kids ass and I want to beat his moms ass too because no one talks to my fucking kid like that “ My daughter is too precious, too innocent, too beautiful to have to deal with an immature little piece of shit like that.

I want that kid NO-WHERE NEAR MY DAUGHTER! I feel like I’m gonna be there and something is gonna upset me and like a flip of a switch, I’m gonna lose it. I want that kid out of her class, I don’t want him taking her bus, but I don’t feel like my daughter should have to move classes since she’s doing so well and has a great relationship with her teacher. She’s doing great this year, I don’t want something like this to ruin anything for her. I’m packing up my stuff for the day, I’ll be on my way home in a few. Any advice would be appreciated.

29,"So I want to start by saying I’m in 9th grade, and have never been “bullied” in my life. I’m on the soccer and track team, and go to all the practices, so I’m in shape. 

Ok, introductions over. We just got back from winter break, and all my classes are the same, and so are all the students. In PE class, there’s this one kid on the wrestling team, and he has a stick up his rear end at all times. That being said, the kid has never had a problem with me and we’ve never talked. Right before we got into school, I accidentally fractured both of my pointer fingers while skating in the park. In an everyday gym class, we start by doing warmups, such as stretches, then we do a few exercises, such as push ups. Most kids in the class don’t fully do the exercises because the teacher is busy with his phone. After I finish my sit-ups, I stop my exercises because I know I can’t do push ups with broken fingers. I look around the room, and the wrestler kid is glaring at me. I look away, and when we all stand up to do push ups, he walks over to me, stares me in the eyes, and walks away. I shrug and sit down. He sits a few feet away and whispers very loudly to his friends, “that’s the kid that doesn’t do his exercises, I don’t like him.” We continue class and the day finishes. I figure he was just playing and when I come back the next day, he walks into class smiling. I’m certain he knows I have a broken finger and I know he doesn’t care. I feel like he just doesn’t like me. We get to the pushups. I hear laughing, I look in the direction of the noise, and the kid is staring at me again. He makes a motion with his fingers symbolizing the slicing of his throat with his finger. This is an obvious threat in my opinion. When we go sit down he sits behind me and starts poking me in the back and his friends laugh. He whispers to me, “you’re dead.” I turn around, tell him to shut up, and he laughs and we finish the class. I’m not sure what to do, since I’ve never had problems with anyone before. I’m not sure what he’ll pull tomorrow, but I don’t like the way this is heading. I also don’t want to be the kid that tells the teacher, because I very well know he won’t care and the kid will continue in and outside class. What should I do? ",11Jan2019,1
30,"So my boyfriend (m,32) has been teaching me (f31) to snowboard. We have been twice this year twice last year and I've been slowly improving, but not as quick as I would like but I'm having fun so I'm ok improving slowly because I am having fun. However I'm slow and still have some fear so my boyfriend is often left standing in the snow, or waiting on me which I know gets frustrating. It's cold!

However,  he got mad at me for not listening to his directions, and trying to go down the hill to slowly because I don't like going fast yet. Long story short with him being mad because I'm not challenging myself, and he has to stand around and freeze waiting for me. I get that. What I don't get is him cussing at me, and when we finally finished talking said as much and got mad at him for cursing at me.

It turned into him yelling at me for calling him out on that. Then yelling at me in front of alot of other snowboarders and storming off for 10 minutes while a group of snowboarders told him lay off me and comforted me when he went inside and I started crying.

I road up with two skiers when he came back out and he rod ahead of us, he was gonna ride up with me but I didn't want to. I rode down with the two skiers who were being nice to me.. I felt humiliated. For him making a fight so public and for not getting to have fun snowboarding instead of him trying to push me and cussing at me.

He feels like I wasn't trying hard enough and wasn't listening to his directions, which I was but with some reservation because I'm still a bit afraid of falling. I would understand that and be willing to apologize for that expect for the cussing, and meanness he exhibited. Which is what got me pissed in the first place.

He also says I tend to shut down when he's critical (I do, only when he starts cussing though) because he usually rips into you because he thinks it's the only way you will listen. But why would I want to talk to someone who makes me feel so bad?

It brought about alot of other issues in our relationship when I got back to the room and we talked. Him working to much, me feeling neglected, him not knowing if he wants a future together, him acknowledging he feels like he's sacrificed our relationship for his company, me admitting I have communications issues, partly from feeling neglected.

We've decided to take a break. I'm going back home tomorrow, and going to do my degree online I've been working on. I'm moving out all my stuff.

This feels silly. I am a self-employed young person who has a hard time saying no. I have a very pushy, entitled client who regularly crosses boundaries. He recently asked me to work for free, and in my shocked state, I froze and agreed to do it. I need to find a way to say ""No, I can't do that."" I need to make a point to draw a boundary because if I'm not 100% clear, I know he will try to wiggle his way back into getting the work done for free. He's a ""give an inch, take a mile"" type of person. Here's what I have so far. Is this good enough?

""Dear Client,

I rethought our discussion last visit about me working “off the clock”. I wanted to reach out to you and let you know that I won’t be able to provide uncompensated work. I feel that it is both fair and appropriate for me to ask to be compensated for my time. If I don’t respect my own time, I can’t expect others to do the same. Thanks for understanding.

Sincerely,

32,"I bought a driving package which consists of 6 lesson which cost $595 total. The lessons were

 **Lesson 1: Basic Driving**This lesson is used to determine if the driver can control the vehicle safely.  
**Lesson 2: Arterial Driving**This lesson is used to determine if the driver understands signs, signals, and pavement markings.  
**Lesson 3: Parking**This lesson covers hill parking, parallel parking, and backing around a corner.  
**Lesson 4: Freeway Driving**This lesson covers freeway driving including entering, exiting, merging, and lane changing.  
**Lesson 5: Pre-test**This lesson tests drivers on arterial driving, lane changing, parking maneuvers, and response to controlled and uncontrolled intersections.  
**Lesson 6: Skills Improvement**This lesson covers the skills that driver's need to prepare for the Washington State Department of Licensing test.

I didn't know that your personal information, including your name and address, was publicly associated with the website! I immediately started to get tons of junk mail, and I was afraid the neighbors at the apartment I was living in at that time would find out. Thankfully, as far as I know, none did.  


I found out that you could go through the web hosts to anonymize yourself (which I really wish they did by default!) and over the next few months, the letters slowed to a trickle, and seemingly stopped. I hoped that they'd stopped for good.  


I moved into a house recently, and hadn't gotten any more junk mail about the web hosting... until today. Thankfully it at least didn't have the (extremely suggestive) website name printed on the outside of the letter, like many of the earlier ones did! But still, if it went to the wrong neighbor, and they opened it, it could spill the beans. And now, I'm surrounded by a bunch of bored, retired boomers, who I'm sure would love to have some gossip about the new guy!  


I really don't care about the website that much. I haven't updated it in some time. It probably brings in a modest amount of traffic to the pages where I sell my stuff, but I honestly don't mind shutting it down and creating a new website (anonymously, this time!)  


So, finally, my question: what's the best way to avoid getting a ton of possibly embarrassing junkmail? Would letting the website registration lapse make matters better, or would it just mean getting a bigger influx of junkmail? Thanks in advance for any help you might have!",11Jan2019,1
35,"I was just curious if this was something typical. Or ever heard of. 
My cousin “committed suicide” last week. It was just him, his 2 year old daughter, and girlfriend in the house. 
She claims that he said he couldn’t do this anymore &amp; shot himself in the head. What led up to this she refuses to disclose as she claims she was advised not to (allegedly by the police) tell the family any details until she’s cleared. Is this something the police would tell someone? Also the police have pretty much hinted that what she said happened appeared true but for whatever reason she hasn’t been officially cleared. 

Our family is so shocked as he did not seem depressed or ever suicidal. He did recently get out of jail and was having a really tough time finding a job. He did also have a rough life. He always seemed like the rock of the family though. 

His gf and him had a history of domestic related issues and just a toxic relationship for years. 

If a lawyer or police officer told me not to tell my bf’s family the details of his death I wouldn’t care. Especially if I was innocent. My story wouldn’t change and I would want to give them closure.

49,"I apologize in advance for my English; this story is long.

My parents separated when I was 4 y/o over my dad's drinking problem, which only got worse after that. He showed up sometimes perhaps until I was 6, but he was in a conflict with my grandmother from mother's side, so I saw less and less of him -- each time they met, it was a scandal, and me and my mom, we lived at my grandmother's.
Usually I saw him once a year for my birthday, or got a phone call, mostly he called when he was drunk, and when he was, sometimes he breathed over the phone, it was awkward. And around my age of twelve, he showed up drunk and when kissing goodbye, and telling me how much he loves my mum and misses her, he moved his tongue and lips on my cheek, like kissing with tongue, but not on my mouth, just the cheek. Also, heavy breathing.
At that time, it was not something I was familiar with, but it felt wrong and I was disgusted and ashamed, and at the same time, I loved my dad and felt bad for him, so I didn't tell anyone.
I didn't see him much, but this thing with cheek and neck repeated perhaps twice when he came drunk to see me, and I wasn't feeling comfortable, so at some point I told him over the phone that I won't be able to go out to see him (he usually called before coming over, and just waited outside for me to go out and see him). 
Sometimes he was sober when he called, and that was okay, but he called less and less. Me and my mother, we moved out, he came to visit once, I was careful not to be left alone with him. 
When I was 15 he married again, and had another daughter, then another, then he got divorced and lost everything he had in the city (my mother didn't ask him for anything, I think she loved him more than his second wife, haha). And so he moved to his parents, who live in the country, about 4 hours ride from the city I live in.
I saw them once when I was 3, my parents and I went for a visit together, but I remember them and the place a bit. And each year for new year and for my birthday I got a greeting card from them, and as I was getting older, they started sending small sums of money, which I felt bad about, because I was living in the city, and they seemed to be poor, so I asked them not to send money and they stopped but wrote cards, and I always replied. Actually I say ""them"", but it was just my grandmother writing and sending money.
When I was about 18 y/o, the age of mobile phones took over, and I got one, and I started getting calls from dad, and sometimes he handled the phone to my grandmother. She always asked me to come over, and I felt guilty about declining, but I was a bit scared to stay alone at the place where my dad was, because at that point I realised the ""kisses"" meaning. I am not saying that my father is a molester, i think he's just an alcoholic, perhaps I was reminding him of my mom (I thought a lot about those episodes, trying to explain them to myself somehow), but still I was afraid to stay with them, thinking that at best that would be uncomfortable, and at worst terrifying, and I would have no means to escape home if something goes wrong - it's a village, bus goes once a day from nearest city.
So I always told how I was busy studying, and that it'd be hard for me to go alone to them. I asked my mother to come along so I could feel safe, but she declined (despite everything, I missed my father a lot, he was nice when he was sober, and I tried to dismiss the drunken ""kisses"" in my mind).
I asked them to come to the city to see me, but granny told me it was too far, her legs hurt, and I am young and I should come. These conversations took place once, maybe twice a year.
I got older, got married for the first time, that didn't work out, I got depressed and started visiting psychoanalyst and taking pills. At this point I think I was about 24. So one time I got a call, and after my grandmother asked me again to come see her, dad took the phone and started pressing me to come, like real hard, telling me it's a long time I promise to visit, and why is it such a hard thing to do. I got furious, and cried why didn't he come to see me himself, and that I love grandmother who I saw once and a long time ago, more than him. It was a stupid thing to say, also not true, but I was always so sad that he didn't spend his time with me, and now I was furious he wanted me to make an effort, when he and his side of a family didn't come to city even once.

So, he hung up on me. And that was the last time I heard him. I continued to send greeting cards, unregularly, but never got a reply. I don't know what he told my grandmother.
At some point, I stopped writing. 

I know (by chance, his 2nd wife was a sister to my mother's good friend, he passed away last year) that my father's father died like 5 years ago, I think my grandmother is still alive, but now that mother's friend is not around, I don't get any news.

Now I'm 35, but I still think sometimes, maybe I should've made an effort. I got a car now, it's possible to go visit. I still feel guilty about that conversation because it was the end of our relations. I wonder if they would be glad to see me. Perhaps if they wanted, they would have come to the city at least once. I tell myself I am his child, and not vice versa, he could have tried to establish contact. My feelings towards him are complex, I miss him, but also I am angry at him for not coming to see me, knowing that I needed him so much. Also I am afraid that he might be still drinking, idk. And the disgusting ""kiss"" thing. He might've changed a lot since I last saw him. Actually I don't know anything about him. He got other children, I don't know if they stay in touch. 
This evening I found one of the cards I got years ago, in my grandmother's handwriting. And I started thinking, maybe I should try and send another letter. Or try to find their number and call.
Or should I just leave everything in the past.

Any advice?

-He has told me somewhat personal things.

-When I’m sitting in front of him he touches my hair etc.

-He tries to scare me and touches my waist or shoulders

-He gives me quick glances but when I turn my head he isn’t looking.

-He tries to keep me guessing even though he always says yes, like if I ask him to hang out with me at lunch he says ‘maybe,’ and then he does.

So I took it to my basement to paint it. While I was painting it, I took my sister’s board to school. On the subway, it got stolen. I immediately ordered a replacement of the same board and waited. I decided it was the right thing to do to tell her. She (understandably) pissed, but I don’t know what else I can do to make it up to her. And suggestions?

63,"I'm 27 and my girlfriend is 29. We've been together for 4 years and we've been living together for 3 years.

Today I don't feel well. It all started yesterday and I basically got a bad flu. I'm coughing every couple of minutes and my throat hurts so much. I even feel pain in my ribs when I cough. Hopefully in a couple of days I'll start feeling better.

My girlfriend went out in the evening with a friend and I'm still alone at home, feeling like shit because of this bad flu.

I feel like I've lost my own identity. I'm waiting for her to come back and sometimes I don't even know how to enjoy myself. This doesn't seems right. I'm in a situation where my own identity depends on the other person and I have trouble at being happy by staying with myself.

There are people that thinks they need to spend more time with other people. I'm at a point where I'm really starting to think that I really need to spend more time alone. I want to enjoy myself when I'm with her, when I'm with other people and also when I'm alone.

I want to have things to do. I want to concentrate myself on some passions of mine and get excited about that. I want to be so excited about life that even if I'm alone I've so many things to get excited about and endless possibilities in front of me.

I'm scared that I can't be enough for myself and I want to change that.",11Jan2019,1
64,"Start with first of all that I’m on mobile 

I’m speaking for a buddy of mine he doesn’t use reddit at all but he asked me for help on this and I knew this would be a good place for it 

Basically my buddy comes from a very rich family (multimillionaire) family 

He does this thing for his friends where will buy shoes with his credit card from sites mainly from StockX and then sell them to kids for cheap because he needs pocket cash that he can use because his parents track his credits card and I’m guessing he just wants the privacy that comes with cash 

I’m talking he’ll buy a ~$1000 shoe and sell it deadstock for $200

The problem is he doesn’t want people just buying the shoes and then reselling them to make huge profit he expects people to wear the shoes considering the deal their getting

Recently he sold to a kid who was suspicious was going to resell the shoes but did it anyway because he knew him for a while 

But before he sold them he did a simple sole swap so that if he did try to sell them when they got into the verification process through the platform he was selling through they would be rejected for the wrong sole

So unfortunately he tried to con him and attempted to sell the shoes through StockX where they were rejected and now StockX is demanding that because of the shoes not being right he pays a 15% fee of which I’m assuming is what he tried to sell the shoes for, totaling to $400

Now he’s telling my buddy that he wants him to pay the $400 because of the sole swap but my friend is saying that it’s his fault for trying to sell them and now is in $400 debt but keep in mind my friend is so rich he could easily pay it off but he’s not sure if he should because of how this guy tried to con him and this other guy is a regular person can’t just randomly put up $400

What do you think my friend should decide to do?

Thanks for reading this long question If your still here guys",11Jan2019,1
65,"Hello, hi. 

Some backstory- I’m really into the architectural style of the Eames Lounge Chair. I’ve always wanted one because they’re nice chairs, and they’re somewhat rare to come across where I live (west TN). So I’m driving home one day and notice this chair sitting outside on said lady’s porch- almost shit my pants because my obsession with these chairs was revived when I saw it.

I thought, yeehaw, I’ll talk to this lady and inquire about the chair. It was and is still sitting outside in the weather so I thought she must not have attachment to it. But, I spoke with her, and she said that she likes that chair because she sits in it to watch her grandson play games across the road. Furthermore, she said she didn’t want to not have a chair out there. 

How do I get this chair? Do I offer her another chair? Do I offer her money? I do not think she knows the worth or rarity of these chairs. I plan to go ask her again tomorrow, but I’m worried if I pry too much to offer too much that I’ll never get the chair because she’ll realize its value. I realize this may make me sounds conniving, but it’s just that I’ve wanted one of these forever and I have the chance to have one now and don’t want to mess it up.

Today while i was closing the shop i went to close down the tabs he usually leaves open and the first page left on the screen was a google search for ""Depression Blue'. If you search it yourself you will find several depression hotlines and general advice on depression. We have been working together now for over a year and we have a pretty healthy working relationship. He is known around the store as kinda the grumpy guy when the store gets really busy and he has a lot on his plate. But otherwise he is a great guy that will joke around with you, ask about your weekend, make sure you get out for lunch even if he cant take one because of it. basically he is a really good guy that people get the wrong idea about. He is married with no children that i know of. I myself have been dealing with depression for a few years now. I have seen doctors, therapists, i've taken multiple anti depressants and anxiety medications. But all this time i have been depressed i have never gotten to a point where i searched for hotlines. My question is, Should i say or do anything? I want to let him have his privacy; obviously i was not supposed to see that search. But i cant help but be concerned for him.

I've always been respectful but I don't think he handles different opinions well).

I'm not really sure what to do about it because i find myself wanting to be liked If i can help it, but he seems to take most things pretty personal. He just likes to make a bit of a blood sport and spectacle out of disagreements. I'm not really one for expending energy where i don't need to but it's pretty crazy how tense he makes situations. He recently blocked me on discord, i figured that out because i was making a random joke dm drop and noticed it wouldn't let me. Afterwards he'd randomly post screenshots in the group conversation with my text missing as if to let me know i was blocked. I didn't give him much of a reaction cause i figured that's what he wanted, a big show and a fight or something.  


Part of me figures I should figure out why he's salty (I literally don't have a good reason/understanding) and try to be more communicative with him moving forward.

Other Part of me Doesn't really care (besides the weird feeling I have in my chest because someone blocked me for reasons I don't know). And figure I'll get over it. I figure it won't be the last time and as I mentioned he's more of a passing acquaintance. Wasting energy on someone i know will be a further drain feels a touch irrational.

But the sexual assault backlashes on me and siblings countless beating when we would do something wrong. I am a high school senior now.

77,"So I'm a pretty quiet and socially awkward guy, but somehow I have a tendency to be generally liked by people around me.
Anyway one of these people and the subject of this post is a girl I go to high school with and have one class with. 
On Black Friday I ran into her while shopping and since then she has generally talked to me every day when she sees me. Sometimes in class and when we pass each other in the hallway, in the hallway. We didn't really have conversations it was mostly just ""hey"" and ""hows it going"" type stuff. I was surprised at first, but I grew to really appreciate these little interactions.
There were a few days right before Christmas break where she didn't say anything to me, but on the first school day of the new year she seemed happy to see me and has talked to me every day since then.
Well, every day up through Tuesday, the 8th, which importantly is my birthday.
So, in the class I have with this girl, the teacher asked me a question, which I answered, after that a guy in the class wished me a happy birthday, I thanked him, then the whole class started wishing me a happy birthday, I thanked some of them. Someone actually yelled ""we love you man!"" From the back of the room, which I know is meaningless and irrelevant to the story but I enjoyed it.
Anyway, later our teacher referenced my answer as being really good a girl across the room said ""way to go (my name)"", which I assumed I wasnt supposed to answer. Directly after that the girl this is about said happy birthday to me. She sits 2 rows behind me, so due to the distance and the other thing that I assumed I wasnt supposed to reply to, I didn't thank her, I actually thought that was how I was ""supposed"" to handle it.
Now I thought I heard this girl talking to her friend during class, wondering why I didn't thank her and seeming , but I didnt know for sure and I hope I don't come across as self-centered. Anyway my plan at the time was just to be sure to be nice to her the next time I talked to her, so she wouldn't think I didn't value her or anything.
The next day comes he doesn't say anything to me, just being clear I never initiated with her I feel that's important to say. And it's not like she didnt see me either we actually made a little eye contact, but nothing more. Today comes and I saw her notice me, but she didnt say anything.

I'm starting to get concerned, I like having a ""hey-guy"" and I'm afraid I offended her, and really screwed this up. Its actually starting to make me feel depressed. I know this isn't the first time she didnt say somthing to me, and it's only bean 2 days since my birthday, so I hope It's ok, but I'm worried, and I feel very bad.

So I guess, what advice do you guys have for me, I could sure use some.",11Jan2019,1
78,"Even though my older brother has seen more than I have, I can't help but think soemtimes he is a guy who has to be right and simply can't be wrong. A know it all maybe, but what would I know. I mean I'm coming here for insight from strangers on Reddit, because I like variety of opinions. I'm having trouble with my older brother and have a D&amp;D question that concerns my friends. My brother can get super mad (no physically abuse, but mentally tiring) and there was a rude guest with my friends and that fact I don't want to play D&amp;D (but not because of guest, I don't think D&amp;D is for me.

**Taco incident (resolved, but need insight and believed to related to today's argument)**

   Where to start? Nowadays I rarely get to see my awesome brother, so we met at a Taco place with my mom. It was all going well until I checked my taco to make sure it was cooked. I didn't start doing this until I saw a picture online of a hamburger that obviously had raw meat and with my OCD I decided real quick to make sure the food prepared by someone I clearly don't know was OK. **BIG MISTAKE**.

&amp;#x200B;

My older brother starts telling that it is weird that I did that and other IIRC ""normal"" people don't do that. IMO he was starting to make a scene and I didn't like how he was acting and was scared what I was 99% sure was going to happen next. It was not over between my brother and I and he was going to drive me home, but before he did, for a while I sat outside the Taco place to curl up and cry. Cry because I didn't want to make a scene at the table and crying because I didn't know how to handle it. I don't think trying to resolve a family squabble at a restaurant is appropriate. I just didn't know what to do and hated what was coming up next.

&amp;#x200B;

 My brother did the driving and I managed to convince him to save his upcoming onslaught of words filled with anger at home and not while he was driving.

&amp;#x200B;

Once home hell was unleashed and we were arguing and he exploded with anger. I'm a laid back person and wished he was calmer about how he didn't like me looking at my taco to make sure it was cooked. We both got so mad that I learned to scream again (it was too much for me and I had to get it out just once.) and that last time I screamed was when I was a giggly stupid toddler.

&amp;#x200B;

It was traumatizing for my brother and I, but I think he still thinks it is weird for someone (apparent especially me) to check their food is cooked. If I'm in the wrong for checking my food I can do better. It just seemed so stupid for my brother and I to get so stressed out over taco, but it happened.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question:** Is it that bad to check ones food before one bites it?

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

**D&amp;D with one person who was a sibling of my friend**

&amp;#x200B;

Far as I'm concerned D&amp;D is something I don't ever want to do again, because I was bored and I was the host of this D&amp;D event. My friend wanted to invite over a co-worker I was cool with and then his sister, who I didn't know.

&amp;#x200B;

My older brother wasn't there, but my younger brother was who watched the D&amp;D game we had instead of playing it. 2/6 people sitting at the D&amp;D game seemed to be enjoying it and I was tried hard to not show my boredom as well as to make sure everyone had a good time. I got bad vibes from the sister (is that even possible) that she didn't like me and imo clearly was bored and rude. Sister of my friend was on her phone alot and was the only one who was doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where me and my older brother disagree. 

&amp;#x200B;

Adding insult to injury the pizza I bought for everyone, I mentioned where people could wash their hands ( I didn't tell anyone to though, just a hint I thought) . I noticed everyone as picking at their faces and other stuff. I'm 90% positive the girl understood me and chose not to clean her hands before we all ate.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my older brother recently talked today and we agreed that the girl was rude, but disagreed with me about how someone choosing not to wash their hands (even with my voiced clue) before they touch food is something that I  shouldn't be offended by or upset by.

&amp;#x200B;

My older brother informs me that ""it is a fact"" (that really irks me when I hear it only from him) and that he has been around more people than I am to ""know this"". That it is weird for me to be upset by the girl to who chose not to wash her hands even with my helpful hint of where one could wash their hands.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides my chat with my older brother, I don't want to play D&amp;D again however I don't want to hurt my friends feelings. I would like to seem them again, but not to play D&amp;D and especially not that sibling who was rude.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

&amp;#x200B;

 1. Was the sibling sister also rude by not choosing to wash her hands even when I clearly stated where everyone could should they choose to do so?

&amp;#x200B;

2.  I love my older brother and know he isn't lying to me, but I don't like one answer especially that I consider an opinion of sorts and being told its a fact.

&amp;#x200B;

3.  Is there a way to invite other friends over without the sibling girl who seemed to be clearly bored? I'm a timid person and dont want to hurt anyone's feelings. I just don't know what to do.  It would be nice if the sibling girl could understand why I was unhappy, but how would one do that without unavoidably being offensive?

I took the weekend of New Year’s off, got engaged to my boyfriend of five years, and I felt amazing. I came back to work after New Year’s and within two hours massive issue happened and we’re still trying to correct it even today. Every time we think we have a win or a small victory we just get blasted with an even larger problem. I’ve come home and cried every night this week and if you like garbage as a leader.

I have experienced a lot of problems and issues over the years but this one has just completely torn me apart it made me question everything about my ability as a leader. I’m terrified to go to work tomorrow because another problem popped up. And this is because I was focused on the other problem and manage to neglect something.

I’ve been struggling a bit lately. I‘m an undergrad of business psychology which means I’ll work most likely in HR or marketing. While I 
love the degree I‘m not exactly sure if I‘d want to work in either of these fields for morality reasons. Someone told me I should just do what makes sense now and the rest will fall into place.  This advice was given to me by someone way older than me and I try to take it. She also said that my time will come and I just have to be patient. If I’m not patient I’ll get desperate and sick and won’t be able to reach my goals. 

What bothers me is that I‘m almost 21 and I want to get out of my town so badly. I want to move out of my parents‘ house and live my own life.

I want to start working so badly in order to be a little more independent but where I live it’s nearly impossible to get a job as a cashier or at McDonald’s if you haven’t done a three year long training and are available all the time. And they‘re paid very poorly too. I‘m not far enough into my degree to work in this field. 

What really bothers me is my fear of failing my goals. I want to move out of my town and I’d love to leave Germany in general. I want to live in a big city and meet new people. Right now my life is basically the same as it was when I was 16. And it won’t change until I get my master‘s degree in another four years.. I‘m really running out of patience. I was told to volunteer in my town which is what I‘ll try to do tomorrow.

I think basically my problem is that I’m very bored. I don‘t have any close connections and I’m craving them badly but I don’t know where to meet people. I haven’t found my place. I had a very bad time growing up in my town which is why I want to leave this place already. I don’t want to see the people here. I’m not very mobile so it’s a struggle for me to get to a bigger city on a regular basis. I want more freedom but it seems as if I’m living in a prison. I need to find a hobby and socialise more but I don’t know how to start. I can’t seem to find anything that interests me enough to leave the house and spend two hours in the train to go there. I‘m very lonely and I need connection. I don’t really feels closeness to the people from my university but I feel rather separated from them. I honestly just want a stable circle of friends that I can count on and a sense of stability in general. 

Don’t know what I’m expecting from this but thanks for your replies",11Jan2019,1
88,"Ok, so I used to go out with someone I would call D.H  for the sake for privacy (not that it matters).  We ""loved"" each other.  And I quote that because I really loved him but the things that he do never showed it. There was so many other things that was a red flag to leave him but I never listened. For example, this is the worse he's done to me,  it might not sound like much but it really hit close to home.  When I would be hanging with my friends after school, he would never tag along even after we ALL begged and begged he LITERALLY said he'd rather play games 😒. So I left him. It was sad but it had to he done.  What's the point of being together if he won't even take time out of his day to talk to me? After that,  I found someone new. I'll call him F. D. When we started dating, the very next day D.H went up to me and told me not to date F.D and to be with him instead.  I WAS SHOOK. And at that time,  I still had feelings for D. H because the reason we broke up in the first place was because he didn't act like we really loved me when I knew for a fact that I did.  So,  I broke up with F.D and went with D.H to give him another chance. He was a better person but I started to hang out with F.D again and.... cheated.  I didn't mean to but since I'm still a virgin,  all we did was makeout. So now I'm in this situation where I like both of them.  After a while,  D.H started acting the same as last time (acting like he didn't like me) and I started to hear rumors that he was gay.  It's probably not true but people are still talking about it to this day.  Personally,  I think he's bisexual because of ""things I saw him do""with other guys 🤣and plus he dated a lot of girls.  When my friend said something about his ex, he got really mad and it bothered me that he still cares about her. I can't tell who broke up with who this time because I was talking to my friend and I told her to ask him if we should brake up because I'm a pussy🤣.  He said yea so it was official.  We were broken up now.  Fast forward 1 year later I'm talking to him again but as friends and it's gonna stay that way.  You know that one ex you will never loose feelings for?  Yea he's one of mine.  And I can tell he still likes me too.  I sometime catch him staring at me but I ignore and try not to make eye contact and he smile A LOT when he's around me( I know it sounds creepy 🤣) . Now, F.D is back in my life and he's asking to get back with me but my friends think I'm over him but to tell the truth,  I'm not over him either.  I'm a WHOLE mess 🤣🤣🤣😢.  So they keep telling him to stop asking me out but I'm sitting there next to them hella happy and wishing I had the guts to tell my friends that I do like him and want to go back out with him.  My situation is so bad.  Any advise?  🤔🤔(Sorry it was so long) ",11Jan2019,1
90,"Hi,

I am a 25 year old who graduated two years ago with a BA and MA in history of art (first class and upper second class) and on all fronts, I am kind of stuck with where on earth I am going...it feels like I have a life trajectory to nowhere!

I am not necessarily depressed- I used to get quite down and really compare my life to others. I still compare but not as much as I used to, and  I want to do something about it I just don't know how, because it feels as though I have so many things to resolve!

Some brief background about me. In my town I have no friends, I live at home, I am not necessarily bothered by living at home but I wish I had certainty as to when moving out may be in the picture. I got bullied a lot at school, sometimes it still bothers me a bit today when I am feeling down, but it is not something on my mind 24/7, it does explain why I had trouble making friends though. I had to switch friend groups when I was 17 as my friends and the bullies were bullying me... it was a very big group of friends that I made at 17 and therefore it was hard to fully get to know people. I left with one main friend who unfortunately moved to a different country a few years ago, we still talk by message and I hope to one day visit. Most of my university friends are in different countries (three of them) so I have two friends in my country, one is a boy my age, and the other is a friend I made from work around 5 years older than me (she may even be moving back to her country this year); I meet up with them every few months over coffee or a day out. It is nice and I am sure there are people who are worse off but I feel my social life could be improved.

So I start with this. I want to improve my social life but I feel that my lack of self esteem in me sort of affects how I choose to interact with others (even if I don't feel I show it). I talk to people at work but apart from that one friend, I have not really befriended anyone else. Everyone adds each other on social media and I have nobody on mine! Most people are very  polite to me and vice versa but it never really extends to friendship. In my head I feel that people may judge me if they find out more (living at home etc.) and I feel that this may subconsciously translate to others when they talk to me.

I want to join a club. I don't think it will necessarily improve my social life, I have been to a yoga one regularly and there was never any social benefit. If I was good at team sports I would do that, as I feel it is a bit more sociable. At the very least, going to a club gives me something to talk to others about other than 'oh what did you do this weekend' 'uh nothing really' etc. 

I want to go on dates, but I have a few questions and need advice. I have used dating apps and once met someone before, it led to a very short, rubbish relationship where he cheated so I am a tad wary, but I think that in a day and age where people like me don't actually know anyone in our town anymore, dating apps are a good way to perhaps meet someone. Question is, if you met someone on a date who had friends in other countries ( didn't therefore have much of a social life) would you judge them? Secondly, which leads on to my next dilemma, if you had met someone who wants to visit other countries, go on holidays etc but has never been on a plane and has thus developed a fear, would you be put off/judge them? I notice that many people on these apps tend to be obsessed with travel, I wouldn't intentionally choose one of these people now but I suppose I just wondered how others would react.

My second general life worry/thing getting in the way of my social life is my fear of flying. I feel that many people my age go abroad and do things and of course I have a few friends abroad, so I feel a bit silly that I have developed a fear and I think it reflects how I talk with people...when people mention holidays or travel I do quite quickly try and change the subject in the hope they don't ask me, and this surprisingly happens very frequently. In my head, it feels as though I am on a lower level than others as I don't know how to do such basic things.  I want to sort it out and I am actually in the frame of mind where I think I can get it done maybe this year, I guess I just wanted to know how others would react to this.

Lastly is my work life and this is kind of long and extends into everything. 

When I graduated in 2016 I was cheated on again by a different boyfriend. With hindsight it is good I had nothing to do with him but at the time everything around me crumbled. I moved home with no means of social life around me and I didn't know what to do. I turned to app dating where I met the next person who cheated on me, he was obsessed with travel and this is where my concern began I suppose.

I started thinking more and more about how I had never been on a plane, to the point where I would have panic attacks on every mode of transport, trains and cars ( I couldn't stand at a train platform without wanting to be ill). I believe I had agoraphobia, I couldn't sit in cinemas or even at my own graduation ceremony without a silent panic attack. My agoraphobia issue has started getting better- I can now sit on a train for 25 minutes without a stop without panicking...sounds ridiculous to most people but i'm so glad this issue is on its way out as I felt at rock bottom. I am actually thinking of contacting one of my friends who lives in a country travelable by train to visit her, but I would have to explain all this embarrassing agoraphobia stuff as I cant do it right her right now yet and need a bit of time.

Anyway, my fear of travel hugely delayed me in building a career and I am genuinely stuck now. I have a part time job at a prestigious museum, it is only customer service but it does mean money is collecting.  I chose part time part out of my train fear but also as I wanted to intern to gain experience...my degree doesn't seem to get me anywhere, presumably as it is too general, but I have been applying to careers in writing/press etc and despite experience at a few publications I get nowhere.

How I apply for jobs is also partially influenced by my fear of travel. I aim to sort it this year. I have no idea what kind of jobs tend to require international travel- in my case I suppose the journalism aspect of writing could, but nonetheless, it feels like I have many fears that hold me back in doing everything out of fear of looking stupid, when they (may) be irrational. All in the space of a year, I have considered careers such as curating, museum education, copywriting, press assistant, editorial assistant, and social media and web...

I actually thought of applying for a whole new MA degree in archives- it seems more definite job wise as it is a degree that focusses entirely on a career field, but it is a risk. I am expected to get a years worth of full time experience to apply, and by the time I do that I will be applying at 27, and I doubt I will therefore have money to live on my own by then. (I would choose to live with friends but as previously discussed most of them are abroad).

25, constantly chopping and changing career routes, don't really know what on earth I am doing with myself and constantly ruled by fear and afraid of judgment. Anyone else feel this way or am I just a bit nuts?

I hate myself. I feel that I am not worthy of anything. Sometimes I feel like I don't even deserve to eat, drink, smile, laugh, or even be in the presence of other people.

Not speaking to anyone unless there was no way around it. If an accident happens and I am hurt I feel like I deserved it (I am not hurting or doing anything intentionally to hurt myself). 

I just.... why am I like this? I dont ever remember a time where I haven't been like this. I want to make sure everyone around me is taken care of, and that they are happy.

104,"REPOSTED, AS IT DIDN'T SHOW UP AS POSTED.**

(16m here, 15 when this all happened.) Last year (November 2017), I was introduced to the chat website OMEGLE, by one of my only friends at the time. I was lonely, so I used it to talk to people. I found a few friends- mostly girls, but a few boys. They seemed nice. We shared interests, and things were great! Their ages ranged anywhere from 13 to 25. 

Until I got kinda dumb. Me being the socially inept 15-year-old I was (and 16 YO I admittedly still am). Some of my friends blocked me (on Snapchat), which may have been because of me complimenting them? IE, saying they are pretty. That's all I could think of to say. Or, I would ask for a selfie to verify they were who they said. (I always sent one, with proof it was me, like a silly face or a finger on my nose, something like that.) One girl even gave me advice on some of my insecurities, including my, *ahem*, size. (No pics sent, no sex talk.) Maybe somehow one of my bad jokes scared her and the others off? I don't know. I had no creepy intentions.

Like, I never said anything sexual to them, or sexted at all. Maybe simply trying to be nice creeped them out?

Anyway, Omegle was an easy cure for lonliness (when peeps didn't disconnect.)

Whenever blocked (happened like, four times.), I  moved on to trying to make more friends during a confusing and lonely time in my life, amidst fears for my mother's health during a cancer battle. Online chatting provided a barrier for me. Talking to people online was therapy. An escape. Comfort. Human interaction. Friends. I never knew why some blocked me. Maybe I'm paranoid and wasn't creepy or offensive at all. Who knows.

One conversation I had was with a 23-year-old woman, obviously not sexual at all, and this boosted my confidence in talking to people in general. I will say that a lot of the time, I disconnected from male chatters- all they usually wanted was sexting. The girls and women provided the conversation I needed. I will say, I complimented the 23-year-old woman and tried to offer my snapchat at the time; I was trying to be nice and friendly, with a few flirtatious comments. I see how what I said could be considered inappropriate now, and I truly am sorry for any discomfort I ever caused her, or anyone else. The closest thing to a sexual thing I ever said was when this woman sent a picture of herself and said her breasts were too small, and I said she looked fine. Sorry to be obsessed with saying I did nothing sexual, I just got paranoid, you know? Like, could these nonsexual compliments be taken the wrong way? 

On a side note, I'll say this: Kids, teenagers, don't do that, sexting I mean. Whoever the adult, or even fellow kid (as Steve Buscemi would say) may be, don't do that. Just don't. It's stupid, potentially dangerous, and creepy. I was just a socially awkward mess at the time, desperate for anyone to talk to. Anyone who would listen. Anyone for me to listen to. To try to help, so they wouldn't be lonely like me. I felt a responsibility. 

Anyway, these online friends of mine were really awesome. I had good friendships with them, and I always backed down immediatly if blocked for whatever reason. (Side lesson: With girls especially, when they say ""NO"" or tell you to go away, even in fully platonic situations, back off. People have their own reasons for ceasing contact with you. Respect that and move on. And watch what you say and how you say it. Texting, even more so over the internet with someone you have never met, is easily misconstrued. I fear this may have happened with some people I met. I had a habit of making dark and sexual jokes, which I have sinced stopped doing.)

I never engaged in sexting with or harassment of others. The 23-year-old girl sent me some (clean) photos of herself, and I was in my anxious mind paranoid it would count as sexual since she commented on her breasts and I reassured her that she wasn't ugly at all. I was so afraid that this could be considered sexting, I was terrified, let me tell ya. I always tried to be nice and respectful. Maybe me being the stupid, socially inept and thoughtless kid I was minced my words and said something offensive, who knows.

I always took safety measures. I would ask these kids if their parents knew and were ok with them talking to internet friends (Hypocritical, I know). 

As for wondering if I'm a bad person, here goes: 

Many of these friends of mine suffered from depression (As did the first two girlfriends I had ever had in my life, if you could call them that- at 12 and 14... lol) . I tried my best to help them. I even convinced a few to not take their own lives, and at least was there for them, and a friend when I could be. One wanted to starve herself. I sent messages to everyone on her facebook friends list, unsure of how to help. She got help as a result of this, as it alerted her friends and family. 

I also reported a suspected pedophile, anonymously. That was a scary experience. I did this a few times with a fake account, before stopping due to fear and anxiety. He was talking to another one of my depressed online friends. I reported him, and they apparently broke up and his accounts were deleted. I hope it's because he got nailed. I looked into him, and he kind of looked like he could be in his late teens as he said, but being older than he said, as I had suspected, was much more likely. Plus, she admitted to doing sexual things with him, so I knew I had to report him, which I did, anonymously. 

I still doubt if I did the right thing. 

Besides this experience, my online friends took over my life. I hated worrying who I would have to talk out of suicide next. I hated wondering if what I said would be taken as flirty or sexual. I hated the idea of one of the 13/14-year-olds' parents discovering them talking to me and thinking I was a creep. I hated decieving my overprotective parents by not telling them about me turning in literal pedophiles anonymously and talking kids out of suicide. I was always on watch. On edge.

I had more friends than ever, but I felt all alone. I also reported one girl to Snapchat for sending me nude photos. I can only hope being reported was a wake-up call to her to stop. 

Anyway, in short, I was always anxious for people I cared about but had never met. It was destroying me, &amp; affecting my home life, too.

So, I did what felt right. 

I sent all my friends heartfelt goodbyes, along with reassurance and links to support websites and help hotlines. I blocked them on my accounts before I deleted my accounts (overkill, huh?). And with that, I was free. I rebounded back to omegle a few times out of loneliness. 

I also talked to the sister of a well-known actor. She was cool. Didn't take my snapchat though, which is fine. The lesson here is to back off when someone declines it; As I remember, I spammed my handle to her as a kind of stupid joke. Again, easily misconstrued as creepiness.

These were all amazing people I wish I could still speak to. Wonderful friends, and I wish I could help more. My anxiety and guilt complex simply do not allow this. 

But at the same time, no matter my own mental state, was it the right thing to be selfish like that and leave them after doing what I could? Was it right to report someone for pedophilia without all the facts- just a strong reason to believe wrongdoing had occured? 

Also, I reported a movie casting call scam. I played dumb, playing along, and even sent a picture of myself to really make the scammer think I was seriously going along with what was obviously illegitimate. Didn't give any real personal information out, however. I'm not THAT stupid. Hopefully. 

15-year-old logic, right? Man... 

Anywho, my mom is better now. I have more friends. That scammer hasn't come after me, so I assume he was dealt with after I cut communication. But to this day, almost a year after this had all ended... I still feel like an awful, stupid person. 

Am I? 

I don't know if this was even comprehensible in the slightist. My words, as are my thoughts, are all over the place. Maybe I repeated myself at points. Sorry about all that. Did I maks any sense? Am I a bad person? Help! 

**Wondering if I'm a bad person for helping online friends with depression, then leaving when my anxiety and the stress began to get to me and impact my life negativelly. Wondering if nonsexually complimenting people and asking for selfies to confirm they are who they say counts as harassment. Is that creepy? Also, my mom is cancer free for one year on April 3rd. :)**

A also told my story in various edited forms, to retain my anonymity, on Omegle, ironically. For second opinions on if I'm an awful person or could have been considered creepy. Time to come to Reddit! Lol.

Thanks for reading! (And commenting, my low Karma nonwithstanding! :D) It's good to get this off my chest. 

I just hope I'm not an awful person. Or creepy. I worry about that, especially in today's climate, you know? 

Sorry for the ramble. Thanks, all! ",11Jan2019,1
105,"We are both 20 something year olds. And have been dating for 5+ years. My ex is Canadian and was visiting for the holidays and will need her passport to get home.

108,"Hey! So I don’t really know how to go about this issue that I’ve run into... Was hoping maybe someone’s mind that isn’t my own might have a good idea. 

I’m not a pet sitter or a house sitter and I don’t know if Im being taken advantage of or if my pay is decent? 

Story - My prof of one semester asks if anyone could cat-sit her two cats for 5 days. I was the only one in the area bc I pay rent here so I stay to get my moneys worth. I say sure and she says she normally does $10 a day, but $50 seemed cheap. I hoped that meant $75 maybe even $100 if she was really grateful. I didn’t want to press about prices though, so I didn’t bring it up. This was my mistake that I’ve now learned from. 

She left me $60 dollars and 3 pages of instructions which included that she’d prefer I stay here every night unless an emergency. 

The place is 10 miles away, 16 mins, from the house I rent nearby. 

When I googled prices online, they were much higher than $12 a day. I understand I’m inexperienced but I wonder if i am being totally skimped or if I should just be happy for another $60 in my pocket during winter restaurant season? Would / could I confront? How?! I want to keep good relations of course!

110,"I moved across the country impulsively in search of a quieter lifestyle and the promise of work, moving from GTA, Ontario to a small rural town in New Brunswick.  I'm a schizophrenic who had only worked 3 months in a factory doing line work I absolutely hated over a period of two years. The small town I had grown up in was now a booming city and it disgusted me. 

I quickly found a custodial job at a school in NB and I absolutely love what I do. I am able to work at my own pace and listen to music my entire shift and work at my own pace. The job gets done, but it gets done on my terms.  I am 27 years old and I have never enjoyed a job as much as I do right now. 

The only problem is that I take a costly medication that costs hundreds of dollars and I am only now getting it covered. I've quickly transfered over my health care and driving licenses and all my other information. 

I want to move back but there are so many cons and the only pros I can see are being close to my parents and all my family and being able to go to metal concerts. 

I've been living with my best friends parents the last 4 months and I just got my own private security code to the school. The only thing I have left to do is acquire a driver's license so I can drive on my own, get a car and insurance, and find a place to rent. I'm pretty much set up for want I want to do with my life but I'm so damn far away from my parents and all the people who matter. 

How difficult would the process be in moving back to my old home?

112,"Background: We are two 20-something year old guys that have lived together for quite a while. We actually dated for about two years a long time ago, but that’s in the past. He still lives in my house, pays his rent, and we’re still friends. When he moved in (the first time while we were dating) he brought two of his cats with him, and we managed to pick up another one along the way. After we broke up we lived together for about three months before he moved out, then he was gone for a little over a year. During this time the cats never left my house because where he moved wouldn’t allow them. Fast forward to now, he lives in my house again, and we still have the three cats.

As far as general household chores go, I do the vast majority of them… All of the cooking, most of the cleaning and laundry, and I even drive him around a little bit when he doesn’t have gas money. I’m also the one that buys the cat food most of the time. The one chore that we argue the most over is who is going to change the cat litter. I think that he should be the one to change the litter, whereas he thinks we should alternate.

That’s not to say that I haven’t done it in the past, or that I’m completely unwilling to do it, but I feel like there’s no shared equity among the work and because he was the original reason that the cats are in the house to begin with, it just feels appropriate to me that he should be responsible for the litter. His viewpoint is that I agreed to keep the cats when he moved out, so it is a shared responsibility.

He’s currently pissed at me because I asked him to do it, and the opinion of the masses won’t change his mind even if I was right, but I am genuinely curious to see what everyone else thinks on the matter. Thoughts?",11Jan2019,1

And recently I had some skin issues and my mom kept pointing out the fact that I have those issues because i'm a 19 year old going 20 virgin...

On Christmas day my sister who is 14 and two of my.friends we went to a club and i saw how all the guys were looking at them but not me... My sisterhas hazel/ light brown eyes and natural light brown curled hair and curvy and tall which attracts boys and my friends one is red head with blue eyes and victoria.model thin but short and the other is also short but with red hair tanned skin and black eyes and also curvy. The boys wouldn't stop looking at them! They even made moves to approach them while no one cared about me.

I'm fat, with long red/brown hair because i had dyed them but I got doagnosed with two autoimmune diseases and the doctor.adviced me not heavy my hair more by dyeing them again so i'm in the process of returning to my natural dark brown color. I'm extremely white from lack of vitamin D and i have brown/green eyes and my skin most times is acne free and others I have acne...

I left the club because my knees started to hurt (autoimmune disease no 1) and the club had nowhere to sit so i left them when they came.to find them i asked them if they were any guys looking at me they said rhey were aome but I knew they were lying...that got me thinking even more...

I spent all my life so far studying and being a good daighter that every time the thought of having a boyfriend was not important for me i always kept saying; ""not the time got to study"" or i would say that i'm too young for boys. Yet lately i keep telling myself that i'll wait for someobe who will see the inner me since the outside me is unattractive.

120,"Sorry in advance for the long post. There's a lot going on, and I'm not sure where exactly to turn to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started university in 2018. It was an incredible experience. I was so anxious at first, especially because I am not the best socially. Making friends was a real worry of mine, as I haven't had the best luck in the past, being part of the 'nerdy outcast' clique most of my life.  Thankfully I was surprised in a pleasant way, as I almost immediately clicked with several people throughout the year, including someone who took a lot of mutual classes with me. We will call him 'Aaron' for privacy reasons. At first, Aaron and I spent a lot of time together, it was fantastic!  I love him to bits. I have never been so close to another human being in my life. But over the course of a few months, our friendship has deteriorated quite drastically, and I am at a complete loss on what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aaron and I still regularly converse on a daily basis. The entire day. Which I have never done with someone before, and honestly I feel like this may be a reason for the downfall of our once-strong friendship.  Whilst, in theory, talking with your best friend all day sounds fantastic.... recently it has been anything but. I'm a person that values independence, I love to do things by myself. From solving sudoku puzzles to playing video games or completing art commissions... I love to have 'me' time! We all need to get away from social media and do our own thing from time to time. A lot of the times I'll spontaneously decide to engage in such activities, as a spur of the moment event. Which to most people would be absolutely fine. But not to Aaron. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since the past few months, he's been suffering from paranoia. Which on its own is absolutely fine. Except because he's talking to me constantly.... the brunt of the negativity is being directed at me. His best friend. It started out a few months ago with accusations of me using him for university-related (academic) purposes. Which is something that goes against every fibre of my being. It really hurt me because I thought he was implying all my time and effort in this friendship was simply for my own benefit. Which as you can imagine was extremely upsetting. These paranoias have progressed to the point where if  I spontaneously decide to do an independent activity, he gets extremely upset. He'll almost always will tell me that I'm simply 'trying to get rid of him' or other negative accusations. Constantly. Even deciding to play cards with my family is seen as an 'excuse' to try to get away from him.  Even though I keep telling him that I am not out to get him....he keeps treating my 'excuses' as such. It's at a point where I am scared to even mention that I am doing such activities because I know he's going to turn it into a negative argument. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just last night... I was cleaning my room, so I said responses would be a tad delayed, because I was busy. I let him know that I was still keen to make the effort to talk. He then told me he would go, and to not worry about it, so I could clean 'in peace', and that he would talk to me tomorrow. I then replied that I would say goodnight to him before I went to bed. I then spent the rest of the night doing as he said... not worrying. I check my phone afterwards and I received a message from him saying that I had 'ghosted' him for 5 hours. (Side note: I have recently come out of a relationship where I was legitimately ghosted so I have asked him not to use this word, as it reminds me of that pain). I had 'ghosted' him despite HIM saying he would talk to me tomorrow. I was in the wrong because I followed his word.  He also accused me of lying about saying goodnight to him before I went to bed... despite the fact I was still awake, and had EVERY intent of saying goodnight before I went to bed. I am quite the night owl, and would go to bed way later than him. He then suggested I was happy that this happened. It gave me a 2-hour long anxiety attack, and I could not sleep until 4 am. I have to CONSTANTLY justify my actions. to him to try and get him to realise I am not the scummy person he seems to think I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's at the point where my mental health is being affected badly. I suffer from anxiety/panic attacks, and these are getting increasingly more frequent, because I go into fight or flight as soon as conflict happens. And it has been... on a daily basis now. I'm scared to check my phone in the morning because he ALWAYS manages to find something to accuse me of/be negative about.  The worst part is 99% of the time I have the most positive intentions... but he turns it into something negative.  In the past few months, I have self-harmed a couple of times because I realise I just can't be enough, I can't get him to trust me any more. He's my friend, but constantly has to think the worst of me. 

Because he is my best friend... having him being constantly angry and suspicious of my activities is really really really taking a toll on me. He's constantly questioning everything I say, whether that be an 'I love you' or even just telling him that I enjoy talking to him (which I absolutely do!). Knowing that I am doing nothing wrong and then having to deal with his angry outbursts is extremely difficult. 

Knowing that my best friend constantly sees me as a liar and an untrustworthy person is a constant mental struggle. Knowing that I have to justify every single activity to him is exhausting. I want some independence, I hate feeling like I have to be on my phone/computer all day talking to him to try to stop him getting upset at me for doing other things. 

I want my independence, but I want my best friend, too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stick around at the moment because I am optimistic. I know that the Aaron I know and love is in there somewhere. He constantly apologises to me and tells me he's working on being better, and the next thing you know he's right back at it. Nothing is changing, and I am trying so hard. I am a constant failure. He is constantly angry/hurt/upset at me and my daily activities. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love him, but he's hurting me. 

&amp;#x200B;

123,"I've always thought I was an introvert because I have social anxiety, but I recently came to terms with the fact that I need to be around others to feel happy. Being around other people I like recharges my batteries, it makes me feel more stable and sane. When I'm alone for extended periods, even if it's just a few days, I kinda start to lose my mind.  

I get anxious for no reason, I get really depressed, and everything seems pointless if I can't share it with someone else. I usually love reading books, playing video games, drawing, and watching my favorite shows. But when I've been alone for too long, all these things seem like I'm just doing them to pass the time, so they ultimately feel pointless.  

I don't have many friends unfortunately, and my boyfriend is going to be away for 4 months. He's been gone a week and I'm already struggling a lot due to having nobody to do things with. We can play multiplayer games together, but he's really busy settling in and won't be super available for a few weeks. So I'm mostly left to my own devices in the meantime. I am attending college, but those few hours with others isn't super fulfilling because I'm not close with anyone there. I'd join clubs at the college, but as I mentioned before, anxiety kinda makes that... really hard. That's pretty much why I don't have many friends, either.  

I knew taking up a hobby is a good way to make your life feel more fulfilling, so I started learning to needle felt. I'm getting pretty good at it! But I'm not getting as much out of it as I thought I would. Sure, it's nice to have something to do with my hands... but it's not enough. I was thinking of getting a fish and spoiling the fuck out of the little guy like I did with my old betta fish (RIP), but I'm reluctant to because I'm probably going to be moving within the next year and I don't wanna dump the care of the fish onto my parents (plus, I know they won't keep to the strict water change regimen I like to maintain). I was also considering getting a lizard, but same story, don't wanna dump the poor little dude on my parents who never asked for it.

125,"The thought of dying doesn’t scare me or worry me at all, if someone would tell me tomorrow would be my last day living, I dont think I would care that much. It would actually be kinda relieving to me. okay, so a little bit about me, I’m an 18 y/o female in my first year of college. the last few years I have been struggling with some sort of depression, I havent completely figured out what type yet. the last few years have been pretty shitty for my mental state. I’ll start where it all went downhill. When I was around like 15 I started to explore the online world, I downloaded a few social apps, to talk to people around the world, especially to girls. I was still closeted, too much of a pussy to come out and thought that it would be a nice opportunity to maybe explore my sexuality a little bit. One app in particular really caught my interest, skout. It kinda reminded me of facebook. It was filled with people my age, from all around the world. I quickly made some friends and we became pretty popular on the app. Almost everyone knew about us and it felt like we ruled the app, I became addicted to it. I used to spent hours and hours on my phone, talking to a bunch of people. After a few months on the app I started talking to a swedish girl, we became very close and It only made me to spent more time on my phone. I caught feelings for her, but after a while I began to doubt her, she was acting really suspicious and I found out she wasn’t who she claimed to be. We talked for about 7 months and as soon as I found out she just dissapeared saying “I cant do this anymore” . I was honestly being really naive, there were so many red flags, I should’ve known. Looking back at it , I probably knew she was lying, but I guess I was just craving affection. anyways 15 year old me cried her eyes out, but luckily got over her after a few weeks. I did still spend a lot of time on the app, I spent more time with my online friends than with my friends in real life. See, I was never a loner, I’ve always had quite some friends, but the online world just consumed me. I met another girl, we started talking and got along pretty well. I immediately checked if she was real and thank god she was. We started flirting and I quickly caught feelings for her, this time it was different though, I actually fell in love with this girl. we spent almost every single moment of the day talking, we used to fall asleep on the phone together, I was saving money because we made plans to meet (she lived in the usa and I live in the netherlands), we both came out to our parents and told them about each other, we were madly in love. this resulted in me spending even more time on my phone, I was cancelling plans just to stay in bed and be on my phone all day, I spent most of my time in bed. the relationship wasn’t perfect though, we used to argue a lot, about petty shit. its not that weird, considering we were both 16 at that time, we were on and off we never broke up for more than 2 weeks though. but the relationship honestly caused a lot of stress for the both of us, we made each other happy but we also were hurting each other. I guess the distance was just too much of a problem. we dated for a little over a year, until I ended the relationship. I was broken. I couldnt continue being in a relationship where there was so much arguing going on, but I knew that if I ended things with her she wouldnt wanna be friends with me. so I knew I would lose my girlfriend and also my best friend.  the few months after that were really shitty, I missed her like crazy and saw her moving on while I was still not over her. I honestly dont think I will ever get over her. but okay moving on my childhood was pretty good, but around my 12th year my parents started arguing a lot, I was always in the middle of it. the arguments continued through the years, at one point the arguments got so bad that me and my mom moved in with my sister for a while, my mom wanted to leave my dad for good, but then he tried to kill himself, atleast thats what he claimed to do, he left my mom a weird message and when she came to the house she saw him with a noose around his neck, I dont know if he really tried to kill himself or that it was just a move to get us to get back to him. we eventually went back and he promised he would change, it didnt take long for the arguments to begin again though. last year december my mom left my dad for good, he didnt take this very well. see my dad is a very difficult person, he is kinda self-centered and thinks that his way is the right way. he used to be kind of the bad guy in the past, involved in crime etc he would never lay a hand on me though and I dont think he ever hit my mom either. but after my mom left him, he lost it. he sent her lots of death threats and even told me he wanted to buy a gun. a few weeks after the split I found him at home his face covered in blood and he clearly was under the influence of cocaine. he threatend my mom for months and it was terrifying, I didnt know what he was capable of. a big part of me doesnt think he would’ve killed her that  it was just big man talk but another part of me knows that he’s capable of doing really bad things, especially when he’s drunk. thank god, he found a new girlfriend and everything is actually pretty chill at home. he’s really trying to be a good dad and I appreciate that but I just cant forgive him for what he put my mom through. the entire situation has caused me a lot of fear and stress, I was so scared something would happen to my mom. and it was so painful to see how he was just destroying her, she still doesnt feel safe and it sucks that I cant do anything about it. I’ve always been a super stressful person, especially when it comes to school. my grades have always been pretty good, but I’m a perfectionist when it comes to studying, not because I want an A+, but just because I’m scared to get a bad grade when I dont study every single little detail. last year I took a gap year, because I just wanted some time of school. but now I’m in college, its just so much. my grades have been super good, but i dont even know if its worth all my stress. I have literally been living in my room. little time for myself. cancelling all my friends. the only thing I seem to do nowadays is studying, I wish I didnt raise the bar so high for myself, but thats easier said than done. I see classmates doing all this stuff and I’m just studying in my room. It actually caused me to have a mental breakdown a few weeks ago it was all just too much, the situation with my parents, school, drivers class. Thats the next thing, I have spent about 3000 euros on getting my drivers license and I still dont have it, I have had over 100 hours of practice, but I still suck. I see all my friends passing and I’m just failing miserably, even though I spent way more time practicing, I feel like a complete failure. I also have major problems with procrastinating, not when it comes to school, but when it comes to everything besides that, I’m a major procrastinator. I havent cleaned my room in ages, there’s literally some dust on the floor, I have a bag of clothes I was going to throw away weeks ago thats still in the corner of my room, I just cant get myself to clean, it feels like I’m putting all my energy in school and I cant do anything besides that. another one of my problems is that I’m living in a fantasy world inside of my head, when I’m not studying I’m constantly imagining situations in my head, I have been living in one ever since I was a little kid, I was always making up story’s in my head and over the years it just has increased. In my head I’m completely someone else. someone who’s good in everything that I suck at. I cant get my fantasies under control anymore, I need to spent atleast a few hours a days living in my head. I honestly feel like a complete weirdo, I’m 100% sure that I’ll never be able to quit living in that fantasy world. Its such a nice escape from reality. I’m scared that this will get out of hand and I’ll become schizophrenic. so yea I’ll wrap my story up because its 4 am and I need to wake up at 9.

127,"I've been with my girlfriend for almost a year and she just revealed $84k in student loan debt. I love her very much but I'm also very scared to take this on at this stage in our lives.

Her:


* 40 years old
* $84k debt
* Almost no savings to speak of
* Income of $65k (has potential to earn more if she changes jobs, maybe $85k or so)




Me:


* 35 years old
* No debt
* $105k savings + $170k in retirement
* Income of $60k - $80k (depending on commission)

Rent is not very cheap where we live. We do not live together currently.

I paid off my loans long ago and it was a lot of hard work. I don't know if I'm prepared to go through that again. If we were to get hitched and share the debt burden, I envision us having very meager lives for a long time, possibly affecting our retirement in a big way. Is that fair to say? What would it take to pay this off in order to have a desirable future? Is it worth risking finances to save the relationship?",11Jan2019,1
128,"I'm 18, attending a local community college, living at home. All of my close friends from high school have moved away to attend universities in other cities and states. Because of my niche major, the circle of people I have classes with is rather slim, I've maybe met only 45 people in my entire first semester of college. Because I attend a junior college, there aren't really any extracurricular events to meet people at, and because everybody lives off campus nobody really spends much time at school outside of classes. I've become pretty good friends with about 7 guys, but we all live rather far apart and have wildly different schedules, so we don't really hang out much. Can anybody offer advice on how to meet new people when school really isn't an option? It feels as though I've moved to entirely new city, even though it's the same one I've always lived in. Thanks.

130,"I’ve been with my husband (25M) for three and a half years now. We have two children together and have moved across the country to be with his family. Things just have never really been great. But we had kids together. When I first met him he was an alcoholic. I helped him through it and he got sober and we had two beautiful babies. 
I have manic depression so I have a lot of anger issues. I’ve done lots of bad things on my part as in hurting myself, yelling a lot, throwing things, and recently I’ve just tore my house apart. I’ve never ever hit anyone and I never will just so that’s clear. Every time i have one of my ‘episodes’ I pick myself up and try to be better. 
I know I’m not the best partner, but I feel I’m not horrible. For the past year or so whenever I talk too much and just babble on and on my S/O tells me to stop talking so much, that’s it’s annoying, and that I talk about work too much. I’ve tried pushing it away and trying to not be so annoying. It just keeps happening. How does someone not talk about work when it’s literally 80% of my life. Anyway, for the past few months I’ve been telling him (when we fight) that he tells me I’m annoying and tells me to stop talking and he said he’s sorry and he gets why I talk so much. But then just continues to do the same thing. He doesn’t talk to me ever. When we go out to dinner we don’t have conversations, we talk about the kids and then basically nothing else. Car rides are silent unless I’m singing cause he won’t sing with me. Lately (since Christmas) I’ve been telling him I want to dance with him. Nothing fancy just a little slow dancing in the kitchen or something. And he won’t do it. When I speak up and tell him things I wish would happen in the relationship and tithings he does, he tells me I’m being crazy and i need to take my meds. I don’t know what to do anymore. I fell like I’m stuck. I can’t leave him because I have literally no one here. My family is on the other side of the country and I have no friends here except coworkers. So if I leave, I lose everything. My house, my car, and most importantly my children. And I would be 100% completely alone. Please help me. I don’t know what to do anymore.

I’m a full time uni student and I work at a pizza place so I don’t make that much money, but if I could I’d save it all up myself.

132,"Hello, 

This is my first time posting on Reddit, so please excuse any grammatical errors, etc. 

To start, I'm 27 years old and have no idea what to do with my life. I am suffering from pretty bad anxiety/depression which is hindering me from doing anything. Within the past 3 years, I've been fired from two jobs because of it. 

Unfortunately, my life really never allowed me to attend college due to financial and family troubles, but in 2017 I was finally able to go to a community college. I was working a 9-5 job at the time and night classes worked out perfectly. (The job I was working was a bank btw) I knew this wasn't my career path, but it paid well for the time being, and the hours were great.(and I didn't work with the general public which was fantastic for my anxiety) Sadly, as I stated earlier, I got fired a few weeks ago which took a huge blow to my self esteem. Not only was I fired from one job it had now become two in a row. 

I was surprisingly able to use this setback to find a new job rather quickly-and in the medical field. I've been working this job for three weeks now, and I'm learning it isn't for me. Not only did I take a huge pay cut, the hours go way past the ""scheduled"" time ;there is so much overtime...and my dreams of finishing school are not going to happen.

(( I was trying to get a liberals degree in college, just to have something.))

I'm at such a loss on what to do anymore. I feel like such a failure, as I don't even have a college degree and I feel as if I'm unable to hold a career. I feel so bad because my fiance is so supportive and he has such a great career, and I'm just holding him back. On top of that, I'm struggling with 10k in credit card debt.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for coming off as whiny-I normally wouldn't post here, but I don't have any friends and I'm hoping that an anonymous community can give some advice. :\\ 

Thanks so much in advance.

tl;dr: I'm a 27 year old woman who has no hopes and dreams, and I can't hold a career as nothing makes me happy anymore. ",11Jan2019,1

135,"Over the past weekend, me and my SO had over his best friend (we'll call Stan) and his SO (we'll call Rasha).

  
Stan has been over before, and was very nice, clean, and fun. Rasha is the same and they have been together for a while.  
This time around, however, Stan was constantly talking, showing us things, telling us we don't understand and that we need to listen, almost like they were on coke, but we know Stan does not do drugs.

  
Stan was telling us that they were the next Albert Einstein, and that they will change the world. They were talking about dropping out of college (which they are passionate about) to decipher a book that scholars have spent years trying.   
This scared Rasha. Rasha was terrified all weekend, as were me and my SO. He has known them since they were in elementary, and this kind of behavior was unlike S entirely.  


Two days ago, Rasha decided to call the police and had Stan taken away in restraints to a hospital, worrying for both of their safety due to Stan's  extreme manic state. However, Stan is now completely upset, taken aback, thinks everyone views them as crazy, and the hospital is releasing them without any worry for their mental state. Rasha has called to talk to the nurses, but because he knows who he is, where he is, just not why he's in there, they're releasing him.   


I'm worried for Stan. I tried to message them and they said ""I don't need your help. Cya"". He is about to ruin all of his relationships and aspirations for a psychotic state that no one will take seriously enough. He is released from the hospital tomorrow and everyone does not know what will come next from him.  
Is there anything I, Rasha, or my SO can do to help Stan, when the hospitals and police won't?

139,"Okay, so I might be making this sound worse due to my anxiety, but here goes. I want to keep this as vague as possible in case someone who might know me runs into it. This seems like a cool place, but the people in my life might not be. All information provided is necessary to the story, all unimportant parts are tossed out for anonymity's sake. 

I just moved to a new high school. A few kids from my old one, including the guy who centers this story. Earlier in the year, I made an awkward apology to him that was incredibly vague. It was for something that happened at our old school. I hate what I did. It wasn't super severe, but it made me feel like shit. Probably made whoever I did it too feel pretty bad too. That's right. I apologised to this guy for something I'm not even sure I did to him. Dumbass move, I know but at the time I was 100% that it was him. It could've been some other guy. That was a weird year. I didn't do it to multiple people, just one, but I forget which one.

Guy 1 is the guy I apologised to. Guy 2, the other potential victim, is not at this current school, and is beyond my power to contact. 

So I talk with a group who talks with this guy, and I admit to them what I did. At the time, I was dead certain it was to Guy 1. I explain in the best detail I can remember. That's where I fucked up. High schoolers spread stuff. It gets lost in translation. It could reach Guy 1, and if it wasn't him he could take it as an insult, depending on how it's worded. 

I'm not scared of him beating me up or anything, as he doesn't seem the type. I'm scared that if he takes it as an insult, he might expose a secret that I've kept from all but a spare few in this school. It's a secret that will, at best, socially ostracise me, and at the absolute worst, get me killed. I don't even know if he's said anything yet, but I'm praying he hasn't and doesn't.

I guess what I'm asking is if you were a high school guy who's been on the down and out for a while, and you heard that some weird asshole might be talking smack about you, would you put his safety at risk?

140,"I (21F) am barista at a hospital and I just agreed to study anatomy with a customer (~70M). The customer is a medical doctor and comes in often and loves talking to me. I enjoy the conversations that we have but recently I feel as if he has been hitting on me. He tells me that I am beautiful, points out some of the quirks I have, compliments my hair and sometimes walks me to cafe when I’m on my break.

Earlier this week, we had a conversation about school and I told him that I was stressed in my anatomy class, so he offered to help tutor me and offer to take me out to lunch. I didn’t want to say no because I didn’t want to come off rude. But now, I kind of regret not saying no. Because later on in the conversation I asked him how he blows off his stress and he told me that he liked watching porn as a way to blow off stress. 


Now I’m extremely confused and worried. I don’t know if he’s trying to hook up with me or if he’s trying to do a sugar arrangement.

He said it was inappropriate and somewhat offensive, and not to do it again in case another teacher finds out. Luckily, he didn’t punish us and was actually quite calm about it, but I feel like I’ve betrayed his trust and feel really guilty.

I've lived in Alaska for the majority of my life. Recently I decided to move closer to my family and pursuit my career goals in a larger, more connected place (marketing degree).

Before I moved, I planned EVERYTHING. Had a job lined up here, my credit score was good, everything was on autopay. The job I had taken paid about the same.

- The job that I lined up fell through (signed all the paperwork and had an anticipated start date and everything!!) Unemployed for 3 months...

-  Managed to rent an apartment (I have a dog so that makes things 10x more complicated) but can't afford it due to months of unemployment (had like 7k in savings but almost $4k went to this stupid apartment) 

- Literally all my missed payments and credit cards are either getting sent to collections or seriously messing up my credit score (has dropped over 100 points within the last 3 months) 

- I have to move out by February and can't find a place because my credit score sucks now, no co-signer, and not much money (finally employed at an awesome company, but the wage is super low). 

Honestly, looking at airbnbs with long term rentals all over the west coast where I can bring my dog, but I just scored this amazing job! I'm so lost right now guys, and I need some advice. I've thought this move was a total mistake, and I failed - but I'm trying to see as a learning opportunity. Someone help!!

This time I thought it would be really funny to force him to go commando for the rest of the day. So I sneaked into the locker room to “steal” it planning to message him I did it. I found what I thought was his open locker(similar outfit to what he was wearing and exact same shoes in the locker) so I went in and took out his underwear. Then these guys walked in and saw me holding a pair of underwear so I quickly walked out. I was able to hear them say “who the heck was he ?” 

I managed to get out in time and ran away from the scene quickly as I didn’t come out yet and no one knows we are dating and I didn’t feel like explaining.  After closer inspection I realized these underwear were not his(I know what his underwear looks like... I’ll just leave it at that..) I panicked in wanted to secret put it back but then I saw coaches standing/guarding the door to the locker room.

So I have two major fears rn. One which is that the security cameras caught me so I’ll probably get in trouble. Two those guys who caught me will recognize me in the hallways tomorrow. 

The guy whose underwear is missing definitely knows someone took it cause it was in the pants. Also the fact that they locked the entrance from the hallway into the Locker room after I ran away( I wanted to secretly return it without going through the pool but it was closed when I went back a few minutes later) makes me think they told the coach.

My mother and I recently moved back to our hometown in Tennessee from Florida because we simply couldn’t afford living there. The whole point in moving down to Florida was for us to start fresh and better our lives and get away from our depressing hometown. We both had jobs but our rent cost along with all of our other bills emptied her savings and we were forced to make a decision, stay there and struggle or move back to our hometown full of nothing. I had an awesome job detailing yachts and worked with the best people that I will never forget. I had a future with that company and now that we’re back in our hometown I don’t have any future here.

At this point we’re both extremely depressed(my mother has suffered from depression for years), lost, and feel like we will never get re-established. We’re currently living with my aunt in non-sanitary conditions with no water pressure, no internet and a lot of other of reasons I will not mentions. She was the only person that offered us a place to stay otherwise we’d be living in our cars.

Recently (and this happens every once in a while with her) she stopped responding to me yet she'll post Instagram stories with her boyfriend.

I have tried to repress it as much as possible because I try my best not to burden my friend, being that she is an ""empath"" and gets overwhelmed easily and runs away from people sometimes when they're going through a rough patch. I confronted her and said she was a bad friend basically for ignoring me all the time (I was just frustrated and moody at the time, I overreacted).

That's when she disappears and calls it ""Re-charging"" and ""self-care"" which I call bullshit and selfish. Re-charging and self-care is important but she does this so much that I don't know if she's selfish or not. It seems like she's caught up in her own world and herself.

I deleted her number because it really hurt that she's shut me out for her new life and said that I dump all of my problems on her and that she doesn't want to deal with it. Am I being the selfish one or is she in the wrong?  


TLDR; I (22F) have a friend (22F) who is known for dropping people when they're going through rough times because she's an ""empath"" who gets overwhelmed easily and has to take a step back from other people. I'm going through a really rough time, and she's been ignoring me for her new music career/boyfriend, and she said I dump my emotions on her. I'm wondering if that's what friends are for and I should just cut her off, or if she's right?

So, I'll get straight to it. NSFW because I'm being blunt, I always try to be honest when it comes to medical stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

 I am 19, living with parents, sexually active  (just done oral with a couple guys), and I have horrible terrible awful anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

My family is loving, happy to have me live with them forever, they pay my medical bills (no insurance), and \*conservative republican Christian stereotype.\* At least, my dad is, and he makes the money, therefore he decides where it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem: summer 2018 I got sick of being a sheltered Christian and went out with a couple guys. I need an STD test. I don't think I have any symptoms but my anxiety is telling me I have Chlamydia and I'll be infertile and die alone. I need this test because I know that I am 19 and if I am going to do adult things, I need to take responsibility and get tested every 6 months. It's been 6 months, and I should get tested, but I am TERRIFIED of asking my mother. I'm worried because I had a deep conversation with her in private and she told everyone about it. I was sad, she said she wouldn't do it again, so I told her more things and \*she broke my trust again.\* SO I can't trust her to keep this private. Even if she did keep it private, she'd ask me who/when/where/how it was and that is not her business. I can't go to the dr alone because I can't afford it... Also, I don't know what paperwork i need for the dr's office. My anxiety is really fucking me up right now. I'd love advice for either 1. How to approach this conversation with my mother (As I type this I thought of writing her a letter, what should it say?) OR 2. How to set up a dr's appointment at Planned Parenthood or any other cheap/free testing place, what I have to bring, where to find what I have to bring, etc.

162,"Hi

Sorry if i will curse, but i cant help it

I have a situation with my friend which makes me not understand why he does certain things. We are friends from school. Our friendship was based on discussing music. We used to send each other songs and discuss them. Usually one would just send a song and another would make micro analysis of this song, say wether he likes it or not and why. 

But when we went to universities to different cities everything has changed. He stopped listening to what i was sending to him. He was just saying that he will listen to it later and he didn’t. I can understand that since he was always in a new company. Like they used to have sleepovers and shit. I can understand that such situations create special atmosphere and make you feel more connected with people around other than with someone who is also important but far away. So back then it was understandable. 

But then really fucked up and weird things happened. Like, i was listening to one great band-Tool. And when i showed it to him he said he didn’t get it. Then he was asking me to send some other songs but he still could not get it. Finally, when we met (we meet once a year) i showed it to him last time. We were at the beach hanging there whole night. And he said that, im quoting, “their songs are all similar and that vocals are like one note”. I said to myself ok, fuck it, he just doesn’t like/get them. 

Some time later he tells me that one girl (they are just friends and hang a lot) showed him Tool and he started to like them. It actually became his favorite band. He would talk about it all the time and say that these guys make very complicated music with lots of layers and that vocals are versatile (which is almost complete opposite from what he was telling me). What the fuck? 

My other school friend also said that he was showing him some band, which he disliked back then, but when guys from university showed it to him, he absolutely loved it. What the fuck? 

Then when i was communicating with this girl i mentioned and found out that whatever music she shows to him, he listens carefully and tries to understand it. What the hell? To be clear, after he went to university he hasn’t replied to the majority of content that i showed to him. He was saying that he listened to them, but forgot to reply me (which is obviously cheap horse shit, previously he would listen and analyze it even if he doesn’t like it, but now he LISTENED AND FORGOT). 

When i asked this girl about it she said that atmosphere plays a big role. And she is right, but: when he was trying to understand Tool, he would ask me to show some other songs to him, meaning that he was in a mood/atmosphere for them. Also, how the fuck is showing a song to a friend (which i meet once a year) on a beach near a sea not atmospheric?

What the fuck is wrong with him? Its not like he completely ignores me. We are actually very close friends, i am a part of a company with him and that girl and some other people. We still talk very frequently, everything is fine. He sometimes, but rarely, listens to some stuff i give him. But man this thing i described makes me sick. I never analyzed it, but when i started to think deeper about it i became very offended by this. ",11Jan2019,1

My dad has become someone I cannot stand to be around. He has so much anger and rage due to a number of things: the death of his parents, many deep rooted fights between him and my mother, family affairs, some mistakes my siblings and I have made, job insecurity, and insecurity in general.

I am interested in ultimately applying again to different PhD or PsyD programs in clinical or counseling psychology. From what I know, most of these programs tend to have deadlines in December/January, and that they tend to only begin in Fall semesters (any feedback regarding this “knowledge” of mine would be appreciated).

I have a winding path ahead of me with a lot of variables going on (just completed the first year of an APA accredited Combined PsyD program, but won’t be returning due to financial issues). I don’t know if/when I will even apply to doctoral programs again (it is still a dream/goal of mine), but wanted to find out what’s the latest I could still report my 3 GRE scores for most doctoral program applications/any other related considerations I may be overlooking.

I don’t want to go through studying/exam-taking again, and don’t believe I’ll be able to reproduce the combination of GRE General scores that I earned across the two test dates listed below. I also don’t want to retake the GRE Subject.

With all of the aforementioned in mind, when’s the latest I’ll be able to apply to most APA-accredited doctoral programs with the score dates below (earliest is September, 7 2016)? Any considerations that I'm overlooking?

Seems like the latest I’d be able to use these scores would be if applying for a Fall 2022 cycle (granted that the program only has the option to start in the Fall… which seems to be the case for most of these programs), but even then, would I be able to report my September 7, 2016 score? Would the application for the program even be open in time for me to send the score report during its period of validity (that score would be invalid on September 6, 2021)?

Just want some help understanding considerations that I may be unaware of and a general idea of when my last shot would be to use these scores for the aforementioned programs.

The way I am currently seeing it, my last shot using these scores for most programs would be to apply for Fall of 2022 (not even fully sure of that).

Do any of these programs (APA accredited only) begin in the Spring?

From the ETS website: “For tests taken on or after July 1, 2016, scores are reportable for five years following your test date. For example, scores for a test taken on July 3, 2018, are reportable through July 2, 2023.”

My score dates:

GRE General

September 7, 2016. Valid until September 6, 2021. November 18, 2016. Valid until November, 17 2021.

GRE Subject

October, 29 2016. Valid until October, 29 2021.

Thanks so much. Any insight would be appreciated for blindspots/considerations that I may have overlooked/be overlooking. I apologize if I didn’t word my questions or what I need help with too well. Please comment with your own questions asking for clarification from me if necessary. Again — any responses will be highly appreciated.

I don't have any special person in my life that makes me feel connected, not anymore at least, neither do I have any friends or family. I use to have someone that made me trully feel like i belonged with but the relationship ended and while i still care alot, it seems they no longer want me in there life. Its been a few years since it ended, months since we spoke at all. Its a big part of it but even in general I am just consumed with unabating loneliness and feel so disconnected from everything around me. Its been like this for so long and just gets worse as time goes on. I honestly can't even remember how it felt to really smile or be happy. I don't want to keep faking it or lying to myself but its gotten so much as to make it hard to even bare a single day. Honestly I know I'm probably not ready for a new relationship but I really wish I had someone to be here with me.. a real friend, that could make this easier to bare. How can i handle being so alone, without the weight getting worse? Is it even possible to find a connection that can matter when this pain has grown past the point I can mask? How would I even start?

BACKGROUND

Since the beginning of the year, my first period teacher, gave me hell every day at 7:25 am. He purposely fucks with people for the fun of it. He is literally a terrible human being and I heard him blatantly admitting that he fucks with the kids for his own enjoyment, to another teacher. If I legit were one second late, he’d mark me. If I wear my hood—even accidentally, he’d write me up. He gives garbage material and grades shit like a maniac asshole. You get the point. He is the worst person on earth and I want revenge.

I recently figured out he is actually extremely into mountain biking. That is, because I found his Instagram, surlyrider. My goal is to use his account and the embarrassing personal shit to my advantage and expose his dumbass but can’t think of a way that’s gunna really make him hate himself and his career. I figured just telling ppl ab his act was too easy and ineffective. I want him HUMILIATED. Advice?",11Jan2019,1

194,"I recently moved to a new state (~1yr) and moved my mother (who had just retired) with me.  She had told me she was going to travel a lot in her retirement and then stay with me in between trips. However, since moving she has expressed no interest in doing this. While this is fine, she has become extremely dependent on me emotionally and I am not really allowed to have a life without her involved in some manner. 

We have almost daily arguments about minute things which are almost always my fault (and while some or most may be my fault it is draining being blamed for everything wrong).

She often tells me that I don’t even want her there and that she should just leave and That everyone leaves her anyway.  The first few times I admittedly felt guilty but it has drained on me over time. Now it’s at the point where every day I walk on eggshells to not fight, I stay at work way later to avoid interacting, and have become quite depressed. I hate even being in my own house now.

Honestly at this point I may actually want her to leave but I definitely don’t want her out of my life.  I feel like if I even mention this to her it will destroy her and she will leave forever as everything I say or do seems to send her into deep depression or a fit of rage.

195,"I’ve never really admitted it out loud really. For a long time I’ve just felt numb? Even though when I cry, I cry for a long time (which isn’t a lot), I often question myself for feeling nothing? I used to feel *too* much, but now I’ve been on birth control that helped me manage that (also my pms is also just complete bullshit in general) and now it feels like I don’t feel enough, and I’m slowly degenerating?

I do like to say I’m better though, because I am. Currently in college, and two years ago I was pretty solidly depressed. I avoided activities I liked, lashed out at people, never really left the house. I’m working on it! But now that I’m focusing on other issues I feel as though I’m almost worse off? Even though my mind is telling me I’m not, and I’m better enough to trust it.

Sorry for the ramble, I’m exhausted :/ my main point is: I’m numb. I no longer have a motivation to challenge myself and do things I really enjoy. I picked up a new hobby, which was fun! But the part that really matters to me is art. I drew a lot when I was younger. I was the kid that was constantly drawing, motivating myself to get better at all costs.

Now, though? Nothing. I can’t draw digitally anymore, I barely know how to draw a concise figure, and my friends who had recently started to draw have now almost surpassed me in some aspects of drawing!

I wanted to draw a comic, I never have. I wanted to animate: I’ve only done it once and that was over 3 years ago.

Idk, I’m just not motivated to work hard, I guess I never have? I was that kid who never had to try for grades in school , and now I just feel lost not even wanting to try for what I poured sweat and tears into when I was so much younger.

I did stop drawing in high school for a reason (pursued engineering, got in. It beat me to the ground and I didn’t have the motivation to fix it. I did change majors though and am much happier in my art related major. Used school as an excuse not to draw but now I really don’t have a reason not to try and draw again)

I know my issue is discipline mostly, I really tried  to do r/discipline but I just couldn’t. I feel lost. I feel numb?

Also I guess I’m just venting more than asking for advice. I don’t want this to get removed, so I guess I’ll ask if anyone else has felt this way before, and what did you do? I just feel so fucking tired and even in those times where I’m genuinely healthy and enjoying life, these “rare” lows I have are just so prominent and never fail to shake me up. I don’t know if I’m tired anymore. I just feel like a useless, unmoving rock :|",11Jan2019,1

So I’m 15 almost 16 and I just moved halfway across the country to probably my least favorite place in the world, from the best place. Anyways, I liked this girl there for along time, and while I was there I thought I’d never move so I already had my life planned out there pretty much, cause I never thought I’d move (yes, I realize I shouldn’t have done that now). But this girl I thought was really special, like she was awesome in every way and I had a huge crush on her for a while and I was planning on asking her to be my girlfriend. The next day I found out I was moving thousands of miles away and yeah that was terrible. So after that I tried to be with her as much as possible, still hadn’t asked her out yet.
It’s been 6 months since then and we’re dating long distance now. Which I guess is better than nothing maybe? I dunno, but I miss her an unexplainable amount and I honestly love her for so many reasons. But, I miss her so much to the point where I’m more sad about it than happy, and I just can’t show my love in any way through text or calls as well as I could in person. She has depression as well as I do, but I can’t make her feel any better through text or anything, I want to make her feel like she’s actually loved and she matters, but there’s no way that I really can without being there. 
Overall, I just feel really depressed without her. But I really do love her and I’ve thought about it a lot, I don’t like anyone more than I do her. And what I meant in the beginning by planning my life there is that I was hoping to do like fun stuff with my first girlfriend, ya know go on drives, go to the fair, go swimming, hiking, etc. (It was Vermont, you can do almost anything there).

I got pregnant at 16 and had my first baby at 17 , he started drinking more around  this time instead of a few beers   1-2 times a week he started drinking a 750ml of vodka 2-4  times a week . That’s when We started fighting more because he became verbally abusive  and controlling when he was drunk, did I mention I had ppd  . Like a dumbass I got pregnant soon after and had another baby 11 months later. Soon after I had my 2nd child I developed hidradenitis suppurativa, this along with gaining weight and hearing all the time “ im a fat  bitch with a diseased p***y  no one will want me “ anytime he was drunk sent me into depression. After I had my 4th chid he lost his job and we’ve been on welfare since that , he’s had a few agency jobs but always fucks it up with his drinking.

I tried going back to school but  on the days he  had been drinking he would leave or wouldn’t wake up when I needed to leave so I had no one to watch my kids I missed too much days and they kicked me out . I wish I could do my schooling online but I’m not that smart I have a very hard time understanding things especially in math, I need a teacher there to help me Sometimes I wish I could just go back and do everything differently I’m so depressed I have no friends just my husband and my kids . My husband isn’t horrible he’s a okay person when he’s not drunk and helps me with the kids and house. He’s also stopped with the verbal abuse since cas got involved with us /we moved to a new area although he still drinks. 
  I  just really want to get a job and  go to school / my own place hate being on welfare .

I inspected the item very carefully before shipping and there was no such damage, and they insisted that the packaging was completely intact upon arrival, so I can only imagine that they intentionally damaged the item to force a return.

This platform is extremely unfriendly to sellers, so there is no real proper channel to go through that will get results, but I am reluctant to let this go without some accountability as the scammer is an older professional who should know better and the item which is worth about a month of groceries for me is now ruined. My friends are unanimously telling me to report them to their corporate office for committing mail fraud on the job, but I worry that the potential consequences might be too harsh.

Here is where my problem lies. I can't get out of my state because I'm not financially ready to. Hell, i only have $75 in savings. That's not because I'm bad with money, it's because I don't have a job. I apply and follow all the advice on r/jobs but I still haven't had any luck. I'm also just not in the right mental state for a job. Most days I can't even leave my room, except to use the bathroom and MAYBE food. 

I can't afford to see a psychiatrist or any form of therapy. I have issues I absolutely cannot solve myself, and my friend nor my family can help. They just don't understand and give me the classic "" well stop being depressed. "" Bullshit. So it leaves me stuck in a cycle; I can't afford for therapy because I can't work. I can't work because of my mental issues. 

I know one way that would help me out of my rut. Moving to a different state. I currently live in Central Texas with my senior parents ( adopted ) but I'd love to move to Colorado or Washington. I've lived in both states and I absolutely loved it there. All I really want is an apartment all to myself. For every day that goes by I hate my city more and more.

I don't care if that means I have to be an office drone with a dead end job. Working a simple 9-5 job where I don't have to worry about the weather or work around dangerous machinery.. that sounds so nice to me. ( I've worked hard labor before and it's hell )

I feel like I've fallen in a frozen lake. My fingers grinded down to the bone from clawing at the ice, trying to pull myself out of the bone chilling water. 

I feel like I'm stuck in a cramped cage that's getting smaller and smaller every day... And the key is just out of my reach.

I have tuition free school (only in my state) because my dad was in the military and my only expense is my car so I’ve saved a good chunk of money. 

My boyfriend (23M) lives in another state. We’ve been together for about a year and a half  and have been long distance for about a year of that while he was in the military. He’s out now and has a good full time job and an apartment. We’ve decided in recent months that we want to move in together, but my dad is totally unsupportive. He thinks I’m stupid for giving up the free school/free rent by living at home.

My job is super awesome and flexible so I will easily be able to transfer out of state and they also offer to pay for employees’ bachelor’s degree in full from Arizona State University online. I planned to take both of these opportunities and I would still totally be on track  and still have free school even in another state. I have brought this up to my dad, but he screams and says I would be stupid to move out of his house and get a degree online. He says no employer will ever take me seriously and that my life will be ruined if I do this. 

I’m at a loss. I have a great relationship with my dad otherwise, but he’s very strict and wants me to pursue a career in medicine (which I DO NOT want) and live at home for the next 2 years of college.

I'm a regular at my local coffee shop and I'm pretty friendly with the staff because I see them multiple times a week. 
One guy in particular had taken to teasing me pretty frequently and would always try to trick me into ordering whipped cream or marshmellows or a slice of cake along with my order. He's super nice, funny and friendly but at first I thought it was just because of his job? A couple times when I showed up he'd blank me completely and not really talk as much so for a while I actually thought he didnt like me at all 😅 
It wasn't until a couple weeks ago he was asking about how I was spending the holidays I realised I kinda liked him more than I should've? 

This is where it gets pretty complicated, because at the time I had a girlfriend that I'd been dating for about half a year so I brushed any sort of thoughts aside. I'm not the type of person to cheat or lead somebody on so didn't want to get ahead of myself before talking to her about it first. 

Last week I came in pretty late and he was working the counter with his partner but it was pretty packed so I didn't really expect to talk much whilst being served. I ended up getting tricked into a slice of carrot cake with my usual order, then parked myself the only table which was directly in front of the counter.

 I didn't really expect anything usual but every time he'd go out and collect cups and wipe down tables he'd stop and chat. 
He'd never actually done this before then but I didn't mind so we spoke whenever he stopped for a couple seconds, just idle chatter about when I was free or how I'd spent my day. I always sketch when I drink in and about 10 minutes before I left he stopped and complimented my drawings that I do before rushing off again. It was round about then that I thought he was acting slightly odd and hovering around much more frequently then he usually does but chalked it up to nothing so I kept on as I was.

 I had already said goodbye to the other barista when and was literally at the door when he stopped me. I couldnt actually hear the first half of what he said but he ended asking that if I ever wanted to have a coffee with him at some point to message him and offered a scrap of paper to me. 
I was so surprised that all I did was take the paper from him and then thank him before leaving?? (like seriously why did I thank him??)

He'd covered all bases and written his number, full name AND email on this piece of paper so I could contact him. I'd felt pretty shitty because I knew I had to text him telling him I had a girlfriend and a part of me didn't want to? I knew I couldn't NOT though so I ended up texting the number just to confirm it was him before actually telling him. He replied saying he'd guessed I couldve been in a relationship but that the offer still stood for if I wanted to meet outside of his workplace which was really kind of him? I messaged back saying I was free that weekend but he hasn't messaged me back since which had left me pretty gutted.

 It's been about a week since he left me on read.

I worked up the courage to go back in again yesterday whilst he was working and he smiled and we chatted but he just kind of left me be, and didn't really mention anything.

Id broke up with my girlfriend a couple nights before because I found out that while I was with family on NYE she'd cheated on me with somebody (honestly was probably best we split for the both of us). I wanted to stake out to see if he was still willing to go on a date or something but I didn't have the guts to bring it up in person..



I'm stuck in a predicament because he probably thinks I'm a lesbian who's in a relationship - I'm bi, single and ready to mingle but I don't want to bring it up if he's already moved on from it? I think I'd be too embarrassed to ever go back in and I don't exactly like the other coffee place. Plus, I'm friends with the other baristas and I don't exactly want to just disappear off the grid.

I'm stuck. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!",11Jan2019,1

223,"Actually, ""office concubine"" would be a better word, since he shows favor to his employees who are pretty. He acts like a boyfriend would without making a move. Moreover, if you were single when you first met him and later get a SO or be hit on by someone, he acts like a jealous husband (thats what I mean by ""territorial""). Guys at work don't dare to approach a woman they know the manager fancies because they know they will regret it. Others (unattractive older woman, men) cannot treat the favourites poorly (it doesn't mean, that he promotes his employees by looks, just the pretty ones get a privileged treatment).",11Jan2019,1
224,"Hello, I am a 20 y old attending college and during my first year I started getting interested in this girl. I have never been in a relationship before so I brushed off all the signs that she was into me but she kept signaling that she did. She would sit on my table or I would catch her looking at me across the table and stuff. She added me on Facebook and liked my profile pictures etc. 

I met her through my group project in one of my classes. She already knew the guys in my group, including the guy she got with and still is in a relationship with him but at the time we were all just friends. I knew they were going to this jazz night and even though they mentioned it, I wasn’t directly invited but because I wanted to get to know them all more and potentially hang out with this girl I turned up anyway. She go excited when I arrived and I waved over at them. She smiled and we all went for a drink at the bar. I came with them even though I had no money and she offered to buy me a drink. Even after I declined the offer she asked me again and I said sure. 

A week later I was with my group and I told them all that I liked her and that they should tell me now if they crushed on her at all since they knew her before me. They all said no so I figured I was going to go for it. I messaged her one night if she wanted to go to another event and she accepted. Me her and my “friend” all went and we had a good time. After we went to the club and danced al night. She held my hand a few times when she was walking me to the bar and I was sure she liked me.

I plucked up the courage to ask her out the next day and we had an okay time. We hugged and moved on. I messaged her asking her if she had a good time and she messaged hours later saying she did and she’d like to do it again. Then she started ghosting. I wouldn’t message her constantly but I would just reply to the open ended messages she left and she would always reply hours later. I was kind of bummed out but I decided the date probably went bad and she probably didn’t like me as a person so I moved on. 

I kind of ignored her during class and she even sat next to me which is a first. Once my next class started she came up to me and started talking to me. I asked her if she wanted to go out to smoke with me on the roof and we hung out before class. It was awkward for me and for her because we both didn’t know what to say. She asked what I was doing that night and I said nothing which I should have asked her out then but I didn’t because I didn’t want to rekindle my feelings for her. Class starts and she sits next to me. She starts flirting and touching my arm softly and touching my laptop. I was hooked again and as we were walking out I was going to ask her out for real but her friends stopped her and she walked off with them instead.

Here is where my friend gets involved. I’ll call him Bill. One time I saw Bill at the campus shop and we said hi and started talking. He asked me about how my date went and I told him it didn’t go great and she probably wasn’t interested. I told him that she bought me drinks and the flirting etc and he immediately jumped to “she likes you bro just go for it”. He planned that we go out with her to the club and I ask her out then, just me her and Bill. 

Fast forward to the club. We all meet up and the same thing happens. We drink she hold my hand etc etc. I didn’t ask her out I don’t know why but probably because Bill was always with us and he didn’t give us time to be alone. Bill invites me to his flat mates party or something where everyone was going to be there. It was me Bill the girl I liked and several other girls that liked Bill. Bill is an attractive guy more so than me and he had a lot of girls that wanted him but for some reason he had to end up with the girl I liked but I’ll get to that later.

This would be the night that I ask her out. We were both really drunk and she came over to me when I was feeling down and wanted to dance. Then she left the dance floor and went somewhere else I don’t know wtf she was doing but whatever. I figured this would be it and I had to ask her out now or never. I told her we needed to talk and she grabbed my hand and we walked out. I told her I liked her and I knew it was coming but she said “I like Bill”. I was heart broken because for months I was chasing this girl all for this to happen. I felt stupid because the so called signs were all false and I felt used from both my friend Bill and her because I felt like I was the catalyst for their relationship and she was just using me to make Bill jealous.

A week later Bill and the girl make it official on Facebook that they’re dating and I felt like shit. It sucked because I lost my friend and I lost her as a friend and I potential girl friend one that I was so excited to potentially be with but all the effort was for nothing.

The reason I’m still not over it is because Bill and the girl are still in most of my classes and I always have to seem them and be reminded of the times we hung out. I was never invited to a night out with them ever again and that was the end of our friendships. 


Sorry if this is long and boring and bad but English isn’t my first language, and if you’ve made it this far thank you for reading.


tl;dr: girl I liked showed signs she liked me when she actually liked my friend who lead me to believe she liked me and encouraged me to ask her out",11Jan2019,1
225,"I'm taking an online Business law 1 class which is pretty easy for me so far. Just know how the terms work and how it applies to situations. We just took an online midterm today consisting of 35 multiple choice questions with a time limit of 50 minutes. I felt the exam was fairly easy and I really put the time into studying so I ended up getting an A and finished in 29 minutes. Our professor just posted this hours after the exam.

"" I couldnt help but notice that many of you completed the exam in quite a short amount of time.  Some of you even completed it in an impossibly short amount of time and still got an A on the exam.  I do not tolerate cheating in the class.  Thus, grades will be adjusted accordingly at the end of the winter session.""

I felt like the time I took for the exam was fair and I'm not really sure if she has the ability to change a grade based on how long you take on an exam. I feel like this punishes students who actually studied hard and have a mastery of the material. Last semester I had a professor who gave us an 80 question midterm and final with an hour time limit so I feel like I have learned how to use my time efficiently as well. Does she have the right to do this and do I have any options against this in case she decides to throw me into that group of cheaters?

228,"To help keep my information private I’m referring to the person I’m talking about as parent 1. And for the same reason, I’m sorry for lack of details. I’ve rewrote this like 10 times. 

I’ve always looked up to parent 1 a lot. They’re a rather brilliant person in my opinion,  well educated, and an exceptionally honest person. 

Parent 1 never really talked about their life too much with their kids but recently I accidentally came upon this information. 

Turns out they killed a person for no known reason other than rage from what I can tell and tried to hide it. The killing was brutal IMO but I guess any killing of a person is kind of brutal. Parent 1 got away with it for a fairly long time and then came out and confessed on their own. They received a life sentence but paroled out. I’m not sure how long they spent in prison but they had kids kind of later in life but not that old. There is also a small chance they went on trial and got found guilty of a lesser crime and got out because of the statue of limitations were up but I don’t think this is the case. 

I work in law and help put criminals in jail. now and I feel like my childhood has been flipped upside down knowing the person I’ve always looked up to most did something so brutal. 

I feel like everything I know about parent 1’s life is adding up and connected now. There are a mountain of connections that all make sense now, it’s like someone gave me half the missing pieces to a jigsaw puzzle I didn’t know I was trying to complete. 

Anyways, I guess the advice I’m looking for is... Do I tell parent 2? Does parent 2 already know and never said anything to me? Do I tell my siblings? I’m very close with some of them and we don’t tend to keep secrets from each other. Do I talk to parent 1 about it? I’m certain grandparent 1 knows about it and I could ask them but grandparent 1 isn’t 100% there anymore, maybe 75% there (Last conversation I had with grandparent 1 was them telling me people shouldn’t be allowed to live as long as they are). Or do I just live with this secret. ",11Jan2019,1

He followed us and almost caught up to us but we were able to back up and leave quickly. My coworker and I are really shaken up, but the police said they could only escort us out after work. I called my boss and he said that he would look at the cameras but there wasn’t much else he could do. I close again tomorrow night and I’m super scared he will be back. I know I could carry pepper spray, or a knife or something, but does anyone know if there’s anything else that I could do? I’m guessing not, but I’m just really nervous and asking for any advice.

230,"So here's the tea.

I worked with this guy for a year or so and we never really talked (I've always been pretty shy). Well a couple months ago -I don't really know how it started- we started texting. We talked all the time at work at this point.  But here's why I'm confused. 

I don't know if we're just friends or not. 

We've only hung out once outside of work but there were other people there. We get along great at work but we almost never have the same shift so the only time we are usually talking is over text. 

Everyone has been telling me that he either likes me or he's gay and that if we're just friends he wouldn't be talking to me this much. The thing is though is that I'm not sure if I like him more than a friend anymore. Now that people have gotten into my head that he might like me I've started freaking out and I don't know what to do with myself. Our conversations are usually pretty light and fun - there isn't any blatantly obvious flirting or anything like that which is why I'm a little confused.

I know this probably seems petty but it's really bothering me because he's one of the only friends I have rn outside of work.

I know there's not a straight answer for this but your two-cents on the matter would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance!",11Jan2019,1
231,"So I'm 17, 6'5 and just try to be an overall good person and a senior in high school. Little overweight but wear it well and have already started to lose weight. I have been told by everyone that I'm able to make them laugh and from personal experience I can tell that I can.  Just enjoy having fun. 

MAIN PART: There's a girl at school and we've known each other for about 2 years. We worked on a project together and ever since then we have gotten close. 

We started texting and started hanging out around school. Walking to classes together. Skipping classes together. One time we went to her locker together and she just stripped to her underwear quickly in front of her locker. She asked if I peeked and when I said no she said it was okay if I did. I saw her in the hallway once and she was walking with some junior and they were holding hands and I found out that they were together. 

I was working on homework in the library and she came in with her boyfriend and he sat down in the table in front of me. Instead of sitting with him she sat down with me. He called her over but she just told him to sit with us and it got so awkward. 

I was also walking in the hallway alone and she told me to walk with her. She said she was skipping a class. I knew her boyfriend had lunch that period and I told her to go to him. She said I hung out with him yesterday and I want to hang out with you today. 

The last thing was that I was waiting for the bus last year and she was leaving at the same time and she threw a little rock at my leg. When I threw it back she was getting in her dad's car it missed and she picked it up. I saw her in the beginning of this school year and I finally got her back for what she did by throwing paper at her. This is where it gets weird. She told me that she kept that rock over the span of 7 months. I didn't believe her but she pulled it out of her bag and told me it was her good luck charm. 

Other small things are that when we were in Florida and she was with family and I was with friends she asked if I wanted to meet up. She laughs hysterically to the point where she cries when I make a joke. She tells me that I truly understand her. 

I also feel that her boyfriend feels that I'm a threat to their relationship. She was talking to me about a month or two ago and her boyfriend told her to come and she kept talking to me. I told her to go but she said it was ok and that I should continue talking. He literally had to pull her away. Now when I see them in the hallway and I she says hi and I wave back he literally grabs her by the waist and pulls her closer to him.

I don't want to ruin her current relationship but I just wanted to know if you guys think she likes me. I haven't talked to her in like 3 weeks but will be open to any opinions.",11Jan2019,1
232,"I feel like if I talk on here I’ll seem like I have a major problem or I’m really that desperate, and maybe I am. 
I just don’t know why I keep going back and forth trying to solve my problems by being defensive when someone criticizes me about anything; my art, or my work ethics. I’ve accomplished a lot but yet I want to do more, I wanna make stories and do something great because I love being creative, however I’m so stubborn that it feels like genetic or it’s in my blood. 
I feel I fall apart some days and I come back together the next like nothing ever happen; I fall apart on the simplest things like changing a character’s name in my story or going to drive somewhere far. I’m afraid of change and I hear the same thing ‘just do it’ it’s not that easy; it feels easy when I do it but it takes so much time for me to actually do it, and even if I do it I feel like I have no confidence In myself. 
Then again sometimes it’s the complete opposite and I’m constantly on a roll, like when I get into a  work out routine. I feel like I’m not working hard enough or I can’t because everything seems pointless because I’ll be out of this routine soon, and I won’t get back to it for a long time. 
I’m scared of this feeling, this idea that my life is a clock running every few months to actually working; I’ve been accustomed to being lazy but I try to change through what I’m inspired by or what people really tell me harshly in the best of ways. 
But then again I forget those words they told me or what my goal was; I just want someone to talk too. I want someone to understand me and give me all the right answers. 
I am not suicidal or self-harming in anyway by the way. 

I just don’t know how to handle myself; all these emotions could be based on simple stuff that any normal person could handle, but then I’m worried I’m abnormal. I don’t wanna trouble others with going to see a professional because I feel Like I’m being a nuisance of wasting someone’s time or I’m the strange one of the group. I’m religious and I believe in God, but I suffer so much on the inside that I feel like people’s counter arguments destroy what I believe which gives me more things to worry on. I don’t like to worry but it’s like a magnet, I keep being drawn into worrying about everything that I don’t know. I just don’t know how to handle myself. ",11Jan2019,1

I've been somewhat socially awkward in the past few years, but I was able to get over it; the girl shows sign of social awkwardness, tried to get her to talk a few time, but she always gives me ""nothing""-responses (this apparently doesn't happen just to me, but to everybody) and she acts quite passive-aggressive sometimes, while other times she lets herself a bit freedom and show other bits of her emotions and smile/laugh. She avoids every type of physical contact (she's the only person in my class who doesn't want to shake hands/high five me) and she also doesn't talk with anybody from my class besides me and my deskmate, and when she does, it's usually just a question and then she either watches us (me and deskmate) conversate with each other or just goes away as soon as we ask her anything. It's actually pretty common for her to ""insert"" herself into conversations, just as a listener, but she never speaks, which makes me believe she might actually want to talk with other people, but she feels... insecure...? (Just my speculation here).
We share a few interests (anime and manga, that's the two interest she ever mentioned to me) but she's doesn't talk too much about it (besides I like this show, or this like this other show / she never made a comment on a show's theme or anything like that).
Any idea on what to do to get to know this person better? Like I said she almost always give me ""nothing""-responses a lot of times, and only recently I started trying to have small talks with her; and even while texting, where she's a bit more sharing, she tends to be passive-aggressive. I just have no solid idea of how to approach people like her.",11Jan2019,1
250,So I recently got my first boyfriend but things aren’t so great. I struggle with showing emotion and knows this and whenever I open up I feel ignored. Today I told him how I feel like he doesn’t like me for various reasons and all he responded with was “I feel hurt that you feel that way” and he does this a lot too whenever I try to tell him something that I don’t like that he’s doing he always flips it around and makes himself the victim. Not only that but he’s extremely jealous to the point he gets mad if I talk to my best friends boyfriend and tells me stop. I don’t know what to do because he was very hesitant into getting in a relationship because he thought I would leave him. Not just that but he already met my parents so if I break things off now it would make things a bit awkward not just with my parents but in classes too. What is a solution where I don’t have to keep dealing with his bs but not break up with him either.,11Jan2019,1
251,"Hi there. I am seeking some advice if possible on how to watermark my art properly. I am a small unrecognised/unknown artist but have had my art blow up several times on different platforms. This had led to people stealing and reposting my art like crazy. It got even worse when some celebrities praised my art on other people's accounts without credit to me, which drew huge undeserved attention to those people and led to even more people reposting my art. I have even had companies now steal my art and resell it as their own. It really, really sucks being unknown and struggling for commissions and then this stuff happens. I tried watermarking/signing my art but people have managed to edited it out. Is there a way to make my watermark/signature more uniquely recognisable and harder to remove without ruining my art?",11Jan2019,1

These migraines completely alter my vision and I’m having a lot of stress and anxiety about having one while I’m working and unable to find a solution to the problem when it does happen. Like I said I am the only person working at the front desk so nobody is able to jump on the computer and schedule appointments check clients in/out.

254,"I am a Masters student at a large university and in early December I applied to be a TA for undergrads in my department for this spring semester (Jan 6 - May). I sent my resume, detailed cover letter and other documents to the Director of Academic Programs. I got no confirmation that it was received, so a week later I sent a follow up asking for confirmation that it was received. Still no response. Program administrator said she is on vacation, okay. A few days ago I sent another email asking when I might hear back regarding the position. Still no response. Now we are a week into the semester and I have heard nothing (TAs are already set and hired). I never got an email or any communication regarding it. 

Mind you, this is NOT a normal job. It is a low paying part time position that I would be taking as a service to my university that I pay 50k in tuition to attend. Our program administrators literal job is to support and communicate with students (you know, the young people who pay their inflated salaries). 

So, I sent her one last email stating that I thought it was unprofessional and discourteous that I received no responses or communication whatsoever. She responded with “we are still in the process of hiring TAs but you were not selected, stop emailing me.” WHAT!? First of all, that is not true because I know for a fact that TA selection has been completed. Second of all, my application was excellent (4.0 GPA and bachelors in the course subject with a long cover letter). 

Who do I take this issue up with? The dean of my college? I should not be treated this way when seeking support through my own university. I don’t want to get in trouble but I kind of want to get back at this awful woman who clearly doesn’t deserve her job. Thanks for any advice. ",11Jan2019,1
255,"Today I went to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend and two friends. At some point we split up, as they went to grab food and my friend and I went to get drinks. We grabbed some drinks and this guy started talking to us and I felt so drunk that I for some reason had trouble getting out of the situation until my friend, who was way less drunk than I was, managed to drag me out. I remember in the car I kept asking my bf if he was upset with me and if he still loved me (because he had to wait for me in the car) and he replied that he still loves me but he also said he had to think about it. I panicked for a bit. I remember asking him once again if he’s mad at me and he said he’s not, and immediately turned up the radio to drown me out. After he dropped me off, I attempted to call him and talk to him but he said “I’m not talking about this now” and hung up on me. My friend filled me in and said that I had also joked about how so over we were and that I was going to break up with him, which I don’t remember AT ALL, though I most likely said those things sarcastically and maybe also out of anxiety. At this point I honestly think my boyfriend should just break up with me so he could find someone better.

I was overconfident and I took 6 subjects (which is considered insane) and i barely studied. Sometime in January last year, I began to indulge in weed. I smoked a lot. I took a few breaks in between but i smoked daily. I got 2 B's, 1 C, 1 D, and 2 E's. My parents were devastated. I go to a private school that's fairly expensive and my father works very hard to send me there and i still failed him. I begged him for another chance and he gave me one.

I grew up every day forced to justify my existence and was taught to believe that I would be killed at any moment and nobody would ever miss me.

Now I live every day justifying my every action in my head to the point where I'm just afraid to live. I don't do anything, and anything I do think about or do, I explain myself to my friend. Any time anyone says anything to me, disagrees, has an issue, whatever, I cannot help but to explain myself and justify my behavior.

Even if I'm wrong and I admit that I'm wrong, I justify why I initially believed I was correct, and this leads to people believing that I'm doubling down. It's not as simple of a solution as ""well, just don't do that"" because it's how I was programmed, I don't even realize I'm doing it.

I'm extremely empathetic to one extent, and have a complete and utter lack of self awareness to another extent, and it's just exhausting. I can't (and don't) live for myself. Every time I'm ignored, it's a condemnation of who I am, and every time I try to help I'm overbearing.

262,"Quick note: New to reddit so I apologize if this isn’t the place or if I’m doing this wrong or something.

This girl I have been friends with since middle school has always been my closest friend all the way up till now in our college years. I never really thought much of her in terms of wanting a relationship until recently. We kind of dip back and forth into hanging out together and doing things but it’s been different these past couple of months. Before when we hung out she always wanted friends to be around so she either invited her friends over or I would. Recently she just wants us to hang around together. To the point that we are already making plans to go out more of just us two. Usually I would take this kind of chance but to be honest, I’m not really good when it comes to receiving signals to make a move. I’m also not that great when it comes to making signals myself.

I tried different ways to see if she might be into me or not. Just easy going things like lending a sweater when she is cold or offering to pay a little more when we go out. Nothing dramatic to give away that I’m into her but it may be too subtle to tell as well. 

This past month she actually brought up something a little unexpected and its that she wants to go to San Francisco with just me during the summer. It isn’t that far to travel since we live in CA and is just a 5-6 hour drive. I told her I would think about it. I’m really into her but I don’t want to make an effort to go to SF since it feels like a really big commitment. I have plenty of time to think about this since she wants to go in the summer and we can both easily split the trip for the amount it costs to go.

Idk if I should be up front and try asking. Really I’m okay with just being friends with her still and I wouldn’t want to ruin our friendship if I ask her out and then turns out to be really awkward around me.

264,"Hey,

it's really strange and I've tried to find what does this ""phobia"" means and how it is called. It really makes my life uncomfortable.

So I've got this problem I can't hear or think about scratching a carpet/ walking on carpet with socks, cleaning carpet, or if my nail ticks, I'm really afraid it would scratch to a some kind of bad cotton thing (e.g. big scarves, sweater ). The nail thing comes just if I file or bite my nails. When I go to sleep, I have to do this wrist to hide my fingers and save them from scratching to some thing.  
The carpet thing is my bigger problem. Fortunately our house doesn't have many carpets. But when I'm somewhere else, and someone does the sounds when walking on it, I have this really bad feeling I can't describe, I got goosebumps all over the body (just writing this causes me that). So this forces me to plug my ears so I can't hear it. Also nobody should talk about carpets or cotton in front of me so this gives me the same thing.

I have this flashback and don't know if it's even true cause I can't get it. I'm around 6 years old, licking a carpet and it feels so gross. That's it. I remember that every singe time the phobia shows (every day once in minimum). This is so sick!

Since then, this phobia stays with me. But this year it got more problematic for me. I've only told my boyfriend. I would love to be cured, I can't imagine hand cleaning my future dirty baby got dirty on it's chest from some food.

269,"Hi everyone. I mostly just need a place to vent and get some feedback but here goes.

I'm 18, almost 19. Around the end of high school and through the summer, I started using a lot more drugs, got into some bad places and handled it quite poorly. By the end of it I had lost the respect of most of my friends. Since then, I went through treatment and attend AA meeting, work the steps etc. 

I had only two friends that really stuck around and all today they're my best friends, they're awesome. Only problem is they live 50 miles away at university and I'm attending community College while living at home. They're dating, and the more I see them the more I want what they have. From the outside they're relationship looks great, although I know it's imperfect. I just want that. It's great to spend time with them but after I do I know that I'm just the extra, the third wheel for lack of a better term. They've got each other and I'm here, sitting in my room, alone every night.

In the past I've jumped into relationships simply because they liked me, thinking I should be happy to be with them cause they're the only shot I've got. It was just high school bullshit, and I've matured and learned from that. But now I'm afraid that the desperate feelings are gonna trick me into the same problem. I just want to find that person that's actually interested in the things I am. That's gonna take a long fucking time. What girl my age listens to Bob Dylan and 60s rock religiously, thinks ham radio is awesome, and wants to carry 30 pounds in a backpack, hike 5 miles and camp on the dirt?

I’m all for loving your family, but he literally will not make any decision on his own. For example, he talked about wanting to propose to me (it would’ve been a long engagement) and was so excited to pick a ring and propose until he spoke to his mother about it. She was upset that she was “losing her baby” so he scrapped the whole idea. We also had plans to move to a new state together, once again he was very excited until his mother told him she thought it was a bad idea. Now it’s out of the question.

He is very sexually experienced were as I am not. I have never done anal sex before where he has. 

He’s known the _whole_ time we’ve been together that I want to wait to have anal sex until I’m ready and preferably married. (I believe in giving something sacred to my husband haha)

Anyway, sometimes when I’m feeling brave and okay to do it, I say to him “shall we try anal tonight? I think I’m okay to go ahead with it” however, we never end up doing it and the subject is forgotten about. One time he asked me “because you’ve asked me if I want to do it, does that mean we can from now on?” 
I explicitly said “no”. “I will have to say it’s what I want to happen at the time, sometimes I just feel okay to do it”

So fast forward to last night, we’re playing around, he goes down on me and eats my ass and whatnot, I’m enjoying it - then he goes to put a finger in my bum and I pull his hand anyway, so then he starts to rub his penis around my asshole and I keep his penis situated around it, not pushing it away. 

This is where I am confused and not sure how to feel. He starts to push the tip of his penis into my ass and I feel it’s okay, it doesn’t hurt that much and I don’t tell him to take it out but then he pushes in further and it really hurts, it feels like my skin is ripping apart and that if he pushes it in and further I’m going to bleed. I tell him “no, no no” and then he says “yes, yes” and I have my hand behind me (he’s got me laid on my front on the bed) and  I’m pushing him away but he’s coming back with a harder force. I’m not enjoying it, I’m in a lot of pain. I eventually push him off hard when he tries to go in even more and he gets off and looks at me and says “what’s wrong”
I just pull a sad face and turn away from him and I just lay there for what seemed a long time just staring at the wall with my ass still out kind of not thinking about anything. I am hurt he didn’t listen to me. 

Eventually I get up and he asks me again what’s wrong, I ask him why did he do that? He then starts raising his voice at me saying “no! I didn’t just do what you thought I did!” And he got dressed, walked out the room then immediately came back in and got back on the bed and asked me how I feel. I said I was confused and hurt and that I didn’t say that was okay. 

He then started crying a little, saying he felt disgusting and that I should report him and that he feels terrible. 

I don’t feel like he raped me because I didn’t say no at the start, I let him go in but then I did say no? I’m more upset because he knew I wanted to wait but he went in anyway but then I didn’t stop him straight away? 

I’m so confused. I left his house this morning after going to bed not talking to each other. It’s weird between us, he feels bad and I can tell he is angry at himself but what do I do now? I feel I should comfort him telling him it’s not his fault, meanwhile it hurts me to sit down. 

What happened? Did he just take it too far with miscommunication, was it me? Or was it rape? 

I just want to understand how I’m feeling.

274,"I suffer from severe depression and OCD. In the last 4 years, I haven't gone out of my room. I based my relationships online, have gone through narcissistic abuse, saw my mom's health declining and lost all of my friends. Basically, this year I took a step to start college (am 24 next month) and I'm kind of overwhelmed. I have gone through therapy, so at the moment I'm much more stable than what I used to be, but I lack a social circle. 

I finished a semester, but as I went through (with difficulty) - I started to miss the life I had before; the freedom of studying art by myself. However, at the same time, I fear shitless of returning to the emotional state I've been in and the sleepless nights of severe anxiety.

Right now, I am a Visual Communications freshman in a prestigious design school in my country, which has a 10% acceptance rate to said department. Basically, I should be happy, but I have many doubts if this is what I want to do.

If I would've quit school, I'd study 2D animation. The reason why I didn't go to study animation in the first place in the same school is that the same person who had abused me has started college as well, and went for animation. And, I thought it'd be difficult to find a proper job in the future as an animator. I tried to plan out a plan B as a graphic designer as a future career path, in case my dream as a comic artist/animator would not work.

Before I started college, I self taught myself illustration. I had done freelance work from home and failed to get a full-time job, and I've learned that employers here like to see a concretive fact I know my shit aside to my portfolio, so I chose to go to college.

The thing about college though, is that it's very, very slow. I have 2.5 more years until I can learn something fun, such as animation or game design. I feel like the slow pace is breaking me emotionally and financially, and I better of quit and just continue to study art on my own.

But I'm torn between what I think is the smart thing to do (hope for a stable future, earn a degree, function as a human being) and what I WANT to do (drop out, study animation and illustration, work on my projects)... Because I fear of continuous loneliness, depression, becoming suicidal again, anxiety attacks, jealousy... Knowing that everyone I had known and was my friend is progressing with their lives while I'm stuck in place, ill.

I'm not enjoying college. It seems like my class is having tons of fun every assignment and really have talent as designers, while I do not.

I told myself before I chose VisCom that ""it's just so much more difficult to find a job in animation. Do I really want to compete against all these incredible artists in the US and the rest of the world for what seems unattainable like having a dream job such as at Disney or whatever?""

I have so many ideas and projects in my head, and it's as though school puts handcuffs on me and prevents me from being an artist. I miss studying on my own, and I fear not developing my skills in school, because I don't feel like I did so far. 

I'm crying every assignment because in addition to everything I'm pretty lonely there and I have no one to ask for advice about this. If anyone has had any similar experience with feeling like quitting school, I'd like to hear opinions.

276,"I have a really childish view on girls, which is far too romanticised. I have this picture of a girl in my head, who struggles with mental health problems and that I can save. We love each other unconditionally and can trust each other, because we would give up our life for the other person.

Obviously, reality looks different. I saved the life of my ex-girlfriend multiple times, when she tried to commit suicide. Mental health problems are not that nice in real life. She had borderline and the relationship ended with her breaking up over WhatsApp and coming by with another guy 30 minutes later. All that after a 2 year relationship, in which I thought she was perfect the whole time. And then I just realised that she basically used me as a emotional tampon until she felt good enough to search for a better alternative.

So yeah reality basically kicked my ass lmao. But guess what ? My view still didn't change and I don't know how to change it.

I just have 0 interest in ""normal"" girls. Even if they are attractive and nice and smart. And this fucks me up. How can I get a more grown up view ?

277,"I have no friends, no job and no money.
I had a dream where I was with the love of my life (an actual real person) and we were on holiday. I went on a plane to go abroad for the first time. I was so legitimately happy during the dream and when I woke up I realised it wasn't real and now I'm so depressed.

I suffer badly with depression anyway but this is bad. I cant get a job because of my anxiety, I can't go outside because I'm agoraphobic. I just wonder if life is worth living.

Not to mention the cost of books and all the fees on top of fees, as much as I want to study and get into programming I feel glad I got stopped before I went in, but at the same time, I feel so lost in what even are my options, I want to get out of the dead end job I'm in, but I don't see how I can make a career out of anything right now, I'm good with computers, build my own and fix them, but I'm no professional, applied for data entry and jobs of the like but I've not got a call back from any.

280,"Hello its @Fluffabug F19, I recently got into a bit of an argument with my new friend/soon to be Fuckbuddy
    We've taken our new friendship into the sexual realm which was what we've both been wanting, last night we were playing 21 questions and I obviously asked him what his body count was and he was hesitant. He proceeded to say it's pretty high, again I asked him what it was and he says 20+... Um excuse me 👀. I was so taken back of course. Coming from a VIRGIN yes a virgin this really shocked me, I didn't know what to say or feel to be honest. I knew he was experienced but not that much !! Shit I thought it was like 5-8 maybe even 10 but not that high. We talked this over and told each other how we felt and everything is well and dealt with between us now but here's the thing... I don't know how to feel? On I've hand I feel like another number on a sex list when giving away my first time. (Additional info- I've never dated, had my first kiss, nothing I mean literally nothing man.) So giving him my v card away is a huge deal for me. 
On the other I don't really care because it's his sex life and he's allowed to do whatever he pleases.  I'm emotionally constipated and I don't know how to make it come out 😅. My question, what would you do in my shoes?  A virgin willing to give away to him until she finds out his body count? Please help any advice will do, Thank you 😅 🙏🏻✨",11Jan2019,1

Like most over-thinkers, I have trouble falling asleep due to an over active brain that won’t quit. When the clock hits a certain hour and all the world is asleep and quiet, that’s when my brain thinks it’s fun to conjure up my biggest fears and remember my deepest regrets. I’m not talking your normal thinking, but an overdrive of anxiety and fear paralyze me from being able to sleep and since I’m on holiday break it’s been going on for over a month now and I find myself waking up at noon and hating myself for it. I exercise 6 times a week so my body definitely feels tired it’s just that my mind doesn’t. 

I’ve tried waking up earlier the following day so that the night coming up I would be so tired that that would drive me to fall asleep. FAIL. I’ve tried NyQuil and generic sleeping pills, which caused me to be groggy the next day and won’t work long term so FAIL. I’ve tried meditation apps to lull me to sleep but my brain still won’t shut off so FAIL as well.

284,"Where do I start..
My first big relationship, almost five years. We had a house, pets, the only thing we lacked was trust. He trusted me, he almost never questioned me but I wonder if it's because he was cheating on me. Three times. One attempt, one kiss, one year long relationship with our roommates fuck buddy. We break up, I find out about it when he moves in with her the day after. 

A few months pass, new relationship. It accidentally happened pretty quickly but I was happy. I ask to use his laptop for homework one day while he was at his job and I opened it to a love showing of him on a dating app. Texting them while he's texting me. I forgive him, but obviously the lying continues and we eventually break up. 
I took a long time to 

Now, to what I need advice on. I just recently started dating someone (after two years). He's fantastic. 
We met on tinder- suprise. We had matched a few times, talked a few times, but this time I decided to be forward and I give him my number. He ghosts me after a few weeks. No big deal, he was just some tinder guy but I get feely one night and I ask him if I did something wrong. He talks to me the next day explaining that he's been single for two years and he was just nervous at how forward I was being. Turns out he was thinking about it a little more then I was. He asked his sister, his mom, and his friends for advice about me. They all told him he was being too skiddish. He agrees to meet me after many days of chat and planning. He says he isnt looking for a relationship but he wants to be friends...
Until we actually meet, then his demeanor changes and he wants to hang out more, and he texts me every day, I've met his friends and his family and he asks me to be his girlfriend. 

He's great, he's sweet, extremely honest with me, gives me no reason to doubt him. 

Why do I feel so scared? I'm nervous, anxious, and theres no reason to be.

285,"I'm at the end of my rope. After enduring an abusive marriage for a decade I joined the work force in my early 30s. Up until that point I was earning some money here and there through freelance design from home, but it didn't earn enough to support me. I had a few work-from-home customer service rep jobs, but doing desk work strained my shoulder despite taking regular breaks and stretching. I decided to pick up a position in retail, took to the job rather well and was even promoted after a few months despite not having prior experience. My job required constant heavy lifting and unfortunately at the end of last year I ended up with a shoulder injury, rendering me unable to lift more than 10lbs. 

After initial recovery I was told that this injury did permanent damage, will flare up when stressed, and to seek work in a different field. I cannot go back to freelance design as it also strains said shoulder and likely caused most of the damage (with my retail job being the final straw, hence why I did not qualify for worker's comp as it couldn't be proven). So I scouted for nearby jobs (no car) that don't require lifting and was offered a position in a assisted living facility. I mentioned my restrictions during the interview and was assured it won't be a problem.

I quickly realized that I was deceived, as now I have to help clients up, support most of their weight, and position them in bed, ultimately going from lifting up to 50lbs in retail to now lifting/moving full grown adults between 150-250lbs. Unsurprisingly, my shoulder quickly seized up again causing excruciating pain. I have taken joy in working directly with people and providing care, but I am unable to fully do my job and I am required to be able to execute these tasks on my own.

I'm at a loss. I know I need physical therapy, but I cannot afford it, my insurance does not cover it. I am thousands in debt due to medical expenses, I can barely keep myself fed and most of my medical debt remains unpaid wrecking my credit.

I have no education beyond a HS degree (abusive parents forced me to take a dead-end job after high school despite graduation with excellence). I have no money to afford an education. I do not qualify for a loan. I do not qualify for disability or social security. I can not lift anything over 10lbs, or preform repetitive desk job (data entry, transcription, administrative work). I don't have a car or license. Even if I sold all my possessions it would just be a temporary solution. I can not find a single entry-level job that doesn't require some sort of physical labor. I have no family to support me. I have exhausted and investigated all my options for government and social aid to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

I am desperate and have even considered suicide at this point, as I do not want to end up on the streets as an outcast begging for change and vulnerable to the world.

I'm just fucked, ain't I? 

The biggest frustration I face is that despite my lack of formal education, I am skilled and curious and have attained knowledge in various fields, educating myself in parts of design, engeneering, neurochemistry, psychology and social engeneering. I am outgoing and have excellent people skills, I'm fluent in 2 languages, I don't shy away from dirty work or dealing with difficult situations, I learn fast have excelled in every position I worked in so far leading to fast promotions only to be stopped dead in my tracks by my damaged body. 

If it wasn't for my abusive upbringing and continuous abuse into my 30s I could have received an education and build savings, contribute to society in some way and secure a future. Instead I was beat down over and over again leaving me broken and broke while my peers are starting to settle down.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired, I'm in pain, I am lost. I wanted to do so much with my life, but it seems that I failed, unable to do physical work at a young age and unable to afford an education to acquire a piece of paper that qualifies me for intellectual work.

An example of this is oral, he does not know how to eat me out at all, I’ve made pointers on how he should do it and try helping him pleasure me but yet it’s continuing to be something I cringe at the thought of and want to get it over with before it even starts. The overall sex is a little cringe worthy too, and it just feels like it’s more for him and to me it feels like nothing in the pleasure department.

287,"Let's start with saying I have social anxiety. I never go out. I never had good friends up till this year. I didn't even talk to girls normally up till this year.

I became friends with an old acquaintance this past summer because of some unexpected but really nice thing that happened. She became my closest friend (though I didn't become hers, I know that for sure. Maybe closest guy friend). Since we can stand each other's company very well we even decided to look for apartments together with her best friend (we all have a long commute). Let's just say that I like her but I'm not sure I like her enough to be in a relationship with her. If she's up for it though, I'd want to try it out. 

Now she invited me for something really weird. Her best friend, A, was going on a double date to a cocktail workshop (?) with her boyfriend and a mutual friend of theirs + boyfriend. The mutual friend bailed so A asked my friend if she would like to join instead. With me. We're not a thing. When my friend asked me, she clarified that it wasn't as her date but the fact A thought of us first, I don't know man.

So yeah, I'd like to go. Fits in the theme of me trying out new things, going out etc... But just thinking of it makes me anxious beyond comfortable. It feels so awkward... I want to say exactly that, that I'd like to go but it feels kinda awkward, but that's basically a non-answer. Is it okay to ask her if she'd want me to come over someone else (basically asking her ""do *you* wante to come"" implies that)? Or is that too forward?

Today when he saw i hadnt cleaned it he spanked me 15 times hard. Hes never hit me before and it was embarrassing and i did not consent to it or get any warnings beforehand. He literally just said “its still not clean? thats it. Bend over” and when i didn’t he bent me over his knee so i couldn’t get up. It was unnecessarily hard i still felt it for almost twenty minutes afterwards. 

He said if i didnt clean it over the weekend he’d do it again and maybe even pull my pants down for it. 

How can i get revenge on him to show him he doesnt have a right to decide what happens in my room and put him off of trying to spank me again?

295,"So let my set everything up. I met my BF at a convention back in 2016. We’re both cosplayers and we both clicked pretty well when first meeting. We both formed a friendship and flirted until a year later in 2017 (almost to the exact day) we started dating. We spend over a year together and never really have too much problems.

He lives about 2 hours away and works all the time so I mostly plan my schedule around him since I’m still in college and have more free days. Whenever he’s free he’ll come and see me and we try to make a day out of it.

I’m currently 23 and my last relationships were in high school. One was abusive when I was 16 and the other cheated on me when I was 17. My bf is the first person I even said “I love you” to so for me this was serious. I am also a virgin as intimacy means a lot to me. I’m not the type to wait until marriage but it takes a while for me trust someone due to past dating experiences and history of being sexually assaulted multiple times in my life. And while we hadn’t had sex in our year long relationship we had done some sexual things together. 

He spent Christmas and New Years with me and my family, he never gave any indication anything was wrong in our relationship.

Fast forward to this past weekend. He goes away to a convention while I stay here to work on other things. He gets drunk to where he blacks out and only remembers kissing another woman and pulling his dick out. 

However, the other woman just so happens to be my friends and tells me otherwise. She also has a history of sexual assault and said he he kissed her she pushed him away but froze when he kept trying and touched her body despite her telling him no. I asked him and he doesn’t deny she could have said no but he was too black out drunk to remember. 

My friend showed me texts she sent him the next day about how he violated her and how she no longer feels safe around him. And in the texts he apologizes to her saying he knew what he did was wrong and to not to tell me about it. She responded that if he didn’t tell me than she would because she’s my friend. 

I asked other people there and while they didn’t witness the sexual assault they talked about how upset my friend was the next day as she broke down crying at the convention. And they mentioned how as the more he drank the more shit he’d talk about me and our relationship like how he was frustrated I wasn’t fucking him yet and how I better “suck his dick” in a few weeks when he takes me to see my favorite band. 

Like I don’t even know what to do now. I am just so hurt and heart broken. He tried to blame it all on the alcohol but I don’t know. He’s told me he’s blacked out at cons while drinking before so it makes me question if this has happened before and I just didn’t know because this time the girl he tried something with just so happened to be my friend. 

I told him that I needed some time but he keeps sending me messages to not break up with him, and how “our relationship should mean more than just one mistake”, and “you can’t make a decision like that that effects both of us”.

I still love him and I don’t know what to do. Help? ",11Jan2019,1

Well, a few years ago when I was depressed, that was when I first told her that I liked her. She didn't say much to it so I took as a rejection — but mention she didn't like anyone, said it wasn't me but didn't feel that way.

Lately I beat depression (hype!) and I decided to take my first rejection as a man. But her answer makes me ... Confused? Wasn't a no but definitely wasn't a yes? (Technically is a rejection but gives future hope)

So I asked how she felt about relationship in general, she told me that she would like a romantic relationship but never wanted to. 

I then asked her if she had a preference, she answered knows that it's men and that she doesn't know if she has a type of guy though. 

Finally, then I asked if she would date me (wink wink nudge nudge — my confession) and she said yeah, she can see us in a romantic relationship, it's possible, and that's as far as she is now with her asexuality. 

WHAT?!

I found it very interesting, didn't push the issue, and me and her are still cool and I still make sure to treat how I always treated her. Thing is, I'm not really driven either. At college, no one really gets my attention anyone and I just want to study on my classes instead. Actually a bit glad it's not the case that we're dating now because of the distance and school.

But it makes me wonder what's going through her head and what she's feeling about me for her. Not looking for definite answers, just maybe a discussion.

303,"Hi there,
I wanted to post here because I have seen the community is really helpful.

My situation is really complicated and quite long, I’ll try to summarise. 

I am currently living in the U.K. with my husband of 10+ years. My home country is a wreck and 5 years ago, we decided to bring my parents over because they were having problems getting their medicines. 
My parents are not old, they are only 62 and 66 yo.
Unfortunately, my dad hasn’t found anything to do and is adamant he will find a job in his field (engineering), everyone has told him it will not happen. 
So my parents are always in my house and my husband is getting really fed up with everything. Also they complain a lot, the smell of the house when I feed the cats, the shower, etc etc. Our house has 3 bedrooms and they are stay in a room each because my dad snores and my mum can’t sleep... 
The treatment towards us is not nice. My dad can’t even put the rubbish out, he can’t cook, doesn’t clean after himself and also because he has absolutely nothing to do and is always here, he is always in a bad mood. My mom works 2-4 hours a day broken into two shifts so is also, more or less, here as well.
They both don’t have the greatest relationship and bicker a lot. My mom complains a lot about him and the atmosphere in the house is really heavy. 
We can’t even have sex because it’s really easy to hear everything here. Also she most likely comment on it later... which happened once.

I’m getting really sick about the situation and I really want them to have their own place but they don’t have any money and more importantly have no interest in getting themselves sorted and have the reins of their life. From the moment we plan for them to come, it has all fall onto us. Plane tickets, visa applications, doctor appointments... so much we have had to plan for them, fill up for them, pay up for them.. and the ungratefulness is ridiculous. I haven’t got a lot of that money back and I know I won’t see it.
They can’t really stay here because I don’t have the economic means to provide for them in the long term, I also don’t have a way to proof dependency for their permanent residence and I certainly can’t pay £2000 each for their citizenship. 
My mum has a well-off brother who has offered to help but it seems like he is waiting for a plan to materialise to then be able to help...  and because no one else has any initiative in making plans, except for us... it means we have to come up with “a plan”.

At the moment we are planning to go to another EU country to be able to get residency before Brexit happens so it’s less complicated. We always wanted to live in Europe and we needed to bring back our plan a bit to do properly. This new country life is cheaper and maybe we can bring our parents but my husband is very very adamant he doesn’t want to live with my parents from March onwards and he has kind of put up an ultimatum about this as he is tired about the whole situation. We are both in our 30s and haven’t been able to have children because we don’t have the space and we are seriously stressed out all the time with them around.

This is more of a rant and I’m so sorry if it’s disjointed. I just wrote how it felt. It’s very difficult... I think if they had a lot more initiative and were in a better mood everyday it would be far easier... but it’s so difficult to be around grumpy miserable people all the time, who have taken over your house and constantly criticise it. 
I know they are my parents but they aren’t disabled or very old and the dependency on us to sort out their life, it’s very heavy. I find them selfish that they have lived and done so much and seem to not care that we haven’t even started. We just work all the time and can’t even do anything us two together without the guilt trip that they were involved (going out to a restaurant, ordering takeaway, etc) so everything has to be done us four.
I am paranoid my husband is going to leave me in the future because we seem to have gone in circles for 5 years looking for a solution. 

It would be nice to hear from people who are not involved in my situation. 

I do have 2 sisters. They stayed with 1 for 2 years after living with me and now they are back with me again (2 years with me, 2 with her and now back with me). My other sister is in Europe and her economic situation is not strong enough to have my parents over.

304,"I'm a children's private music teacher and work one on one with my students. I spend the first few minutes of every lesson asking the student about their day/week/something exciting. This gives them a chance to share with me, and also really helps them to focus on their lesson for the rest of the time.
Well, here's what happened the other day, and I'm just curious about what other people's first thoughts would be.

Conversation with 7 year old boy. 

Me: How was your week?
Him: I kissed my friend.
Me: okay. 
Him: ...on the lips. 
Me: Did your friend want to be kissed?
Him: yeah, he said I could. He's in my class. 
Me: cool. 
Him: but he's a boy.
Me: okay.
Him: and I'm a boy.
Me: I know.
Him: my story got boring.

So, for starters, my first thought was consent. I didn't think or care about what the gender of the other person was. I just wanted to make sure that this was not a one-sided situation, and that there was equal power.
My student goes to one of the local private Christian schools, and his family is rather involved with their church. Just from my student's prompting about 'he's a boy and I'm a boy', I could tell that he was testing the waters to see what my reaction would be. My lack of reaction to a 7 year old boy kissing another 7 year old boy was not what he was expecting. I'm pretty sure that if he had told his family, he'd get a much different reaction from each person. Mom: laugh and blow it off. Dad: get angry because 'boys don't do that'. 6yo brother: 'ewwwww'. 

Just looking for some of your first thoughts if this was a conversation that you took part in. I know that I did nothing wrong, but it bothers me that my student was ultimately telling me this story to catch me off guard/offend me /make me laugh/something else, and I didn't give him any of the reaction that he was expecting.

If you ever read “No Mire Mr. Nice guy!” , it felt it perfectly described me behaviour and my internal rationalisation of it.
I am appalled by what I did. I am more disappointed in myself for doing something I never thought I would do, than anything else. I just don’t know where to go from here.

307,"I’m not sure if I am overreacting or not but a family member of mine sexually assaulted another family member and it sort of blew up on social media when they went public with the assault. I supported them and I was the one they went to for help. Anyway, said sexual abuser and I share mutual friends who know very well about what happened. I still notice that some of them like and comment on sexual abusers updates (I know this thru an anonymous account strictly to keep tabs on what the person is doing being that I blocked them on my real account) 
Is it unfair and irrational to unfriend sexual abusers and mine mutual friends who still are buds with them? I feel conflicted and I’m very annoyed, even angered that anyone would even associate with them after the numerous amounts of people who came forward publicly. 
I keep trying to put myself in their position and how I would react in a friendship with somebody who was accused of those kind of acts. I can’t find any reason why I would continue a friendship with them, especially if their were multiple people who came forward. 
Idk if I’m being petty or if this is a legitimate reason to cut ties with mutual friends who still socialize with a sexual abuser on social media. Any advice is welcome obviously, and thank you for taking the time to read this.

I've been dealing with an issue with an ex for quite some time, I, A, have been dealing with a guy, R, that I started dating in high School, during school I was very bi-curious and wanted to explore, after dating him for maybe a year, he started talking about him starting treatments to get a sex change, it was a shock at first but after we discussed it for a while I agreed we would consider it, because I was comfortable with him and he said it would make him more comfortable. 

However before he went through with it, we broke up, but every few months, since late 2015, he'll message me and ask to get back together saying that he still loves me and wants to spend the rest of his life with me,

He just started messaging me again a few days ago and I'm really not sure what to do, he's still saying that he wants to get the sex change so that we can finally be together. He's honestly starting to scare me, if I try and block him he'll just make a new account.

I have a girlfriend now and im about to move in with her, im also seriously considering proposing. She knows that I was bi curious in school and that I had dated a guy, but I'm too scared to tell her about him still trying to message me, he's also threatened to tell her about all of this.


TLDR: Ex boyfriend from highschool that i havent seen in years wants to get a sex change so we can ""be together"" even though he barely knows me anymore, and I'm dating someone else.

323,"This is going to be a long post. TLDR at the bottom.

Hello, somethings you should know, i am in my twenties, i am from a small town in India, i live in a joint family and i am gay and still in closet, i tell you this because all of this is part of the problem, its been 7 years since i discovered my sexuality and it took a long time for me to come to terms with it and even tried to find out a solution for this situation, you see, i planned to get a job and move away from my family so that my sexuality is not a problem for anyone, good, i thought, although my parents would think that i betrayed them but maybe they'll come to terms with it, it's not like i was asking them to give me my share of inheritance or anything, i just planned on getting a job after college and make do however i could. 

In my last year of bachelor's degree my mother was diagnosed with cancer, it was pretty bad, i left a chance to go to a good college and enrolled in a local college for post grad, to stay close, she passed away, i slipped into depression, my father on the other hand was alone, literally alone, you see my father was not much social before, he had next to no friends, he didn't mingle with the clan/community, he just kept to himself, his business and his family. Atter her death he tried to migle more with more people

Now with my mother gone other family members suggested that i should get married, as ""every household needs a lady"", i refused, said that i still wanted to study, its been 2 years now my father has started to mingle with  the society, and my studies are complete, the pressure from my family is increasing, last sunday, my father asked me when i was planning to get married, he had never asked me directly because we don't talk much about anything, i declined, he asked me the reason of my refusal and i was at a loss of word, a wave of guilt washed over me and i just choked, regarless i kept my composure to not break down and refused again, from then on i knew this day would come, i just wished that it didn't, je asked me again last night, i refused again, he said that my decision would cause him and me a lot of  shame, my family  is splitting up and there will be noone left to do the household chores, he said that there is a lot of responsibility on his shoulders and i should step up and share some of it, i just gulped and said no again, from then on i see him muttering to himself 'kya hoga' (what's gonna happen) and 'kaise hoga'(how is it gonna get managed) under his breath,  he acts normal but i know he is just deeply worried, i cant see hime like this, but i have no other option i just can't bring myself to get married to a girl, it'll ruin her life, not only she'll be getting married to a gay man but she'd also have to take care of a family of four, i cant divorce her after marriage because she might not be able to get married again, her life would be effectively ruined. I don't know what to do anymore.., if I don't get married people are gonna raise questions and even my siblings marriage prospects could be jeopardised. I just feel hopeless

tldr: i am from india and i am gay, my family is asking me to get married because my mother died, i feep guilty because I can't give my father a normal life that he wanted  on one hand and i can't bring myself to ruin a girl's life by marrying her for the sake of my family.",11Jan2019,1

The competitions he was talking about I know I wouldn’t be going to bc I wasn’t putting in most effort, and because those kind didn’t interest me.

326,"Shortly after we moved into this house in July last year, two lovely ginger cats followed us indoors. They're both very friendly, loving cats, so we let them in and gave them some cuddles and they left when they'd had enough. Months on and they're still coming back into the house. I'll add at this point that we haven't been feeding them so they are literally just coming in for our company.

My partner and I have pretty messed up sleeping schedules, so one night we were up at about 3am when we decided to go outside and there were the cats, they shot inside as if they'd been scared by something. Not wanting to leave them out in the cold (by this point we knew who owned them and they don't have a cat flap) we let them into our bedroom to sleep the night. They settled down and stayed there until the morning.

We've noticed the cats are barely ever in the house, they're always either in someone else's garden or roaming on the street. As I mentioned before, their owners don't have a cat flap and don't seem to leave any windows open to let them back in. 

Today one of the cats came in and was meowing very loudly at us and wasn't being quieted by strokes as she usually is. I put down some water for her on a plate and she started lapping it up like she hadn't drank in days. My partner went to get her a cat treat (we have a small bag of them that we give to them very occasionally) and she was literally pawing at his hand trying to get the food. 

We're concerned that the owners are being negligent - the cats are constantly out in the cold and I don't know how much they're getting fed or watered. We don't want to feed them properly in case they are being fed elsewhere as well, but we don't want them to starve either. Should we start feeding them? Any advice would be helpful.

327,"Three years ago I moved from my home country in Europe to the UK, initially to do a one year masters degree. However, I met my boyfriend in the first few weeks and we have been together ever since, and I stayed in the UK. He is training to be a doctor and has another 2.5 years of university before he graduates. I am in my mid-twenties am working and studying as well, and have a set career goal here in the UK. My boyfriend has never expressed interest in leaving the UK, and he has told me early onwards that he would not want to move permanently to my home country ever. I completely understand that since I am the one who moved countries.


However, I feel like life here hasn't been so great. While I love my boyfriend to death, I have not made any real friends (only some acquaintances I occasionally meet up with). Over summer I generally feel more happy and that things are fine, but especially in the winter months I can't help but feel slightly depressed. I go back to my home country whenever I can, and I spend a good 4-5 weeks with my parents per year. Especially now after the Christmas break it's been extremely hard. At home with my parents I never feel alone, I am in a comfortable environment with loads of family around, and generally feel happy there. It's like a sanctuary to me.

I know it's not real life to life with your parents 24/7. I think part of what makes it so comfortable is also the fact that I obviously don't have to work when I'm at theirs. It's like taking a break from the real world. However, I am also so close to my parents and I feel like I got so lucky with them. In a way I feel like I am 'wasting' this good family by choosing to not live near them. On the other hand, they live very remotely and in an area where it would not be possible for me to have a proper career. Bigger cities are a good 3-4 hour drive away, so I keep telling myself that even if I lived in one of these cities I probably would not see them more overall. I would probably drive to theirs once a month for a weekend or so, but considering I now spend full weeks at theirs whenever I visit, I probably see them a similar amount of days per year overall. 


It just feels like there is always something missing. When I'm at theirs I miss my boyfriend, but when I am back in the UK I miss them. Having both would be ideal, but realistically that will never happen. They said that once they are pensioners they plan on spending more time in the UK as well, but that's still a while away and I also don't know what this is gonna look like.

I finished school some 3 years ago and my family's views on post high school education were always that we don't need degrees or diplomas to be successful in life, which I followed. So instead of going to university I attended community college were I studied computer science for a year. When that was done  I couldn't find a job and so I started helping my father out at his work where he repairs printers. That went well until an uncle of ours suggested that I take a cloud computing course instead of helping my dad out. My dad agreed to all this and he even bought me a new computer to help me finish my studies in that. All the preparation kits and resources needed were paid for by  my uncle, even the exam fees. However due to my lack of experience in any working field things did not go as planned, I failed two exams and I only passed one and my father quickly sought to accuse me of not being serious with my studies which was completely not true. 
Now I'm attempting to write my third exam and I'm kind of in this situation with my father were he never openly has a conversation with me without faking his smile or he can say completely sarcastic things that really hurt my feelings. He always criticises me for staying at home everyday and studying ""useless stuff"". No matter how hard I've tried to explain to him how demanding the field I'm in is, he always never seems to be listening or even care that I'm trying to talk to him. 
At this point it has grown so bad that he won't even have dinner with us at the table and he eats alone. I've asked my mother for help but she seems to not understand as well what the problem is. In my own opinion it seems as if she thinks that I'm being an asshole and I should talk to him man to man. I've tried that but I immediately burst into tears and he just told me I was weak and I shouldn't bother him with petty stuff. 

I understand my father is under a lot of stress from work and all that goes on around him but I don't think I deserve this kind of treatment from him. In the past everything was fine and we used to do stuff together. Now it just seems like he's disgusted by me and everything that I do. Even the way he talks to me has changed.

Now I  need advice on what to do because it seems like ever since I started doing my own stuff he hasn't been as supportive as before. I'm even thinking of quitting what I'm doing to go back to working with him but I'm torn and I know my career path has big rewards in the end.

I’m 19F from France.
I know that because I’m young, it sounds normal for me to be lost in life. 

I’m in my last year of uni (skipped a grade when I was younger and was born at the end of the year, so I’m quite young), studying Applied Foreign Languages (English, Chinese and German applied to economics, marketing and stuff like that). 

Next year, I have to decide if I want to pursue in graduate school or start again undergraduate to do something I really like. Problem is, I don’t like something enough to see myself studying it if I start again. I don’t want to pursue in economics or marketing, I don’t really like it. With my degree, i can also become a translator but I despise translation (the classes I’ve had... well let’s say the teacher hasn’t seen me a lot lol). Moreover, if I just go in graduate school, I’ll be 21 when I’ll finish my studies and I find it too young to start working. I won’t have any experience compared to the 24/25 yo against me in job interviews haha.

Right now, I’m just lost... I want to take a gap year starting in September to really “find myself” but I’ve been traveling this past year, I was studying abroad in China and it did not help me like I thought it would. So I’m just guessing that the same will happen with the gap year, I expect something (to find myself) but it won’t happen. And I don’t know what to do during my gap year? I think I want to learn Korean but I’m not sure, and it would be expensive. I think I want to go to New Zealand but I’m not sure..

I have taken multiple personality tests, I’ve been to the therapist but it did not really help me. My mom is very supportive, she always tells me that everybody makes mistake and I should do whatever I like because it’s my life and I’ll have to live it.

I do have some hobbies, like exercising, reading, learning languages too! It’s fun but I don’t see myself having a career with it.

Depending on the amount of weight lost or gained you would pay into the pot of money. At the end of the challenge, whoever lost the most weight would win all the money. At the end, there was over $100 in the pot.  

  

Coworker 2, who was a participant in the weight loss challenge, got very ill and dropped a lot of weight really quickly. Because of this, they technically won the challenge. Coworker 1 let them know, and coworker 2 did not feel comfortable taking the money and said the person who came in second can take it. 2 people tied for second place and split the money, but then decided they wanted to donate it to coworker 2. Now it gets interesting.  

  

Coworker 1 took the money home to ""exchange for bigger bills."" Okay, sounds reasonable enough. She told us all that she messaged coworker 2 to get her address, and will send the money to her in a card. Fast forward a few weeks and coworker 2 comes to visit. Coworker 2 brings up the weight loss challenge and asks who won the money. Confused, the winners explained that they donated the money to coworker 2. Coworker 2 had no idea what they were talking about. One of the winners told Coworker 1 to give coworker 2 the money since they were there already, then a card wouldn't need to be sent out. Coworker 1 refused, as the money was in their car and we were too busy in the office to go get it.  

  

Fast forward a week later to payday, Coworker 1 drops a card to Coworker 2 in the office outgoing mail. One of the winners said she looked in the card and there was only half the money in it. Nobody wants to speak up about this and make waves but I think this is SO wrong. Clearly coworker 1 knew she was under heat and waited for payday to throw a card and half the money together. Coworker 2 is really sick and needs that money. I am hesitant to say anything to management because I didn't physically see the shortage of money in the card. Should I ask coworker 2 how much money was sent to her in her card to get a definite answer before going to management or should I just keep my mouth shut and do nothing? It's eating me up inside and totally not fair to ANYONE who contributed money. Please help!!!!",11Jan2019,1
336,"So a couple of weeks ago  I bought a bunch of parts for a new Gaming PC to build myself. And I bought the CPU from Newegg because it was cheap . (US company, I'm Australian). I built the PC and immediately it wasn't working when playing games (they crash pretty much immediately saying various error messages), and long story short I believe the CPU is at fault due to the game crashes as well as many blue screens. I bought the CPU on the 25th of Nov last year.

Initially I saw a holiday return policy on the website until the end of January which is why it took me so long to come to the conclusion that it was the CPU's fault and I needed to return it. And this was the only return policy I saw and thought it applied site wide not seeing the International one. It took me so long to follow through with this because every day I tried different things to fix it myself before I thought I could return at the end of Jan.

So on the 10th of Jan I go to the return page and it wont let me, so I contact Newegg through the online chat window. They said that the holiday return policy that I saw was only for residents of the US, and due to an international return policy had 14-30 days to return it, and they also said I didn't have a warranty with Intel directly.

Now I realized and must admit that I have gone over that return date and I cant return it due to their policy which is fair, but I personally don't want to just admit to losing over $500 without trying something to fix it. I am very new to this and any help would be appreciated. I have two thoughts in my mind for what I could do at this point though but I don't know if any would work:

The first is to contact Intel directly. Newegg says that I don't have a warranty through Intel but I personally don't fully believe that. I don't have any paperwork from Intel directly but possibly they do have some way I could do this and if anyone knows about this kind of thing that would help.

The second is to go through PayPal. I have done this kind of thing in the past for other products but I don't remember how the warranty worked and possibly PayPal could give me the money back due to a faulty product and chase up Newegg I don't really know.

Thanks for any help regarding this.",11Jan2019,1

Before I begin I want to try and clarify some stuff...

\-I (f19) have been living with and paying bills for an apartment I share with my older brother. Both of us work as delivery drivers at a pizza place and make pretty good money. With this job, I'm not only able to pay my half of rent/utilities, but I am also able to pay for my own car insurance, life insurance, and phone bill.

Last year was my freshman year of college and with the major I had at the time, I had no choice but to live on campus. I thought I was ready to leave my family and go out on my own, but then move-in day came. The realization that I would be a 2 hr drive from my family and would only be able to see them on weekends hit me like a ton of bricks. It doesn't sound like much, but for someone who hasn't been away from family since they went away for summer camp at age 10, it was pretty bad. That plus a lot of sudden changes in the family made freshman year miserable for me. Since then, I've switched my major to one that I feel suits me best and am now studying online. Doing this allowed me to be close to my family and I've been doing much better since.

\-My sister (17) also works at the same pizza place, but she works as a server. Although she is good at it, she only makes 3.25/hr along with tips, so money is tight for her. She currently lives with my parents and only has to pay for her own gas (my mom has agreed to pay for her insurance until she graduates this spring). She does have a car at the moment, but it's unreliable, so her and my mom are saving up money to get her a new car. She uses her tips for that along with a tattoo fund (she wants one, doesn't know what yet).

She, like me, hasn't spent any large amount of time away from family since the age of 10. She's had trouble with her mental health for quite some time now but she only told us about it last year. We've (Mom, friends, brother and I) done our best to get her help and be there to support her. She's had her ups and downs and imo, she seems to be doing better now that she knows she has a support system. The only person she seems to have trouble with is my dad. The two of them are both very like minded, which leads to a lot of arguments between them, resulting in resentment on both sides. It's also worth noting that my sister is strong willed, in a way that if someone tells her they don't like an idea she's had, she'll go through with it just to spite them

\-------------------------------------------------------

A few months ago, my sister off-handedly mentioned to my mom and I that she was considering moving to Oregon with her friend (f17, named M from now on). I didn't think anything of it at the time because not only had my brother considered doing this with his friend group, (it didn't end up happening) but we ourselves had a mutual friend who wanted to do this (also didn't end up happening). I thought it was going to be the same as before so we told her we supported the decision and I didn't think anything more of it. 

I thought that would be the end of it but it wasn't. She kept bringing it up and she seemed very serious about the idea. She's pretty sensitive about being criticized because of my dad constantly picking on her, so trying to talk to her about it is hard. I've tried asking her about how she plans on doing this but she gets defensive pretty quickly. Even when I can get her to answer, it doesn't seem like she's put much thought into it, almost like she just plans on hitting the road and hoping for the best (Ex: Me-""So what do you plan to do in the way of finding a job?"" Her-""I don't know, I'll have to look when I get there."" M-""So have you guys been looking into apartments there?"" H-""No, not really, it's still too early.""). 

She cooled down for a while and started making plans to do an end of school year trip. She wants to rent out a cabin in the mountains and spend a few nights with M, her friends from band, my mom and I. She's really excited for this trip, to the point where she's been considering asking the days off from work and renting the cabin ASAP, when the trip is supposed to be in June.

I was over at my parents house hanging out with her, talking about this trip when she told me that M's dad (who is in the Coast Guard) had been given a final chance to decide if he wants to take M and go to Oregon. He accepted and they're going to be leaving sometime later in June, and she tells me, ""So, I might be leaving with them earlier than expected."" At this point, I should've been honest with her and told her my opinion, but I instead told her that it's her life and if that's what she wants to do then I would be there to support her. 

Don't get me wrong, no matter how this shakes out, I will love and support her unconditionally. I am fully aware that I have no control over her life and if she wants to move, she is absolutely free to do so (as long as my parents agree). But I remember how hard it was to live 2 hrs away from family. Our entire family (immediate and extended) and her friends all live on states along the east coast, she's planning on moving to the exact opposite side of the country. The only person she will know is M. 

I don't know that with how her mental state has been in recent years if she would be able to handle a change like this. She'd be leaving 90% of her support system behind.

She's also not considering whether or not M's dad has agreed to this. I don't know him that well but from what she's told me, he's rather strict with his own daughter (this girl doesn't have a driver's license yet and she's never had a job). He doesn't seem ready to let M go quite yet, which makes sense, being as she's still 17 and can't legally be on her own. I also can't see the logic in agreeing to move for your job, taking your daughter (who doesn't have the means to live on her own) and her best friend (who also doesn't have the means to live on her own) with you, only to let them move into their own place. I'm not sure if my sister is just planning on staying with M and her dad until she moves out, but even still, her and M's dad aren't at all close so I don't know why she thinks he would agree to this. 

Another thing I don't think she's thought about is that she's basically going to be starting over. She wouldn't be able to take her car with her (they plan on going by plane and we can't go with her to pick out a new car in Oregon), if something happens to her cell phone, we have no way to contact her (unless she borrows someone's phone/computer) and if something happens to her medically, she won't have anyone there to oversee her care (M doesn't know our family's medical history or my sister's medical background). 

I feel like it's far too big a risk for her to be taking when she's not financially stable. I haven't talked to my mom about this yet, as I'd like to do so in private when my sister isn't around. I don't know what her opinions are exactly, but she seems to have treated it the same way I have (assuming all this would blow over). I'm not even sure if my sister has told her about the most recent news yet.

So, finally, I've gotten down to my question, which is...

How do I tell my sister (who doesn't have the means to live on her own) that I don't think moving across the country to live with a friend is a bad idea, *without* sounding like I'm trying to put her down?

\*TLDR: My sister (17) had mentioned moving across the country with a friend a couple times. I didn't take it too seriously at first but now she's said that it might be happening soon. I don't think she can handle a life change this big and am looking for advice on how to tell her that.",11Jan2019,1
338,"This is probably the dumbest thing you’ll ever read, but it’s been coming to my mind very often and I can’t seem to get it out. So, here goes nothing. 

I married my girlfriend of 2 years after she begged and begged me to just marry her already. Her parents are fucking amazing and her family is wonderful. My home life absolutely sucked growing up so it’s great seeing a functional family with some fantastic people in it. Anyways, her parents agreed with her about marrying ASAP and I finally gave in and we eloped and got married without a big wedding or anything. I’m very in love with my wife for sure, I love her so so much. 

BUT, that’s the big word here. She has had, and still does have, many mental and unexplained health issues, and I want to help her and hold her through every one of those. She’s constantly battling depression which is the worst thing and I try to make each and every day amazing for her and I tell her I love her every chance I get. No matter what I seem to do it just keeps getting worse and worse and I worry more each day. But that’s not the main focus of this story. 

I’m worried about myself because I know that even though I love my wife so much I’m still totally in love with a previous girlfriend of 2 years as well. I don’t know why but I just never really got over her and she never really got over me either (she moved to LA and I live in Maryland). We only text every once in a while and just catch up but don’t do anything out of the ordinary, just talk about what’s been going on lately.

I can’t stop think about what would’ve happened if I hadn’t married my wife or if I’ll ever get to see the other girl again and tell her that I still love her. I know it’s awful just to think those things while I have a loving and beautiful wife sleeping next to me. Is it wrong for me to think these kind of things or regret getting married? Is this normal or am I just awful? Should I do anything about it or should I just pretend it doesn’t exist? I’m so lost on what to do here but I know if I tell my wife she’ll be so upset and never think the same of me. 

Anyways yea, I just needed to get that off my chest I guess. I feel like an awful person for even thinking about that kind of stuff, but it’s been bugging me so much lately that I’m feeling consumed by it. And I’ve always been as loyal as I can be to my partner so I don’t want to do anything that could even be considered cheating in the slightest. I just feel like thinking these things is almost crossing the line I guess?

I'm currently studying a Bachelor of International Relations and have the option of 'opting in' to a Masters course in third year and graduating with both in fourth. I absolutely want to do this to both hone in on my own personal interests and help myself out later on with job hunting, but I'm having trouble deciding on which Masters program to do.

Career-wise, I'm most interested in intelligence, defence (also joining the Reserves while studying soon), humanitarianism, diplomacy, among others (can you tell I have no clue?).

341,"So right now me and my girlfriend are, and have been for a while planning to move to a big city. We're both from fairly small towns so it would be a large change for us. We have friends and family in the city we want to move to, so we will be staying with them until we find our own place.

She has good reason to be there, some family issues and its hard to find a job in our small town. She has a fairly practical  degree but is working retail because there  are hardly any jobs here.

Me on the other hand; I don't really have any good reason besides supporting my girlfriend ( which I believe is a good reason, but some do not ). I've received permission from my boss(s) to work remotely, so I can pretty much pick up and move any time I want. But I have the feeling I'm hurting my career by doing so. My biggest concern is the cost of living, I'll basically have  significantly less take home pay by moving.

I've always wanted to move away, and it seems like a good time do it. But when people ask why I'm moving I really have no reason. And when I say ""My girlfriend has family reasons, and cannot find a job here"" I get the feeling people think I'm making a terrible decision. ""Why move when you're going to be paying more working the same job?"" ""Working remotely is hard, you'll have no human interaction"" etc etc.

The only thing I don't pay is my phone bill, but everything else comes solely from my income. My dad and I are not n estranged but were not close either.

344,"  

I’ve been feeling an immense amount of guilt recently and want others’ perspectives on whether I am “justified” in feeling this way or whether I need to chill out. A few notes about me – I’m a bit of a hypochondriac and know I tend to worry way too much about health-related issues. Additionally, I do have OCD and tend to obsess about things.

I had a new sexual partner in the fall. Before engaging in that relationship with her, we discussed safe sex and stds. She said she had been tested and was clean. During each of our encounters, I wore a condom. On the last occasion, she was on top and the condom had come off at some point. It seemed like it came off while she was getting off of me because when we found the condom, my semen was inside it. That was the last of our sexual encounters. Throughout the following week, I learned that she has had quite a few sexual partners in the past, including one abusive ex who was deemed to be dangerous to himself and others by a medical professional. At some point during that week, I became terrified of the prospect of having an std. Specifically, I became fixated on HIV for some reason.

About 8 days after the sexual encounter, I developed what felt like a mild flu that lasted about 1 day. This was after reading up on some early symptoms of HIV, so I’m not sure whether I actually did catch a flu or whether I had a psycho-somatic response to the thought of having HIV (I’ve actually had psycho-somatic responses to these sorts of things before, so it’s not out of the realm of possibility). I didn’t have any of the tell-tale symptoms such as a fever or sore throat. Plus, I knew that HIV symptoms usually don’t present themselves that quickly, but I was still a little concerned. I went to get tested about 3 weeks after the sexual encounter for all stds. Regarding HIV, I specifically asked for the most sensitive test out there (RNA test), which should determine true HIV status about 9 days after the sexual risk event. All tests came back negative. The next few days, something irked me a bit about some words the doctor used to describe the HIV test I received, possibly indicating a test other than most sensitive RNA test, but in the end I thought “He’s the doctor, and maybe I didn’t understand fully the language being used and am just worrying unnecessarily.” I followed up the next couple weeks with a couple Oraquick HIV tests (a less sensitive, at-home HIV test that recommends testing 3 months after a sexual encounter). Both of those came back negative as well.

In the following month or so, I entered into a romantic relationship with my now girlfriend. During the first few weeks of the relationship, I had not been wearing a condom. During that time, I had some nagging feelings that I could have HIV, but I honestly thought it was my typical unnecessary worrying because I had been officially tested with negative results. A few weeks in, I continued to feel irked by the language my doctor used when I got my first test, so I called the office to confirm. It turns out I did not get the most sensitive RNA test, but a 4th generation test, which is the next closest thing to my understanding (can detect HIV status with good accuracy, about 95%, by day 28 after an encounter). I had my original test about 21 days after my encounter. Once I found out that information, I went into a clinic to get tested again the next day. This test came back negative as well, which was about 9 weeks after the sexual encounter. I still had a nagging worry that I had HIV – definitely a combination of hypochondria and my OCD. I took another 2 at-home tests at about the 3-month mark from the encounter, both showing negative. Turns out I do not have HIV in the end – good news, obviously.

My worry – I’m feeling like I put my current girlfriend in “danger” during those first few weeks, and I’ve been having pretty extreme anxiety + guilt constantly. I’m going back and forth between the guilt and then thinking “I honestly thought I was worrying unnecessarily at the time, had testing that provided me with the best results to my knowledge, and made sure to get re-tested once I found out I didn’t get the test I originally thought I received.” Also, I try to think – it’s not like I had HIV and knew it for a fact, and continued to have unprotected sex. But then I feel guilty again because I really was worrying about it, no matter how irrational and unfounded, and I should have taken that into consideration. My main feeling of guilt with all of this is that I am undeserving of my girlfriend’s love and feel like a horrible person (even though I know that’s not true). My OCD is taking over at this point, and it’s a constant thought/anxiety right now. 

I’d like some perspective on this to see what you all think. Am I worrying unnecessarily and just need to let this go? I tend to be very hard on myself and hope that’s just what I’m doing. Deep down, I feel like I truly believed I didn’t have HIV and was just obsessing. This was seriously the first time in my life going through a scenario/scare like this, and maybe I just need to go easy on myself. Perhaps the only thing I can do is move forward, continuing to treat my girlfriend with nothing but love and respect and try to grow as a person every single day. I suppose my other extreme thought is that I’m truly undeserving of her love and live with that fact every day of my life being miserable – I know I’m probably spiraling at this point, but it’s a legitimate thought I have. I’m planning on discussing this with my therapist next week but welcome any of your thoughts. Thank You.",11Jan2019,1
345,"Hi all,
My girlfriend (f 27) and I (m 36) are in a wonderfully loving relationship. I come from a toxic previous relationship and she comes from an emotionally/financially abusive relationship, we both have two children and together we make a lovely family. It took a long time for my girlfriend to open up about the abuse in her relationship and for a long while she was in denial about, she is not in denial anymore and sees it for exactly what it was. We moved in together and honestly it’s been amazing for both of us, we enjoy every faucet of each other’s company and are very much in love.
My home is now where she has spent her entire life and as I don’t have much family most of it is hers, along with her few friends. Now her ex has been a constant thorn in our side, he is the master of utter delusion and gas lights like you wouldn’t believe, he has a whole massive list of abuses he has enacted which include financial, emotional, to such a degree that my girlfriend still carries the bruises. She has been amazing in dealing with this and has come out the other side a wonderfully grounded person, I am immensely proud of her. 
So what I need advice on, her ex (due to the children) is still very much tangled up in her direct families lives. I think my girlfriend should disclose the nature of the relationship to her close family so they can make their own decision on whether or not they should associate with him. She is reluctant to do this at fear of being disbelieved, in my eyes if they were to disbelieve her then I would think “well fuck them then”, I know not everyone thinks like this. The problem I have is 2 fold, I believe the ex is allowed to pull the wool over her families eyes and keep his foot in the door, he was controlling and calculated in the relationship and I don’t see that changing if he is allowed to stay within sight of her. The second issue is, when her family say nice things about him, I am expected to go along with this lie, my girlfriend will tell her the shitty things he has done after the relationship ended but not the nature of the relationship itself in which case they think he is the hurt party in all of this. 

So firstly, am I right in thinking that she should disclose the info in order to rid herself once and for all of this man that she wants no association with at all? 
Secondly, if I am not right how do I best deal with biting my tongue and living this lie? 

Thanks in advance. ",11Jan2019,1

I have also told them numerous times that I don't want to apply anywhere else, and they usually roll their eyes and say something along the lines of ""One day you'll learn to be responsible,"" which really upsets me. I don't want to be disrespectful, but I'm also tired of being called irresponsible for not wanting to waste time (and in two cases money) applying for schools that I have no interest in.",11Jan2019,1
356,"I find that my inner thoughts can be really harsh and judgemental about people. I hate to say it but it mostly revolves around looks and ""success"". I hate this about myself. It's like there are two sides of my thoughts, this really harsh, mean, and petty side and the compassionate, empathetic, and understanding side that can find good in anyone. These two sides seem to constantly be battling but more often than not the judgemental thoughts are always the thoughts that develop first and ring the loudest and I have to mentally convince myself otherwise. It's really tiring and makes me really down on myself because I don't want to be that horribly judgemental person and it also hurts my self-esteem because through the judgments I compare myself to the person and get really down on myself when I fall short.

359,"So I've been talking to this guy. We have both admited our feelings towards each other, but he says he's not over his ex. I told him I undertood and waited. 

Recently he has been ignoring me and I thought I did something wrong. I asked if he still loved me, and he said yes. Then he sends me this long paragraph that's basically saying that he stopped talking to me because he isn't ready to date and he was trying to get me to stop loving him since he isn't over his ex. 

It made me think. My friend told me that his ex and him hang out and talk all the time. He doesn't talk to me at all. He says he loves me and wants me but isn't over his ex. 

So, if he's trying to get over his ex, wouldn't he try to not talk and hang out all the time? I'm really confused because I have never have had these types of relationships nor have I known someone that hasn't been over their ex, but talks to them all the time.

367,"I'm not sure where to post this but I'm hoping someone can give me advice on what to do.

I booked a room on the third party site Get A Room on new years for me and my boyfriend. Room was $169 so not crazy, but we are on a super tight budget so it was still a splurge. I booked the room online on my debit mastercard, I use this card often online and it acts as a credit card.  When I got to the hotel and they wanted a deposit I was told this card was not a valid credit card and they couldn't take a deposit. Neither me or my boyfriend own a credit card and for the most part doesn't cause any issues, I have only stayed in a hotel once before and they took a $100 deposit off my card with no issues and returned when I checked out in the morning. I offered cash or to get my friend to give phone authorization to use their card but was refused. The woman at the desk told me she didn't know if I would be charged still and wrote me a letter saying that I was not able to check in. I literally wanted to cry I was so disappointed, so I phoned my boyfriend let him know the situation and we made the best of our night anyways. 

A few days later I noticed the $169 charge on my card. I contacted the third party site and explained that I was't able to check in, and that the card I had booked online with was not considered valid, and attached the letter the hotel gave me. But after the site contacted the hotel they told me they had me marked down as a late cancellation and couldn't refund me anything.

If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it. We are a young family and $169 goes a long way for us. It's really bothering me to just throw money like that away on a room we weren't allowed to check in to.

370,"A few years ago, I was friends with this girl, (lets call her Kirsten) who was honestly a terrible person but I was always there for her and helped her through what she was going through or rather, put herself through and hoped it would help her get better. It didn't. Now, this old friend of mine is the kind of person who will only ever call you when she needs something from you but I didn't think she was capable of the shit she put me through. Kirsten and I became friends through work and would often hang out together and go to parties together with our coworkers because, being in a small town we kinda had limited options. It happened on the night of the Christmas Duo of our workplace. I was only 17 at the time and like any teenager would I went straight for the alcohol! This work duo was crazy and not in the good way. Now, I had had a few drinks and I was being a little flirty with a coworker I had a crush on at the time but I would never pursue because I valued my career more than anything. It was later that night where my crush had led me away from the party that he had raped me. It was my first time and I wanted to save it for someone I trusted but instead I lost it while I was held down by my throat, in pain, sobbing and yelling at him to stop in the back of his car. I won't get into any more detail with that- maybe I'll talk about it on another thread or something but this isn't what I wanted to talk about. The next morning I found myself in the back of my crushs car and my friend and another coworker were tapping on the glass of the back seat window to wake me up. When I had shakily fumbled out of the car to meet them my friend gave me a mixed look of sorts- like she was disappointed in me but slightly pleased at my situation. I had never gotten to tell her what had really happened that night and whenever I had tried to message her she would dismiss me all ""I don't know, name, I've never fucked a coworker"" I was so messed up about what had happened and my friend wasn't there for me and played it off that I was a slut. She told everyone at our workplace what she had thought had gone down and just like that- the entire workplace thought I was a slut. So not only had I had to deal with being raped and working with said rapist and doing it alone but now someone who I had thought was my friend was spreading rumours about me. Whenever we would go out she would yell across the room ""Hey Name! Who are you going to sneak off and sleep with tonight!"" And get around telling party goers that I would sleep with practically anyone. I stopped talking to her. I left my job for those reasons and more and moved to the city to pursue my career. I now live with my best friend who has somehow still remained friends with her and has let her and her boyfriend stay in our house. My friend had told me this morning that Kirsten was going to stay with us and that immediately soured my mood for the rest of the day and brought back all the terrible things that had happened back then and what she had done to me. My best friend doesn't know what had happened between me and Kirsten back then because I didn't want to ruin their friendship or anything. I'm really distressed by seeing Kirsten again and I'm not sure what to do. So far I have just stayed in my room and been curt with her but I'm not sure if I should tell my best friend what had happened and why it upsets me that Kirsten is staying with and I have no idea how long she's staying for but just her presence is causing me grief and I just want her gone.

375,"This needs some backstory. I (19M) met this girl in college last year and we hit it off. We've been the best of friends and we're great together. Last July, she texted me telling me she started dating this guy she met over the summer. While initially I was alright with it, we started spending more and more time together and I realised I had feelings for her. I thought about keeping it in and dealing with it, but since I've always been honest with her I came clean and told her how I truly felt.  


She initially told me she didn't feel the same way and felt really bad for it, saying she didn't want to hurt me. For a few days I accepted that and felt super bad about myself. We went out drinking once and she confessed to me that she started having thoughts and wanted to get together with me really badly, but she didn't want to hurt her boyfriend by doing so. The night after this, we spent the night together and she kissed me in the morning. I really didn't know what to make of it then, but that night she told me she told him she wanted to end it, but didn't really tell him why. Ever since, we've been together.  


It was a good few months, alot of firsts for the both of us and it was one of the best times of my life with her. She went back home over December while I stayed behind in Uni to work. While she was back there, she met her ex and when he asked her about it, she confessed she was in a relationship with me. She was drinking quite a bit that night, and she told me she ended up crying for hours. She felt really bad hurting him about it and didn't know what to do. We spent the next few days talking but she seemed out of it. On New Year's, she told me she was having a bad time and I called her to wish her, and then she told me she wanted to take a break to figure stuff out.   


She says she still has feelings for him and doesn't feel its fair for us to be together while she's feeling this way. I asked her if she's trying to move on but she says she can't; she still feels strongly about him. She says she doesn't want to be with anyone right now while she feels this way, but it sometimes feels like she's gearing up to get back with him.   


She's told me that the time we spent together was good for her too and a part of her does love me, but she feels she can't be with me until she's over him. She still talks to him and me both, but I don't know how to feel. I really do love her and want her to be with me, and she keeps telling me I've done nothing wrong, but it feels like I've messed up somehow and that I'm not good enough for her. I did what I thought was best for her every single day of our relationship, committing to love her always, and she keeps saying I was perfect, but she cant be with me until she's over him.  


I don't want to lose her, I really do love her and see a future with her. What should I do?

379,"So here’s the deal.

Once month ago, I agreed with the letting agent on a 24 month contract at £710 pcm (rent frozen over the 24 month period), with a 6 month break clause. They sent me the contract, I signed.

Five days later, they came back to me and said actually, the landlord would rather have a 12 month break clause than a 6 month break clause. I said ok, they sent me another contract, I signed.

Nineteen days later, they voided the contract and sent me another one. I was a bit confused. I realised this new contract removed the break clause entirely. I emailed the letting agent, and they informed me the landlord didn’t want a break clause at all. I was very frustrated about this, and tried to press my case for a break clause.

The next day, the letting agent let me know the landlord was now only offering a 12 month contract at 710pcm. On the 9th January, the letting agent confirmed this included a 6 month break clause. I agreed and signed.

I’m anxious that the landlord is running down the clock, before rejecting the contract again and offering one without a break clause. If he didn’t want the break clause on the 24 month contract, why would he agree to one on the 6 month contract?

I’m still waiting for the landlord to countersign, so it’s all up in the air. Meanwhile the clock is ticking. I emailed the letting agent to say I had signed, and they said they would chase up the landlord - that was yesterday.

381,"So, this has happened twice in two years, not a big deal to some but for me 26/f it is. My mom is great, she's emotionally supportive and my best friend but since I started university here in England she has wanted a chunk of my student finance which is a loan I'll eventually pay back. I do not live with her, I have myself and son to support, and so far she's had 800 pounds over the two years. I feel terrible if I say no, but I've just given her 350 and I know I won't see money back.

I used to LOVE doing art, and tbh I miss it, a lot! However, I'm now in college so it's been years since I've drawn anything really, and if I do draw, it rarely turns out good.

Even if it's good, most of my experience is with traditional media and not online programs, which would give a cleaner look to art. My electronic drawing tablet has also been broken for years, so if I wanted to make anything good I'd have to buy another. I'm not unwilling to buy it, as I have some extra Christmas cash I can spend on a cheap one.

383," I’ve been feeling an immense amount of guilt recently and want others’ perspectives on whether I am “justified” in feeling this way or whether I need to chill out. A few notes about me – I’m a bit of a hypochondriac and know I tend to worry way too much about health-related issues. Additionally, I do have OCD and tend to obsess about things.

I had a new sexual partner in the fall. Before engaging in that relationship with her, we discussed safe sex and stds. She said she had been tested and was clean. During each of our encounters, I wore a condom. On the last occasion, she was on top and the condom had come off at some point. It seemed like it came off while she was getting off of me because when we found the condom, my semen was inside it. That was the last of our sexual encounters. Throughout the following week, I learned that she has had quite a few sexual partners in the past, including one abusive ex who was deemed to be dangerous to himself and others by a medical professional. At some point during that week, I became terrified of the prospect of having an std. Specifically, I became fixated on HIV for some reason.

About 8 days after the sexual encounter, I developed what felt like a mild flu that lasted about 1 day. This was after reading up on some early symptoms of HIV, so I’m not sure whether I actually did catch a flu or whether I had a psycho-somatic response to the thought of having HIV (I’ve actually had psycho-somatic responses to these sorts of things before, so it’s not out of the realm of possibility). I didn’t have any of the tell-tale symptoms such as a fever or sore throat. Plus, I knew that HIV symptoms usually don’t present themselves that quickly, but I was still a little concerned. I went to get tested about 3 weeks after the sexual encounter for all stds. Regarding HIV, I specifically asked for the most sensitive test out there (RNA test), which should determine true HIV status about 9 days after the sexual risk event. All tests came back negative. The next few days, something irked me a bit about some words the doctor used to describe the HIV test I received, possibly indicating a test other than most sensitive RNA test, but in the end I thought “He’s the doctor, and maybe I didn’t understand fully the language being used and am just worrying unnecessarily.” I followed up the next couple weeks with a couple Oraquick HIV tests (a less sensitive, at-home HIV test that recommends testing 3 months after a sexual encounter). Both of those came back negative as well.

In the following month or so, I entered into a romantic relationship with my now girlfriend. During the first few weeks of the relationship, I had not been wearing a condom. During that time, I had some nagging feelings that I could have HIV, but I honestly thought it was my typical unnecessary worrying because I had been officially tested with negative results. A few weeks in, I continued to feel irked by the language my doctor used when I got my first test, so I called the office to confirm. It turns out I did not get the most sensitive RNA test, but a 4th generation test, which is the next closest thing to my understanding (can detect HIV status with good accuracy, about 95%, by day 28 after an encounter). I had my original test about 21 days after my encounter. Once I found out that information, I went into a clinic to get tested again the next day. This test came back negative as well, which was about 9 weeks after the sexual encounter. I still had a nagging worry that I had HIV – definitely a combination of hypochondria and my OCD. I took another 2 at-home tests at about the 3-month mark from the encounter, both showing negative. Turns out I do not have HIV in the end – good news, obviously.

My worry – I’m feeling like I put my current girlfriend in “danger” during those first few weeks, and I’ve been having pretty extreme anxiety + guilt constantly. I’m going back and forth between the guilt and then thinking “I honestly thought I was worrying unnecessarily at the time, had testing that provided me with the best results to my knowledge, and made sure to get re-tested once I found out I didn’t get the test I originally thought I received.” Also, I try to think – it’s not like I had HIV and knew it for a fact, and continued to have unprotected sex. But then I feel guilty again because I really was worrying about it, no matter how irrational and unfounded, and I should have taken that into consideration. My main feeling of guilt with all of this is that I am undeserving of my girlfriend’s love and feel like a horrible person (even though I know that’s not true). My OCD is taking over at this point, and it’s a constant thought/anxiety right now. 

I’d like some perspective on this to see what you all think. Am I worrying unnecessarily and just need to let this go? I tend to be very hard on myself and hope that’s just what I’m doing. Deep down, I feel like I truly believed I didn’t have HIV and was just obsessing. This was seriously the first time in my life going through a scenario/scare like this, and maybe I just need to go easy on myself. Perhaps the only thing I can do is move forward, continuing to treat my girlfriend with nothing but love and respect and try to grow as a person every single day. I suppose my other extreme thought is that I’m truly undeserving of her love and live with that fact every day of my life being miserable – I know I’m probably spiraling at this point, but it’s a legitimate thought I have. I’m planning on discussing this with my therapist next week but welcome any of your thoughts. Thank You.",11Jan2019,1
385,"So my friend, and I have not hung out in a little over a month. And we have barely been able to talk for the last month or so. We were both on vacation, and then when she got back her boyfriend broke up with her. This was about a week ago. since then I've tried to reach out she hasn't been receptive, but yesterday she reached out, and let me know she is hoping to feel more okayish tomorrow (today) and that she is going to try, and clean up. When I meet up im going to give her, her Christmas present as an ice breaker. But after that im not sure what I should say. Do you think I should avoid it, bring it up, or talk about myself, and let her decide? I know she is going to be bummed out about it, and hasn't told me what happened, but im not sure what to do. I have an ASD, and it makes me worried I won't be a good friend. Is it appropriate to touch her shoulder or hand, do I try to give her a hug, or let her initiate it if it's appropriate? ",11Jan2019,1
386,"English is not my mother tongue and I'm writing on mobile so sorry in advance.  Tl;dr at the end

For the past six month, I've seen my mother attitude change a lot.  
It all started when she became to go back to church from time to time. She was going to the church with her friends at the time. We sometimes (my little brother (8) and I (15)) went to it but it wasn't too much of a problem. We were also reading the Bible at evening for 15m. I noticed that she was more happy so I thought that her praying the God was a good thing even if I didn't myself believed in those things. I was wrong to think like this.  

Fast forward 3 months ago, she started bringing us (with my dad) to the church every Sunday. I found it annoying to waste 2h every weekend but what could I do? She also started to watch videos on YouTube about God and Bible but also about the apocalypse and the return of Jesus. She doesn't work so she (I assume) was watching those videos all day. She also showed us videos from the Internet (from random people) and I noticed that she assumed that everything she saw on it was true! She became to believe in the Satan and how every politician is corrupted...   

She started to criticise me playing video games saying that they were corrupted by evil and that I was corrupted by demons. She started giving this explanations to every moment were I behaved badly. Reading the Bible now took 45m to 1h due to her showing us a video of often 30m before reading the Bible. On weekdays!  

My little brother was enrolled in all of this and now believes that I'm a demon and gives this argument in every single conversation we have.  

My dad however is not believing in all her craziness. They often have arguments and shout.  
One time, we took almost 1h30 of Bible reading on a day before school. When my dad tried to explain how my brother and I had school tomorrow, she answered ""that the end is near"" and so that the apocalypse could happen tomorrow with enough luck. Bull. Shit.  

Remember how I told you she believed in everything on the Internet? She believes now in Flat earth, in fake moon landing and in Freemasonry. I almost thought one day that she became anti vax and was really worried about my brother... She also despite gays and all the LGBT things. She really believes in the End of time, third world war and how Jesus is going to judge us.

Yesterday, she even cancelled school for my brother, claiming that he was sick. Lies. But my brother was happy about it and accepted because he doesn't understand the situation. I'm sure it was just so she could make him swallow more of those religious videos.

In conclusion, she's now at one stage were she thinks that me and my dads are full of evil and wants to bring my brother in Viet Nam (her birthland). She wants to sell our house and take her money and go. My brother do not know Vietnamese and is at a low level of autism. I'm really worried about his education. My father do not know what to do (I know he wants to avoid divorce).  
  
I need advice on a possible move I could make.  

Tl;dr: my mum became super religious, always angry about something and being negligent on our education

Now, FIL never stayed there until recently and used the place as a hoarders paradise. Every room chockablock with old carpets, tables, chairs, foot stools, magazines- you name it- we got it. I got him to agree to let me help him clear it out and he said yes then back peddled when I tried to come up with a plan to start the next day. He will soon be moving more stuff in from the place he was staying.

I'm going back to work in 2 weeks and am worried that it's not safe for the baby once she is mobile (it's not).

How do I approach this? I've sent him keep old manky balloons from 15 years ago. He literally will not throw anything out.

He is the main tenant. Is there anything I can do? Or do I have to just be harsh?

I’m in an apartment, so I share a wall with them. Also, every room has a sliding door to an attached balcony which are within a foot of each other. 

I get I’m in an apartment and I’m bound to hear my neighbors. However this specific apartment complex, when you sign the lease, acknowledges that it’s a “quiet” complex. Aka no parties, no loud music to disturb the other neighbors. 

I’ve lived in this complex for about four years and have never had a problem until these new neighbors moved in about a week ago. 

At 7:30am the woman will VERY heavy handedly open her balcony door that it wakes me up and almost makes me shit my pants because of how loudly she does it. Then she talks on the phone so loudly to the point that I know what she’s saying. I am 100% certain people doors away can hear her talking. 

She will open her closet doors (slide doors) so goddamn loudly, stomp around her room. I can’t be the only neighbor who is bothered by her. 

Not sure if it’s her first time living in an apartment? Maybe she doesn’t know how to open a door properly without just yanking it open?

 Let’s start by saying after I finished school I went on to working in hospitality and then into retail. Did that until I was around 23 then managed to get a job as a flooring installer apprentice as I was fed up of working in retail and being a waiter as it was no longer enjoyable and I knew it’s not what I wanted to do in the future! 

 5 years later I am no longer an apprentice and I work for myself.  As fun and this sounds there is no security in being self employed. Work can sometimes be few and far between and I’ve spent the last 2 years living from week to week. 
 I’m sat here writing this now as I’ve just found out the shop I was expecting to be working for this new year now does not need me.

409,"Some background: when I got pregnant, my son’s father went MIA and completely denied that we were ever dating. Our baby was sent immediately to the NICU at birth for a few months. His father barely ever visited- even when I asked for a break to pick up my prescription medicine (my labor caused physical injury). This is when the resentment started.

He comes over once a week to MY house to see our son. When I asked him to take our son to his house instead, he guilted me about not doing what is best for our son. My resentment grows every time I come home... when he spills something, he doesn’t pick it up. He leaves a sink full of dishes each time, comes over an hour late, and other small things that give me an inappropriate amount of resentment.

About 6 months ago, things got better. I kept making excuses for him (my fault) about why he wasn’t around more or paying child support. He kissed me, led me on, and when I asked him what his plans were, he denied that he did anything to make me feel like there was romantic interests. The resentment grew from here. Recently, I asked him why he didn’t visit our son more- he said that he had another life and was busy and if I couldn’t deal with that, than we couldn’t be friends. Mind you, he doesn’t have a full time job so he should have plenty of time.

So now I know that he was never intending to pay child support or to play a larger role in our sons life. And the resentment turned to pure rage. He enjoys expensive hobbies so I know he has money to at least buy our son’s diapers, he’s just choosing not to.

don’t get me wrong, he’s a GREAT dad when he’s around. But he chooses not to spend more than a day with our son each week and won’t even help buy diapers.

I’ve been going to therapy every week for a year which has helped me get over the rejection and depression, but I haven’t been able to shake the feelings of rage. I don’t want to feel this way, I want tor forgive him and move on with my life but I just can’t seem to. Please help!

418,"I know this isn't a special question, but my best friend growing up od on heroin last year and one of my biggest regrets was not actually trying hard enough to help him as i thought his soul was totally gone.

Now this post is about another friend whos gotten really deep into Coke addiction and im not sure if i should completely give up on him yet. i know cocaine and heroin addiction can be 2 different things but its just sad having all my childhood friends ruining their life.

The few friends i had who fought serious addiction only did so because their parents sent them away to a very expensive out of state rehab usually in florida where it cost close to 80k or so.

the friend im talking about now has went to free programs and none seem, to have worked but its probably the only choice he has since his parents are broke and cant afford anything private.

Has anyone here had a friend totally fight real drug addiction without spending a fortune on treatment? i know it has to be possible but i just cant seem to find any good info.",11Jan2019,1
420,Hello everyone. New here. I have recently noticed that many of my clothes mainly panties and tights have been missing from my hamper when I go to do the laundry. Didn’t think much of it. I was recently going through my sons room yesterday doing some cleaning and found 2 pairs of my tights and some of my panties in his closet. Not really sure what to do or say? If anything. I don’t mind it I just don’t want to embaress him or have him feel uncomfortable. Any thoughts? ,11Jan2019,1
421,"My wife and I have an elderly day care provider named Janice, whom we like. Janice has an adult son named Mike, and Mike in turn has young children of his own. In addition to running a licensed home-based daycare, Janice watches her grandkids (Mike's kids). So, my children associate with Janice's grandkids every day.

Mike was in a contentious divorce with his kids' mother, Ellie. She's still in the picture, because she occasionally drops off/picks up their kids at the home of Janice, her ex-mother-in-law but current-daycare-provider. But relations are cold and professional. Of course, none of this is any of my business, and I like it that way.

Two days ago, we got a text from Ellie saying that her daughter wants my daughter to come to a birthday party on Feb 2. It's strange that Ellie would be texting us directly, because how did she get our number? But whatever. Cool. Yes, we respond, our daughter will see you on the Feb 2.

We mention this off-handedly to Janice. Janice becomes upset. A party on Feb 2? That's news to her! The party is on Feb 9 and they were just about to invite us! Sure enough, a few hours later, we receive an e-vite to a Feb 9 party for the same kid, at the same venue.

We discover that this isn't an error. Ellie purposely scooped Mike in creating a party. As it turns out, Ellie had gotten our phone number from Janice under the pretense that she was going to reach out to us about a play date. Neither parent is backing down. There will be two parties. My options are: 

1. attend both (a pain in the ass and an added gift expense. Give two gifts? Show my daughter a peer that is getting two parties?)
2. attend neither (it would send the right message, but it would disappoint Mike and Janice, both of whom we are friendly with)
3. Attend one party, and appear to ""choose sides.""

Keep in mind that we've already RSVPd for Ellie's party, which we did before we got wise to the BS. We have not yet responded regarding Mike's party.

What's the best approach?",11Jan2019,1

424,"I have been living with my other half’s mum and stepdad for about six months whilst we look for a house. We’ve been there for a while, but will be leaving in a couple of weeks when we complete on our new house.

My other half is on nights at the moment so wasn’t here when I woke up this morning. I got up a little later than usual, showered and went downstairs. His mum was in the office (which is upstairs) as I went down. As I entered the kitchen, there was a something playing which I then realised was coming from the Alexa. I froze and stood there, whilst I realised what it was. Porno. A woman as well. She was enjoying herself. There was nobody around and in my panic I just said “Alexa. Stop.”

I left the kitchen and as I walked through the hall to go back upstairs (heart racing), I realised my other half’s stepdad was in the toilet. He must have forgotten his audio was connected to the Alexa. I went upstairs and he left immediately to go to work. I also left to go to work.

I’m now sat on the train home wondering what the hell I’m  going to do when I get in. Pretend I heard nothing? I’m assuming when I told the Alexa to stop (🤦🏼‍♂️ why did I do that) he must have realised I’d heard it all. Do I bring it up with him alone?

425,"I am 28 years old with elderly parents in dire financial trouble, the only problem is so am I. \[CANADA\] Here are the details:

My mother is turning 66 soon and my father is 76. My father works 364 nights per year (contracted paper delivery), and his health has been steadily declining. He was always in extreme pain when I was a child/ teenager and after a near fatal surgery he is now experiencing similar issues again, and it breaks my heart to know that every night he has to travel hundreds of kilometers at night, especially in the winter during blinding snow storms, on closed roads, etc. His customers are the same age as him, and some demand that their paper needs to be walked to the front door by a certain time and if its not then they call and complain, so he hobbles up their icy path to the door, fall hazards all round him. This is the only job he can get to support us. My mom is a wreck because of this. I can barely make my $100 a month in rent living with them and I am on seasonal unemployment and do not have enough money to move somewhere with more opportunity. I considered taking over his contracted delivery route, but I cannot imagine working that job, with no opportunity to make friends, meet someone special, or have any semblance of hope for a social life, that and it pays shit meaning I could not cover my expenses and theirs, and there's no way I could work a second job (if I was lucky enough to get one) due to the hours of the delivery route. 

My parents have about $200,000 in debt (L.O.C), plus maybe $35,000 in credit card debts, and their house is worth maybe $375,000 and my father is staunchly opposed to rent/apartments (just how he is). I have $97,000 in debt (student loans, car loan, no C.C debt) and FYI. I need a reliable car where I live. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think to understand my current situation, there are pertinent details in the past that need outlining. When I was 17 I lived in a different town with my parents and I was about to graduate high-school and looking at post secondary options, I applied to financial assistance programs (Canada) and was denied due to how much money my father earned. My father, who was privy to the whole loan application process told me not to worry and he would pay for all of my post-secondary expenses. I was ecstatic that I had parents who were financially able to support my education, or so I thought. 

Since there were literally no post-secondary schools in my area at the time (rural Canada), commuting from home was straight up not an option, so living expenses had to be included in my university expenses. While I was away at school I floated the idea of getting a part time job (I had never had one in high-school because of logistics *\[small town, no transit, no ride, had to rely on school bus to get home, etc.*\]) and was told by my parents to not do that and just focus on school. I followed their advice, being naive. Fast forward two years later and my parents inform me that they have run out of money to give me. Initially I was surprised, as I was unaware of their finances and just assumed that my parents were upper middle class. However, after learning this I lost my motivation. I was in a university program that I did not enjoy at all, only because of the misguided notion that a degree would land me a well paying job, and my grades in high-school were average, but not high enough to get into a program that I would be a lot more engaged in. So I had no choice, I dropped out and came home. After residence fees($12k), tuition($6k), meal plan/food($5k), and additional expenses over two years, I had somehow unknowingly sunk my father +$50k in debt all for nothing but a hard life lesson. 

&amp;#x200B;

Returning home after uni might be a bit of a misnomer, as right after high-school my parents sold our house (which we only had because they were living way above our means), and moved to an even more isolated/rural cottage/vacation area many hours drive away to 'retire' as my dad was tired from his old job. 

This, I feel, is significant because there were literally no employment opportunities. We live in the woods far away from any city. In order to go to a store I have to drive into the closest small town (pop. \~2000) which is about a 20 minute drive away. In order to get a minimum wage, part time job I was willing to drive up to an hour away. This meant I needed a car, and my parents had to buy me an old beater for $2000. Cycling was not an option as our winters can be brutal (Nov - May) with some months having blizzards multiple times a week, let alone the highway distance. I tried for over a year to find employment (all the while my parents paying my gas/car/ insurance, etc. because I literally had no money and no way of getting any. Heck, at the time we did not even have cellular service in my area (circa. 2010/11), and our internet speed is garbage being at the end of a long side road, making potential online work very trying). 

&amp;#x200B;

My only hope during those years was waiting an arbitrary amount of time since my dad last earned anything in order to apply for financial assistance, get approved this time, and go back to school for something I am actually interested in perusing. This is what I did. I went to a college this time (again, had to move to a city, and pay living/travel expenses), and came home for the summers where I was able to secure a minimum wage job for the summer ""cottage/tourist"" season. Now the overwhelming majority of jobs in my region are at summer campgrounds, gas stations, grocery, etc. These jobs fall off a cliff come fall and I guess your expected to go on 'seasonal' EI (Employment insurance) until tourist season in the late spring gears up again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, after graduating from my program, I could not secure a job where I was (too much competition/ time ran out and I couldn't bare to ask my parents to cover my lease/ student loan payments.) I returned to my parents house, which I have no privacy and cannot make any noise due to my poor dad sleeping during the day. My mom is constantly flustered and telling me ""shhhhhhh quiet!"" for taking any louder than a slight whisper. Forget talking on the phone, exercising, anything really that makes any noise. This has been going on for years now. I am severely depressed because of this and absolutely zero social life,  I see old friends once a year maybe, that I have to drive hundreds of kilometers to see and its hard to make schedules work. Also, there is no online dating for much of the year ""sorry there's no one new in your area"" only goes away when people come to vacation at a cottage in summer when I am working overtime. The median age for my area is around 60-65 supposedly. There are little/no clubs or anything that interests me in my area, no way to socialize in my silent home.  Additionally, I believe that my mental state has started to decline slightly due to years upon years of social isolation and now I sometimes have a phobia of being in a city/ socializing. Also my deceased grandmother was verbally abusive when I was younger so the thought of volunteering to spend time with more old people irks me a little. (I grew up around angry elderly and want to spend time with people my own age.)   

&amp;#x200B;

**QUESTION:**

**So how exactly does a person get out of this situation? How should I precede?** 

&amp;#x200B;

**I have been racking my brain for years.**  

**What I want is to be able to support myself financially, have a few friends and maybe a wife/kids one day and try to break free from my depression and for my parents to be healthy, feel safe and relax and enjoy their later years.**

I recently moved down to one of the most famous cities in the world (and in my mind the best for what I'm wanting to do).  Mostly this was to pursue my musical ambitions as a singer-songwriter, but also I see it as the next logical  step towards finding a career post-uni.  I'm renting a flat with some friends from home who go to uni here - they are getting financial support from the government and don't need to worry so much about money, but I'm finding supporting myself whilst on the job hunt (and trying to play music) to be incredibly difficult. When I first moved down I began working a cold-calling charity job.  This paid the bills but the hours were incredibly antisocial and I ended up being let go for poor performance in low-dem areas (we would go to council estates and were told to push people who were unemployed into donating to a homeless charity which I found unfair and unethical in many cases).  Since then I have picked up odd jobs in catering but can't find anything concrete that will actually pay the bills.  I've had a few interviews for 9-5, solid jobs in the fields I'd like to get into, but not getting the last one just really got to me.  I thought I'd interviewed really well and it just seems like there's an endless tide of competition and feeling of insufficiency pushing against my genuine want to work.  I know that this is a whiny response to rejection and not logical - I need  to be realistic and get a thicker skin, but really I just don't know where to start now.  I'm embarrassed even to tell people that I didn't get this interview; my friends are all working really nice, relaxed jobs and I wish I could find something that would stop this feeling of complete stagnation.  I have an incredible  girlfriend here who I'm very much in love with  and many friends who have been fantastically supportive  - all that I need to move forward is my personal growth and finding  a stable job.

I travelled home today because I'm spending the weekend with my mum for her birthday. When I got on the train I went to find my allocated seat. The man in the seat next to me offered to take my bag and asked if I was sitting next to him, so I said yes. Naturally my introvert ass was like ""please God don't talk to me"", but lo and behold he launched into a full-blown conversation.

He told me his life story in kind of inappropriate detail (for instance, he told me that he moved to Cyprus because his ex-girlfriend tried to stab him). He told me where he was going and what he does for a living. Then he started asking me questions: what my name is, how old I am, where I was going, what I study at university, etc. Then, as I was getting off at my stop, he asked if he could add me on facebook and, being too socially awkward to say no, I showed him my profile. I know that was a mistake and I shouldn't have done it, but I just didn't want to seem rude. He said he would add me when he got somewhere with wifi.

So I got off the train and hoped he would just forget my name or something. But I just opened facebook and he has sent me a friend request and a message request. I would guess that this guy is at least 15 years older than me, and I don't really know why he seems so determined to remain in contact with me. He didn't seem violent or anything like that when I was talking to him, but now I'm kind of creeped out and I don't know what to do. He knows my full name and where I go to university. The likelihood is that he only has good intentions but I still have a bad feeling about the whole situation.

I moved to the US four years ago for school and I've been able to put off learning to drive here for as long. I drove for around a year back in my home country, but was usually accompanied by someone. I think my fear of driving here is three fold: 

1) The driver's seat is on the left. The last time my friend offered to help me learn, I almost brushed against another car on the passenger side because my depth perception or something is messed up - the driver sits on the right back home. 

2) Everyone drives so fast here. I'm terrified of getting into an accident and hurting someone. I literally have recurring nightmares about this. 

3) This may sounds silly, but I'm really scared to fail. What if I can never learn how to drive? I'm scared of people judging me for bad driving.

 If this should be in another sub please inform

Over the years, my mother’s behavior has affected me but only recently have I considered the possibility it would possibly be considered psychological abuse. When angered, she becomes hostile to everyone, me and my sister specifically. She will swear at us, threaten to hit us, demean us, mock us, and refuse to listen to reason: she believes her minor in psych from over a decade ago renders her immune to protests or criticism. Her most common reaction is to confront us one on one, not allow us to leave or protest or defend our actions, and yell or threaten us if we do, then send us to our rooms or away. This is step one, step two bring the later apology: she will call us in, be much more calm and listening to reason, and apologize, and say anything along the lines of “ no matter what I say, I still love you.” Only recently did I recognize this was repeated almost any time there was a confrontation between me, my sister, and her. Looks at reddit have also enlightened me to these manipulative behaviors. Her actions have made me afraid of her: I become nervous when I hear her footsteps, and I dislike interacting with her even when she’s calm because of her past actions. She does provide for me and my sister, but emotionally and mentally, I’m just worse around her. I’m also worried if I try to discuss this with her, she’ll just blow it off and punish me, or get angry, or all of the above. (Her own past as a child is also in play: she was also psychologically and physically abused by her mother and stepfather, and to her, this means she can decide if we are being abused or mistreated, because, factually, she was treated worse. But I’m fairly sure that we are also in turn being mistreated regardless. )

447,"It's probably my fault.

I had been depressed for two or so years - I was negative and always bitching about things. I had problems sleeping and was always agitated. I don't know what cause this, probably a lot of things - losing my father, difficulty finding job after graduation, subtle backstabbing by friends and bullying at work - I became bitter towards the country I was born in and everybody living in it. I still do dislike this country and culture as a whole but a lot less. It feels like my only friends are my colleagues. I feel they treat me better than my friends.

I stopped talking to my friends for several reasons, I am probably wrong but somehow feel this way.


I feel like I spent a lot of time and energy into putting a group together, always inviting people anywhere when we were going somewhere and making sure no one  was excluded. 


When I was in a rough patch of my life I felt like I didn't find support, when I used to whine or bitch about things (which I still believe are true) their reaction would be laughter (because they thought I was joking or somehow felt it was funny) or telling me how much I bitch and whine. There were multiple instances where I just broke down and started crying (I'm a man) and their reaction would be laughter or a comment like ""oh boo hoo everybody has problems in his life. get over it"". THIS REALLY ANGERED ME. I know what they said was true but still they made me feel like a piece of shit. Other instances include telling them something and  somehow strangers got to know about personal stuff. Others include dating  or ridiculing  me in front of girls I was talking too. EVERY FUCKING TIME. So I started not telling them about any. Whenever I showed them something I made, like a song, or some form of art I would usually get no answer or not noticed. Granted I wasn't Hans Zimmer or Picasso BUT give me some feedback. I also used to DJ and organise parties. They never came to listen to me, so I started to lose that hobby too. They never came to a party I organised (even if I offered free entrance). Now they go to parties 3 times a week.

 I used to go out every day but then what I call preferential ism started. I didn't mind, everybody has a best friend. Just tell me. Don't leave me hanging there. Then I started feeling like a second-class friend. They used to  talk to me  when  they needed something and this got more frequent. When I asked for a ride, when they lived 10 minutes away, they would refuse to give it to me. Only when they needed me did they offer. This is a small matter but it really pissed me off. So I started going out less, my love for solitude  growing greater as time goes by. I used to leave facebook group chats, only to get put in the group again. They couldn't understand I CHANGED and wanted to be left alone.

In the mean time I had planned to move abroad with two of these friends, and after making all arrangements, they suddenly decided to move somewhere else (without telling me) because they didn't want to wait. Half of me said, fuck yes finally, the other half felt betrayed. I'm still moving abroad in a few months time (and they think they are going to get free accommodation once I'm settled.). They came back two times and they never told me, somehow other friends knew. The first time they came they didn't want to meet because they had to do their CVs (yet you see their posts with girls on instagram). The second time only one of them came back and 'wanted to meet' (pussy was already in his pocket I guess).

I sought help from a therapist and was given some anti-depression meds due to anxiety (sleeping problems). My mood started to get better, however by this point I had become selfish or ego-centric.  I didn't give a fuck anymore. Don't care of your fucking problems, never found you when  I needed you.

Then my best friend broke up with his girlfriend and somehow IT'S MY FAULT. He then got depressed too, and started giving me lectures about taking meds (because they fuck your mind according to him and that I was looking for an easy way to solve my problems - even though I went through 4 therapists and 1 psychiatrist so that I could get one  good night of fucking sleep) - then he started telling me that it's not good that I only went outside when he did (I mean he was my best friend, who the fuck do you want me to go out with?)  yet at the same time  he told  me that he felt neglected (1) after I had warned him they would neglect him too 2) he forgot the many times I stayed at home because he wanted to get attention from new friends 3 ) the many times he went with other friends without telling me 4) even if I had just went on vacation with him one months prior - was planned between the two of us but somehow I wasn't enough so a third party came - during this trip all he did was talk about pussy or telling the other guy how he could not rely on his friends because 'they only spoke to him when they needed him'). ""I  was trying to help you"" he said. I do believe it - kind of. He did try to help. But when his friends started neglecting him somehow I was to blame (he always did that when shit hit the fan, instead of getting angry at the culprits he gets angry at me and I was the one that always had to apologize even though I felt I was right) and that he needed to move on - so I got pissed and told him the only reason I was talking to the others was because of him and that they were his friends not mine. He told me I was trying to get pity and trying to shift things on me, got angry, blocked me and told me not to tell other people I knew him.

So now I only have one friend left, who has got a girlfriend, which means I'm all alone.

Not all of the other friends were assholes but they are one group so I don't want to have anything to do with them, in the mean time I feel like an asshole for getting angry over stupid things and I am also back to a mini-depression, with two months left in the country.

Not sure whether I should reconcile or not. Don't really feel like it but I am scared that I will not be able to make new friends after losing these ones.

What would you do? Should I reconcile?",11Jan2019,1

My smile is not perfect either but it’s decent. Mine might be a little bit crooked but they’re all there, at least the ones you can see. I had a few pulled in the back but you can’t tell. 

But these guys are nice guys and they must struggle with confidence due to their appearance. I feel like if I could just fix their teeth for them real quick or just give them a gift card to go to a dentist and get them fixed, their quality of life and confidence would improve dramatically. 

The problem is, 1 I don’t have the money to fix their teeth for them, 2 they might take offense to me trying to decide that for them even if I did have the money, and 3 it’s not my problem anyway but I just imagine what it would be like to be them and wake up every morning and go to bed every night with an messed up mouth. It must be really hard and I wish I could fix it for them. ",11Jan2019,1
451,"I was originally friends with say, John. We hung out frequently after becoming friends at work. Later, I became friends with Jane. I never hung out with her much, but she was more of a work friend. Later on, John and Jane become friends, and we all started hanging out. The thing is, I'm not very well connected with Jane as our personalities are polar opposites. However, when I hangout with John on my own, Jane sometimes expresses how she doesn't like feeling left out. It's become this thing where she needs to be included, but it's easier to joke and talk with John, whereas the topics with Jane are too bland/gossipy, which I don't really have motivation with.

How can I let Jane get the hint or let her know that I will no longer be hanging out as a trinity anymore, as it really takes away from the conversation. It all feels so forced by Jane, as she always wants to tag along, and gets upset if we don't include her.",11Jan2019,1

My thing is that i know im starting at a disadvantage, and my dad told me i should go for the experience, and to continue studying and better my art since i should be able to follow my passion. And that i should go without a major and just take the classes i want until i feel like ive done all i want. But i dont know if i should? I have no interest doing art professionally or getting a degree, because i know its not that easy as if i was in STEM or something, i know im probably gonna end up working a retail job and doing art on the side. 

And i really do want to study and better myself, i want to be able to be taught tecniques, be critiqued, experiment with different media on a level i never got the chance to get in poorly budgeted public school. And i want the chance to get out of the nest for a bit and at least have a taste of college life (im a bit starved socially from the homeschooling) but i dont know if i even have a shot at it in the first place or if it would be worth the cost in the end.

457,"For context I have a decently sized group of friends we see each other as family we all look after one another like family 

At least that's how it used to be 
About 8 months ago I found myself in a loving relationship probably the best one I've had so far I'll just refer to them as Kat.
Things were good for some time till Kat made a realization about one of my other friends I'll refer them as Frank the whole thing is beginning to make me depressed as my College life isn't going too well and my friend''s falling out with me isn't helping

Now for drama at hand
We'll start with Frank first him and I saw each other as brothers at one point however as time went on it became harder and harder to see him in that light as we've had multiple falling outs before due to stuff he's pulled and me getting more distant with him every time it happens. Now I believe he isn't a bad person we have had a lot of good memories but he has his moments as sometimes he can do some really scummy shit in the background.

Now when I got into a relationship with Kat she would tell me again and again that he gives her bad vibes and didn't like to hang around him and so I respected that and we hung out with Frank less and less.

I'm eventually told about something that Frank did to Kat over text by Kat herself it happend I'd say a few months prior before our relationship but to put it simply, Frank was sexually harassing her and demanding nudes from her

This naturally pissed me off and I completely cut Frank out of my life 
A little while later he calls me out for abandoning him for Kat and began to call out a number of other friends that said he was an asset behind his back but I'm said message he was mostly targeting Kat and I 

He played victim and got a few of my friends to take his side and they pressured Kat and I to talk to him we agreed on talking to him this Friday the others are staying neutral but have said to take my side if frank forces them to pick my side of he forces them

I want to talk this out with him 
Kat wants nothing to do with him but is willing to put up with him for this once (I'm proud of her for taking a stand with me as she's sensitive and downright despises people who talk to her sexually)
Frank just want's things to return to normal with being friends again

471,"So it is a long story but I (24f) currently live with my boyfriend (26m). We have had our issues and I have decided that I am not happy and don’t want to be in the relationship anymore. I told him this in October of 2018. We had a lot of time left on our lease so we were going to try to tough it out, try our best to be happy, and live together until August 2019 for financial purposes. 

Problem is that I am not happy, I know that I can’t be when I’m living here with him and in this town. I feel like I’m just wasting time and wasting it unhappily. 

I would like to leave and likely move across the country. It’s a city I love and have been dying to move to. The idea of moving there makes me immensely happy. I’ve been offered a job that pays almost twice what I make now. The cost of living is a little higher, but not too much. If I left, I would still have to pay my part of the rent in my current lease.  Things would likely a little tight for me financially but it looks possible. 

Another factor is that I am applying to grad school, three possible locations. One of which is in the town I would move to if I left right now. Even if I get into the other schools and not the one in the city I want to move to, I might just stay and reapply. That’s how much I want to be there. 

Even though it seems very spontaneous and a little risky, I want to do it because I know it’s going to make me happier than I am right now. 

I just want to present my situation and my desires to you all to kind of check and see if I am thinking logically and rationally. That I’m not making a overly emotional and impulsive decision. Because I hear (from the boyfriend I want to leave, mind you) that since I have told him that I want to leave him, that I’ve been making too many emotional and impulsive decisions.

482,"ok, so me and this one girl were friends, we didn't talk much all the time, we weren't close by any means. but last year i ended up having a bad episode of depression, i ended up in a mental hospital 2x, started to get really fearful of being neglected and rejected, i lost tons of friends even when i pleaded for them to stay, i didn't want to lose anyone. always vented on my fb account about it and she said to me about 4 times in 4 different situations that she'd always be there for me if i needed something. she said we were friends but she'd never text me or even try to have a conversation tho. i ended going through a mental breakdown again. and i asked her and a bunch of people ""do you even consider me a friend"" and then i threatened to cut myself, she literally started to attack me for no reason. told me to go cut myself and blocked me. after she said several times if i ever need to vent or needed something she'd be there, but when i was vulnerable and cutting myself, she dropped me just like that. i was so fucking pissed off, i told her to go fucking kill herself like her dad did and kept sending her images of dead people with headshots, sometimes with their heads almost completely gone, and i kept making fun of her, kept sending her images like that, kept telling her to kill herself until she shut down all of her social media. and she hasn't been on for 2 weeks. i feel kinda happy and feel like i'm in control. i hope she fucking died. if she does come back tho, should i apologize? am i a bad person? i mean she knew that i was having a mental breakdown and decided to make worse and i retaliated she did a lot more, but it's personal and i don't feel comfortable talking about that. part of me still wishes we could be friends. i don't know what i should do, what should i do?",11Jan2019,1

484,"Throwaway account in case certain people are looking for my account AGAIN

  
I'm 17F and I dropped out of school a couple months back due to extreme mental health issues.  For the 2 years before that I had kept going but always ended up missed at least 40 days of school.  I was one of those kids who learned to read at 2 and could read at a college level before middle school.  I can't go back to high school and I can't keep up with online school due to my mental health problems, (or maybe just being lazy).  I decided to get my GED and as I've been studying for it, I've felt increasingly stupid with every word I read.  After about 2 weeks I gave up on studying and haven't gone to the Adult Learning Center since even though I know I will have to eventually.  I'm debating whether to be a Psychologist or an Avian Specialist Veterinarian and I was going to get a job at the local avian vet but I'm much too terrified to call and I'm afraid even if I like the job that I'll still have a terrible time getting out of bed.

   I was homeschooled before 6th grade and had an extremely mentally ill mom who would psychologically and physically abuse me and my dad.  She used to think that songs that came on the radio were messages for her or my father.  She used to go to the police and tell them my dad killed thousands of people and that her dad was the Zodiac killer, which obviously none of that is true.  She swears by it that everyone has evil twins that are out to ruin her life and if you ever stand up to her she will blame her evil twin 'Terry'.  It's hard to explain and there are so many things to go into.  But due to these experiences from 7-11 I prayed every night that I would die in my sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

This year I lost my 3 best friends which I had since 6th grade.  I found out that they had separate group chats without me to make fun of me and shit all over me.  I found this out by them making the mistake of adding my boyfriend to one of them to see if he would also do it.  He didn't and he sent me everything they said immediately. 6 years of my life were just flushed down the drain.  I told one of them that the other two would never stop making fun of me and I was sick of it.  She promised not to tell them and you can guess what happened next.  They called me delusional and insane for thinking that they were making fun of me and that when they are they're 'just joking.'  That was September and all I really have left is my boyfriend who has stuck around surprisingly.  I'm glad I have him but I need more than one person in real life.  I'm desperate to leave the house more than once every two weeks.  I miss them dearly but I don't and can't go back. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mental health gets increasingly worse with every day and my meds don't help. 2018 I was in the hospital twice due to suicide attempts, right now I'm at the point where I'm like ""too afraid to do anything but if I died in my sleep I wouldn't be against it, or if a car was coming towards me I wouldn't necessarily move away, or if there was a button I could push to die, I'd do it.""  I have PTSD, panic disorder, Bi-polar 2. general anxiety, trichotillomania, BED, OCD, and ADHD.  Due to the BED mixed with everything else, I've progressively gained 60-80lbs every year since 8th grade and I am at the heaviest weight I've ever been.  I hate everything about myself.  I hate my face, my body, I miss my hair, I wish I had a personality.  I've started having night terrors again. I've ended up waking up screaming and running outside or into the living room in a panic twice just this week.  I can barely leave the house and when I do, I picture my dog, my birds, and my dad all being brutally murdered and when I come back they'd all be dead, blood splattered all over the house.  I end up always going back inside.  I'm too afraid to talk to my therapist even though it's her literal job to listen to me.  I'm terrified she's going to judge me and I'm just afraid to say anything.  I'm too afraid to ask my dad for online counseling. I'm too afraid to voice my problems to anyone because they'll think I'm seeking attention or that I'm faking everything, but I need to talk to one of them so bad.  I owe my online friend group so much, I've met half of them and I've known them all about 5 years. My psychiatrist says the meds won't work if I don't start getting out, but I can't go out, I'm so scared.  I feel so useless and pathetic.  I had such a bright future and so many dreams and I've become a disheveled mess who lays in her bed all day crying.

495,"Yeah, so I'm 21 almost 22 and 5 and a half years ago I made a decision that I feel like has completely and utterly ruined my life for good. I was always a bit of a geek that enjoyed anything to do with fiction way too much. When I was really young (child and early teens) this manifested itself as a love for books, but as I hit my teens it transformed into a love for video games. Particularly around my GCSE years my friends got me playing competitive games like Call of Duty and later League of Legends (trust me this is all important information). I did fine in my GCSEs (I got two A\*s, seven As, two Bs and two Cs) however I'd started developing behavioural, concentration and memory issues around that time. They weren't enough to cause any real issues then, but as I moved into Year 12 (so the school year that I turned 17) these concentration and behaviour issues really started being a problem and my performance in classes started tanking because of it. However one thing that remained a consistent was my enjoyment of competitive games, specifically League. I kept on trying my best at school for the first half of Year 12 but my school had a very low tolerance for problem students. I quickly learned that I had become one of these problem students in the eyes of the school staff, and essentially I just didn't receive any help from their end what-so-ever. They'd already kicked out several problem children in my year during previous school years and it looked like I was the next person on their list. Because of their lack of help and my worsening concentration ability my results just got even worse and worse (and it didn't help that my parents just straight wouldn't believe me when I told them about my concetration issues and wouldn't even entertain the notion of me being checked out for ADD or whatever).   
So about halfway through Year 12 I thought 'screw it, at this point my education is unsalvageable without my school suddenly changing its stance on problem children, I'm really enjoying League, I'm gonna focus on getting better at it and aim for a career in gaming (either as a streamer or even better someone in the eSports scene). Well, considering this post I'm making now, that clearly never went anywhere. I started playing that game religiously, and even though I still went to school and completed my time there, I came out with a miserable D, D, U, U. Because of both my failure at school and my failure to improve at the game I loved to a level where I could make a career out of it, I sunk into a deep depression that I am still suffering from today, and because of that for the last 4 years since I finished school my daily schedule has been 'wake up, instantly go on my computer, spend literally all day on my computer, go to bed'. I've had no hobbies, had no jobs, lost most of my friends, and basically haven't even left the house in 4 years. It's only recently that I got to such a point in my depression that even gaming has become completely unsatisfying, and I have managed to scrap together what little sanity I have left in me to \*want\* to improve my life. My mental and physical health (I'm clinically obese, who'da guessed...) aside for now (because I'm already looking into options to improve those), my main issue is the fact that I am convinced by now I must be unemployable.   
The highest level of education I have is GCSEs (pretty much), I've never held a job, and I've \*literally\* done nothing for 4 years straight, not even \*attempted\* to look for a job. I've never been gifted at anything so I don't even have a talent to fall back on. I've run through what my CV would look like in my head and it's actually disgusting how bad it'd be. I can't imagine someone \*more\* unemployable than me, and don't see how anyone would even remotely consider hiring me based on how my life has gone in the past 5 years. I also can't see at this point anything I can do to change this. Because I fucked up my A-Levels there's no way I'm getting into a uni course now (even if I'm ignoring the fact I've forgotten basically everything I learned at school by now), and even blue-collar apprenticeships are oversaturated with applicants now, most of whom would definitely have much better CVs than me. And this isn't even thinking about the fact that after 4 years of doing nothing I can't even think of a job I'd \*enjoy\* doing. And now here I am, feeling like a heavy boulder at the bottom of an ocean trench tasked with reaching the surface. I'm not even hopeful that this plea for help will result in anything that will actually help me, but it's the only thing I can even remotely get myself to do right now, and even then it took me a solid day before I could work myself up to type all this. So yeah, that's that. If anyone has \*any\* advice on how to solve what seems to be an impossible predicament please share it.",11Jan2019,1
496,"A bit of background: my grandparents passed away awhile back and left a house with a mortgage still to be paid off, essentially a house that three of their children (my mum, aunt, and uncle) would own altogether once the mortgage is cleared.

Now for the past 4 years, my mum has been the only one paying off this mortgage. The problem is that my aunt is the only one still living in that house (along with her scumbag boyfriend), so my mum has essentially been paying her rent because she doesn’t want to lose the family home that her parents worked so hard to keep while they were still alive.

This is ridiculous within itself as my aunt brings in double the income that my mum does, but has such terrible spending habits that she ends up with not enough money to pay for the mortgage (essentially half of what she’d be paying in actual rent if she were to move out.)

It’s so much worse now because my mum has fallen very ill. She can’t afford to be working so hard just to keep the house. She doesn’t expect her brother to help because he has 3 kids and troubling finances, but she’s asked my aunt to help with at least half.

This bitch straight up freaks out and says she can’t afford it. Throws a tantrum and declares that she will move out if my mum has a problem with her. Basically being very defensive and lashing out, ignoring my mum’s rational messages, ect.

My aunt spends all her money travelling, buying expensive clothes, going to expensive restaurants, giving her boyfriends mother gifts and plane tickets and holidays and meal outs. Also paying her boyfriends bail every now and again. She is completely irrational, impossible to talk to, and keeps threatening to move out whenever we try to talk some sense into her (which would be great if she actually went through with it.)

My mum has put the house up for sale now but still has to pay the mortgage every month - lest the bank takes the house and she’s left with nothing but the knowledge that she threw most of her earnings for the past 4 years into a bottomless pit. But no one’s going to buy it anytime soon, as it’s an absolute garbage pit. Smelly, messy, full of termites, because my aunt is an utter disaster and has no idea of what responsibility means so the house is now as much of a wreck as she is.

We’re all at our wits end. What can we do? Does anyone have any advice? We’ve tried talking reasonably, trying to get her to move out, and it’s all been for naught. I’m so worried about my mum’s health. I’m still in school so it’s not like I have any income to help her out either. I just want her to stop being taken advantage of.",11Jan2019,1

I'm having a little mental breakdown and can't find any answers, so I'm really hoping someone in this world can help.

I hate the course that I'm doing at uni. I didn't choose to do it, I didn't get the grades that I needed to do the course I wanted, and they offered me this instead. As it's a prestigious British uni, I said yeah. I bloody hate it, I have no interest in it and the thought of going back next week makes me want to cry.

I want to apply for a different course that my uni offers (I have the correct grades for it). However, my tutor told me I cannot apply for a different course whilst doing my current one.

Having told this to others, they think this is ridiculous and applying to start a new course in Sept 2019 should not mean that I MUST drop out of the one I'm currently doing. My tutor said that I'd have to drop out and then re-apply.

I don't think it sounds right either, as I could end up not going to that uni at all, ultimately left with nothing. 

Does anyone know what I can and can't do here? Should I just say fuck it and apply through UCAS for the course? It's because it's still the same uni that there seems to be a grey area.

505," 

I was officially terminated on December 6, 2018. I came to work, was told that I could clock in ten minutes prior to being fired by the General Manager for an alleged complaint from co-workers . I never clocked in. There was a physical copy of an email with my store manager’s email attached to the top. She knew I did not have a job, yet she knowingly lied by telling me I could clock in early for work. When I was confronted and told that I was fired, I had no idea what for. I had nothing but positive online reviews from the days I was scheduled to work, provided excellent customer service, and great feedback from my manager. There was an instance where she talked to my former manager, telling him how awesome of an employee I was. With all of this said, I had to really take a second to think about why I was being terminated. I recalled in the second month of working for the company I had two errors regarding closing the cash register. The issues were immediately dealt with, I had one-on-one training with the manager, and never had an issue since. However, I still asked the question, “ did someone accuse me of having an issue with the register?”. I knew this was ridiculous since I was not the one who closed the register the last day I worked. The General Manager,which I gave to him without hesitation. He then handed my a letter suggesting that multiple people filed a complaint saying that I sexually harassed them by exhibiting sexual actions and making comments in the workplace. I was in shock. For one, the letter stated that four people had an issue with me; the last day that I worked, there were only two people who closed with me: a co-worker and the manager. The manager was busy doing computer work, which left only me and my co-worker. Before closing, there were two other employees, but they left two hours before me; we barely had any contact. The complaint(s) were made the next day when I was off. An investigation was promptly made, and two people alleged that I had made comments directed toward them in a sexual nature. I cannot even guess who these people are, as I am sure I haven’t made any sexual advances toward anyone in my workplace. I never even as muched asked to meet outside of work or have phone numbers stored in my phone. The store owner, whom I’ve only met four times, concluded that the allegations made were true, there were damaging allegations made toward me, and that I was no longer a fit for the company. There was no opportunity for due process, I didn't even know what the alleged complaints were. I was just told in a letter that they were “sexual in nature”.

In hindsight, I do admit to engaging in a consensual two-way sexual relationship with a female employee, who was my age.The nature of the sexual language was mild, and it was not directed toward one another, rather we were talking about online and offline dating experiences. The girl made comments about having a lesbian celebrity crush and all of the things she would do to her crush. She picked fun at me often for complimenting customers on their clothing or hairstyles by saying I was  “flirting” with them. She and another co-worker joked that they would keep count every time I said the word “cute”. The only other comment I could think of that was possibly sexual in nature was a joke I made while someone referred to me as “Jonathan”. A new female co-worker at my old job referred to me as Jonathan, when I introduced myself to her. I laughed and said “I guess I could be Jonathan, but didn’t feel ready to come out yet”. I am a lesbian  (androgynous) female, deeply involved in the LGBTQ community, so I tried to make light of the situation since the employee was embarrassed;she felt very comfortable afterwards. When I clocked into my other job, I told them someone called me Jonathan, so I guess that’s my new name. Without hearing the reason behind my joke, the assistant manager told the manager what I had said. The manger confronted me and I told her briefly, I do not want to be referred to as Jonathan, and she said to come to her if I am serious about transitioning. She said we were friends, and can share that information with one another.

I love her, but guys, i fucking resent children. I realize we should’ve been more careful, but I was under the impression the chances of it happening were low/zero. Any advice would be much appreciated.  ",11Jan2019,1

As I am not in a place I could meet someone. I am of course in school, the only issue is that there isn't really anyone that would be my type, in my school I study programming, but all the other people that don't do programming are art students, and as I would be able to be friends with them, as I am. I can't see them as someone I could be in a relationship with as our political views are polar opposite and our general way of thinking is also quite different.

I was just wondering how I could come in a position where I would be able to meet someone.

522,"A little background about myself: I’m a visa student currently in school, I have very limited time to work by laws (therefore have very little money) and live with my brother in a small apartment, which I went through all the legal stuff to get, it has my name on it, I pay for everything including internet and hydro bills. 

1. My brother moved in with me after a few months I lived by myself, little did I know those few months were the best time I had for myself, because ever since he moved in, the whole place has became a living nightmare, to the point where I disgust my own home. He’s disgustingly messy and has no problem living in his own filth. There is literally no space on his bed for a human to actually sleep on it, clothing, take-out food, makeup, blah blah blah EVERYTHING IS ON THE BED. But that’s his own room so I didn’t have any problem with it, until the filth spread out into the living room and bathroom. He has the mentality of a princess who expects to be served whenever he wants and that doesn’t fly with me. I told him not to leave his things around, living room and bathroom are common rooms so he shouldn’t leave ANYTHING of his around because I have friends over for board-game nights. But noooo he has to leave his precious jewelries on the counter, on the couch, UNDER the couch, on the floor! One time his bracelet went missing, he immediately blamed it on my friends for stealing it. I asked if he has check his bed or the bathroom, he insisted on the idea of my friend stealing. I got fed up and did a little search with minimal afford and found it lying under the mail (that he left) on the counter. This happened multiple times but different location.

2.It’s not bad enough that he fucked up his room, he brought all the other rooms with him. He left all the used utensils and dishes and cooking wares EXACTLY where he finished using them, and he just kept taking new things out to use and at this point when I’m typing this out, I have one pair of chopsticks, one fork, one cup and one plate saved for myself, which I keep in my room to make sure he doesn’t use them, the rest of my plates and utensils are dirty, stacked up in and out of the sink. When he has nothing to use, he orders in and eats out. All the plastic cups and bowls are lying around, taking up the entire table where I usually sit at to eat. I now eat in my bedroom.

“If you have a problem with it why don’t you just clean it up y’all are family”  - I did this for the first few months he moved in, ok? I tried my best to keep my place clean but at his rate of destruction, I can’t anymore. I’m only human and I have my limit, alright? I have told him multiple times this is not okay, that I can’t keep going like this with the stress from school and job, he kept ignoring until one day I snapped and yell at him. He got very upset and guess what, HE TOLD OUR MOTHER ON ME. He told her I yelled at him, I in turned told her what he did, she screamed at me for scolding him! Her reason? “You’re the female you’re supposed to do all of the chores, especially because he’s your brother! He’s a guy he doesn’t have to do any of that!” 
... And this becomes a loop. Every time I snap because he doesn’t clean up, he tell my mother about it and she yells at me for not doing my female duties. So yeah, I don’t clean up the house anymore, I only clean my room and don’t come home until 4am so I don’t have to look at his face. 
 
3. I’ve always wanted a cat and so I planned to get one since I’ve moved out. But my brother who hated cat at the time, said that he would tell my family if I have a cat and since they’re paying for my tuition and hate cats, I bit my lips and not do anything. 3 months later, he made friend with someone who owns a cat, he immediately wanted one purely to show off to other people. Me, at the time, being so fucking stupid and desperate for a pet, agree to get a cat. I paid for the adoption fee, I bought the food and litter box in term of him having to take care of the cat. And the cat is under his name. stupid, I know. I beat myself up everyday for this so please don’t rub it into my face. I was just really desperate to have a companion. We both agreed to leave the cat, let’s call her Cream, in the living room so she can get used to the environment and us. 24hrs in, he took her and everything onto his room and lock the door. He literally said that his intention is to force the cat to love him. 3 months later, she still doesn’t. She looks worse than before we adopted her. My heart sinks whenever I see Cream. At this point, he put her bowls and litter box into the living room, which I’m 90% sure because he’s tired of taking care of her and wants to push the responsibilities on me. And boy oh boy  was I correct. I had to work 5 days in a row and didn’t come home earlier than 1am. Through out that 5 days, he picked up her shits twice! I kept track. Last night was my first day off so I went out with my friend for a bit. This morning, I woke up to a litter box full of cat shit, Cream’s vomit because he hasn’t fed her wet food because “she doesn’t even like it” and cat pee on the floor because the litter box is full. I told him to clean up and that the litter box hasn’t been cleaned in two days. His excuse was because he’s tired from work so he doesn’t do it and he has cleaned her box for 3 months (that she was locked in his room) so it’s MY TURN to clean up now. I’m very angry but I did it anyways because there’s only a limit of how long you can look at an animal being mistreated. The whole time I spent cleaning up, he complaint about how lazy I am for not cleaning up anything and how I’m not responsible for OUR cat (now that he’s tired of her). I’ve been crying in my bathroom for about an hour now. I’m emotionally, mentally and physically tired and just want a way out. All my friends are very supportive but we’re all students, there’s not much they can do to help me. 

TLDR: my brother moved in with me and is ruining everything. He’s disgustingly messy and borderline abusing “our” cat and my mother wants me to be his slave. I’m living a nightmare. Please help.

529,"Okay so this is gonna be fairly long because I’m not entirely sure what to say 
But basically
I’m trying to get my life back together

I suffer from severe depression and anxiety, as well as having a very bad vomit phobia (emetophobia) and being pretty suicidal (I’m ok ish on that part atm) 

I have no job (was in a&amp;e due to my depression and couldn’t make my shift so boss fired me) 
I struggle to leave the house for multiple reasons 
-too depressed to get out of bed 
-my emetophobia is awful during winter, i will have a serious panic attack the entire time I’m outside of my home 
-my sleep routine has completely failed, I will not sleep during the night, no matter what I do, and will tend to pass out during the day, I’m talking absolutely no control over it, no matter what I’m doing I will become so tired I will just pass out.

So because of these I’m struggling to find a job, as well as there just not being any jobs in my area.

I failed at school (all above reasons were affecting me awfully and was before I was properly diagnosed with most) 
I dropped out of college twice because of above reasons 

So I have next to no qualifications 

I can’t exercise because I become exhausted and nauseas pretty much as soon as I start 
I don’t have the money or energy to cook proper meals, and even when I do I become too nauseas to eat them 
Even though I can eat crap food just fine (which honestly I hate) 

I’m at my wits end with how much I’m struggling 

My bedroom is a MESS. I hate living in a mess it makes me so miserable, but I’ll start tidying it and I’ll become so overwhelmed and fatigued. 

I have a therapist that I’ve been going to for almost two years and while she helps a lot I’m unable to see her as much as I believe I need to, and when I do the sessions just aren’t as helpful as they need to be because I have a habit of not talking about what I specifically need to talk about, I’ve tried not to but I just can’t help myself 


Only bonuses are I’ve recently stopped smoking and tonight I’ve taken one of my anti depressants that I haven’t had in months (crazy work schedule made it difficult and boss wouldn’t allow me to take them while at work) 

What on earth can I do? I’m so sick of living like this. ",11Jan2019,1

23m, in Massachusetts.

I’ve lived a life of poor decisions so far admittedly, decisions that have left me without family to turn to, and I don’t feel right asking my friends to help me face my consequences via a place to crash, or anything else of the sorts. 

In my haste to find love and a home, I invested (poorly, at times) what I had materially and emotionally into a relationship that me and my partner really are starting to feel isn’t healthy for either of us.

With that said, I can’t stay here. It’s not okay for me to overstay my welcome and impede my issues with stable housing upon her. I’m accepting of the fact that I can’t, and shouldn’t, put her in a position where she has to live with someone she can no longer get along with.

So, with my lack of resources and people to turn to, I’m coming to terms with the fact that I might have to live rough for a while til I can get back on my feet again, and be a healthy member of society.

533,"I am just a month and some change away from ultimately choosing college. Although I am oficially a sociology student, at the end of this month I am ending prematurely.

Anyway, I am most inclined to double study of English language and something minor. But there is a possibility that I could regret this choice (second one!). Although I have always been a quiet and thinking type for most of my life, I am afraid that I could be actually the best at some natural or technical field. I have always been quite bad at both of these, but I like to learn some amazing fact from each. Although that it may sound as silly reason to choose a field based on this, but I am afraid that I maybe really should have and I don´t want to make the same mistake twice.

Anyway, I have several dreams. One of them could be a famous author (novelist) and I also like the idea of being youtuber. So I think that English language+Journalism or English Language+Movie Theory and History and Audiovisual Culture would be perfect combination. Right now I would like to work at desk and make decent living.

However, I also know the fact that these days, college degrees, tend to be meaningless, because the job demand is lower than number of graduates and that these days, what matters the most are skills, passion and that for some difficult jobs I don´t need college degree, but there are some paid courses for people who want to change job or entire career that last for a few weeks or one or so year.

So, there are some possible jobs I *could* find enjoyable:

1. Mechanic (like, aeronautical for example)
2. IT developer (web developer, app developper, game developer, software developer...)
3. Music technician (any kind of work at music studio - I´d love to work with/for famous musicians)
4. Designer (Graphic designer, logo designer...)
5. Filmmaking (Probably also some kind of technician or something, but I generally like the idea of working at some studio and with someone famous)
6. Economy (I studied high school focused on economy, but I didn´t like it. However I like idea of having some good living without worries of getting into debt and living calm life. Knowledge of economy would certainly help me understand how money works)

So what certainly can I do without college degree from either these fields or some other fields? Anything I don´t need a degree for, I wouldn´t study at college, so I won´t lose years of it.

At first she responded well, explaining some situations, and we texted back and forth and she got progressively angrier as we did. She just started saying ""youre tired"" and I was kind of annoyed because I honestly did put in a lot of thought to whether or not I should confront her about it, and for her to assume it was only because I was tired kind of ticked me off. But the argument pretty much ended by her saying things like ""You think im rude but you never think abt yourself"". But the whole point of the discussion wasnt to prove whos right and whos wrong, I simply wanted her to acknowledge my feelings. And Ive explained that several times, but she kept on continuing the argument. She did say sorry twice at the beginning of the conversation, and I have said that it was okay, so I have no idea why we're still talking about this.

They were never really close and suddenly there are best friends. And it’s because they suddenly share a hatred for me. The girl directly behind me uses her two big monitors to close herself off from me (she used to always leave it open so we can chit chat) and doesn’t say good morning and purposely excludes me in her goodbyes. The other girl is also not really talking to me but isn’t being as obvious (or childish) about it. Every time I turn to my coworker who sits next to me to ask him a question or say something, the two girls will stop mid conversation, listen in, and then hop on IM and start typing to eachother and I can hear them taking turns typing to one another, and the giggling. To be honest I can’t think of what I did. Last time she was mad at me, I confronted her and told her if she ever felt I did something she didn’t like, to tell me and I will fix the issue. She was mad because she misunderstood a message I sent and I explained to her what the situation actually was and i still apologized and asked her to not ignore me next time and just come talk to me.

I always noticed he was kind of bad, when I saw him kicking a yard sign, but never thought much of it because I just thought he was a bad kid. Today as I was about to get into my house, I hear him just continually shout “aaaah” as he’s running from his grandma and then he stops in front of my house and screams “aaah” to me. My boyfriend is with me and faces my door so the kid can’t see him laugh. I turn to the kid and just scream “aaaah” back, thinking it was just pure fun and a silly situation, also thinking if I did it, it would shock him and make him stop. I then quickly go into my house and hear him go “aaaah ahhh” again. When I get inside, my boyfriend says “that kid was probably special needs and you just mocked him”. My heart just sank because i just never thought about it that way and felt like me doing that back to him was mean now. In the moment, I just thought it was funny and playful. I would never ever make fun of anyone especially to their face and feel super horrible looking back.

Would you consider this mocking and rude? I feel so bad and am scared to see that kid again.",11Jan2019,1
546,"I am a 23 yo female and I have been in a serious relationship for almost 3 years with my boyfriend, 28. We'll call him ""J"". We have actually been living together for two of those years and let me tell you, he's the one. It may sound cocky, but we're the real deal, and we're ready to take the next step, marriage. Or at least engagement. Problem is, he's married. Technically. He married his ex (We'll call her ""E"") in 2013 and had twin daughters in 2014. In early 2016, he discovered that she was having an affair with a coworker,  and demanded she leave her job and they get counseling. She refused and left him the next day. Fast forward a few months, and I meet J at work. We hit it off immediately and things get serious quick. About three months into out relationship, E decides she is tired of her new boyfriend and wants J back. After weeks of threatening to take the twins and leave the state if he doesn't take her back, J broke up with me in an attempt to stitch his family back in together. It didn't work, and ten days later, he was asking me to come back. And I did. About a year later, he asks me to move in with him, and I agree on the condition that a divorce be set in motion. E is reluctant, but after finding a new man, agrees. So by spring of 2018, things are looking good. J and I are getting along well with E, the divorce is going smoothly, and we are all drama free. Then, E goes through a rough and dramatically public break up. Three weeks later, she discovers she's pregnant, and the divorce has to be put on hold until the baby is born, according to state (KY) law. She gets back with her most recent ex (""M"") , saying the baby is his. A few days after her first doctor appointment, she comes out and says that M is not the baby's father, but she'd had a one night stand with J's friend (""C"") while her and M were still together but not sexually active, and C was the father. C was married at the time, and denied the child and E's claims it was his in order to keep his wife from leaving him. E is devastated by this and publicly bashes him. Six weeks later, C commits suicide. Fast forward to to a month after the birth. J casually asks E if she's ready to move on with the divorce. She says no, that she is trying to apply for C's survivor benefits from Social Security for her baby. E says she wants all of that settled first, and says that J has to prove he isn't the father anyway. J tells E that he wants it done now. She tell him that he can if he wants to, but he must may for everything including the DNA test proving the baby isn't his.

J and I are completely at our wits' end with this girl, and are desperate to move on from all of this. He isn't one to seek advice, but I am. Please, if there's anyone who could help me figure out what to do to rectify this situation, I would greatly appreciate it. I just don't know what the right things is to do here. ",11Jan2019,1
547,"My school is forcing my whole year to do a page and a half speech infront of the whole year 80 plus students they are making us stand on an actual stage. One of my friends got out of doing it because of her mum actually caring about her wellbeing as for me my guardians honestly don't care but I can't do it especially since English isn't my fist language and I can feel myself getting sick at the thought of doing it. If I skip school I'll get points just as if I was in and refused to do it and wont be able to do any other fun school activities such as trips, competitions etc. Would a simple note from my gaurdian be enough, should I talk with the principal or should I get my doctor to exempt me?

548,"This may seem weird or pretentious maybe. My little sister is 15 and she doesn't like reading. She says that she wouldn't have a problem with it if there was something she really liked reading, but there aren't any books that interest her. 

My concern is that she isn't super great at spelling. My siblings and I were all homeschooled since early childhood, and the way we learned to read and write was primarly through, well, reading and writing. Our mom just made sure we had plenty of books (picture books, chapter books, fiction and nonfiction, selections of poetry, et cetera) and read to us every night, and encouraged us to write our own stories and poems just for fun. As a result, my siblings and I learned to read and write when we were really young... with the exception of the youngest. She just never really liked reading. She has trouble getting into books.

The most success we've had in the past: She enjoyed the How to Train Your Dragon series, but only when my mom read it to her. She wouldn't read it on her own (she was around 10-12). I loan her manga and comic books occasionally, and she reads those (fewer words, but dialogue is necessary for tracking story), and she plays a lot of video games, and more dialogue heavy games would definitely help.

I want to find more ways for her to get into reading, because her spelling is pretty bad. I don't want to just correct her all the time because I feel that she would only resent me for it, and 8t wouldn't solve anything.",11Jan2019,1
549,"Ok so the wierdest thing ever happened last night. My best guy friend and i were talking on the phone, the usual for us. We were talking and i dont even remember how but the subject skewed in the more ""sexual"" direction. When it really hit the fan was when he asked me whats my sexual fantasy, as in a place that i would want to do it once. Then he just started asking about more detail about it - position? what will come off first? And you know it was getting kind of wierd but it was somewhat in third person. But then we continued talking about it and it sort of went into what i would call masked first person. Ill explain what i mean. He said something and i said he sounded like a creepy uncle. He then asked if he should can call me his niece. (Sidenote - i know this is fucking freaky okay? Dont shame me). And he started saying what if uncle did this/that. Im not going into more detail but we talked about some freaky shit.

So then later he said he should probably apologize for all this. I said its fine. And i feel kind of wierd honestly. It was 4am when all that shit happened and we were both ""sleepy drunk"". Idk should i say something? Should i leave it?",11Jan2019,1
550,"Sorry about the essay.

 TDLR - Feel very low, need to get a grip.

This happened in the East Midlands in a small corner shop type premises about three hours ago. I was trying to buy a scratchcard and the shop keeper asked for ID. I'm 25 but I don't look it. I have photos of my ID on my phone so I was looking through my phone trying to find them. It didn't seem too long, maybe 20-30 seconds looking. I didn't know anyone else was in the shop. The person behind me (black, aged around 30-40) then says something along the lines of fuck whatever you're doing and goes in front of me, no physical contact. Not too sure what I said honestly, but whatever it was it wouldn't have been much more offensive than 'what are you doing'. He turns around and is enraged instantly, has me by my coat in the neck region very quickly. It all became a blur even 5 minutes after it happened, but some of the things I remember is him saying is that he'd vaporize me, me not being able to speak because of the grip and barely able to shake my head while looking at him, probably me instinctively trying to notion 'don't do it'. After he loosens the grip he hits me across the face. I could tell he was rascist as one of his remarks made me feel steroetyped 'don't talk to me like one of your white mates', among other things - I wish I remembered specifically, but I knew he got me wrong and that I was unworthy of a reaction like that. He then purchases his tobacco, leaves and I hear the car drive off as I'm standing there stunned at what happened and why I deserve this sort of shit. 

Called 101, got a crime reference number. Gave a terribly undescriptive description, the location/rough time and emphasised the fact that the store has CCTV. The shop keeper doesn't speak English amazingly but well enough to listen to what I was saying and called the shop lessee, although he seemed convinced that I must have known the guy, as that sort of reaction must have been from some previous grudge or something. They had no mouse to look back on the CCTV while I was there. For all I know it's not even recorded. Looking at the monitor at the counter I could tell that there was no way it was going to read the number plate as he drove off, and the employee said it was parked just before - out of the range of the camera. 

Later I thought to check if there are any other cameras and saw that the property to the left had a camera pointing to where the car would have been parked, so knocked on the door and learn it is the landlord of the shop. He also doesn't speak amazing English, implied that it would have to be his daughter that would have to look through it as I don't think he is technically savvy with it. Seemed promising in the sense of cooperating with police to provide it when the time comes, if it does.

I am feeling very low, and the guy is right, I am a pussyhole. I know for a fact that if I'd tried to do anything or said anything after 'say one more word' the guy would have laid into me. I don't do any harm to anyone, it really does make me feel like a low c***. I am depressed as it is. My question really is what is the likelihood of any justice? Is there anything else I can do to increase the likelihood of him getting some sort of punishment? The way he made me feel for not even being in the wrong in the first place makes me want to do what I can. Disregarding my default pessimistic outlook, I have a strong feeling nothing is going to come of it other than another mental burden weighing me down. Guess I have to wait for whichever officer is assigned the case to contact me and hope for the best.",11Jan2019,1
552,"I am so sorry if you've seen similar posts pop up bit I promise this is the last time I write about this on Reddit. I am 18, he is 17. We caught up on Facebook after years of parting in middle school. He told me about how he occasionally self harms, his mental illness, his expulsion due to terrorist accusations, and dating his friend's ex girlfriend... I supported him as an old friend. We met up and it's like we've known each other all along despite the distance. I hardly recognized him and he didn't recognize me. His mother instantly liked me, she was the one who made him bet that he had to take me out. I learned later that the very same day he went out with me was the day he broke up with her. It wouldn't be a problem if he hadn't confessed to me the very same day. We spent almost every day with each other and I mean it... everything was fine, he became my first boyfriend. Until we went out with his family and he took my phone to dial his ex girlfriend which he insisted was a friend's mom. A few days later, he gives me his phone so I can check when I told him I wanted a break, and I realized the texts he showed me of his ex the previous nights before were no longer there. A few days later, we go out with my mom and she catches him talking to other girls on the phone when I am not aware. When I broke things off for the very last time, he wrote that he loved me, he won't give up and that he will make things right. That week, he never showed up not even to bring me my stuff back as he was so eager to get his stuff back from his ex. Not a phone call or a message. In fact, his mother was the one who messaged me since she so desperately wanted this relationship to work. But how can it work when it was never there in the first place, when his heart belonged to another as he spent time with me? I finally ended things and it was the sweetest break up I believe to have existed. It was almost as if he was relieved, unbothered, and content. This is so messed up on so many levels that I am torn.

555,"I work for a government entity

the department has started a drug take-back program where citizens can come drop-off used/unused medications in a drop-box that’s available 24/7. (This is to prevent drugs from ending up in our water and environment, as many people just flush them or put them in the trash)

One of the requirements is to dump all of your medications into a single plastic bag (resulting in a bag of mixed medications). This is to cut down on bottles/boxes taking up space in the drop-box.

The department is requiring me to empty the drop-box. They’re requiring me to OPEN the bags of mixed medications and pour them in to paper bags in order to burn them during disposal.

Here’s my concern: I don’t know what kind of drugs are in these bags (some are pills, some are tablets, some are liquid gels, some are powder, some are liquid, etc.) and I’m most likely inhaling them upon transfer. I wear latex gloves and a paper mask, however I feel like this is not enough.

Does anyone have a resource for what kind of equipment should be used for this type of work or if we need certifications for this? Because I work for a government entity they are unwilling to spend money to have a hazardous waste company come and dispose of them. And I feel like if the only other means of transfer/disposal is through a hazardous waste company, should I really be doing this??

556,"I'm currently working my first full-time job. I've been here for 1.5 years, and I feel like it's killing me slowly. I work in a cubicle doing IT help desk work. When I first started it was exciting. My first ""real"" job and I was learning more every day. Then the boredom set in. Once I learned the ropes of the one (1) product I support, everything became routine. Now I don't know which is more boring--the calls I get, in which the same problems repeat over and over, or the dead periods between calls, which I waste by furtively scrolling on my cell phone.

IT work has never been my passion because I have never had any passions. I majored in English in college because I liked to read (yet I have never read for pleasure since graduating). I then decided to become a librarian because I had no better idea for a career. I spent two years getting my library degree, only to experience an endless stream of rejections after graduation, as it turns out there are exponentially more aspiring librarians than there are job openings.

I decided to turn to IT as I once again had no better ideas for a potential career. I got an entry level certification and, eventually, an entry level job. I spend all day in a cube and come home completely drained and exhausted, despite the fact that my job is neither mentally nor physically taxing.  After work, I have no energy left for the things I used to enjoy. All I want to do is eat fast food and go to bed. Then on the weekends I catch up on the chores and errands I neglected throughout the week, and I repeat the same cycle the next week. I'm not living, I'm just surviving.

So it WA sjust me, and when the police were called, I was able to move in with a friend. So it's been over a year now since that happened, and I decided that it was time to reconnect with my mom when she messaged me.

He emotionally and physically abused me, and she knew that. She said she had taken a long break from him, but they were living in a house together. She then asked if I wanted to come stay over at her place, which I then said no. I never want to talk or see this man after everything that I've been through because of him. The worse thing is that she knows how much he's hurt me, but she's back with him. I'm just unsure what to do about maintaining a relationship with her.

Current state of events:
My mother wants to call CPS to gain full custody, but we know if they do, they will break up the kids and hand over   the three youngest to Foster Care. We don't know what to do, but we don't want the kids to get separated.

My parents won't allow the girlfriend/wife into their house since she attacked my mother and has a restraining order against her.

570,"I'm a typical gamer. 

As long as a game is fun, I will keep playing until I am really good at the game. I will invest hours into playing, develop the fundamentals, and watch tutorial videos. The perfect example is Rocket League. This game requires **hundreds** of hours of playing/training/tutorials to reach top tier. I put in 900 hours and got **really** good, but the first 400 to 600 hours, I was garbage. 

I quit and uninstalled the game at least 5 times, but something always told me to reinstall it and suck it up. 

Why am I able to do this with video games, but not with something useful/creative? The only creative thing I've pushed through enough to get decent at is writing. 

I forced myself to develop an interest in reading. I figured out what kind of books I liked. I bought over a dozen books dedicated to writing. I researched authors. I wrote two full-length novels and self-published one on Amazon (but took it down because I rushed it out. No professional editing, nothing like that).

I've attempted to do several things on my own, but they all fizzle out. I lose passion, I lose any reason to push through the tough times, and I talk myself out of it. 

Here's a list of things I keep trying to do, but they just... fizzle:

* Writing
* Drawing (figure drawing &amp; comics)
* Bodybuilding (this is more for just personal health/fitness, never thought it make me money or anything)
* Guitar
* Ceramics
* Woodworking

Woodworking is pretty fun/rewarding, even though measuring stuff takes me a while to get right... 

So my real question, I suppose, is am I trying out the wrong things? I'm creative, but I want something more ""solid"" as a career. I don't want to depend on my creativity to bring the bacon home. I think that's why I've quit drawing and writing so many times. 

I always think, ""I don't have to do something creative, I can be good at many things. I can work as some kinda park ranger/attendant and live in a campervan. I can become an HVAC technician, a carpenter, go into IT support (it's always been my fallback plan since I'm good with computers and helping people)""

The ideal lifestyle I strive for is ""simple and secure"". I'm a very introspective person, most of the time to my own downfall. And I have BPD, which can throw me in for a loop if I don't pay attention to myself. 

This is a lot, but do you have advice? Thanks for any help :)

I started life well, was the top performing student at school every year, did sports and had friends with no effort. Graduated a degree at a good university, then got a bursary to study my dream career in a different continent in a foreign language. Was doing well and on track, then in my final year with a few months left I fell into a deep depression lost the passion, couldn't function and decided to drop out and moved back home. Went into a deep existential depression, after a year I took ayahuasca which help me feel a bit better. Another year passed and I did mushrooms and lsd a couple times in a month and really got my confidence back so I moved to another city and got a contract job which only lasted a couple months and was let go early for no reason. So I moved back home and decided to pursue art, tried to teach myself but in a few months started feeling depressed again, now 2 years have passed and I have nothing to show for it. Been stuck at home, extremely exhausted everyday and just browse the internet, rarely socialising. 

So now I've lost 4 years, feel suicidal for a long time, I literally don't know what to do, have no motivation, cant feel any enjoyment and feel completely incapable of doing anything or ever feeling normal again.

575,"Hey guys

So a little background here:
I started studying for an academic degree in “Product development”. I’m currently in my last year before I finish my Bachelor. If I want to complete the study I have to get my Master degree which is another 2 years. Over te last 2 years I realized that the courses and way of teaching etc. were kind of odd. They “advertise” it as a “technical” study and teaches a wide variaty of knowledge (philosophy, anatomy, mechanics,...). Next to the theoretical side there is also a practicak side with a lot of (group)projects. Here is my first issue. First of all most of the projects focus more on design than actually quality. For example, a project that isn’t innovative or doesn’t work but looks good get’s higher grades than a well thought out product that isn’t super designed (me). I mean I get that you need to have best of both worlds but it seems to me that an actual functioning product is more important than a nonfunctional one which looks good? If i buy something in the store and it doesn’t work it’s a bad product end of the story. You won’t be think oh what a bummer but at least it looks good. That being said, the mentors all have a different vision of what the study/project should be. One says make it this way. The other says no make it that way. But like really contrary visions. While one says yeah you have to make this and test that, the other says no you don’t have time to make anything focus on the other things. Very confusing if you ask me. But if you then say I’ll do it my own way they’ll be like you did a bad job and you wouldn’t listen. Next to that the mentors are extremely subjective. On exams, on projects,... I could deliver as much work as someone with very high grades. But because I did that work on my own instead of in their sight they would say that I didn’t do my best. They would give high grades to a students project that totally failed, because they remembered it worked, but I had to redo the whole project because he “didn’t remember that my project also had worked”. Not very fair in my opinion. The last thing I want to bring up is the “wide variety of knowledge”.  It is correct that we see a lot of different stuff but how we see it is ao shallow, that it’s barely usefull.  Most of the students don’t even try to gain insight or gain extra knowledge by looking stuff up. They just learn it by hard, not knowing what or why they are doing. Funny thing is that this method is way more succesfull than to actually understand the matter. 

Long story short; the best way to succeed at this study is by thinkering a bit, make sure your projects look good. Doesn’t even need to function properly. And put a lot of unnecessary and ill-considered efforts in them so it looks like you’ve spend a lot of time in it. And you will get there. 

This is not what I am about. I want to learn stuf. To realize things and all. Gain a lot of actual knowledge and skills. 

The fact that this is the scenario at my faculty made me loose my motivation. I have been very unhappy the last months because of this. This made me think if this is the right choice for me. Although it would be an “easy fix” to just deal with it for an extra 2 years so I get my diploma and I can go my own way, I don’t think I could mentally handle it. 

I went searching for alternatives for my study field and stumbled  uppon industrial sciences: industrial design. From what I’ve heard this is the more technical variant of my current field and this will get me a industrial engineer titel. On the negative side it is in a city far away from home and family which is the opposite of my current situation. 

I’m also frightened that if I make the big change, the other study/city would be so dissapointing and not what I was expecting that I made the wrong choice. This withholds me from deciding. 


I feel like it is a very big and important decision I should make. But I am to scares of both outcomes (resume what I am currently doing and affecting my mental state or change studies to find out I’ve made the wrong choice)

So anyway. I’m very sorry for the long post (and bad english). But I think the background story is necessary to give advice! Hope you guys can help me! Thanks!!

I’m mostly hoping on advice about both fields but any advice is welcome! ",11Jan2019,1
576,"Hello. I'm a 19M and I live in Norway, Oslo.
I moved to Oslo about 2 years ago and I have been multiple years without friends. I spend my time working, playing games and talking with Swedish friends I've made over the internet. The last days I have gone through a pretty hard breakup of a 2.5 years long relationship(19M&amp;18F)
Ive realized, lately, that I'm an introvert.
(As added information I work shifts) 


Im genuinely wondering how I can get friends and what to do to start a new ""life"" with friends and ofc possibly a new special someone after some time:)

578,"So I checked the bid notice board at work and noticed I obviously didn't get the bid due to my union seniority being junior to most of the workers here. 

I know union are set up to help workers but I feel the opposite working here. I feel that the junior employees work much more efficient than the seniors do and are kept down in a dead-end job with low income, shitty hours, and no benefits. 

Meanwhile, the already well-off established workers get more $$, more benefits, and overall better economic situation when they've never had to struggle. 

It makes me so fucking angry it's bullshit. 

This is dead-end no way to move up union job and I've been here for 2 years.

580,"I had a really bad relationship, the guy was horrible and has made me a lot more paranoid about relationships which I hadn't really realised until now. I joined Tinder again and have my first date tomorrow with a guy who I previously went on a date with. I'm excited but nervous. My worry is that guys don't want to take things slow cause they really want sex and I'm worried that they don't have much sex education. My ex was the first guy I had sex with and pretty much everything went wrong. I'm also worried that I'm going to date the same type of guy who is mean to me. Is there a way that I can stop stressing so much? What can I do to make myself more relaxed? And how can I trust men more? ",11Jan2019,1

583,"I am a young, new mom to a 7 week old girl. My dad loves photography and has several very nice cameras and wanted to gift me one for my birthday. I thought he was going to give me one he already had or a ""cheap"" nice one.

He spent $450 on a $1200 camera bundle that was on sale. 

I feel so guilty for having something so nice when I'm struggling to pay car insurance and student loans, etc. I'd much rather return the camera and get a cheaper one so I could still take pictures of my family (like he wanted), and use the leftover money towards my daughter and savings. 

I tried explaining this but he seems so keen I keep it. It'll hurt him if I try to do differently. 

What do I do?",11Jan2019,1
584,"Background: Today was the last day of my first week at my first internship. It's a corporate office job in the IT department. My manager is a very nice guy, but from what I've heard from the other guys in the department he's sort of peculiar and have commented on this particular issue before. 
I would like to think so far so good with this internship. I've been eager and picked everything up pretty quickly. 

Now to the situation: the guys (about 8 of them) who work in my department (all full time salary guys (im hourly) who have been there at least a year) asked me to go out to lunch with them today. I was pretty ecstatic about it, I felt included. Didn't really ask any questions about where we were going because I'm not picky and I just wasn't really thinking about it. We have a one hour lunch which coming from retail and my shitty 30 minute breaks seems like a lifetime. The place took like 15/20 minutes to get to which I didn't really realize because I was just feeling good about being invited out. Service was really slow. Didn't even think to look at the time, and when I did an hour had almost passed. I didn't know what to do, I'm new I didn't want to be like ""ya know we really should leave now"", especially since the one guy had just gotten his food. Even at this point I still wasn't really thinking or worried about it until the other guys realized how late it was as we were leaving. Now I have to punch in and out from lunch so my manager sees what time I come and go. I got back, clocked back in, finished what I had to do and left around 3. 

I was only supposed to be there until 12 today, which is around when I clocked out for lunch. The only reason I stayed is because I had a meeting at 2, so I approved it with my manager to stay later beforehand. Note that I was not being paid or anything while I was gone because I was clocked out. 

I sent my manager an email a couple hours ago explaining the situation, and didn't call anyone out, just apologized and said it wouldn't happen again. Did I do the right thing?",11Jan2019,1

586,I was engaged to SO for 1 year and broke the engagement. So here’s the story. We met and it was a commitment really quick. He moved in within 3 months. We were engaged in 11 months. I broke the engagement after 1 year. I made more money than he did. So when his car need to b get fixed (3xs) I charged it on my credit card. When he needed new work clothes I charged it on my credit card. When his son need school supplies and clothes I charged it on my credit card. So all added up it really comes to like thousands of dollars. So after we broke I asked him to pay me back. He of course refused saying that we were a couple and that all was household expenses. The thing is I miss him. I want him back. My family says no way he was using me for my money. What should I do??? See if we can continue or just let it go and realize I was being used?? Thanks for any advise. ,11Jan2019,1
587,"I have been lonely as hell for a very long time. I was severely bullied, especially because I watched a lot of anime and movies, and also read a lot when I was young. I was labelled a gay-nerd. Because of that, I found it very difficult to speak to people. I made only a few friends but they would always move on and or leave me because of how socially awkward I was. I would just walk the hallways of my school alone speaking to myself like a madman. I moved to a new school where I found a group of people at that school who accepted me for the person I was, they helped fix the weirder aspects to my personality and people that I really related to and loved to be around.  

But there was specifically one girl out of these people, let's call her Laura. She was the first to approach me, as she noticed that I was reading Storm of Swords ( Game of Thrones book) and we started to talk. She is really popular at our school and very smart too. Laura and I slowly realised most of our interests were the same. We watched the same stuff, listened to the same music and even played the same video games.  She introduced me to her friends, who were incredibly nice as well, found me funny, and were nice to me in a way that nobody else had been. I started to fall for one of Laura's best friends as well, a really cute girl who seemed to be interested in me too, let's call her Cali. Everything seemed to be going well until Laura's twin sister (she shall be called Gina) broke up with her boyfriend of 4 years. 

Our friend group lost a few friends who took his side, but I was around with Laura and Gina and the rest of the gang. It was a big shock, and I really wanted to know what had happened. I didn't want to ask but I was super curious. 

I was studying in the library and I saw Gina's ex-boyfriend and whilst he was walking by I stopped and asked him about the breakup. I wanted to know about what had happened, and we started to talk, and when we did I went on with his story. When he would say bad things about Gina I would enforce them and also make my own untrue remarks about Gina myself to build up his trust. Turns out they broke up over a strange and insignificant thing and it wasn't really worth the effort I went to. 

Then all of a sudden things had started to change. 

My friends were acting extremely strange. They weren't really talking to me the way they normally do. They were being a bit cold, sometimes confrontational. I had never seen them like this and I was kinda freaked out. I tried bringing it up, but they would just brush it off and say they were tired or something similar. I could have accepted that except that Laura wouldn't speak a WORD to me. We had become very close. We did have a different argument before and I assumed that was why she was angry. 

Then Cali told me what had happened. 

One of the people in the library overheard our conversation and took photos or a video of me and Gina's ex speaking. All of my friends were told and they had become extremely angry about it. They were really hurt about the stuff I had said and that I would approach this Fuckboy of an ex-boyfriend instead of my real friends. Cali wasn't angry at me but even she barely speaks to me because of the group. 

I tried to apologise to Laura, but she said that I should have apologised to Gina, but now it was too late to do that and that she no longer trusts me. I have never made connections with people like this and not being with them is really painful.  I was going to ask Cali out, but even she is distancing herself from me. 

It's been a month and a bit now, and they are still treating me the same way. I try and avoid them, but not speaking to Laura is the worst. I don't know how to make things up to Laura and Gina and then the rest of the group. There's about 9 in our friend group and all of them are being really harsh about it. 

The whole situation is really eating at my brain, and I am getting super depressed about it. School is becoming even worse than how it was before and I can't even focus on work or any other aspect of my life. I don't sleep and I don't even do the things I used to like to do anymore. I need to fix this. I don't know what to do to make things better and was hoping for some advice.

TL;DR I made a group of friends, for the first time in my life, but because I was being nosy into one of their private issues, they are angry at me. Now all my friends are angry at me and being really cold towards me. Don't know what to do to change my situation.  ",11Jan2019,1

590,"My life is an awful mess. I’m living with my new boyfriend (S 21) otherwise I’d be a homeless university student. 
This relationship isn’t necessarily new, he was my high school sweetheart but we ended it before I turned 18.  It was abusive but he’s tried to change. 

I was single because my now exboyfriend Matt (30) who was perfect in every way possible ended because he went to jail half way across the country. (I live in Manitoba, he’s in Vancouver) he told me he’d wait for me and want to be in a relationship with me when I’m single. That’s what he told me (not that I agree he should do that but the very fact someone loves me enough to wait for me.. is touching). 

I’m honestly stuck in this city until I’m able to start grad studies and get a good paying job because the top schools I want to go to are in Toronto and Montreal. 
I hate this life of waiting. ",11Jan2019,1
591,"I bought a gift for the kid of the guy I was in an on and off ugly relationship with (2 years, basically he just wasn’t ever going to be in it for real and has now ghosted).  I’ve bought her presents for birthdays and Christmas before  even though the last time (September) he told me not to.  I think she genuinely likes my gifts and I like doing something nice for her because she’s a good kid and I never got a chance to really connect with her.  The gift is wrapped- has multiple items wrapped individually.  I’m wondering what to do with it now.  Do I unwrap it and attempt to return to multiple locations? Hold on to it in case we return to at least a speaking point so I can give it to her? Mail it or drop it in the door? (this would probably spark an ugly response) or something else...donate a wrapped gift somewhere?  Not looking for “relationship” advice here just ideas of what to do with the gift because I keep moving it around my house. ",11Jan2019,1
592,"My life is pretty good on most days. I'm 18, almost 19, have a job that pays a good wage with good hours, a free ride through college (currently at community, will transfer in 2020), a car that I paid for, and a loving and generous family that I wouldn't trade for anything. 

Or that's how it looks from outside. I've been dealing with a lot of internal conflict regarding the way I was raised and how everyone views me, which I've done two things with. I wrote about my early (age 0-11) years and how I felt then (major issues at the time) in 3 pages of MS Word, and I also made a little bullet point list of specifics including recent stuff. 

Could y'all tell me what I could do as far as working on some of my problems?

Note: even just writing this, I felt guilty about what I was saying. Most of the time, my family is supportive and quite generous, but I still feel as if I've been disadvantaged by my circumstances. I know many people have it worse.
