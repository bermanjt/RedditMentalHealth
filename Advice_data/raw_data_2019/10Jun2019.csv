0,"I apologise in advanced for what might sound like the most stupid thing to be hung up on but I really don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 16 I met this girl through a friend and we dated for about 2 years, we lost our virginity together and became closer than anything I've had in my life. Emotions are something I have always struggled with and never really felt actual happiness until I met this girl. Well as time progressed I began experimenting with drugs and meeting toxic people and my lack of feeling had suddenly became overwhelmed with this need to please myself constantly (not jerking off lol). I was in a toxic environment at home and found myself getting high everyday. Time passed and we begun to distance ourselves as she started a college (English high school) miles away and we saw less and less of each other being from every day to about 2-3 times a week, but texted constantly. I begun talking to this girl from my previous school (who then went to her college) and we ended up having ""sex"" at her house. Now I put this in captions as we didn't have full sex, I was feeling incredibly guilty for essentially cheating on my gf and went down on the girl but refused to let her do anything to me. Not that this justifies my actions but I think its key to show my feelings even then.

&amp;#x200B;

At this time I was having a lot of issues at home with my parents (dw I won't bore you with another story) and I knew that in the next few days I would need to move out. My GF at the time being the angel she was, would have done anything for me and I knew that me leaving home would effect her studies as I knew I'd be living at least 2 or 3 towns away (she was so committed to becoming a midwife). I decided to break up with her but wanted to do it in what I thought was the perfect way. I would call her and explain to her coldly that I had no interest in her anymore, and confess to the atrocious cheating I committed (my idea being the only thing that can truly heal a broken heart is unrelenting hatred towards me). After I said what I said, I deleted our conversations, blocked her on everything and have never spoken to her since, I didn't even hear or see her reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been four years and I have never felt anything even measurably close about anyone the way I felt about her. The women I have met since are always charming and pretty but just don't have that spark that she had. I understand that getting back together is not an option as she has moved on with her life and she deserves a real man who will give her everything, not a broken toy like me.  I've smoked and drunk myself 2 stages above a coma all this time and I still feel today as I felt back then. I've told myself all this time, she's  in a much better and happier place now. This has brought me a fake warm feeling of contentedness over the years to think she's doing well but I actually don't know if she is.

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to do is apologise to her, using the internet as-well as a can do attitude I have been able to locate what I think (maybe 1 or 2 houses out but definitely in the radius) where her exact address is.... Now I'm not going to appear knocking on her door or any sort of encroachment on her university/ new life in general but I really want to apologise to her, in person just so that: 

1. She understands why I did what I did, 

2.  To know life's going well and she fulfilled her dream.

3. I just want to hear her voice again.

(The plan will be to keep this brief, thank her for the memories and leave)

Is this the right decision, and if (probably) not, what can I do to find true closure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading all of this, there's way way more detail I could add to make this all make more sense but I hope I've generalised where necessary.... although the thing about the other girl probably wasn't needed in this generalised context but in full it would make sense.",10Jun2019,2
1,"Hello all, my parents got me a dog some time ago and she’s got some behavioral problems I don’t know how to fix or correct. She’s EXTREMELY territorial and impossible to walk! The entire time she lunges and growls at people with dogs passing by— some that are thrice her size. It gets so bad I have to pick her up and run her home. It’s so embarrassing. I’ve read countless articles about training but she responds to NOTHING. 

I’ve tried to bring pieces of chicken on our walk to train her to sit and be calm, but no... her focus is entirely on seeking out the next lizard to kill or dog to bark at. 

And that’s another thing. She barks at EVERYTHING! I know its in her breed, but sometimes its too much. We even got this can of spray where the sound is supposed to deter dogs from barking... she stopped for 2 days and went right back at it.

My parents won’t pay for a trainer, I know that. On my own I saved up a little bit of money to pay for her to be neutered, I was so hopeful it would calm her hormones! But no!! She’s the same! 

Every time she acts up now, I’m in tears, I feel like such a bad owner. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I mean, even though she is territorial  she is all bark and no bite.

Please, any tips? I’m heartbroken. I thought she would mellow with age but no such thing is happening. I don’t have friends with dogs to help me",10Jun2019,1
2,"  I go to appointments fortnightly with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the 
interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then talked upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little bit about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet) ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this accordingly) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s. Just really worried she thinks I'm Ugly and that I stink. I did need a shave which maybe why but I always showered as normal and was clean I just hadn’t shaved this once and had easy wear layabout clothes on :/ she also put in the email ‘please dress smartly’ underlined. But she also chose me for 2 interviews and didn’t say that anything about appearance at all the 2nd time",10Jun2019,1
4,"Just to preface this, I do have pretty bad social anxiety and have a horrible time understanding social cues/ what’s socially acceptable. 


So I’m going to be an incoming college freshman pretty soon, and last week we received our room and roommate assignments. I was assigned to a 3 person room, which is just great for my social anxiety :’). Roommate information is provided and the college encourages us to get to know each other before school starts in the fall. Since I get email notifications on my phone, I found out pretty quickly who I was with. I thought it would be more casual and less weird to just follow my roommates on Instagram rather than text them, email them, or mail them. First girl doesn’t follow me back, second does. Later that night, first girl follows me back and dm’s me saying something along the lines of “hey, so it looks like we’re rooming together! You should give me your number so we can FaceTime!” I responded with “hey! My number is **********.” 


Shortly after, I see that someone I know is already following first girl (Instagram will show if anyone you know follows someone right on their profile). Small world, right? It was a friend I made at debate camp. I dm’d the girl and asked her how she knew first girl as she was my new roommate. Turns out she goes to her school. She wishes me well in college, and that’s basically our whole conversation.


About two days later, I was going though my dm’s when I noticed my conversation with first girl was gone, which was pretty weird. I look her up, and sure enough, she blocked me. Asides from her message to me and my liking a picture she posted earlier in the day, I hadn’t had any interaction with her. I haven’t even met her yet and now I’m freaking out over the idea of having to live with someone who already doesn’t like me. 


Can anyone give me any idea of where I may have gone wrong and what I can do to remedy the situation without looking like a total weirdo? Thanks in advance",10Jun2019,1
6,"So I currently am enrolled into my university for computer science. I am well off because I went to community college for 2 years, saved over 40 grand and got financial aid + money from my grandma and support. Parents will pay for my housing until i get my degree which puts me into an entry position of very high pay and low living cost because of where I live. Im set to graduate with minimal student debt, I do my school each day and try to thoroughly understand it and excel, But I feel depressed. Despite all of these goals

I get up at 9 o clock and program for one hour, I eat breakfast and get to class early at like 10:30-10:40 I get out at 12. These are 8 week courses aswell so its effectively twice the pace 6=12. which is what I am enrolled in. Afterwards I get home Chill for one hour Program for an hour, and workout, by this time it is 4 o clock. I will relax and maybe clean up around my parents house tell 5:30. On tuesdays and thursdays I will go to class again at 6 and get out at 8. My freinds work 9-5 Jobs, I am in school, I am not in financial need of a job, but not against it, I just would rather concentrate on school.

&amp;#x200B;

Im keeping myself occupied 9-5 for about 6 hours in total sometimes 8, with constructive activities meant to improve my quality of life and self in some way. Im getting into some of my harder coursework so thats why it can be a timesink.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all these things im doing right I don't feel happy. Im set to get good pay, get a job I like and will probaly apply in internship this year to get one over the summer, where I will be working 40ish hrs a week. I work just like everyone else, wether thats contributing to my bank account or just school/overall health.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I see things as absolutes, I don't have a job so i feel like shit, But im already working hard so would it take away from school? Mind, idc your lame because your not working. Im Lame because i still live with my parents me ""I wont be next summer cause my housing is paid for aslong as i do well in school so  I can live wherever I want."" Mind Idc.

&amp;#x200B;

I have absolute negative thoughts, and I know that im progressing toward great things but I feel absolutely unfufilled about life. Its never been things for me, I mean im going to have to deal with a lot of unoptimal situations to get to the optimal ones but i cant come to terms with anything, I am suceeding and yet I feel as if I am failing at life.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; financial aid and community college have made me basically in a good spot to where I will have little debt, set to graduate with a high demand, high paying job in 2 years, Feel bad because im not working but parents will pay for my housing wherever I want to live apartment wise and support me so long as i work hard toward school. Feel some things as absolute needs that have to happen now and I cant get past this.",10Jun2019,1
7,"But I’m not 100% positive. 

I am housesitting and a few days ago I had a brief and friendly conversation with the neighbor whom I’ve met several times before. This time something felt terribly wrong! 
Here is the story, it’s a bit long but I really need some insight about this that’s unbiased. 

It was about 6:30pm, I was outside playing music, watering plants and then picking cherries. My music was loud, it was Fado, Portuguese music that I love. 
I then heard the neighbor playing their music loud and decided to turn my speaker down. 
As I was picking cherries I saw the neighbor at the fence. He smiled, asked what I was listening to and seemed genuinely interested in the music. I asked him about his music and we had a nice, short conversation about it and that was that. Even though I did sense he was a little “too friendly” I thought NOTHING of it. Maybe just an old man flirting. 
I think... 🤷🏼‍♀️

After I was finished outside I came inside the house leaving the sunroom doors open. 
I started some laundry, used the restroom and then returned to the sunroom. 
That’s when I found 2 items on the table that I KNOW were not there before! I was so, so freaked out! It was a “chromatic pitch music tuner” and a small brass pot that I couldn’t open but it had something inside!!!! 
I immediately called my husband and asked him to come over right away. 

The thing is, I was drinking a bit earlier and admittedly was quite buzzed. My reactions were way over the top and I was incredibly angry. I felt totally violated and then I realized that I was way less credible because I was under the influence and my emotions were high. 

I felt so violated and angry because I was sure that man was fucking with me! My doubt started to set in when my husband and mother were wondering what exactly happened because I was not sober. So now I am thinking maybe I had a psychotic break and lost my sh*t. Maybe I’m watching too much true crime and serial killers and I DEFINITELY know that had I not been drinking there wouldn’t be ANY doubt. 

I’m willing to accept that I might have freaked out somehow and those items were there all along. At the same time I know I’m very, very observant and particular about my job housesitting. I always leave things just as they are and make sure everything is clean. As soon as I saw these items I knew they weren’t there before!!!!

Thanks for reading if you’ve made it this far! 
Today the home owners return from vacation. I left the items on the table and simply asked in a note if they belong to them or if they’ve seen them before. The answer will clarify some things. I just needed to write this out and see what Reddit has to say. 

I will definitely update this when I find out more info.",10Jun2019,1

10,"Been at this job for 9 months, there’s this cute sweet woman that’s works here... Im a good looking down to earth guy, but I keep to myself..

anyways last week I decided to send her a facebook request... it’s been a few days and was left ignored; not denied or accepted..

I knew she saw my request because she’s been different with me ever since!

she’s always nice to me and everyone, but the next day at work she said “hey (my name)” in a happy tone when she walked by..

and the next day she was striking up small talk with me at checkout, which she does with everyone, but very rarely with me... she’s just been enthusiastic around me more than usual, and very outwardly nice more than usual... and I’m not sure if it’s sincere or fake behavior.

we work in retail and are in different departments, so I don’t run into her often...

11,"I was heavily bullied as a child and developed a strong sense of self hatred to the point where I hate people being proud of me or giving me compliments because I can't fathom a world where I could be anything but an abnormal, ugly mess. It's gotten to the point where I can't bring myself to talk to anyone out of fear of being judged or ridiculed. I only have one friend who barely talks to me, probably because I over think everything and don't say what I truly want to when talking to them, thus making me think I'm boring. I also am terrified of making them uncomfortable or being overbearing - even though half the time I'm pretty sure I come off this way despite my best efforts. Anytime someone is nice to me I question whether or not it is a joke because it seems weird that someone would *actually* want to be around me and *actually* enjoy my company.


I feel like if I could just be myself, the way I am around trusted family members and by myself, I might have friends and be well-liked, but I just have so much fear and self-doubt that I isolate myself and put out this cold, shy, *leave me alone* type vibe. It seems like the people who are liked and have friends are the ones who are outgoing and confident, but I am afraid that if I'm like that then it will be seen as obnoxious and weird simply because it's me. For some reason, too, I feel that me having self-esteem and actually liking myself would be seen as narcissistic and arrogant.",10Jun2019,2

I would talk to them about this, but I know they would just talk about how they do it because they love me.

Whenever I ask if he’s wants to hang he hasn’t really given a true answer and he always seems to have something that he has to do. What really upset me however was what he said yesterday.

He offered me an inv to this other guys lake house and I said id be down to go. He asked yesterday so I was expecting like a follow up today saying like the time and all that, but I never did get one. I later figured out that he was already there and I was furious saying like “hey what happened to the inv” he then follows up saying that he forgot to text me and that I’m still inv but it just seemed like bs so I didn’t go.

My brother use to joke about me being left-handed when I was younger but I thought it was just a joke of him just being special in the family but I found out from my oldest brother that the reason why I don't use my left hand was because my dad was simple-minded person and thought right-handed was the right way and prevented me from ever using my left-hand.

I also had some suspicion that I was left-handed but I was quick to disregard it because I thought it was just stupid. I also had some of my teacher asking me if I was left-handed and asked me if I needed left-handed tools because apparently when I traced things it looked like I was left-handed (I don't know, my teacher told me this), I also noticed that my hand writing stayed bad, it never got better, sometimes if I were to write long sentences it would become unreadable for someone else and sometimes myself (Maybe my handwriting naturally just sucks)

So I took my shirt off and one of my friends hosed me down. Now while this was happening my friend decided to take a video of this and a couple of pics and I wish he wouldn't but I was preoccupied at the time. So cut to like in a couple days I'm at school and we are talking about it and I ask him not to post those pictures. The reason I said this is because I am somewhat overweight I weigh 155 and am 5'6 and am not comfortable with my body and don't want everybody to see a wet shirtless pic of me. So he agrees and for 5 months everything is fine until I wake up this morning and he posted it on Instagram and in the group chat for an upcoming event. I thought that we had agreed that he not post it but now he did and Im wondering what are my options.,10Jun2019,2
35,"I’ll get straight to the point :). 

I had been doing great a month ago before a series of bad luck turned my life upside down. Now I’m desperately trying to figure out what to do to better my situation, And frankly, just survive. 
  
The sucky part:  
 
I stay in Ktown in LA and got my car stolen 2 weeks ago. I was in between Apts. so I had everything important to me in there. 
 
On a good note, my car was recovered 2 days ago but had to ask my Dad to pay 700$ in impound fees. Almost nothing was left in the car aside from some of my clothes and personal hygiene items.  
 
Was doing PM and doordash temporarily then I couldn’t do that or even get another job cos no ID/BC/ sscard. Subsequently lost any place to stay because no money no job basically. This all happened in the span of 2 weeks. I know, boohoo. But it really does suck when it’s all you have. 

 
The good part (and the part where I ask for advice):  
 
So, I’ve got my car anyways which is newer, great on gas, and has no problems. It’s just nearly out of gas.  
    
       I’ve also ordered a new birth certificate from Utah vital records but it’ll take about 2 weeks to get here. Soon as I get that I can get a SS card and a replacement CA drivers license.

When I get those after 2-3 weeks I’ll be able to get an actual job, cooking or teaching/tutoring. And thus, be able to afford rent somewhere decent and get my life back on track! That will be amazing 
 
However until then, I have only my car, smartphone and charger, couple changes of clothes, laundry soap and blanket, a few other items, and a GoBank account which is linked with my PM and doordash accounts. I will be receiving a debit card for this account in the mail on Monday or Tuesday. (I’m getting my mail sent to a homeless office in DTLA)  
   

 I could start delivering right away again and have an income source but atm I have very little gas left in the tank. No money. No food. I’m 26/M and able and willing to work for anything. I just don’t know where to start.  
  
I wrote this whole thing because I’m  willing to take any advice/help I can get right now, not just on how to get some gas money.  I also need pointers on maybe more suitable subreddits to post this at, how to format it better and/or make a tldr, how to better ask for advice in general, Etc...
 
 I apologize for the bad writing and formatting! I’m a long-time lurker but never posted until now, so I just made an account :).  
 
Advice away, thank you stranger.",10Jun2019,2
36,"I'm just going to use a number system cause this is a lot. Also my first post to reddit, ever, but I'm overwhelmed and looking for advice from people with no real skin the game, so to speak.


1. 8 years ago I developed chronic pain in my neck, shoulders and arms. I was in university for illustration, and while I was trying to figure out how to fix my pain, I had to give it up to pursue other things
2. Other things were ""communications"". But due to the physical and mental toll my pain took on me, I dropped out 3 years in to love back with my parents. Hoping i could use to the time to actually recover from my illness. 
3. At this point doctors are apathetic. I have chronic pain. Itll be there the rest of my life. What do I want them to do? They think I'm trying to get drugs too (I've never needed or gotten opiates, btw)
4. So ok. I regroup. I cant really draw anymore. It was my whole identity, my only hobby, the only thing I'm good at...but let's try something similarly creative that i have a lot of interest in. So I sign up for and get an associate's in filmmaking from the local community college. It's not Hollywood but theres a lively film industry here, plenty of people make a living doing it. And i like it! Its fun! It's also too damn much for me. 14-16 hour days are average. Theres no union here, and I have so many horror stories of people getting underpaid, overworked, put in dangerous situations and outright scammed. Film sets are high stress environments that are physically taxing, too much for my pain. I cant even work my way up to a less physically taxing position in the industry because...
5. I'm just a wreck that cant do anything. Even 35 hr a week jobs in an office destroy me, mentally and physically. I've never held a steady job that didnt send me to a dark place mentally. 
6. And the thing is, I'm getting better on that front? But not enough. I've been to many many therapists over the years and finally i have a good one and a good plan I'm improving with. I'm losing weight, I'm able to function well enough after work to not live in filth...but that's it. I havent gotten to "" and do something enjoyable"" or ""be social"" yet.
7. But ok. Here's the actual situation. I just thought maybe that background would be helpful;
I'm turning 26 and losing my parents insurance. I've lived with them for 7 years now, and while they have been financially supportive (as in, I dont pay rent) they do not help with medical bills. Or, well. anything else. They are hypercritical and borderline emotionally abusive and always have been. They think my illnesses are excuses for failure. They do not and never have let me have friends. I don't have any friends within 3 hours of me because of them. I'm closeted. I have no idea how bad they would react to me coming out, but it would be a question of *how bad*. It wouldn't be good. I need to move out. But I have only 5k in savings- most of my earnings from the past 6 years have gone toward medical treatments that dont do anything. I want to move out of state, but I dont know where. I dont know what im supposed to do for a career when everything is either too much to handle or so boring it makes me want to d/ie. I dont know how i can work enough to support myself when everyone I know works 2 or more jobs plus various side hustles and still cant do it. I dont know how I'd find a roommate when i dont know anyone and cant just live with strangers (it's a thing I've left out but this is too long as is). Nothing doctors have done to treat my pain has made any difference, but the thought of not treating it because ei cant afford too and just living with it...unacceptable. talk about a one way trip to suicidal ideation. But so is continuing to love closeted with my parents. I've been stuck in a viscous cycle of ""work job that kills you so you can treat your illnesses so you can keep working the job that kills you so you can keep treating the illnesses so you can keep working the jobs that kills you"". just...I dont know what to do. But something has to change. It cant keep going this way.",10Jun2019,2
37,"I feel trapped in a impossible situation where I am 100% unhappy in my life. I have tried waking up every morning and saying what im grateful for,self help books, meditation, and talking to others but it doesnt seem to get any better. I work endlessly to get no where because I have two children and a wife who wont work. I am 29 and still live at home because where I live it would take 60 to 70 percent of my income to pay rent. It is overcrowded and my expenses are such that I have no real room to save.

38,"Hi so this is a bit awkward and weird for me to post, but I think I am finally in dire need of seeking some advice for this.

I'll start at the beginning. Back in October 2017 my sister decided that she was going to cheat on her long-term gf with this co-worker of hers. Everything kind of got messy from there because that new girlfriend we'll call her M was in a sticky situation with the law. They came into my room one night at around 4 am asking me to do something that was completely out of context for me and ever since then began to dislike her quite a lot. Moving forward my sister (A) and her gf (B) decided that they BOTH wanted to date M and so they kind of started living with her. 

This is where the sticky situation comes in because Both A and B and myself all share an apartment together without a couple of other people and we had just signed a 16 month lease in October. Fast-forward a couple of months into May 2018 and they decide that they are moving out and they want me to move into a one bedroom with B's moms name and B's name on the lease so that they won't get an eviction on their credit or have to pay the apt to break the lease. So, I say sure. However, I never signed the lease myself and don't have any of the bills under my name. When they moved out they were months behind on the light, gas, and water bills. This unfortunately left my bank account in negative and I have been in negative since then and can't seem to be able to get out of this hole. It has now been a year and one month since this has happened, and there is now 5 months left on this lease. However, I don't really think I can take it much longer as I have to go to PT and see an actual therapist. I have been wanting to move out since January, but every time I am about to move out my family makes me feel extremely guilty about it. What I am asking is if I should just move out and not care what my family thinks or says about it? Or should I try and find someone to sublease this apartment? I kind of don't really want to try since they don't seem to even care what is going on my life anyways. They are happily living in a new house A, B, M, and M's little sister. Any advice giving should be helpful. Thanks and sorry for any spelling errors.",10Jun2019,2
39,"I honestly have a huge problem where I just don't care about school at all. I don't do the work, unless it is directly related to me failing the class. I've been trying for years now to break out of this patterns and I just can't do it. 

Despite this I was able to get out of high school and into a good college, but after a year there things have only gotten worse. I failed half of my classes last semester and am retaking a class this summers and I'm still not doing the work. School and grades just feel so insignificant to me until they catch up and screw me. 

I really don't know how to handle this anymore. I can't trust myself to try harder. I'm thousands of dollars in debt, about to fail out of school. My parents keep trying to push me and I'm just not moving forward from this.

48,"I'm 20 \[M\] and live in Australia.

I'm not trying to brag anywhere, just giving as much info as I can. 

At the age of 20 I've travelled internationally many times (USA 5-6x, China, Indonesia), worked in Retail, Fast Food, worked as a product manager for a startup, worked as a business analyst in a school and have an internship coming up at a big 4 accounting firm. I achieved a really good score in my final year of school and was able to choose pretty much any course I wanted in Uni. I have a fantastic friendship group who are academically and professionally motivated and have some super close friends I consider to be like brothers/sisters. I have a current long term girlfriend. I started going to the gym when I was 17, eating healthier, and taking better care of myself and since then I've become insanely more attractive and feel so much more confident about myself.

The problem is, I still feel like I haven't done enough and I'm running out of time to pursue things. I was never a big party animal in high school. I went to some parties, but not really that many. I was teased for being overweight when I was younger so throughout highschool I never felt attractive or confident in myself which obviously limited my social interactions which people I wasn't completely comfortable with. This also meant I hardly talked to girls, and if I did I would never try to make it anything more than a quick casual conversation. I had my first kiss at 16 but I didn't have sex until 18 which was after I finished school. 

I've now become a massive party animal. I drink a lot, and never say no to a good party. I just feel as though because I missed out on all of this in highschool, my social and sexual experience lacks and I feel like I missed out on being young and stupid and I won't get the chance to do this again. I'm planning to study abroad in 2 years times (I'll be turning 22 when I leave) and essentially I just want it to be a chance to party, meet new people, and be young and wild. Except I feel like by 22 I'm way too old for that. 

How do I break out of this mindset? Ever since I was young I've always had a mindset that you need to work hard in school, get a good score, go to a good uni, get your degree, get out before you're 23, and begin your career ASAP. I've somewhat broken out of this mindset but it still kind of sticks with me and I feel like because I had that when I was younger, I've missed out on a lot.",10Jun2019,0

51,"Please don't say that I shouldn't place my value on how others value me, we all do this because we are social creatures, I can almost guarantee people who say this are people who get regular validation from family, friends, partners, etc.

I have no family. 

I have no friends.

I have no partner. 

I have no friends, for some time I did but that was almost ten years ago and that they moved on so easily makes me question if they even counted as friends, I've had acquaintances since but no friends - I'm not anti-social or introverted, I do try to meet people but as an adult it's difficult to make friends and I just don't connect in any way to anyone. I don't really meet people so that includes guys, what few guy I attract don't seem interested in a relationship with me. 

I've never felt loved by anyone, surely that means there's something deeply wrong with me as a person. All I have ever wanted is to be loved, hell even valued enough for someone to want me around would be nice. It's very difficult for me to maintain any sense of value or love for myself when no one else values me, I'm beyond tired of being alone. 

I'm a good person, I'm not the most amazing fun person but when I see so many horrible people with friends...I'm surely good enough. How on earth do I determine *why* people don't like me, what makes me so disposable and unlovable?",10Jun2019,2

53," 

So let me start this off by saying that everything is entirely my fault and I'm going to get down votes because I'm a shitty person. I'm not asking for validation, I'm asking for help.

I am 14(M). I have few friends because I have social anxiety disorder, I'm introverted, and awkward. My friendships revolve around video games because that's pretty much the only thing I do. I also have clinical depression and adhd. I have always been very impulsive and have outbursts of anger. This is where the problem starts.

For about 2 and a half years I have been playing video games with this group of 3 friends and I am always throwing tantrums and fits like a fucking child. For any of you guys who have played league of legends or actually any multiplayer game, you will know there will be people trying to intentionally troll games for their own team. I am one of these people. When I get mad for what ever reason I would afk or intentionally die and obviously my friends would get angry at me for ruining their game and wasting their time.

Over time my depression and anxiety have worsened mostly from age and circumstance and with that my emotional unrest/instability has also worsened. I more frequently get angry and waste my friends time. I never really get angry at them. I just get angry and then ruin their games. I have never really tried to improve my emotional outbursts because it didn't take priority over some of the even bigger fishes in the sea of problems. At some points in my life I almost ended it and I had to focus on my depression instead of dealing with my anger issues. I can't say I regretted it because I might not be here today if I tried to focus on my anger issues. That's the reason I haven't been getting help for it.

Recently it's been getting worse to the point where they would not talk to me for a couple hours. One game around 3 days ago I afked and they none of them have talked to me aside from insults after trying to get their attention. One of them said I am full of shit, another said I will never change, etc. It's summer so I don't have to see any of them at school so they can ghost me. At this point I don't know if they will ever talk to me again. I have been able to get there attention through spam but they won't except my apologies and promises to do better because I've apologized countless times before and I haven't done better.

At this point the existential dread and loneliness has really set in. Yesterday I didn't talk to a single person the entire day. Let me say that again, from the time I went I got out of bed to the time I got in bed I hadn't said a single word to anyone at all. I was always quiet and lonely but this is on another level. I twitch streamed for the first time today because I was so lonely and I had no one to talk to. It helped a little bit but it didn't solve the problem of having 0 friends.

I have no idea what to do and I'm convinced that I'm just a shitty person and I can't change and my friends have reaffirmed that belief. I don't know what the next step is. I don't think I can make new friends especially since there is no school. If I let everything be and continue how it is then my depression will probably get the best of me and I might kill my self out of pure loneliness and misery. What do I do?

Sorry for shitty formatting and most of sentences probably don't make sense because I typed this in a very emotional state. If you need more information then ask me in the comments. Sorry for the long read but I don't think a TL:DR would give enough information for you to accurately access the situation and give fair advice.

61,"Just to preface this, I do have pretty bad social anxiety and have a horrible time understanding social cues/ what’s socially acceptable. 


So I’m going to be an incoming college freshman pretty soon, and last week we received our room and roommate assignments. I was assigned to a 3 person room, which is just great for my social anxiety :’). Roommate information is provided and the college encourages us to get to know each other before school starts in the fall. Since I get email notifications on my phone, I found out pretty quickly who I was with. I thought it would be more casual and less weird to just follow my roommates on Instagram rather than text them, email them, or mail them. First girl doesn’t follow me back, second does. Later that night, first girl follows me back and dm’s me saying something along the lines of “hey, so it looks like we’re rooming together! You should give me your number so we can FaceTime!” I responded with “hey! My number is **********.” 


Shortly after, I see that someone I know is already following first girl (Instagram will show if anyone you know follows someone right on their profile). Small world, right? It was a friend I made at debate camp. I dm’d the girl and asked her how she knew first girl as she was my new roommate. Turns out she goes to her school. She wishes me well in college, and that’s basically our whole conversation.


About two days later, I was going though my dm’s when I noticed my conversation with first girl was gone, which was pretty weird. I look her up, and sure enough, she blocked me. Asides from her message to me and my liking a picture she posted earlier in the day, I hadn’t had any interaction with her. I haven’t even met her yet and now I’m freaking out over the idea of having to live with someone who already doesn’t like me.

63,"I'll try to include only relevant details, but enough to get a real picture for a real answer.

**TL;DR:** In a training program with the DoD where they pay for me to go to grad school (must be STEM) while not working for one year (paid school, salary). I worked it so I could get a full year to study at GTL in Metz, France. Am I trying to make up for mistakes and relive my early 20s when I should just let go and rearrange my priorities to get a masters locally and/or something more stable like finding a partner and planning for a family? Insecurities due to age and gender, and (possibly self-imposed) pressure

&amp;#x200B;

Without going too far into a full life story, I feel like I threw away my college years and early 20s in a lot of ways and missed important opportunities, maybe in some part due to my family working-class background and not knowing how to navigate college or career stuff, and in other parts due to mental health struggles.

I've had some instability in the last few years, but I grew up with an unstable home life, so it didn't strike me as abnormal. Again, without going into too many specifics if it's not relevant, I'm looking back at my choices and regrets, and I feel like this last year I've been trying desperately to make up for lost time in not being assertive and trying to please people and turn my life around. 

In the process of trying to find a fitting career path in the last couple years, I found an opportunity with the DoD and took it. I started last September - it's a training program where I work for a year, get paid to go to grad school for one year, then return back to work. I graduated 4 years ago with my BS in mechanical engineering, and now my age is hitting me. I'm worrying I'm too old to be doing this training program that's geared to fresh college grads. I'm also worrying that I'm being insane in using it to go do the masters in France. I taught myself French for fun a couple years ago and looked for ways to get over there, so I actually tailored this opportunity to work out for my personal goals. I'm just wondering if as a female it's dumb because I should be trying to settle down and have a baby, not go back to school after 4 years out. I was accepted by Georgia Tech and can go to either Lorraine or Atlanta, and I was also accepted by another local school. I'm in the visa application process, but I could still technically choose to go to the other local school or Atlanta (though I don't think GT would be very pleased with a switcharoo at this point).

I have really enjoyed the job I'm in, I love the people at work, I've made many friends, gotten to do a lot of fun things with really great people, and I see and have sought out opportunities. I don't think people realize I was working for 3 years prior, so sometimes I get bummed that it feels like my work experience means nothing, but I'm also not sure it matters ultimately. Some people do know and I think it is obvious in how I communicate, work and approach problems anyway, so maybe it doesn't matter. At work, anyone brand new like me is about 22-23 years old and some of them start higher pay scale (mainly because of my training program I chose), so that makes me self-conscious sometimes. The maturity difference is usually noticeable and I often feel alone in my situation, but for the most part, I've been happy, though constantly quite neurotic and stressed about all of these worries and wanting to have a stable residence for longer than a year!

I've often been intimidated by my male counterparts that exude a natural confidence with regards to engineering, and I definitely still feel it, but I'm more confident in myself now in dealing with that. Still sometimes I wonder if I might be too behind to be able to have a fulfilling career as an engineer. 

It's really tough to hear people talk about women in certain ways that make me extra self-conscious. Sometimes I'm not sure if it's done to plant seeds of doubt and neurosis, or if I'm just overthinking it. Like, an example, my high school ex who insists on still texting me occasionally (but it's always a ""how are things going?!"" to which I reply in a laconic manner, but he only wants to tell me about the latest thing in his life that's going great, like his career, house, trip, etc.), one day texts me how he feels bad for his older sister because her time is running out to get married and have kids. He says how after 30 females are just not prime for child bearing anymore and men at their age are looking for younger women and men can have kids up into their 40s and how that really sucks. Well, I'm still unmarried and I've just moved to a town in the middle of nowhere with a limited male selection and, the area being full of families and retirees, probably largely already married. Then even if I do meet someone I really like and start a relationship, I have to leave them for a whole year. So I've fucked my prospects completely! 

I would give anything to go back to being 18 or even 23 (yeah I now am starting to get when older people see posts from people that young saying their life is ruined, etc.). I feel like if I were a guy, this wouldn't be a big deal. But as a female, I am increasingly getting surrounded by married couple friends and married women who don't work or work less with these stable lives. I feel like I've screwed up in a lot of ways - I'm still not married but I want a family, I'm having a longer path to career stability and fulfillment, and by the time I get out of grad school I'll be 29 and apparently undesirable to many men. 

So the possibility of failure in the program and the pressure to settle down have me in a state of constant anxiety and stress. I haven't been able to sleep well for weeks, I have frequent panic attacks, chest pain, and I already have other health issues I'm trying to address with doctors before I leave in August. I also met someone I really really like and I don't want to get into that, but it's just getting hard to stay above water in my head right now.",10Jun2019,1

Some real advice that is NOT what you’d typically hear. Something that would actually help.",10Jun2019,0
65,"Okay I will try my best to summarize the context of this shortly but i apologize if its a bit lengthy this encompasses almost 3-5 years worth of events 

 So when I was in High school I decided to date someone who was part of the same swim team as i was (it was a Co/ed organization) . About a year into our relationship i figured out she was cheating on me with somebody else and that somebody didn't know she was cheating on them either . so i reached out to the man and we both broke up with her at the same time and though I tried to refrain about speaking about the subject to anyone who wasn't family due to the pain that it made me feel to think about the other individual lets call him Matt (not real name of course) , Matt decides that breaking up isn't enough he decides that he has to tell everyone about what happened and basically make my Ex into somewhat of a pariah in our local community . (since we live in the sticks its a very small community , everyone knows everyone ) This unsurprisingly resulted in her having a whole lot of hatred for him but then when Matt decided to leave the country to get his education abroad this left me to deal with all the hatred that she still had towards us .

 by this time I thought she had forgotten me . I was in a casual relationship with another person and i believed that when the time came we would mutually break up as we had decided to go to colleges that were very far away from each other and neither of us wanted to bear that weight for 4 years or more but before i had that opportunity i received a text message During the week of Graduation from an unknown number I checked to see what enough and sure enough it was from my ex (lets call her Amy ) so Amy offers to go out for lunch on her as a way to make up for being such a hurtful person in the past and honestly I dont know if i was gullible or just stupid but I agreed . I picked her up and then we ate and after that I took her back to her apartment while we drove back she opened up about how she wanted to date me again and whether id give her a chance and i , knowing that my current relationship would end as soon as the school year ended said ""not now but if she was single after college then maybe"" i was convinced that she had changed i was so obviously wrong. (now here is where it gets crazy ) she looks at me with this massive face of spite and says nothing to me for the rest of the ride home and when we arrived she simply said thank you and left . That was the last of Amy I had heard until a few weeks into summer vacation. I had just broken up with the girl from before (lets call her Liz ) and i had just begun talking to a girl which is now over 2 years later my girlfriend . However it turns out that while time had passed and i graduated Amy had taken the time to contact EVERY. SINGLE . EX i have ever had (which at the time was three people) and tell them that I had cheated on my current partner at the time with HER , she had the whole nine yards fake Sexts (with conveniently no photos ) as well as photos of us kissing and holding hands from back when i was Dating her . and she figured now would be the perfect time to strike with this plan . She told Liz of her story and needless to say my life went very downhill very quickly it was like night and day almost my entire hometown HATED me Hated me so much because Liz was the golden child she was and Is in my opinion a good person and they couldn't believe that i had cheated on someone so great I tried to tell Liz that it wasn't true but it seemed like every time i almost succeeded Amy would hit her with another painful psychological blow needless to say she didn't believe me ...

I tried to reach out to friends and nobody believed me .. not a single one i lost every major friend i ever had .. they were all and some still are disgusted by what she said i had done . I was a swimmer and a wrestler at my local highschool so needless to say the friends i had were not many but they were people that i loved and losing them almost from day to night broke me for a while ... I received death threats in my Email.  i would get creepy voicemails and calls to my phone and i couldn't check my instagram without someone commenting about how i was a ""bastard lair "" or a ""dirty Cheater "" so I sort of caved in unto myself and deleted all of my social media for almost 2 years , i changed my phone number and got a new email address. I was utterly alone. I gained the better of 80 lbs in a year and Kept myself mostly locked indoors playing street fighter due to my own fears  I couldn't even go to church because the local church was filled with people that knew Amys family and Liz's family as well and respected them. The one time i went nobody looked me in the eye and nobody sat near me . 

I decided i would take my education as far as I could and I moved to a town about 4 hours away from home in order to Study Law . while at college i made new friends and they have been some of the greatest people i have met in my entire life and i even got into a relationship again with a person who without a shadow of a doubt has been one of the most amazing and most loving people I have ever met and i truly hope I can make a life with her eventually . I slowly but surely opened up to more people about what happened and for the first time since I moved people actually trusted me . I moved back home from the summer and 1 or two of my old friends opened up about ever since Amy started spreading her story they felt as if it wasn't right and they came to apologize for distancing themselves from me and I really almost broke down in tears of joy then . But even then its never been the same i used to be a local face because of my involvement in sports i used to have many friends and acquaintances but now if i have 5 people that care about me then i consider myself incredibly lucky . I am now halfway through to Graduating with Honors from college and then moving on to Law school . 

However through one of those friends that came back to me i learned a little sliver of information . Amy found the school that i am attending and WILL BE THERE COME FALL . Now this is where I lose sleep at night and where my heart sinks . it has been almost 4 YEARS now since I broke up with Amy and i am petrified of what she will do once she finds me since she technically hasn't done anything ""illegal"" or ""wrong"" then i really do not now what I can do. I have struggled so so hard to bring my life out of the gutter where it once was I value and love my Partner and my friends so much but i feel as if this situation has taken my life completely prisoner and now that Amy has found me again i really dont know what i can do i feel like im going to lose my loved ones all over again and ... i dont know what im gonna do if she destroys my life all over again . Its very hard for me to make friends and I feel like she's come to deliver the killing blow ... any advice would really be appreciated . Thank you",10Jun2019,1
66,"Next year, I start a new journey in my life: high school. Along with starting high school, I’m starting a preparation process for high school. So far, I’ve gone to two people who were very successful in high school for advice. Luckily, they took time out of their day and gave me amazing advice which I’ve compiled on a document of mine. I’m going to live by the advice all throughout high school, since it’s extremely helpful. I’ve also written down goals for 9th grade which I plan to accomplish. I’m going to be challenging myself hard in everything I do, so my goals represent that. I’m also starting to improve my reading/writing skills more, and I plan to get to know a few people over the summer going to my high school. In high school, I’ll be joining theatre, debate, hockey (already play), baseball (used to play), I’ll be aiming to start two clubs, and I’m already in some advanced classes and possibly an AP course going into 9th grade, but we will see come summer time.

69,"Hi all. I would really like some help with a problem of mine. This might be a long post so please be patient with me! 
I am a 21 year old Female who was diagnosed with depression and Anxiety at 13. For 7 years I took Prozac or Fluoxetine for my mental health disorders and it helped a great deal! When I was 19 I got pregnant and promptly stopped taking all medication (40mg of Prozac and Methotrexate for my auto immune disorder which made me have alot of inflammation in my eyes I had surgery on the right one at 16) Anyways, after I had the procedure abortion done my life went back to normal but I did not get back on Prozac. Fast forward to last October and I started again because O was seeing signs of my depression and anxiety growing again but I freaked out the 4th day I was on it. I'm not sure what changed in me. I was taken off and given Cymbalta and that was the worst experience of my life. I took it for one week and had literally every side effect and the withdrawal was hell. Three weeks in bed but I survived. My doctor then prescribed me Lexapro and I am horrified to take it. I am so scared I will lose more time because of side effects or It will make things worse so I havent taken it yet but things are getting so so bad now. I cant stay where I am without any meds but I'm so scared to take the lexapro. Both of my biological sisters take it and never had any side effects and four of my friends report the same but what I'm reading online scares me. I'm very sensitive to meds so I worry. My doc also gave me Ativan as needed for panic attacks which I dont mind taking but I dont want to take too much and I worry if I take it I'll be freaking out the whole time. I cant take time off work to adjust to this drug I have a very demanding work life and schedule and dont know what to do!!",10Jun2019,1

72,"(Throwaway because I dont want my friends to know yet.)

Let me start of by saying that I [18]M have had feelings for my teacher [24]F for about a year. After I left school about 6 months ago, I decided that even if It was weird, I needed to tell her I had feelings for her. She asked to meet up to talk about it, I agreed at we met up at a coffee shop. After talking for over 2 hours she told me she felt the same way. We have been together since (give or take a week or so). 

So this is where I ask for advice. She wants us to come out as a couple, which doesnt bother me, but my parents dont know about us. So how do I tell them, without it seeming weird? 

Any advice is welcome, thanks. (Also Im going to say this now, if you think this isnt right for us to be dating or whatever, I dont care. We are both adults, and I do really like this woman. So I dont care if you think its wrong).",10Jun2019,0
73,"1. What happened

First I should explain that /r/legaladvice has never allowed a post to stay up.  The give me bogus reasons for taking it down, ignore direct messages (which are what the removals instruct you to do), and have even muted me and blocked me for posting, for direct messaging them about it politely.  I think it's because this is about the government, and is sometimes complex.

I got beaten up by a Sheriffs deputy.  I was forced into unconsciousness via a ""carotid hold"" / rear naked choke, and then at some point the deputy shifted his hand that was on the back of my head to against his other fist to give himself additional force in squeezing/crushing my neck.  I regained consciousness, and he continuously squeezed/crushed for another estimated 4-6 minutes.  He also had one knee on top of my kidney area on my back.

The cause of this occurring was that I replied ""I'd prefer not to answer that without an attorney present"" in response to an intake question in a jail.  I was in jail for going into a construction site and looking at the architecture.  I had already left without taking or damaging everything.  I had just pulled off the road to have a piss behind some trees and I'd been driving a while so walked around a bit to relax my legs.  Like I said I had already left the construction area when I was apprehended by the police, and hadn't taken or damaged anything, and was headed back towards my car when they apprehended me.

Anyway, after I said ""I'd prefer not to answer that without an attorney present,"" the deputy replied, ""Fine, I'm done, go back to the waiting area.""  This jail had a big open waiting area with a TV and several rows of chairs.  So I said ""Okay,"" got up, and started walking back to the waiting area.  When I was halfway there, she shouted out ""Actually you know what go to the holding cell.""

I turned calmly, saw that she had gotten up and was walking around the desk, and the deputy from the desk next to hers had gotten up also and was following her.  I didn't do anything.  It was an awkward situation to be punished for something like that, and it was also awkward because she and the other deputy were walking quickly towards me obviously with some intention and didn't stop or hesitate at all.

The first deputy, the female, walked around behind me, opposite of the holding cells.  At this point the holding cells were in front of me, and I was totally willing to just cooperate and not complain or anything.  I didn't think anything of the deputy walking behind me opposite of the holding cells.  Suddenly the deputy grabbed my wrist and yanked my arm, and slightly twisted my arm as she yanked it.  She was also yanking at about 160 degrees away from the direction of the holding cells, from the opposite side of the holding cells, from behind me. I am trying to be up front and honest about this, and I did have a slight reflex.  I retracted and untwisted my arm, and turned my body about 30 degrees, in order to untwist my arm.  I did not move my left hand or arm at all, and I did not extend any part of my body toward the deputy or anyone at this or any other point in time.  

I quickly mentally processed what was going on, and totally relaxed, and said ""Okay.""  Then the second deputy put his arm around my neck and his other hand against the back of my head, and lifted me up and leaned me backwards, and the last thought I had before losing consciousness was that the best thing to do would be to not struggle at all, to demonstrate that I'm not fighting or anything.

I woke up on the ground, on my stomach.  My right arm was still being held with both hands by the first deputy and was in complete control.  My head was turned to my left.  The second deputy was squeezing my neck hard.  I remember seeing that he had shifted his left hand from the back of my head to against his right fist to provide additional force.  His right knee was on top of my left kidney area on my back.  I could not move my left arm.  It was pinned under the deputy's left leg between his ankle and shin.  This lasted for about 4-6 minutes until I was finally handcuffed and carried into the holding cell.

This happened right underneath a surveillance camera, however I was told later that the CCTV system in the jail doesn't have recording technology.  Several other deputies came out.  At that point, the deputy choking me etc. said ""Give me your arm"".  At that point I couldn't breathe, or speak.  He waited about 10 seconds, and then repeated what he said calmly, then waited another 10 seconds or so, and repeated it again.  Then another deputy walked around to the side he was on, and kind of pointed to my left arm pinned under the guy's leg, and said ""I think his arm under ... "" and pointed to my arm.  The deputy choking me moved his left leg, and repeated to give him my arm, and I moved my arm out.  He then repeated himself again.  I lifted my left arm up off the ground.  I was on my stomach and still breathe at all for I would estimate 90% of this time, including at this point in time.  He still did not take my arm.  

I then took my left hand and tried to wedge it in between his arm and my neck.  At that point he released his left hand and took my left arm with his left hand.  I was then handcuffed and carried into the holding cell.  One officer had a tazer pointed at me, and said ""If you move you will be tazered.  Do you understand?""  I replied ""Yes.  I don't want any problems.""  And she left and the holding cell was locked.

A nurse came by and inspected my wrist through the holding cell door for about 1 minute I would estimate about 5-10 minutes later.  I requested to see the nurse again, because my kidneys hurt, and my neck.  I was not allowed to see the nurse for another 2-3 hours, even though he was walking around, seemed unbusy, and was chatting with employees.  He inspected my kidney area on my back visually, and did nothing.  

The deputy who had assaulted me had a huge, absolutely delighted grin on his face for the next 15 minutes after the altercation occurred, and then he and the other deputy involved in the altercation left and I didn't see them again.

I asked another deputy for the name of the deputy who had assaulted me and he refused.  I was given paper and pen, and wrote the events down and gave the paper to the deputy, slipped it under the door, and he stood there reading it for about 30 seconds, and then said it was mine, and walked away, and the paper was picked up by an inmate janitor and thrown in the garbage later.

I bailed out.  The charges were not filed by the DA.  I was advised by several attorneys to wait a year, because the DA had a year to re-open the criminal case and charge me if they wanted.  All my research indicated that I had 2 years to file a suit, and the statute of limitations was two years.  I called about 25 different attorneys about this, and very very few would talk to me, and the only ones who actually talked to me either told me I wouldn't find a lawyer for this because there's no money in it, and it's incredibly difficult, or wanted $300/hour for consultation and then when I said I'd be willing to do that and asked about their experience referred me to someone else, who in turn didn't return my call.  

&amp;#x200B;

2. Backstory

The question I was asked was ""Are you on probation.""  I was.  I was on probation because I had been maliciously prosecuted without evidence, or probable cause.  The DA in that case literally said at court ""There is no evidence"" and ""We don't know what happened"" to the judge.  However the DA refused to dismiss the charges, because then they would be liable for malicious prosecution according to the case laws (Heck v Humphrey, etc.).

This was literally the 5th incident where I was victim of extremely serious (as in somewhere around life threatening) criminal misconduct or violence on the part of police or other government officials.  That, for my adult life, at the time, worked out to once every 3 years on average.  

I would estimate my chances of surviving the last incident to be about 60-70%, and the chances of getting out of the incident before that even less.  My life expectancy is ridiculously low

That's why I want to sue.  Not for the money.  Not because I care at all about winning.  But because this is crazy.  If you join Facebook groups about this you'll see that stuff like this happens a lot.  As in almost every day there's some out of this world horrific story about cops doing just bizarre sick things to people that I can't in good conscience even repeat here, because they're well beyond the limits vulgar and graphic and profane.  And they generally get away with it.

A lot of people don't believe it, and want to generally blame the victims.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Prologue

I started the process of filing a claim with the County.  In California there is a 6 month deadline to file it with the County.  This information was plain not available at the time, and several lawyers and other legal professionals stated I had 2 years to file.  I have two years to file a federal civil claim.  I was up front about that, and mentioned that to every government official I corresponded with.

They had me to talk to the Independent Law Enforcement Review Board.  ILERB had me talk to Internal Affairs.  Internal Affairs had me meet them at the Sheriffs, they searched me, they focused solely on my behavior, and attitude, \*after\* the event.  Admitted that they hadn't even talked to anyone besides me yet, and pretty much said they didn't think either of the deputies did anything wrong.

I emailed ILERB and the director promised to follow the investigation very closely.  The director subsequently resigned, and there are local news stories about how he clashed with the Sheriffs department, and thought their investigations weren't fair, that a 13 year old was killed several years ago, prompting the formation of the review board.  He never reviewed my case.  

After going through about 6 other people, I finally was directed to a woman from the ""Risk Management"" division of the County Supervisors office.  She had me meet with an 'analyst' from her office, who literally met me in the lobby of her office, in front of the clerk, and she had no authority, could not answer any of my questions, or tell me anything, or give me any kind of response about anything.

I filed my claim, emailed the woman I had met with.  This was about 5-8 weeks after I had met with Internal Affairs.  Literally 2 days after I filed my claim, I received an email from the Sheriffs dept. stating they were exonerating the officers.  I immediately emailed the woman I met with asking for the claim to be put on hold.  It was ignored.  3 business days (including a weekend) after that email, a letter was postmarked to me rejecting my claim, citing no other reason than because it was late.  It also did not respond to anything I said in my request to file late, which was detailed.

I emailed the woman who had directed me to the woman I met with, the same one who had evaluated my claim and rejected it.  I asked her if she had spoken with &lt;name&gt; before evaluating my claim, and if she had gotten my request to put my claim on hold.  

She responded ""I'm sorry about the situation with &lt;name&gt;,"" did not answer my questions, and then invited me in for a meeting, but wording it as to imply that she was acquiescing to my request for a meeting...

I replied ""I would be willing to come in for a meeting.  What is your goal of meeting?""  I asked if she was willing to put the claim on hold.

She replied that I had asked for a meeting, and that my claim had been rejected.  And didn't reply to any more of my emails.

The DA's office refuses to take a report from me.  The Office of the Attorney General refers me to the DA's office, and refused to take a report from me four times, before finally allowing me to send them a report about this, but requires proof that both the DA and Sheriffs office ""can't help me"".  The DA's office also refused to let me apply for a victim's advocate.  

The first time I spoke to the DA's office, they also suggested that another law enforcement agency will sometimes take a report, and had a specific term for it, but I forget the term.  I have the name of the agent I spoke to.  So I called the police.  The police literally 3-way called the Sheriffs, asked if they would take a call from me, and then hung up.  And then I reported the incident.

The Internal Affairs officer called me the next morning at exactly 7am, seemingly for no other reason that to express his frustration to me.  I was polite with him.  He said that there were 4 deputy witnesses besides the two involved in the altercation and they all said that had been combative.  The other deputy witnesses were not there until after I had been forced into unconsciousness.  I do not believe that all 6 deputies would lie about this.  And if so, it's not that hard to detect.

I also spoke to the IA supervisor who signed the exoneration.  He literally did not dispute any of the major facts of the event.  I had an hour-long respectful conversation with him, but he continuously blatantly tried to misconstrue what I said to twist things in favor of the officers.

83,"I’m throwing a surprise party for my girlfriends birthday. It’s pretty rare that all her friends are in one spot (everyone lives all over the country and they all travel for work constantly). But I got a group of her best friends to clear their schedules and rent a house in the country for 4 days to do a long birthday weekend. One friend is coming from another country.

Do I still need to buy her a birthday present?

The part is happening the day after her birthday (because schedules), so for her birthday I figured we would go out to a nice dinner and I would say her gift is that we’re going to have a little adventure starting the next day. Is this enough?",10Jun2019,1

85,"Title pretty much says it all, but I will add some context to the question.

I'm living at home, getting to save an enormous amount of money, and am in a good spot there. 

The issue I am having is the workload required for this job, and how it's affecting me outside of the office. Since day 1, there hasn't been a day that I have not worked overtime, and most days around ~12-13 hours. I'm lucky if I can find time to go to the gym, and most days it's get home from work, eat, finish up the last little bit of work I still have sitting, shower, and go to bed.

86,"I auditioned for my school's dance team last week. Not only is it a dance team, but it is also a class at my high school which fulfills my graduation requirements of a PE course and a Art/Performing Arts course. I have done pep and cheer for the past seven years. I was in the dance PE class during my sophomore year (currently a senior) which is the dance course available to freshmen and sophomores only, while the dance rep class is available to only juniors and seniors. At tryouts, I felt very confident in my audition. While not perfect by any means, it was certainly satisfactory. The dance rep class is made up of students who like to dance, not professional dancers or kids who take actual dance classes, and so they're not looking for the best dancers. The next day, the list of people who made it was posted. My name was not there. I was completely shocked. My friends and everyone around me were shocked and confused. People who struggled with the choreography during auditions made the team, while I did not. I was so confused as to why I didn't make the team. Later that day, I emailed the dance rep teacher asking for an explanation as to why I was selected. The following day, she responded back to me. According to her email, I wasn't placed into the class not based on my audition, but based on the teacher feedback/recommendations she received. Now I was even more shocked. I sent an email back to her explaining my confusion, and explained that I'm a hardworking student in multiple AP classes and that I have never caused any sort of trouble in my classes or have ever disrespected my teachers. In fact, I am quite shy and so I typically refrain from talking in my classes. I also asked her if she could tell me what was said about me in the feedback she received. After telling my friends about it, who are in my classes, they were absolutely confused as well. 

On the audition form, we were asked to provide the names our English teachers. With that in mind, I assumed the dance rep teacher asked my English teacher for feedback. My English teacher was one of my favorite teachers ever. She even told me that I was in the top 10 students she has ever taught. However, one of my friends told me that the teacher told her second period class (I am in first period) that the two people she won't miss are me and another student. I was honestly so heartbroken. I don't know why she hates me so much. It's like one day she loves me and the next she can't stand me. I truthfully cannot find any reason for her to dislike me so much. I'm not some delusional brat either lol. I am a good student. I emailed my English teacher asking if she gave feedback on me and why she didn't recommend me. She replied to me in a couple of hours and told me that ""I gave \[dance rep teacher\] some honest feedback on multiple students, but ultimately, it’s her program and the decision is up to her. I would recommend you reaching out to her for more specifics."" 

I was honestly baffled. I asked many of my classmates in my English class if I have ever talked rudely to our teacher or caused any trouble. All of them said no and even believed I was one of her favorites in her class. 

The dance rep teacher has not replied to me since then. I am still waiting for her response. I wouldn't be so upset about this if it was just a regular sports team or anything of that sort. However, it is a class I was planning to take. I confirmed with my high school counselor that my class schedule for next year would be conflict free, and it was. But now, without dance rep in my schedule my whole entire class schedule is thrown off and I could miss out on taking certain classes that I want, and I would have to find a new PE course and Art course. My schedule included 5 AP classes and dance rep, and now, I have no idea what it is going to be. 

After thinking about it with my friends, I decided that perhaps I should write an appeal letter to the school or to the dance rep teacher asking her to reconsider my placement in the class. I am honestly so conflicted. I want to appeal and I also don't want to. I know if I do, I will no longer be able to have a relationship with my English teacher who I admire a lot (but i mean she apparently already hates me so), the dance rep teacher will already judge me poorly when the school year begins if I do win the appeal, and it's pretty humiliating having to ""complain"" my way into the class. But ultimately, I want to be in the class. What should I do? What would you do? How should I go about this?

Thank you to any and all advice. Please ask any questions. :)

Note: If any of the statements above seem like I am bragging or anything like that, please know that is not my intention. I am just trying to emphasize the fact that I should not receive a ""bad"" teacher recommendation due to my behavior as a student.",10Jun2019,2

(Names will not be disclosed)

(For info, we're all the same age.)

I've been friends with S for a while, he's a really nice guy, we're been great friends for 2 years and we have a really good relationship. But, about 6 months ago I met a guy named K that was really nice to me. We were also getting along really well, and at the same time I  was spending more time with him than S, and our relationship started drifting. I don't know if its true or I was just going crazy, but I felt like S was being mean to me. I also introduced a kind of friend to S (we will call him H) and they got along really well. So while S was busy with H doing stuff, I was talking to K on different games. Eventually I thought I liked him and i'm sure I did too, but we didn't say anything. At this time I started talking to S again and since K has some stances that me and S agreed we didn't like very early on he started kind of joking about it and I was agreeing. So S basically convinces me to stop being friends with the guy. Now, he wasn't just being manipulative. And I kind of realized K was... messed up. He lived in a really bad situation, hated his parents, bragged alot, sent me some risque shit, and made me feel kind of guilty when I wasn't playing with him. He also said he had no friends besides me. We often argued about his stances on certain things but generally we got along. Now, I still like the guy, and i'm sure he wasn't REALLY trying to be manipulative - he was just generally inexperienced with social ques. So basically I agree with S and we start fucking with him, because I was ""sure"" I was done being in any kind of friendship with him. So afterwords me and S play, and I remember how great it is to play with the guy, and the same things he did when I thought he was being mean was actually just light-hearted jokes. And i'm pretty sure K was doing something to me. I start playing with H too, and we're having alot of fun. But K messaged me telling me he fucked up, he was sorry ect. And i'm overwhelmed with guilt. I feel so fucking awful, and I can't help it. I'm shaking currently. Its so confusing and I just need help here. I'm sorry if this is confusing to read. I'll clear it up in the comments.

101,"I'm new to this whole thing, but I thought I'd get some advice on how to go about it. I won't go too in-depth because, well, _time_

Ever since I was a kid, my family used to drill into me that relationships can wait or that I'm too young, too naive, to know who and what's good for me. Luckily for them, I've always been a bit of a bookworm and a studyholic, so any crush I've had [or someone has had on me] has always been pushed aside to better my studies. If I'm being honest, I've never thought much of dating until 2017-18, but that was only when more people began confessing that they liked me. 

It felt as though giving into these, erm, 'wants' would mean disobeying my family's, so I've politely declined. And I've turned down a few handsome dudes that I genuinely regret right about now [but I digress]. It also helps that my friends and I revel in the fact that we're single, but at least we have each other.

Earlier this year, however, I befriended a guy and, despite how I was raised, gave in and confessed that I had a crush on him. It wasn't a physical attraction either [he's hot, don't get me wrong]. But he's also funny, smart and quite literally the nicest guy I've ever befriended. He confessed back soon after. I pleaded with him to wait until summer, just so we could 1) get to know each other more and 2) finish our final exams. 

Hanging out with him makes me feel - dear I give into the cliche - _alive_ but each hang-out or joke or brief physical contact reminds me of my family's constant nagging to stay away from relationships. Over the past few months, he's been really understanding and won't push me to date or make our 'thing' [don't know the word yet] public until I'm ready. But at this rate, I don't think there will ever be a 'right' time.

The last few weeks have been hellish as I've tried easing them in to the idea of me dating someone. A casual 'Oh, I know a guy like that' or 'What if - hypothetically, of course - I had a boyfriend?' has been brutally shot down with threats of embarrassing or hurting me. Physically. Matters only worsen when they 1) assume I'm gay [I'm the only non-homophobe in my family] or 2) think I'm too... 'me' to have a boyfriend, yet I'm given no opportunity to change their minds!

On the upside, he's mentioned me to his mother and sisters, and I've even met his father and stepmom a few times. Even his friends and I get along, and my friends - most of which don't know we like each other - just adore his company. But at this rate, he's gonna be dating me before I ever get around to dating him.

What I wanted advice on is difficult to ascertain, but I'll try to put into words [and sorry for the long post!]

* Is it fair on him to keep things private? 
* How should I tell my family?
* Are there any funeral arrangements that I should prepare in case things go south?
* Is dating him REALLY such a bad thing to do?
* If now's not the right time, when?",10Jun2019,1

He clarified that he meant black music as in rap music and ""didn't mean to say anything mean to me."" I thought of this as a learning moment and explained that generalizing all of black music (Which consists of a majority of genres) and stating you dislike it is a racist statement and he apologized for doing that. I thought I did pretty well until another co-worker said that I was being too sensitive and shouldn't have tried to lecture him after the initial apology. He also said that I shouldn't talk back to adults like that, especially a higher up. My dad told me that I'm in the wrong for not reporting him to a higher up and that he's a racist POS.

She rolls up her sleeve and shows me and my bf a golfball sized bump on her arm. she started explaining that she's being tested for cancer and the bump was a result of a bone marrow sample that had been taken. Fast forward a few weeks, I go to Europe with this worry constantly digging at the back of my head. It scared me so much that I went into every cathedral I found and lit a candle and I prayed. Without getting into details, I don't pray. Ever. When I come back, she tells me again, 'okay, you're not allowed to cry, but I have nonhodgkins lymphoma. Don't tell anybody. ' I don't know anything about cancer or treatments. I had no idea what to ask her. At that moment, the time I had with my little sister was limited. I only had numbered days left with her. My best friend was going to be gone and she was going out in a painful and miserable way. the more we talked, the more she emphasized that nobody could know. She didn't want anyone in our family or friend group to know what was happening. So, my bf and I kept this secret for her. As time went on and the more research I did, the more questions I had for her. I kept asking to see her paperwork from the doctors. She kept giving me excuses, 'Let me change the baby's diaper and then I'll grab them.' (She had two daughters at the time. She now has four.) or ""oh ya, they are in the glove box,' and she would start digging through things trying to 'find' papers. She started telling me that she wasn't going to go through treatment. This was so upsetting. I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that she had two daughters and a family who loved her and she wouldn't try to fight it. She was just giving up. Hours of trying to convince her to at least tell our parents was pointless. I felt trapped because I had no one to talk to about this. I had no support. I needed my mom and my dad to help me through this and I couldn't figure out why she wouldn't tell them. 

One night, her bf at the time calls me and is freaking out because one of my sister's friends called him and told him that she isn't doing well and is in a hospital dying. We call all of the oncology units in our area and can't find her. I started calling her cell phone over and over. It turned out that she was at home fighting with her babydaddy. She wasn't in a hospital. She got mad at me when I started crying on the phone panicking. I had to explain to her that I was so scared because I thought she was dying and that I was sure that i had lost her. She ended up just laughing it off.

Fast forward a couple of years. We were hanging out and she says, ""Remember that one time I had the giant bump on my arm from getting my birth control out?"" At that moment we both freeze. She has an ""oh shit' moment and realizes that she just outed herself. We stopped talking after that. She still won't admit that she did anything wrong and that the problem in the relationship is my fault. Because all I want is an answer. Why did she tell me she had cancer?

For a while, I kept her secret. I didn't tell my family why we weren't talking. I picked up a therapist and was able to finally talk about it without completely breaking down every time I thought about it. I stopped telling people after I told a client and her response was anger towards me for being stupid for not talking to her. So, I shut down again.   

Eventually, I told my mom. She has been completely neutral and very supportive of me. She has no idea why my sister would lie about something like that. 

Every once in a while my sister and I will text back and forth fighting about how I want a relationship and all I want is answers to why she told me she has cancer. She turns it around on me telling me it's my fault and that I think I'm better than everyone else, or that the family doesn't give a shit, or she's trying to have a relationship, but I'm not willing to talk. Basically, at the end of every conversation, I have a full blown panic attack and can't function. My boyfriend and a close friend think that it's a toxic relationship and shes narcissistic. 

What do I do?

TL;DR My sister told me she had cancer. After a couple of years of trying to get answers and eventually proof, I caught her in her lie. She doesn't have cancer. Every time I ask her why she told me she had cancer he gets defensive and turns everything onto me and tells me it's my fault our relationship is the way it is.

116,"I'm gonna start this off by saying I believe I have depression but I've never talked to a therapist/gotten an actual diagnosis.

So I'm 18, just graduated high school and have been in summer break for a few days now. I don't have a job. I still haven't taken my permit test or even been in the driver seat of a car. I even have trouble doing the bare minimum like showering, getting dressed daily, brushing teeth, etc. every day. Instead I'll browse Reddit, watch Youtube or distract myself with videogames until I go to sleep and do the same thing all over again the next day. I haven't even finished completing important financial aid forms I need to begin picking classes in college. This past year my grades slipped significantly for the first time due to procrastination or me just straight up not doing assignments. The thing is, I really do need to be doing these things but I just don't? It's hard to explain, I know why I need to stop procrastinating and ""get my act together"" but when the time comes to do said acts I just push it off for another time. I even promised my favorite teacher I'd try and learn programming over summer but I haven't even done anything related to programming (my passion) for months now.

I was having dinner with my family and I noticed that my dad was chewing a little loud and with his mouth open so I nicely asked him to stop. Well since that time it has definitely been a downfall. So many noises bother me and they typically have to do with the mouth or nose. I can’t describe the anger I feel when someone is snoring or just breathing out of their nose. I literally can’t fall asleep if someone is breathing weird out of their nose. Also I noticed is that I’m not mad by everyone who chews loud it’s only certain people for example: my parents and brothers. I’ve googled it before and I know there is a name for why I feel like this and get annoyed by chewing noises but I just don’t know what to do. Does anyone else feel this way?

123,"I'm young, 15 male. I like to play video games and listen/make music and be with friends, have laughs and fun times while gaming. That's basically my life. School I literally don't care about at all, considering in the future my dreams are to become a gamer YouTuber and a musical artist, so I tell myself those things don't require an insane education, which is why I don't consider school to be important. Also as a person I feel like I lack common sense. There's simple stuff that someone my age should know that I don't. I don't really go out of the house much, only place I go is school and all I do everyday is play video games. So maybe that's why I lack common sense. Shit I don't know the president of my country, how to put gas in car, neighborhoods and places in my country (even tho been living here 5 years). And the list goes on for stuff I don't know. Yesterday I was talking with my 2 buddies and they were talking about places in our country and I was confused not even knowing what they were talking about until they told me.

&amp;#x200B;

 To be honest, most days I'm good and normal and try to stay positive, and I think about how good of a person I'd be in the future if I stay positive. But then I think about the fact that I fucking lack common sense, and that's something needed to be able to cope with life, and I get depressed and go back to being negative. And the thing is I'm too lazy to fix myself and fix my problems, which is why I think to ruin my fucking life. I always think to myself : I could live a positive life living the dreams I want and have a wealthy life, or I can be depressed and do drugs and be with the wrong crowd. Of course when I'm in a good mood I wanna be the positive side and when bad I wanna be negative. But I honestly feel if I'm this fucking stupid then I deserve to waste my life. My family give me everything, good education, food on the table and everything and I'm wasting it, wish I can trade out my life with my best friend whose family is poor and he really wants to get a good education. I don't seem to feel sad when I think about how I'm wasting my parents money on school for some reason. I always wanted to try LSD acid and other drugs. I decided I'd do this only if I waste my fucking life. LSD interests me as it's an escape from reality and you can set yourself in a different world basically, helping me cope with the  negativity in the future. But at this point I haven't decided who I want to be but I really feel i was meant to be a fucking bad person.

125,"So I frequent a bar and me and this girl have got to know each other, she is married and although I sorta know her husband I wouldn’t say we are friends. We don’t even hang out when we are at the bar just casual acquaintances due to fact we go to the same place. 

The night in question her and I ended up talking for a good portion of the night. She started telling me about how she isn’t satisfied and that she finds me attractive. I haven’t been in a relationship for a couple years so the flattery was definitely welcome. The night continued and than she pulled me in and started to make out with me. I didn’t stop it hell I’m pretty sure I leaned in after kissing she pulled away and said something along the lines of “damnit I hoped that was going to be bad.”  We both left this sort of hanging and I ended the night shortly after as things felt awkward. I wanted to deal with the fact that she was right it felt good but also fuck I’m sure this is a timebomb her and I just started a clock on. 

The following night at the same bar I’m pretty trashed by the time they got into the bar. So she comes over we start to talk again and she can tell I’m fucked up so she offers me a ride home her husband agrees we take off and.....nothing happened mainly cause I was pretty trashed and was not in the right frame to talk about it nor pursue it so gave her a hug and went inside. Now this last wk or so has been rough trying to figure out wtf I should do especially since haven’t even had a chance to see each other and like I said casual friends due to establishment of choice.

127,"The relationship I have with him is hard to explain, but long story short we met on the PS4 and I befriended him because I friended everyone at the time. My other friends made a few friendly jokes about me but he keeps repeating them and he has repeated them for over a year. Every time I get online he invites me because he is only ever on the ps4. He lives in a house with his brother and his brothers girlfriend, and always complains that his brother makes him do chores and urges him to get a job. I never speak against it even though he is living there for free and should help around the house. It’s to the point where I’m always in offline mode because if I don’t join he’ll message me on the PS4 and on WhatsApp. Every time we hang out I’ve started to notice he only makes fun of me. I’m not offended by any of it, but it’s just never interesting or fun to talk to him and I’m never happy when we talk.

My best ps4 friend is also always invited by him, so if I’m trying to hang out with her, then he’s there. She’s ALWAYS in offline mode, so if I’m hanging out with her, I have to be in offline mode too or else he’ll join. It’s gotten to the point where on Overwatch he clicks on my offline profile to see if it says “Join Group”, so if we are playing without him he can join. A lot of the time it seems like she doesn’t want him there either, but I’m genuinely not sure because sometimes it seems like she enjoys him there. 

I should also mention that he was a toxic boyfriend to one of my good friends and kept taking money from her account thinking she wouldn’t notice. Once he kept asking when her next paycheck was (she was SIXTEEN at the time and STILL sent gifts and money from her minimum wage paycheck to her 19 year old boyfriend), so I stepped in, and he yelled at me. You could tell during the end of their relationship she was very unhappy and uncomfortable around him. She knew he would threaten suicide if she broke up with him, but I eventually convinced her that she was never going to be happy in that manipulative relationship and she wasn’t responsible for his happiness. I’m 14 and he’s 19, which is also weird to me, but it’s not that weird since all my close ps4 friends are 17+. It strikes me as weird because of how clingy he is to a 14 year old girl. This isn’t to say he’s a pervert, I just don’t want to be responsible for hanging out with a 19 year old that I don’t enjoy spending tine with. It kinda disgusts me to be around him after that whole toxic relationship, but lots of my online friends are out doing college shit in June, so I play Apex with him when I’m bored now.

130,"Hey there, I'm looking for some advice on how to convince my brother to make some changes regarding his health/even his outlook on life in general. He used to be obese, but after he got a trainer and worked out for a year and made better diet choices he is down to a good weight, but he's picked up on some bad habits. I NEVER would have thought he would smoke cigarettes, he was always so against it but he tried it with a coworker and these days he goes through probably half a pack a day, often smoking two or more back to back(esp when hes drunk). He found a coffee shop that gives him a nitro brew with FOUR espresso shots added, and I swear he just does it to feel the caffeine bc there's no way he actually enjoys the taste even though if you ask him he'll say he does. The other day he said he drank TWO bottles of wine earlier that night. He thought he wasn't that drunk but I could tell since he was talking so much(though he wasn't slurring or anything). 

He refuses to work out, saying that he's burnt out from his job, and thinks that eating less to supplement the alcohol he drinks/the junk food he eats is fine, but its obviously contributing to his laziness.(By no means would I say he's an alcoholic, but he's just too excessive with substances when he does use them). I just know he'll be contempt with keeping up this lifestyle and when I ask him whats new he never has anything to say, when I ask how he's doing he/ll say vague things like ""oh good"" or ""eh whatever, tell me about yourself"". It's pretty apparent he's a bit depressed/bored but I don't know what to do about it.

I'm also a devout Muslim, and that has played a big part in my life choices and the way I navigate the world.

I just recently graduated high school, and although I was happy for myself, I felt I didn't achieve what I wanted to or even where I needed to be in terms of academic achievement or socially. I didn't join any clubs, had sparse yet close friends, and I wasn't graduating with honors. I applied to my nearest university, and I got accepted, but as the summer grew closer, I realized I have no passion in life.

I love to do many things like writing and studying works, but I have no idea how I'd make that into a career without being unstable. Another unreliability in my life is that everyone in family marries young, from my grandmother at 18 and mother at 19. I don't expect that early especially since I'm only 17 and times have changed, but I expect probably 22 or 23 at the latest, and if my future husband lives overseas, that would be another challenge.

134,"Me, my girlfriend, and my mom just went camping this past weekend and here's some backstory:

Me and this girl were set up on a blind date by this girl's own mother and our first date was simply a movie. On said date, my mom had dropped me off and also met my girlfriend for the first time. She got a picture of us together, introduced herself, etc and after I asked her about being an exclusive couple on our second date, me and my mom set up a camping trip for the three of us, since my mom wanted to spend more time with her and she's also an EMT who's very into the great outdoors, so it seemed like the ideal situation. My girlfriend had never been camping or fishing before and I also thought it to be a good way to get her into it and try something new.

And on the camping trip itself, she didn't seem very into it. There were times when I'd be trying to set up camp or prepare fishing lines and she would just be awkwardly standing around and staring into space. She wouldn't be offering to help me or interacting with my mom or anything. And I got my hopes up about the two of us snuggling by the campfire, but she just awkwardly sat on her own little rock and just stared in the flames. I put my arm around her, but she didn't reciprocate in anyway.

And when I told my friend about what I did, he just simply stared at me and said ""You're fucking weird."" I asked him what he was talking about, but he just simply said ""No, I'm not talking to you. You're a strange man."" And not only is he pissed off at me for some reason, but my girlfriend also seemed to be a bit distant because of the trip.

138,"So my gf and I have been together for 1+ year now. I need you folks to chime in if I should hold onto it?

Both of us are currently college students. We barely have arguments on anything. I adapted to the small changes she made me do like dressing up more etc. i go full force into making myself to appease her but by no means im some weird submissive guy lol. She is also religious and I even started to attend them weekly with her when I can. But some of the down side about her is that she has this particular guy that keeps hitting on her and I confronted him already. Thinking that my gf would block him. But she doesn’t block him. She continues to treat him like trash but he insists he is the bf. I don’t understand why she can’t simply block him and focus on me? She insists that guy is a nobody. But i said if thats the case why can’t she block him? I might be naive but i trust her that she hasn’t done anything that cross boundaries. Time to time we break up and make up alot because of this. 

So that is one of the main problem.

So recently i started to bust my butt off working full time to afford a vacation to her country. Her family by now treats me like part of the family. We plan our future together or dream of it at least.

But working full time also put us at a distant because. I work evening to night. Then we have this binging thing going on for a show we are watching. So i thought if i catch up the episodes at night since she is sleeping. I got something to talk to her when im at work on break. But somehow everything backfired on me. She said you have these set time frames and be in bed by then. And i sleep all morning (she is a morning person). But i explain to her that i watch the shows to share some sort of connection with her since i work fulltime. That this job is temp (seasonal) until i go back to school and have more time with her. While having the money for our vacation.

143,"I’m an 18F. I just graduated high school about three weeks ago. 

I don’t know if I want to go to college anymore, I know that I’m not in a healthy mindset to go to college and, I’m not exaggerating here, I have no money to go to a cheap community college. 

I don’t want to be over my head in student loans at 18-22. I’d like to take a year off and see if I could handle college in the spring of 2020 or the fall, but everyone I know tells me not to do that. 

I feel like that if I don’t go to college that I won’t be able to be successful in a career and that I won’t be able to support a future family. A lot of my teachers say that college isn’t for everyone and that you can be successful without it but I hear so many people say the opposite. 

I also have no idea on what I want to do with my life. 

My friends have gotten accepted to their colleges and already know their majors. I feel like I’m already way behind on the entire thing and I don’t know what to do honestly. 

I feel like if I don’t go to college, I’ll be a failure and a disappointment.",10Jun2019,4

145,"me and my boyfriend of almost 3 years broke up in august. we broke up due to my mental state as i tried to end my life a month prior. he told me that he would “lose me either way,” if i were to myself or if he were to leave me. so there was no point in staying. 

i loved him deeply. and i hate myself for still loving him. even though he does not love me the same way.

i’ve always been told that i will get better. that i will not think about him as much anymore. that i will find someone new, that someone will love me regardless of my mental state or depressive episodes. but will i? 

i’m young. but i feel like i will never heal from him. i’m trying so hard to forget, to forgive, to move on... but i can’t. i haven’t texted him in about 6-7 months so i feel like that’s progress, but every day i get the urge to text and just ask him how he is even though i don’t want to know. the urge pricks at my fingertips. i just want to hear his voice again. see his face again. 

i’m constantly wondering if he’s thinking and feeling the same way that i am. i know he’s not but the possibility eats away at me. i want him back but i know i can’t have him back. he doesn’t want me. he doesn’t love me. and i know that. i’ve acknowledged that. but i’m having difficulty accepting it.

146,"I got out of really really bad relationship around two years ago. 

I was 18 when we met and 25 when I left for good. 

It was a lot of manipulation and control. A lot of lies and substance abuse in their end.  Missing debit cards random tangents ... the rest I found out when I broke up with him. The money he borrowed or stole and the substance abuse ... He also told people he needed to borrow money to help my family out which was never true. 


It got bad enough that the final time I left it was because his mom sat me down and said you can’t do this to yourself ... I owe her a lot. 


My question is moving forward. What are other red flags? 

It makes me nervous to think I could wake up next to another monster again. The whole ordeal was so shameful that I hid it from my dad because i didn’t want him to know what my ex did to me and how bad things got but then my dad died. 


So when I’m ready to get back out in the dating scene... what red flags  am I looking for? I never want to be a man hater or falsely accuse a guy of being something he’s not but I don’t want to go through what I went through again.

I have been staying with my friend for a small while and we share a bathroom together but no matter how many times I have this discussion, he constantly pisses on the toilet seat and around the floor.

Its become more than an annoyance at this point, every time I go in there, I have to literally use baby wipes and then wash my hands before I use the toilet then after, if I continue scrubbing my hands, they will soon be skeleton hands.

I had the final straw tonight, I walked into the bathroom half asleep after getting out of bed and without even turning the light on, I dropped my knickers and sat on the bowl and was immediately covered in pee and then when I pulled up my panties, he had pissed on the floor as well so they were soaked, I had to literally have a shower then and there

I mean WTF how hard it is to aim one of those things, does it literally come to life and start trying to Irish dance while dudes are trying to pee.

When he comes home from work tonight, he is getting a yelled at cause I am very annoyed and emotional right now.

We weren’t perfect before, but we thought being together would help smooth things out, if anything it made things worse. He quit his job due to stress, and we are around each other a lot, since I have no where else to game but the same small bedroom.

Growing up, my parents never had sit down talks, but a lot of yelling, screaming, and the cops being called. I deal with anxiety and depression because of my childhood and other events that have happened. 

Basically, I’m asking how to approach future situations better. I jump the gun, I make demands and beg for apologies, when I could just talk things out, but my brain automatically jumps to blowing things out of proportion.

One thing led to another and ended up snap chatting  some guys nudes after some *talk* and I regret my decision so much. I’ve never set any before, let alone to STRANGERS FROM OMEGLE and I’m terrified. It was such a spur of the moment thing and I didn’t even think things through.

154,"My major is Graphic Design. In short every time something is due I look at it a competition. Since there’s no test and everyone has different pieces they turn in...it’s all subjective. Though I don’t care to be the best I strive for top 3 submission out of about 15 people. My theory is... this is what a client says is the guidelines which is given to other artist (classmates) and we do our best for them to want to choose our art work. My favorite day is the critique day when we present. It’s like a boxing match. No one knows what you’re bringing and boom put that on the wall. Within a couple seconds you know if you did well or not. Some classes they’d go random, while one class he started with best to worst drawing.  The way I think is.. what is the project...what are my classmates going to do...now how can I make it my own and really different. Tomorrow I start summer class which involves making art on the computer. Which I’ve done prior to college for like 2 years.

I definitely know my pieces in design weren’t crazy like the previous. My last semester was more chill than the first. Still stressful with deadlines but it was more about getting through it. With a B or higher of course. I know no one thinks like this. The main thing I think this is because it’s me, my name, and my face attached to it almost like an extension.

Her mom kicked her out and she is living in her boyfriends car and has been for a couple months. I’ve been urging her to look for a job but she seems to be under a lot of stress as it is. She has pretty severe bipolar disorder and it affects her life and pretty major ways yet whenever she has an episode she refuses to go to a hospital. She now has Nexplanon in her arm so she is unable to take the medication she once was, and cannot take anymore until she’s 18 due to her insurance plan. Long story short she has been hanging out with me every day and although I personally thoroughly enjoy her company, my family doesnt want her at the house everyday any longer. I can completely sympathize with this sentiment but I feel as if I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I love her so dearly but I’m not sure how to help her.

156,"So my mom's 79 and pretty spry and with it. Like she still does heavy yard work and could until very recently drive.

Unfortunately she had a bad seizure last week, it's a remnant of a stroke she had 5 years ago due to a doctor's mistake. Now she can't drive for 6 months.

She already had to stop walking long distances because the tendons on the top of her feet get sore. And to be honest, she really didn't drive very much. Usually I'd drive her wherever she needed to go. We just had to jumpstart her car because it had been sitting so long the battery went flat.

So my mom is super frustrated. She needs cataract surgery, can't drive, is supposed to be taking it easy. She hates the iPad she has, wishes for a desktop computer like she had when she was working. 

She just feels trapped. I don't blame her. On the 19th I'm taking her to go see her neurologist and get papers signed for her to use a free bus service our town has, so if she wants to go out she can. But she's really upset.

I don't know what to say or what to do to make this better for her. I let her know that I'll take her anywhere she needs to go, but she doesn't want me to always feel like I have to be turning down plans with friends to drive her around.

I don't really want to explain but as a hint: I was really shy and pressured by my friends to talk to him. He was also shy and awkward. I took his hesitation as disinterest. I also felt like it wasn't time and he wasn't ready to talk to me yet or start a relationship. So I walked away. 

I have a scholarship to school and can't ruin my grades. When I am hurt emotionally I have no motivation for anything. I didn't want to be told he didn't want a relationship at the moment and be hurt. So I walked away and cut my loses. I did it so I could focus on school. 

My friends pressured me because they felt like. ""It was fate"" and that ""I needed to talk to him as soon as possible"" I felt that if he was ready to talk to me he would come and talk to me. As a shy person, I take my time to go talk to someone until I'm ready to put myself out there.

168,"Partner and I moved here a year ago to try something new. I work remotely, they were offered a job in town. We both took small pay cuts to move in to our current roles, but we figured that was worth it for a new adventure. 

A year in, the job my partner was offered is not as promised; let's just say it was a bit of a bait-and-switch. The job causes them significant anxiety and is one they should leave sooner than later. My own job is a real roller coaster; high turnover, plenty of hand-wringing about the company's financial future &amp; worrying about layoffs, and the apparent likelihood I don't have a future to move up at my current company are all weighing on me. Furthermore, as I wrap up grad school this fall, I want to take advantage of by what all accounts is a decent job market for people in my profession. 

For the last 6 months, I busted my butt to find a job locally, hoping I could root myself. I got involved locally with a couple of volunteer gigs that provided me with an outlet. The catch-22 in both of them is that my job, being a bit wacky, limits my ability to deepen those commitments by diverting my attention from them and requiring me to be ""on call"" on off-hours; also, the neverending grad program I'm in saps my time and energy. I was hoping I could land a local job so I could feel like I was really part of the community, start making more friends, &amp; feel like I could be here long term. It's become pretty apparent that the most one can make here in my profession is about $10,000 less than what I make now, which would make achieving our goals of owning a home and traveling a little (at least to see our families) quite difficult.

We are also quite a ways away from our families in our current town. At first, this wasn't a big deal. After some deaths in the family over the past year, we are re-thinking where we want to be, and have decided we want to live within an hour of the towns we grew up in/where most of our immediate families live in. Problem is, they are at least 1,000 miles away. 

It isn't a big deal for me to up and look for a new job, since I WFH and can plant myself somewhere for a while to apply for and interview at firms locally. It is an issue for my partner, who is not allowed to WFH and is looking for work from over 1,000 miles away. They had an opportunity at their old org, but were a bit too upfront about their relocation needs (not money, just time; they wanted to be able to stay the summer and work remotely and relocate fully in the fall); I suspect this made the hiring manager skittish. My partner has since come around on not feeling the need to be here the whole summer, and hopefully there will be another opportunity at their old org to join. Still, I am nervous for their chances looking for a job from a great distance, and their profession is a bit more niche than mine; I don't want them to quit without something lined up, but we also don't want to do another winter here (both our anxieties were VERY bad here last winter), and I don't want to keep renewing the lease on our piece of shit apartment/definitely don't want to rent from another one of the shitbag property management firms in town.

I've taken a break from my volunteer gigs for the summer as work has gotten busier and want to be able to maximize my free time to search for new jobs. Being in my town but not feeling like I have time to meet people or engage in volunteer work has me seriously bummed out, as WFH is getting quite isolating.

My partner and I are both looking for work, though I suspect I'm pursuing it a bit more aggressively. At this point I see there being **three options for the summer:** 

**1) Fly home, stay with my parents for up to 2 months to look for work, aggressively look for work in my hometown and continue to apply in my partner's, and plan on relocating when we secure something/fly back to take our stuff in their car and a rental.** This is my preferred option, but would leave our dog without someone to care for him when my partner has to work overnights out of town, and our roommate is gone the first weekend I plan on leaving. It's possible we could have a friend look after him for that night no one will be here, but I don't want to get that far down the list/burden people.  

**2) Buy a used car in relatively good condition, take 1/2 our stuff &amp; our dog to prepare for an eventual relo, stay with partner's parents for 1-2 months, look aggressively in my partner's hometown while still applying in my own (they're about 1000 miles apart themselves) and plan on relocating to whichever town I find work in first. After I secure a job, fly back, take the rest of our stuff, and be done with the small town.** This would help with the dog (my partners' parents love him and he could stay there indefinitely even if I had to leave for a bit) and moving our stuff, but I don't really need a car at the moment and am still smarting from my last used car, which ended up being a massive piece of shit. 

**3) Wait the summer out here, apply where I can back in my partners'/my hometown, and drive 1/2 our stuff back with the dog in October in a rental car I booked some time ago.** In this case, I'd double up on classes for the summer just to be done with my program and spend what little time I'll have available outdoors, but I'd at least be done with school for good in the fall and would pursue the cheapest option for our relo. This, of course, would be pursued at the risk of diminishing my already-failing mental health and growing frustration at being in a town with limited job opportunities and outlandish housing costs. 

I've gone over these options obsessively in my head, with my partner, and with friends, but am having trouble deciding which is optimal. Is there one that stands out to you as the best? Is there an option here I'm not seeing? Any advice for my partner to look for work from 1,000 miles away? They got lucky last year finding something cross-country, we're hoping lightning strikes twice!

I’ve always had a big interest in art and animation. But I have been able to commit to learning animation. This is something I’d really like to do before I graduate high school. (So within two years at most).

I do have a free program on my desktop that includes onion skin layers for animation, but it is pretty simple and would require me to draw each frame with my computer mouse. I don’t think I will be able to keep the frames consistent while using a mouse to draw.

... now she’s always nice to me and everyone, but the next day at work she said “hey (my name)” in a happy tone when she walked by, which she’s never done before..

and the next day she was striking up small talk with me at checkout, which she does with everyone, but very rarely with me... she’s just been enthusiastic around me more than usual, and very outwardly nice more than usual... and I’m not sure if it’s sincere or fake behavior.

we work in retail and are in different departments, so I don’t run into her often...

I personally think she’s just doing this to keep things calm and not awkward at work...

175,"Context: I work thirds

Hi so I agreed with a coworker to trade a day this week. His Saturday for my Monday. Boss says we need to fill out paperwork (no big deal). However it has to be faxed in by Monday after I have worked. So I get the paperwork filled out and let him know he needs to fill it out. He said he would drop by the next day and do it. (Sunday) I come in to work and find out he didn’t show up to fill it out. I now have no paperwork to fax in for tomorrow.  And its due tomorrow. Should I blow up his phone? Or explain to my boss he didn’t come in. I sent him a text recently and he knows he was supposed to come in and fill it out.

I am a very nervous and anxious individual and am unsure how to proceed. Also what ramifications do you think I would get for working a shift with no paperwork?",10Jun2019,1

181,"I’m looking for any funds or grants I can apply to in hopes of preparing for the high possibility of having to pay for my lawyer. I don’t mind that they get virtually half of whatever settlement money I get. I’m more worried about how to pay for them, since I only have less then $10k in my bank account and most of that is towards the medical fees I’m incurring. 

I’ve been put on suicide watch twice and under yet another involuntary psychiatric hold, despite already being an intensive outpatient program. My employer didn’t believe that I had a disability and intentionally spun me into hypomania and then mania once I spoke up about being forced to do three different jobs at the same time. I kept having all of my reasonable accommodations denied and they also intentionally witheld information about the disability program I’m in, repeatedly treating me as an at-will employee when I’m not at all. I did get approved by the unit handling medical leave, to go on SDI and I’ve actually been receiving payments. But because my boss was vindictive, she punished me for going on medical leave to escape from her and still intentionally terminated me while I’m on medical leave. 

I only found out recently that she withheld informing my HR that I was on medical leave and now I’m still being cut off of my work health insurance. It frustrates me that just because of my disability, I’m treated as a walking hazard even though all of my coworkers said I did a great job — despite them not knowing before I told them that I had a disability. They actually were the only ones who still treated me the same and are even sympathetic about what my management has subjected me to still. I’m fortunate that I still have my family to support me and am now on my mom’s insurance again (luckily, I’m only 23 and haven’t aged out yet for California), but it pisses me off to accept that I have to on medi-cal and be, what it feels like, forever low-income just because I keep being fired for my disability, not for my work at all.",10Jun2019,1

183,"We have been talking for about 2 weeks but we clicked instantly. I started to grow really comfortable with her and we had talked about starting a relationship despite living 8 hours away from each other. Like the title explains, about 3 days ago she lost someone really close to her and she has since told me that she can not be ready to be in a relationship and even when as far as to block me. I really don't know how to handle this. I confronted her about it and kinda had an anxiety attack and sent her a text proclaiming how much she means to me and how I don't want to lose her, I'm scared I might have scared her off because of this. (I wasn't in a good place and emotional) She told me it's too much to take in right now and she just wants to be alone and I asked if we can stay friends maybe and she didn't say yes or no but she told me she will text me when she feels ready.

I am now waiting until she feels ready to text me. It has only been about a day and I understand now that she really just needs time to grieve and I am planning on giving her that. I however could really use some reassurance. Can I hold onto hope that we can stay friends? And that one day she would decide she still wants to be in a relationship with me again? I would also like to show her that I care, if after a week she still doesn't text me would it be okay to check in with her? Just say hey, I hope your doing okay? Or can I just say an apology?

186,"I went shopping today at Target and took my four year old son into the bathroom with me when I had to use it. 

While using the urinal, I started noticing what kind of sounded like feminine moaning sounds coming from the stalls. After a few more seconds it became clearer that is what I was hearing. 

As I finished using the urinal, I decided a just needed to get my loud, vocally curious son out of there as quickly as possible. 

I turned and saw a boy, probably 9 or 10, leaning against the wall. He made a face like I caught him doing something wrong. Before I could really process what was happening I grabbed my son’s hand and left. As I did, I saw the boy put his fingers into his ears and make the face of a person following orders. 

As I left the bathroom I tried to assess what to do. Do I tell an employee? Call the police? What if this was a consensual situation and I wind up taking a son away from his mom? What if it’s not consensual and really needs to be stopped as soon as possible? What is best for that boy?

I already knew why, she felt attracted to another guy and kept lying to me about going to her friend's place, but she was actually hanging out with him. I agreed to take the break, but I felt like I was only an option so I decided to break it all off with her a week later after thinking to myself the entire week and told her that I didn't want to be an option, since she flat out said she couldn't choose which guy she wanted to be with. I told her that I will always be her friend &amp; if she ever needed anything from me I was just a text/ call away and she didn't have any emotions when I said it to her, while I was pretty heart broken since I had a lot of plans for us after I graduate in a week from now (Long distance). Originally she claimed that it was her parents giving her problems, then falling out of love with me, then to another excuse and it just kept coming so I knew something was up.

I've been texting her here and there like once a week, but I guess she just made it official with the other guy right after I broke it off and didn't want to be my friend by the way she texts me back with one word answers and leaving me on read. She called me about a week after I broke up with her to ask if I was ok and I reacted normally and told her I was fine and all, guess she didn't believe me and now she wants to celebrate with me for my graduation (she will be flying to me), but I have a feeling she will get drunk and try to have sex with me. I'm pretty sure I'm just going to reject her offer and tell her that I still love her and all, but I won't have sex with her or do anything to ruin her current relationship because I know how it feels to be cheated on especially when the other guy thought she was single the entire time. I just genuinely care about her since I've known her for 11 years of my life and I just want her to be happy even if it isn't with me. Whether or not she is in a rebound, or think the GRG I just care about her and it's not even about being in the friend zone, I was over the breakup after I broke it off with her which was a week after she wanted to take a break.

TL;DR : broke up with ex, still wanted to be friends with her since I knew her for so long and I just genuinely care about her and don't care if she comes back to me or not. Need to know if doing anything wrong.",10Jun2019,2

198,"**some backstory:**

my mother (41/F)  has been emotionally and mentally abusing me (13/F) since i was in first grade. she continuously ignores my mental/emotional state and i. due to events throughout my life (most caused by my mother), i am depressed, anxious, and suicidal. i have tried to kill myself before, but failed (obviously). she is not aware of this. anyways, she’s never been there for me and would always ridicule me in front of family and friends. the fact that she is a drunk doesn’t help. one of my earlier memories include her grabbing at the wheel of our car while my older brother was driving while drunk. we almost crashed and her and my brother jumped out of the car (after parking it). my younger brother and i also hopped out. i tried to run to my fathers house, which was about a 20 minute drive away. it obviously didn’t work. the entire time i was running, my mom was screaming profanities at me about how i’m a worthless daughter and i was abandoning her. my older brother ran up to me and hugged me, saying he’d bring me to my dads house if i came back to the car. he never did. 

she always ridicules what i eat, who i’m friends with, my grades (which are straight A’s because i work my ass off to try and make her proud of me), and who i am as a person. im so over it and i want my dad to have full custody of me, but i can’t find a way to ask him. plus, my father is always out of state due to work, meaning i wouldn’t have any other place to go except for my mothers. and it doesn’t help that when my father is gone, he’s gone for days to weeks at a time.

my stepfather is literally the male version of my mother. he does the exact same things as her, but even more brutally. when he does this, my mother backs him up. in this past day, i’ve had two breakdowns (each lasting somewhere between 1-3 hours) due to them.

**so, the advice i’m asking for is:**

1. how do i get my father to have full custody of me? will just asking him work, or would we have to go to court and such?

2. if my father says no to having full custody of me, how do i get my mother and stepfather to stop treating me like utter crap?

3. if you were me, what would you do?

* One of those people is the ex-wife of my friend
* Prior to my long time friend &amp; the person I like going out, I helped my friend look through his ex's social media posts he was considering what to do post divorce I showed him some questionable old posts &amp; pointed out some nicer things the ex said. 
* I had never gotten to know his now ex-wife that well before but we always talked when we saw each other.
* They had reached a good middle ground with things
* Jump back to more recently I followed her on social media &amp; talked to her once or twice. She starts posting alarming things of how my long time friend treated her or things he did.
* Long time friend stops by today mentions he sent screen shots of  ex's social media to his lawyer. He also didn't ask me how I was doing at all.
* I don't want to believe but what she posted I'm not going to just dismiss it 
* I'm supposed to be seeing the ex soon (she had some of my stuff &amp; I mentioned I would like to hang out) This was set up before the lawyer stuff but after my friends hooked up.
* I want to lay out in detail what I did &amp; how in my opinion I may have wronged her (the ex) &amp; where I felt what I did was justified
* I dont know how to broach the subject of her accusations with my long time friend (based only on what she posted I WOULD NOT RELAY ANYTHING THE EX &amp; I SAY TO EACH OTHER)

200,"Hi everyone! I’ve been needing this advice for a long time and finally decided to ask the internet. Sorry if this has been asked before and sorry if this doesn’t belong here. I’m pretty new to reddit even on my main account. 

I (16) went to visit my uncle’s house today with my mom and siblings (bro is 13/sis is 9). My close cousins (both 16) were also there. I’ll refer to them as Veronica and David.

David is known to be an asshat to his younger family (Veronica and I are both younger than him by a few months). It’s gotten so bad before that our moms and ourselves had to sit down to talk about it and I’ve constantly gotten onto him about how he treats both my siblings and even Veronica. I don’t tolerate his bullshit and I make it clear to him. 

My brother has a habit of becoming just like David when he is around him and still kinda acts like David when he is with his own friends or older kids. He doesn’t take it seriously when my parents get onto him or when he is confronted by anyone about it. 

We (my cousins and siblings) were all messing around and playing, David and my brother were being little shits and were picking on my sister for the one hundredth time that day for literally anything she did. She can’t even attempt a cartwheel (she wants to be a gymnast) without them tearing her down in every way possible. 

Right when I heard David and my brother start to blame my sister for hurting my 6-year-old cousin (Veronica’s little sister) and calling her a liar without letting her explain what happened first, I snapped at them both. They were insulting her in both of our faces. SHE’S FUCKING 9 YEARS OLD. 

I begin with that fact. These two were 4-7 years older than her and couldn’t leave her the fuck alone. They immediately began to talk about how I “was taking it to another level” and “needed to shut the fuck up.” That made me absolutely livid and if anything, worse. I told them how seriously I took that shit and how you could really fuck a kid up like that. 

Veronica decided to step in, but only because she didn’t feel like listening to me rant and was agreeing with them. All three of them kept talking over me when I was trying to bring up a serious issue and laughed at me. I began to raise my voice and they shut me down for it by yelling at me at the same time and making stupid ass noises. I kept saying “listen to me just for a second” and “I won’t stop until you let me finish,” but I couldn’t get through with them. 

I decided to not to continue because I was already close to sobbing and I didn’t want anyone to see me like that. I simply told them that I was done and  that I was going inside to “chill.” They started sighing and muttering to each other before I even left. 

Once I got inside, I could hear them through the window of Veronica’s room talk shit about me to my 18-year-old cousin (David’s older sister) when she asked where I went. I cried a little bit because it just happens when I get too frustrated and calmed down pretty quickly, but I refused to go back outside. It didn’t really help that I was PMSing really bad and my mood has been wack since I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. 

Luckily, everyone went home soon after the fight and I didn’t have to see David since we left after them. On the car ride home, I mentioned my brother’s behavior to my mom because I was sick of it and I’ve been told before that I’m not allowed to “be the boss/parent” or do anything when it comes to my siblings acting up. My brother went into defense mode, said crap like “she’s mean to me too,” attempted to cry his way out of it, and played his game music as loud as possible to drown me out. 

My mom agreed to talking about it with him the next day because she was too drunk. I don’t believe that that’ll do anything because this isn’t going to be the first time he’s had a talk with both my parents about being an asshole around my cousins to my sister and I. 

I don’t know what to do with David and my brother treating my sister like actual shit and disrespecting me the way they do. I believe it would help if I learned how to control my frustration during an argument with a bunch of dumbasses like them and if I could somehow get David to actually listen to me for once (we argue a lot and even when he is certainly incorrect, he pulls the same shit every goddamn time). It’s just tiring when I need to let him know what he’s doing, I love him and my brother so much.",10Jun2019,3

203,"I’ve had this sweet black cat named Buddy ever since he was a kitten. His sister and him were dumped out where we live (out in the country) when they were not even two months old. We took them in and raised them, and they’re the absolute best cats anyone could ever ask for. 

Fast forward about three years, we noticed Buddy was getting in fights with some sort of animal. We let the cats go outside at night and they come back in whenever they please, and considering we live in the country with coyotes and other wildlife, we were getting nervous. He had cuts, ripped padding in his paws, but mostly a horrible walk where he was constantly tripping, so we took him to the vet. Apparently, and I have no clue if I’m explaining this right, but the muscle that goes over his knee joint wasn’t stable so the joint was sliding all over the place causing him to walk weird. We put him on steroids for the pain and kept him inside for awhile. The surgery to fix it is extremely expensive and there’s not a guaranteed chance it would work. My mom did promise that we would save money to get the surgery at some point in time though.

About three months later, Buddy was walking comfortably again and we were giving him less medication. It was clear the pain wasn’t bothering him much or even at all, and he was going outside again. Sadly, the fights started up again. Recently he got into a bad one where his ear was ripped, had patches of fur missing, and was scratched up pretty bad on the face. What bothered me was how little my mom and her girlfriend seemed to care about this. They’d have him stay inside and maybe give him some medicine, but put in no effort to keep him inside and prevent the fighting. My parents are divorced so half the week I’m at my dads, and I can’t control what happens to Buddy when I’m gone. If I could, I’d permanently make him a indoors cat.

I’ve started to notice too that recently he’s having extreme trouble jumping and always falls, and seems to be in pain when scratching himself with his back leg (he wasn’t even like that a month after we learned about his joint). Buddy’s sleeping so much more than he used too and isn’t as playful. I also noticed today that his nose seemed a bit bigger than usual and I asked my mom what it was about. Apparently in one of his recent fights he broke his nose. I was genuinely shocked, and asked my mom if we were gonna take him to the vet. She said he was fine and there was nothing the vet could do anyways, and when I asked about the joint surgery, she flat out did not want to do it. Money is currently tight with our family right now, but my mom is getting a job in a few weeks where we’ll make a lot more money. I’m surprised she’s refuse to help him, or at least take him to the vet for a checkup. My mom was always the one helping animals too, especially her girlfriend.

Buddy is probably on his last life at this point, and I’m worried since he can’t run well, that if he goes outside at night a coyote will get him. Maybe even worse is that something is currently wrong with him now, and not taking him to the vet to get him diagnosed will hurt him in the long run. We had a previous black cat before also named Buddy who went missing, and he was a huge part of the family. I don’t want this to happen again, especially if we could control the outcome. I don’t know if what my mom is saying is right or if Buddy needs profession help. I’m genuinely worried at this point.",10Jun2019,1
204,"After my freshman year of college, my parents (who are Mormon) found out about my weed and acid use. It was a rough time but we eventually worked it out and are still on good terms. I always thought that stuff was behind us and went into my sophomore and junior year which were both periods of strong depression. My junior year I started to write in a journal to cope with my thoughts. The journal included some more drug use (pretty much just weed and mentioning acid use in the past), depressive thoughts, and some cringy stuff that I'm pretty embarrassed even got read by someone else besides me.

At first when I found those pics I was shocked. My gut sunk super quickly and face flushed. I always thought my parents and I were cool but they had to snoop in my journal? And as I'm an adult? It made me super uncomfortable to know that they knew all about my problems with girls, drugs, procrastination, and depression for the past year (the pics are dated a little over a year ago) and they have acted like nothing happened this whole time. Never once brought any of it up with me but managed to take a pic of every page. The journal also had some dreams in it but I'm not too worried about those. The shock has turned into anger that my mom still feels like she can snoop in my stuff when I'm 22 years old (was 21 at the time), especially when she hadn't really snooped before, at least not that I know of. 

My relationship with my parents has been pretty strong, at least I thought, for the past couple years. I'm sure some of the stuff they read has devastated them in some way, especially since they're Mormon, and I'm not sure if my mom shared these pics with my dad or other family members or not. I want to know if there's a healthy way to bring it up with her. I don't want this to become some kind of hate fest as I still care for my parents, but I want them to understand that snooping through my personal stuff is an absolute break of trust with me and it should never happen again. This experience has made me feel naked. Those words were never meant to be read by anyone but myself to help me cope through some dark times.",10Jun2019,16
205,"My best friend and I are extremely close. We hang out almost every weekend typically at her house. The only problem being that her parents are a little uptight. They are against cursing and don't allow it. Her father has a reputation for being quick tempered and violent (never domestic), only ever saying it was for a good reason. The kind of guy who does martial arts and says he'll kill any guy his daughter dates (stereotype to the max). Unfortunately for him she has many guy friends, all who are in my opinion respectful people. Despite her fathers reputation he's been very nice to me. So tonight my friend is on the phone with one of her male friends (who has no problem cursing in front of her parents). This guy yells at his sister in the background calling her a ""c*nt"" for one reason or another. I know many people hate that word but still, it's not my place to police the language of others. Her parents who are sitting outside randomly come running in and her dad suddenly screams at the top of his lungs, ""SHUT THE F**CK UP!"" It was so sudden I actually thought he was joking considering his reaction was as if someone pulled out a weapon and threatened her life. I was panicking so much that I said nothing, because I was concerned with him becoming physically aggressive. It was as if these stories I'd heard about him were becoming more and more real, and less and less funny. I left probably five minutes later while my friend pretty much clung to me because of anxiety the entire car ride back. Her mom was very quiet and only said that it was ""not cool of him to say that"". If I'm completely honest I know it doesn't sound like I'm in the right to be upset and shaken up, because it wasn't like he WAS violent. But it was aggressive enough to upset multiple people, and to feel like a man I trusted enough to call family could be such a different person. I don't want to end this friendship because of this, but I'd be so uncomfortable ever being around him without knowing what he'll do.  There's no way for me to avoid her family it's pretty much a whole damn package, that I really don't want to unwrap.",10Jun2019,1

210,"Backstory: 

My friend (we’ll call her Jane) and her roommate (we’ll call him Charlie) used to date about 5 years ago. They broke up because it just wasn’t working out. I’ve only known Jane for about 2 years and we’re not super close, so I don’t know all the details to their relationship. Jane has had some toxic ex-boyfriends in the past, and surprisingly Charlie isn’t the worst. They were still friends and even hung out occasionally mainly because he was selling her drugs. It was obvious that Charlie wanted to get back together, but Jane made it clear she did not. 

I also want to state that I do not know Charlie personally, only what she has told me about him.

In February, Jane asked Charlie to watch her apartment and pets for her since she was going to be out of town for a week or so. He took care of them and everything was fine. After that, they began talking more and Jane eventually let him move in as a roommate. She struggles paying the bills on her own and she had to kick out her last roommate because they weren’t helping pay, so Jane needed a new one. It worked out for a while, and they had even hit the “it’s complicated” stage of a relationship where Jane didn’t know how to define it. She made it clear they weren’t dating but there was potential. 

Fast forward to May:

I put Jane on with a guy (Joe) who she can buy drugs from. 

Jane texts asking if I knew of anyone that might be interested in dating her, so I try to think and I have one suggestion but she wasn’t interested in him. 

Less than a week later, she asks me if I knew that her and Charlie were NOT dating. I respond that I assumed as much because she asked me to set her up. She informs me that Charlie told her “I went to OP’s job to get some food and told him that I knew OP tried to set you up with someone else. I told OP that we were dating and OP said ‘sorry, I didn’t realize’”

I informed Jane that this was a completely fabricated story and that I hadn’t even seen him that day. She assumed as much and informed me again that they weren’t dating or even close. At this point, she’s looking for a new roommate because Charlie is lying about her to her friends. 

Fast forward to yesterday:

Joe starts texting Jane because he wants to have sex and she informs him that she’s not interested (in a roundabout way). Joe isn’t one to give up easily so he keeps trying. The whole time Jane is sending me screenshots of the messages, asking for my advice. Eventually she stops texting, which I assume means she fell asleep. 

This morning, I wake up to a call from Joe telling me about the conversation he had with Jane this morning. What he’s telling me doesn’t line up with what Jane showed me, so I assume Joe was trying to save his pride. I go along with what he’s saying to play along. 

Not long after that, I get a text from Jane telling me that Charlie had stolen her phone in the middle of the night and texted Joe essentially telling him to leave Jane alone in an aggressive way. Charlie was using Jane’s phone, so Joe thought it was Jane the whole time and was confused so he decided to just let it go and back off. 

Jane then informs me that Charlie blocked and deleted a bunch of numbers from her phone. He also texted Jane’s best friend something to push her away from Jane (unsure if it worked) then blocked and deleted the number. 

Charlie is a toxic person and Jane does not want him in her life. The problem is that Jane is in a lease until October and is not financially stable enough to a) break the lease, b) kick him out, or c) take him to court and evict him. 

We live in NC where the law is that if someone has lived there for 30 days or receives mail to the address, they technically reside there and must be legally evicted. 

I am trying to help her come up with a solution to her dilemma here. She can’t afford to move away from the apartment complex she’s in now because she doesn’t have a car and walks to work. The next closest apartment complex is too far away. 

What can be done in this situation by anyone?

212,"So my girlfriend of seven years. I just found out shes been messaging a guy that she found on tinder since November. One of her friends emailed me with info about how she was talking to him on whatsapp. 
My girlfriend is very protective of her phone and will never let me even look at contacts for a number or anything. I have been pretty suspicious recently. So after the email I knew if I confronted her she will deny it and my fear was she would delete it. So I just went in and checked without her knowledge just to clear my mind. It wound up being true. So I confronted her saying I got an email about a guy named let's say Brian. She looked at me and said it's a lie and there's nobody. I knew at this point she was lying to me. I asked her to clear my mind to just show me so I can just feel at ease. She refused and yelled at me that I'm wrong and shes not hiding anything. Saddened I just told her I checked already cause I had a feeling and I knew she was lying. By the way the texts were both talking about sex and sharing nude videos and pics. She confessed and told me everything and that she never met the guy just shared messages.  I'm hurt and I just dont know what to do. What do I do? This has never happen to me before. Seven years of my life I was prepared to spend the rest of my life with.

213,"In 17 years old in an early college program. For the two years that I was in high school I felt out of place. Social anxiety drew me to this program just as much as the double high school/college credit that was avaliable. I've been at the worst stage in my life for the past year. For my first quarter, I was doing *okay*. I failed my math class and did well at my two other classes. For the spring quarter. I stopped going all together in the middle. With this quarter, I didn't miss a single class and I'm failing both them.

In the last two I have been going through some really hard times. Through incessant self harm and being on the verge of suicide, I failed myself twice in a row. With this, I will very likely have to go back to high school for my senior year. And I may not graduate.

I was a straight A student through 9th grade. I've gone from a perfect 4.0 to around a 2.0 GPA.

I don't know what to do. If I've fucked myself over like this. Where I won't be able to graduate high school. Where I'll have to take a make-up class to get enough credits to apply for a job. I won't have a chance of getting into a college. Why the fuck should I bother trying anymore. I'm so tired. I just want some rest. But I can't. I've had several panic attacks for the last few days. I don't want to let myself get away with this. I'm fucking done. I have ADHD and bipolar disorder. I'm medicated for both. I see a therapist weekly. Nothing fucking works. I'm not fit to live in this world. I try so hard to get better. Every single day. Every week. Every month. Every year. But I don't get better. I always fall back into this position where I don't know what to do and I don't want to live anymore. My mind is foggy and I'm physically and emotionally exhausted. When I need people most, they aren't there. I've had an abusive mother growing up, and I still have to see her a couple of days a month. I'm not selfish enough to kill myself.

214,"For anyone who cares to listen.

My life story...
I’m 24 years old, have steadily been working since I was around 16. I’m in a committed relationship and have two children with my SO. 

How I got here. I was raised in a large wealthy Mormon family. I was relatively happy growing up until my mid/late teens. I’ve been homeless, in and out of the military, driven coast to coast across the USA, been in a few relationships, and have been with my current SO for over three years. We’ve created two beautiful boys together who are ~2 and 1 weeks old. I’ve worked as an electronics tech for ~4 years, 3 of it for one company.

My muddled thoughts after a challenging day at work and reflection on the past present and future....

What really strikes me is how much cruelty I’ve seen in this world. I don’t want to get political, but I think it’s mostly the fault of money.

People lie, kill, and cheat their fellow men and women for a penance. Life is not fair is an understatement. Religion clouds peoples minds, and causes them to do outrageous things. Humans continue to consume this world until their own demise. 

I feel like the world is insane, but it might just be me. They’re plenty of good people in this world, but it’s hard to tell the good from bad. They’re are so many wolves in sheeps clothing. So many people just fight and argue in life, online, and all over TV. 

What is a man supposed to do in a world like this? I sacrificed myself for 3 years at my last job, just to be fired on the spot.

Everything has to be a competition. Millions are without food and shelter, and a few live lives of excess and wealth. Not only have I seen this in my family, but across the country.

Where is the world headed? What are people supposed to believe anymore? The future of humanity and this planet seem grim to me. 

I’m typically a positive person, and I try and accentuate the positive, but that just feels like a bandaid on a gunshot wound sometimes.

I feel like the world has become too complicated. I dream of escape. Just finding a small plot of land where I can garden and hunt, and take care of my family. The world doesn’t seem set up for this anymore though and many people are forced to work in offices and under management. People are treated as numbers and machines.

I know it’s a muddled mess of text, and I’m probably wrong about a great deal of things. It’s just how I feel right now, nearing 2am, and how I’ve felt countless times before. It all seems so out of control. How are people supposed to find any meaning in life in a world like this.",10Jun2019,1
215,"Alright, so I am a 18 year old guy and I have been really struggling lately with my head. 

For the past 3 years I’ve come to realize that I am not sexually attracted to women really, although I am attracted to guys, however it’s more complicated, i physically could never have sex with a guy, not because of being raised homophobic or anything like that, just in my mind it’s something I would ever do, when I almost hooked up with a guy I couldn’t do it, it felt wrong. I watch gay porn and it turns me on, and when I’m turned on the thought of having sex with another guy is a-ok to me, until I get too into it and completely loose that feeling or after I orgasm I especially feel no attraction to guys. I also don’t want to end up in a gay relationship, I want to have a “normal” life and have always wanted to have kids and a family of my own. (I know happy gay couples have kids, but that’s not my point). I haven’t always been this way, I used to feel attraction to girls and have hooked up with girls before. The part that I can’t come to terms with in my heads is that straight porn doesn’t turn me on, gay porn does. Physically hooking up with a girl makes me get aroused but I get all anxious in my head now and feel like I won’t be able to maintain an erection or just look like a complete idiot, and for this reason I am also still a virgin. I like girls and I want to have a girlfriend but my anxiety and thoughts just completely mess it up for me. It’s just all such a confusing mess in my life right now because I’ve never had a girlfriend, people probably think I am gay, which I am not trying to completely deny, it’s just that I don’t want it to be that way and truly don’t feel right about it and that’s not influenced by the stigma around gay people.

I want to know, from others past experience or knowledge about this, is it normal for me to think like this, and will I ever be able to get over it or change anything? I wish my anxiety didn’t eat me up about this so much and make me literally afraid to having a thing with a girl. the fact that I can’t get aroused from straight porn also makes it worse for me

I thought that was that, but this year me and her got a few classes together, and around lunch, me and my friends and her friends would meet up and just talk and do dumb shit.

I have a group of friends, who I consider my best friends, and I have known them for a very long time. They know I’m broke. One of my friends in the group definitely has something wrong with him mentally. It’s kind of hard to describe, but I’ll try my best. Over the years he seems to progressively worsen mentally, he was always normally a chill kid, but now he just becomes an asshole to all of us for no reason, and I don’t even mean the friends making fun of each other kind of way, he would literally be such an asshole to the point where one of our friends in the group actually ended up cutting him off for a while. (Yeah he was a dick, but it was never as bad as what happened in this story) After he would act like this, he would sometimes say his regrets about it/apologize, one time he told me how he worries we’re gonna hate him because of it, and that combined with our history makes it really hard for me to get mad at him. I’m thinking he may be bipolar, at least that’s the best I can think of. Anyways, onto the story, was hanging out with two of them a week ago, and I was at the house of the one I described above. I was planning on buying something off of him (35 dollars, not anything big) and because of my lack of money, I couldn’t then, but he up and gave it to me right then and there, telling me I can pay him back when I have money. I saw it as a nice gesture, and I took it. Today, he texts me out of the blue to remind me that I needed to pay him back. He was extremely rude about it and it took me by surprise, so I told him that I was going to pay him back when I got money, and that I didn’t like his attitude.He starts telling me he’s going to fuck me up if I don’t pay him back by Thursday, that I messed with the wrong person, and then accused me of “taking” from him even though it was handed to me. I told him I needed time, but then he tried saying it’s been three weeks, when it’s only been one. I told him if he was gonna be such an ass that I didn’t even want it anymore, and that I’d give it back to him, but he completely refused to take it back from me and continued to demand that I’d pay him. I then asked what if I didn’t, and he told me that if he didn’t fuck me up, than he’d get people from school to do it for him.

It's been extremely clear for the last several decades neither my mum or her brother want to take over the damn farm or move back closer to them and now that pressure has fallen on me.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently they were at my house for a visit and the conversation of who takes over the farm came up. I did my best to gently but firmly tell them I did not intend to take over a farm that's already fallen apart, but it just went in one ear and out the other. If anything now they've got it in their heads that I'd be willing to move in with them after college and learn how to farm while also taking care of them so they, ""won't have to deal with terrible senior homes."" Awesome good to know that the only things they want from me are to take over a farm I couldn't give a shit about and take care of them until they die.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to hurt them, I really don't. I do love them to a certain extent, but I can't put my life on hold or stop it completely for the wishes of others. Am I just an asshole for not wanting to take care of family? How do I tell them this isn't a life I want?",10Jun2019,1
228,"My friend (21 now) has a strange relationship with a former teacher who used to lead her teen support group. Aside from counterculture beliefs he has imparted to her and a few other girls, he has told her to cut off friendships. He gives her cleanses to take, and she thinks she is ""viabrating"" differently than the rest of us, who are in the Matrix. One time when he was drunk she says he asked her to strip for him on video chat and apologized that he was joking after she got upset and brought up that she had a boyfriend. There are a few other stories like that and she relates them affectionately.

At first I thought it was funny and just nodded my head, but it seems weird and predatory as more details emerge. I've told her as much, and suggested talking to someone. And then dropped it. It's odd because this has been going on waaay before I knew her. Is there anything else to say or do?",10Jun2019,1
229,"My boyfriend has been in legal trouble a few times in his life. Mostly just things he did when he was 16-18 but about 6 months ago, he got out of jail for something that happened with his ex-girlfriend. Basically, she cheated on him and nudes of her were sent to my boyfriend along with texts from
her and the guy she cheated on him with provoking him. He ended up posting the pictures on Snapchat calling her names &amp; she went to the police. He served 10 days out of 90 for it &amp; is on supervised prohibition for 18 months. 

Recently, he was served court papers. They said that over a year ago, a $500 check had been stolen and cashed into his ex’s account with her name on the check. Multiple checks for $1,000-$3,000 were stolen but only the $500 check was cashed. She said that my boyfriend and his brother asked her to drive them to a neighborhood and pick them up somewhere else so, they could steal mail. 

My boyfriend swears that he had nothing to do with this. He thinks that they may not even have been together at the time and she was just visiting on the weekends so, she likely came down with someone else and stole the check. He said that he remembers her having $500 Bc he was selling weed at the time, fucked up on selling and didn’t make his money back. She came back from “babysitting” with $500 some dollars which, she gave him to buy weed. My boyfriend also said that he would’ve never stolen mail Bc he knows it’s a federal crime. He also said that he definitely wouldn’t have cashed a stolen check Bc those are super easy to trace. 

I believe he didn’t do it but the idea that he might go to jail for this is driving me CRAZY! she just recently had her hearing and got Nolle prosequi on all charges except theft under $100 which, she got a plea bargain for and is doing 18 months supervised probation. My boyfriend talked to his lawyer and he said that there’s a 60% chance they will drop everything or just make him plead guilty to one charge and a 40% chance that they will try to hit him hard.  He said that the fact that she admitted to forging a check and didn’t have to plead guilty to it threw him off but it was also the most serious charge. She’s never been in legal trouble and definitely doesn’t look like someone who would so, I guess maybe they just wanted to give her a second chance? He swears he didn’t do it &amp; that there wouldn’t be any solid evidence against him other than her testimony. I’m so scared of him going back to jail &amp; just thinking about it makes me sick. 

He’s finally back on his feet and just got a good job that pays well. He’s 21 now and just wants her out of his life but now more shit comes up to fuck him up AGAIN. The thought that he might go to jail for something he didn’t do or that he might be lying to me &amp; he actually did steal the mail, literally haunts me. Every time I think about it, I cry and have so much anxiety &amp; I CANT GET IT OUT OF HEAD. It’s ALL I can think about. I struggle w anxiety already &amp; I was finally getting help and feeling better. Now this whole situation has brought me back to square one and I’m about to have a panic attack just writing this but I’m so desperate for advice. I’m not coping with things well at ALL and we won’t know anything about his case until the end of the month. 

I know I sound a ridiculous being this upset but he is my best and ONLY friend.  My best friend of 10 years recently stopped speaking to me, my life at home isn’t great and I don’t really speak to my parents. My life has been so chaotic and he’s been the only thing that brings me peace and happiness. He’s been there for me so much &amp; helped me through this really rough time in my life. The thought of him getting locked up for god knows how long breaks my heart. I’ve never dealt with people who were in trouble like this. I’m only 19 and he’s my first boyfriend so, I really care about this guy. I’m up at 2am writing this and I can’t sleep Bc my anxiety is so crazy. I feel SO alone and could use any words of encouragement you guys have to offer. please give me any advice on how to handle my anxiety these next few weeks. I won’t be able to get to my therapist until the end of this month and obviously, I’ve been having a tough time coping with all of this. Thank you!!",10Jun2019,1
230,"So I love my job... I am a forensic investigator and work for a 24/7 Forensic unit. We typically work 4x10s but if there’s a big case we can work anywhere from 15-24 hours. No breaks and we do everything from on scenes (burglaries, robberies, murders etc.) to lab work, and fingerprint comparisons... I’ve been there almost 2 years and get paid $22. We start off at $20 and need a BA or BS in a science or criminal justice. We work in all types of weather and have to wear bullet proof jackets for protection (we don’t get paid hazard pay or night differential pay). Recently dispatch has been getting raises after raises in hopes to keep people (we have also lost people in our forensic unit because other neighboring cities pay more and we don’t have the management support to get more money for training or raises). Just found out that dispatch doesn’t need a degree at all. They start off at $19 and after a year of training they get paid $22... management says “well dispatch always gets what they want” and it gets brushed under the rug. Our coworkers think we make more and when we tell them how much we start off they are in shock because they know how hard we work in order to solve crimes. We’ve all tried talking to our supervisor about pay and training budget but I feel like we are not being heard... what should we do? Who should we contact? I feel like HR/the city probably doesn’t know we are getting paid so little since our supervisor doesn’t speak up for us... btw the city we work for has 250,000 people and crime is pretty high.",10Jun2019,1
231,"About 2 years ago, I told my mom that I'm suicidal and really struggling with some mental health issues. We talked for a while and we agreed that I'd get out more and see friends and she'd help me go to therapy. After I went a few times, we just stopped going. I couldn't drive myself at the time and I didn't bring it up because I assume it was a money issue.

Last February, I drove the car out and was going to crash it, but a friend called me and talked me down. My mom found out about the whole situation and again we talked for a long time, but this time the conversation kept going to what I was going to do differently and how I was going to fix my problems. Again, I agreed to go to church and meet new people (I'd just graduated, so I wasn't seeing many people at the time) but now 5 months later absolutely nothing has changed.

I want to move out and try my best to take control of my own life. However, if the best I can do is live in a car or try to pay for therapy behind mom's back, that works too.

I tried to start by applying for jobs, but there's not really many openings in my city and what a surprise minimum wage fast food restaurants are the only ones who will take a recent high school graduate with a low gpa.

Basically what I'm asking is what are the first steps to moving out? W?hat kind of job can I get that will allow me to pay for a house with a roommate and possibly for therapy? Should I just do fast food and hope for the best? Should I save for a car first? Or save for rent and keep using my bike? My city isn't as expensive as a big city, but it isn't cheap.

I lived in a shed close to Mexico with no air conditioning sleeping on the ground with some blankets, so I can live basically anywhere including in a car (which I've also done for a few weeks and could go longer if need be)

I'm taking my cat, no questions asked, and its an agreement I made with the animal foundation to not give her away. I know that she would put up a fight, but I most fear her taking the cat away and leaving without telling me during the moving out process.

I have friends who've done none of this. They've played and hung out and done things that make their hearts pump. They've rebelled and stayed out until 4 AM swinging from bridges and swimming in lakes.

Those friends of mine have quickly developed skills and talents that make them truly extraordinary. Some of them are freak athletes. Others are amazing artists. Many are both. They make things and earn money and generally live their lives to the fullest.

I have a really good friend that has unfortunately been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past couple months. She’s 16 and has been drinking, smoking pot, juuling, smoking cigarettes, and much more to “escape”. I feel for her and I understand that the pain she’s going through is real and extremely hard but I don’t think that any of these substances will help her in any way. Her sister (who’s 24) provides her with all of the stuff which I think is very inappropriate.  My friend gets mad when anyone tells her that what she is doing is not good, and just tells them to chill. As I said, I understand that she is struggling and doesn’t know the right things to say, but the drugs are really impacting her mood and interests. I’m going to talk to her about it tomorrow; any ideas on what to say? Also, if the talk with her doesn’t work, should I consider talking to her sister to tell her the impact the drugs she is providing has on my friend? I’m really worried for her as addiction runs REALLY strong in her family, with her relatives dealing with hard hard drugs, in and out of prisons.

Currently not talking to my friend as she has lied about something and tried to blame me and turn others against me. Not only that, but we both know the truth and I'm keeping my mouth shut about it so it doesn't hurt her marriage and kids.

I gave her my Netflix password about a year ago and had absolutely no issue with her using it. Then she gave it to her daughter who is a teenager, again, no problem as there were 4 screens on there and I don't watch it much but my own children do.

We have not spoken in over 2 weeks and she has behaved very poorly towards me my telling lies to others which I know will eventually come out, so I've just kept quiet.

This morning, I got a new device log in alert on my Netflix account so I go check it out. It was my son adding it to his phone as he's on a school trip today and wants to watch a few shows in case he gets bored. Then I notice that my friend is still logging into my account, (her teenage daughter too, but I have no issue with her using it). It's definitely her that's logged in because it was early hours this morning (5am) and she gets up around that time with her husband as he works. The device comes up set top box which I know is what they have in their living room.

I'm feeling a bit pissed about this. Her behaviour has been well out of line as it is. This just further adds to her disgusting sense of entitlement which i fell out with her over. 

It's easy enough to say to change the password, but there's no reason why her daughter should have to miss out. She's something wrong. If I change the password I'll get called petty and it'll just give her more fuel. Any advice how to deal with it tactfully?",10Jun2019,0
255,"​Hi Redditors,

My bf of almost 2 years and I just moved in to my tiny 1 bedroom apartment together. We will be re-locating to a much bigger 2 bedroom, but it won't be ready until January. In the meantime, we've squashed into my tiny one until my lease is up (his finished earlier than mine, hence why he's here).

My bf moved in a week ago and ended up bringing every single one of his belongings, even though he promised to throw a lot of it away. He will be ordering a garbage takeaway this week, but until then the garage is full and unusable in a neighbourhood where parking is incredibly scarce. The apartment itself is also still full and chaotic, despite hours of unpacking. It is definitely sized nicely for 1 occupant, not 2!

Ever since he moved in, I have struggled to get rid of this sense of anxiety. I love him and he is so great, but the idea that I'll never be able to just do whatever I want or ever have 100% privacy scares the shit out of me. Also coupled with the idea that I have to explain my whereabouts to someone again after having grown up with an overbearing Mother. The apartment also feels super cluttered. I even burst into tears when he was moving stuff around, because I felt like I was losing having a say in how my home is once again, as all my previous room mates in other apartments were super controlling and would only allow to have everything their way.

I was not feeling this way before he moved in, so I'm not really sure why I'm suddenly feeling this way now? I honestly have the urge to run away to my parents' house and hide under the covers. It is so bizarre.

Does anyone else have experience with this or have any advice? I do have issues with anxiety, so it's not uncommon that I'm an uptight stress head, it has just never involved my bf before.",10Jun2019,1

261,"I am just going to keep this short and try not to make this too long. 


    13 years ago, I had a hookup. We were able to keep in touch as we had a few mutual friends. Days later, I find out from another friend that she is pregnant so I got worried and tried to get in touch with her. I was terrified, I was nervous, the girl I was with was very religious so she was entirely against the idea of getting an abortion. I decided to just stick with her and try my best to be a dad. But when the baby came, I just couldn't bring myself to actually be a father. I was 18 and I was barely able to get a job for myself, I didn't know how I was gonna really help the kid at all. Once it hit me that I would have to actually take on the responsibilities and shit, I freaked out and tried to get away. I ghosted the woman I hooked up with and basically cut off any ties. My parents understood and let me move with my older brother, who was 28 and in need of a new roommate at the time. 
 

        Recently I came back to visit my parents for 2 weeks. As I was walking around the corner to get to CVS, I saw the same women I left years ago, walking towards my direction. She stopped me and we talked for a while, then she started yelling at me and got mad at me for leaving. She told me how much of a piece of shit I was and how fucked up it was for me to leave, which I agree a whole lot. Then she told me how she even lied to our daughter and told her that another man was her father. And how her ""dad"" basically abused the kid. 

     
      I can't stop thinking about how I left her behind. I feel insanely guilty for what I did and how I left them. I know that I fucked up but I just want to make things right by her. I've grown more financially stable, I have grown more used to kids, I feel like I am ready to be a real father. 



         The only issue is that I don't know how I am going to present the idea to her mother about meeting our daughter. I also don't even know what I would say to her. All I know is that I just want to be there for her and give her the dad that she never had. 
        


Tldr: 13 years, I ditched this girl that I got pregnant. I stuck with her through the pregnancy but left after the birth. I ran into her and now I feel guilty and sick of myself. Her mother told me that she was abused by her fake dad (her mom said another man was her father). I matured since then and want to be a father to her.",10Jun2019,1
262,I’ve been having a problem lately with sleeping. I deprive myself of sleep sometimes because I’m worried that if I fall asleep I’ll sleep through my alarms and miss important things like work or other events. It’s getting out of hand. I just have a bad track record of oversleeping. I’m such a heavy sleeper that there’s been times when people have had to come into my room and shake me to wake me up because no amount of noise would work. It’s always hit or miss. Sometimes my alarm makes me jump out of a deep sleep and wake up and other times I just don’t wake up. What are some things I can do to fix this because this issue has me taking 6 hour naps so I can stay awake all night and not worry about oversleeping.,10Jun2019,2
263,"So both me and this girl are doing some volunteering work. We both live together and every week we get 50$ food money each. We share the same fridge but again, we buy our own stuff. A couple of days ago I realized that she keeps taking a lot of my things. I made myself a big pot of soup and she had three bowls of it without asking (she didn't even finish it and threw some of it away), she uses my bread and cheese even though she has her own etc. 
Now I'm not really sure if I should say something to her. I mean I still have plenty of food and technically it isn't a big deal. I don't mind sharing food, quite the opposite actually, I love cooking for other people but it kinda bothers me that she takes it without asking.
I know I could just tell her but I don't want to get a reputation as being stingy or petty and I really hate drama.
Do you think I should say something? She's leaving in two weeks anyway and it's not like I'm loosing a lot of money because of it. It just annoys me.",10Jun2019,1
264,"To make a very sad story less sad. My whole life my parents lived a lovely relationship for what people would say was a standard relationship. I could only count a hand full of times they got into big, screaming at each other, arguments. My mom was stay at home to make sure my brother and I were raised with enough nurture and care. Now she only started doing this when I was born, which at the time my brother was 9 years old (9yr age gap) The house we moved into was such where there was only 3 rooms. One room was for my brother, another for my dad, and the last was me and my mom. It was a weird setup but it made sense because of my moms light sleepness and my dads loud snoring/ sleep apnea made it where they couldn't sleep together. So me and my mom would be pretty close though considering she was always home. We've never had much money so we never went any where, which in result made me spend time with her even more. There was allot of drama when I turned 15 however because my dad got injured on a job and in result fell behind on mortgage payments, which stressed my mom out to the point where she went days without sleeping and would hallucinate multiple times. It was only till we got foreclosed and moved to a close but downgrade of a house that she could actually get rest. (In this new home there were four beds though so we all slept separately finally) Life returned to normal after this. I remember even being like wow that was a crazy time. Nothing compares to what these last six months have been however. In November my mom got deathly sick. Apparently she came down with Pneumonia. After multiple tests though they found out it wasn't just that. It was also Brain and Lung cancer. (My parents were/are avid smokers so when I heard this is, it hurt even harder) It was just heartbreaking to know this because of how much cancer can just rip families apart. Not a week later my family finds out my brother got his girlfriend of a 6 month relationship pregnant. Fuck. So now its not one, but two major events coming together. One tragic and the other sorta the opposite. My mom was sent into radiation first to try and get at the most deadly cancer parts. This only made her weak and feel horrible. My uncles, aunts, and anywhere in between were here for her though. My mom was always considered an angel and Bambi for just her sweetness and overall care for everyone around her. No wonder people would want to give back to her. She went through all those radiation appointments though and then came chemotherapy. This was a heartbreaking time. To see all her hair fall out with just a horrible sight. When she fully went bald it was bad, but not as bad as when the doctors had to say the chemo just couldn't help. My mother was a very fragile and small woman (100lbs was a good medium of where she was usually at) The chemo just kept kicking her ass to the point where if they did another go it would kill her. So she was sent to hospice. It was February or Early March when this happened but in reality it is all a blank to me at this point. She was expected to stay in the center for two weeks top. But she was a fighter. She stayed in that center then anyone could have ever imagined. At a certain point toward the end they kept trying to kick her out because of money reasons and that her insurance wouldn't pay for it anymore. My father lost allot of his sanity to these people because of it. It was weird though how she kept on though. It was six months in where I was about to graduate high school. It was amazing because I was happy she would get to know both her sons graduated. There was a live stream and my uncle stayed with her in bed and she watched the entire thing. A few days later my brothers girlfriend had her baby. My mom was now a grandmother. The amount of joy she was able to express was great. She saw one son graduate and the other have his baby. The next day she passed away. June 4th 2019. It was expected but it still didn't hurt. Her funeral was just this Saturday. My dad and I strived for it to not be so much a funeral but rather a celebration of life for her, and indeed it was. And there is no way I don't believe now that she hung on in her body till she got to see those two events from my brother. It showed how much she truly cared for us, That not even death could take her down till she felt satisfied. She was 59 years old so as my dad puts it, For a women to have a wonderful 59 years and the last 6 months to be shit, well she lived a good life. It still hurts though to know shes gone. To know any other achievements in my life she wont physically be there to witness. Before I graduated I was on the verge of not because of all this going on in my life. My guidance counselors and BRACE adviser helped me though. I let them know of this going on and they truly helped in every way they could. I received a two year scholarship to a school nearby and another two year scholarship for years three and four because of them working with me. My mom got to see this which I'm also so grateful for. I just don't want to let her down though. I'm the first in my direct family to be going to college. The workload isn't easy. I'm just so afraid of letting her down. I want her to know I used to scholarships to the best of my ability. I want my dad to get better. He still smokes because of the addiction. The financial situation at home is something that still worries me. I'm scared for my future me and my dad have to pave through. My brother will be moving out soon so it'll just be me and my dad in a home that once fit four. I love my dad. I just want to make sure he is with me for much longer. It is a scary feeling, but I just am lost right now at what to do. My dad is pretty much everything to me right now. This wasn't like they were divorced and he lost someone he still loved but not fully. No he lost his soul mate. His best friend. One of his few friends he has still. I don't want widowhood effect to come to him. I just don't know how to feel anymore. I'll be turning 19 in just a week. I've been a man for awhile. but god dam do I want to be a kid again. I still feel like a kid in some ways. I just feel lost.

266,Like the title says I met a girl on tinder and we kinda hit it off. I wasn’t really looking for anything serious and neither was she because she’s leaving to college in another state at the end of summer. Well I suggested that we have a summer fling (I guess that’s the word I’d use) and she was all for it. Well we talked for awhile and she wasn’t able to hang out for a long time but we talked every day about whatever. Then it just started to slowly drag on me. I started getting more depressed and just felt super lonely even when talking to her. Then we finally met up and saw a movie. After the movie we got each other off in my truck. I felt horrible after. I felt so alone and didn’t really think I could continue talking to her. I told her so and said we could still be friends and she kinda half heartedly agreed. We would talk for a little every once and awhile but I never thought too much of it and kinda just stopped talking to her. I moved on and started to seriously try to find a relationship. Today she told me that after we stopped talking she felt like she would never find anyone and that I fucked her up really bad with my rejection of her. She started cutting herself again and just felt super lonely. I feel super bad now and I’m not really sure what to do. There’s no way we could go back to what we were but also I think she’s slowly spiraling. She was already in therapy for her own problems.  I never realized how bad off she was on the depression side or I wouldn’t have tried to do this with her in the first place. She told me she gets attached easily and that it’s not my fault. I still feel like the biggest asshole though. I told her we can start talking every day again as friends and maybe more if she wanted and she said it wouldn’t be the same but she just needs time to get herself back together. I don’t really know what to do.,10Jun2019,1
267,"I'm 18/F. For the last few days I've been visiting another city, for the first time, and I've also been on my period. I'm not sure exactly how or why, but since the day I was got on the plane to come here, the top of my crack has been overall itchy and painful if I sit on it by accident or apply any pressure. 

I thought at first it was just my period blood leaking up there, or irritation from heat, but then it can't be because Imy period is almost over now, and I wash down there everyday. I finally wiped from the bottom of where its irritated tonight, and saw a ton of blood. Bright red, with what looks like blood clots as well.

268," 

quick warning this will be very very ramble-y and all over the place, i have no idea how to organise my thoughts (and it's like midnight), though i will try my best. you probably wanna read the tl;dr instead, i just kinda needed a place to dump a lot of my thoughts and not all of this is super relevant to the situation

(sorry for using a throwaway, some irl ppl know my reddit and i don't want them to see this)

Okay, so I'm 16 years old. I suffer from a lot of mental illness, namely really really bad anxiety, both kinds, and maybe ADHD? I'm transgender and my family is relatively ok with that, extended family is not as good but they're not too important. My dad is the super stoic type (have long suspected he never really wanted kids), and my mom is super emotional. When i was growing up, my parents didn't really have an understanding of mental illness (not their fault, but at least they should have thought something was up and looked into it, i was a REALLY weird kid). Being trans, i have to talk to a therapist and all that, and it's helped me way more with my mental issues, and being friends with other trans kids has practically gotten rid of my depression which is amazing since i was pretty suicidal as of like a few months ago. Anyway, after a session with my therapist, she talks with my parents about how i'm doing and to schedule and appt n stuff, which made my mother kinda realise that anxiety is something she's suffered from her entire life, especially since having kids. She's not a helicopter parent by any measure, but if i don't respond to a text or call within 30 minutes she really goes off the rails (not really my choice, phone is on its last legs and reception in our town is real spotty).

She just has massive separation anxiety with me and my older brother. He's 18 and is moving out for college by the end of the summer, and i'll be moving out next year (i'm gonna be a senior). He will be moving pretty far north, and my mom is not super ok with it. She is freaking out but i think she knows its reasonable to be ok with it, especially since he will keep contact. That is not what i want to do. Don't exactly want to discuss, but growing up with an undiagnosed mental illness and being closeted, plus just being a completely different person than both my parents put me through a lot of horrible things, and i grew to silently resent my parents. Living in this house is horrible and i hate being stuck here and dependent on them. **I do not love them.** They are completely unaware of this and still think i want to stay with them a few years after graduating high school. The only thing is, i know if i just cut them off my mother will FLIP. As previously mentioned, she gets separation anxiety and not knowing if i'm ok will not fare well for her. (i know i talked about not bearing to live with them but i don't wish any ill will on my parents. most of my hardship was the fault of their ignorance or completely unrelated to them. (also couldn't fit this anywhere else but i don't wanna be financially dependent on them either. they used to be pretty wealthy before the 2008 stock market crash since they both worked in real estate, but we've been dirt poor ever since (don't know much about the situation, it's mostly inferred; i was 6-7 at the time). they're already paying for half of my brother's college tuition which is going to be a LOT. especially since they already paid for 4 years of catholic school for him and 3 for me (i'm transferring out for my senior year, since the one i attended was single gender and that doesn't work too well with being trans))). In an ideal world, i would move out almost directly after graduation, but i'm going to graduate at 17, so i can't live on my own until like half a year after i'm done with HS (birthday is in november, you do the math). Would consider couch surfing until then, which would be pretty easy, i have a decent amount of friends and if worst comes to worst, there are a handful of abandoned places around town i can sleep that have decent unperishable foods and general necessities (leftover from before i came out, see: anxiety). Only downside to that is there's a likely chance she'll call the local police to find me and bring me home, as i won't be 18 yet, and i don't have the best relationship with the police here. Even if i couch surf, that's 6 months for the police to never see and recognise me. Also, won't have access to my meds or phone or anything since that's under them. i really really don't want to live there after i graduate but it seems like i have to

So moving out at graduation most likely won't be happening. can i move out when i turn 18? eh maybe. my two options are probably limited contact and cutting off. i know that my parents would NEVER understand why i want to do this. they are, as previously mentioned, completely unaware of the abuse i suffered; most of it wasn't on purpose or not directly involved with them. a sorry would NEVER cut it. i might be able to visit in the future, but i really can't stand living here for those extra months; i don't even know if i'm going to make it to graduation without going crazy. when i say cutting them off, i mean for a few years to get past all of this baggage and start a new life. i will probably see them again, though whether i will establish a permanent connection after that is up to future me. limited contact would be maybe talking to them once a month letting them know i'm ok. but because of the type of person i am, i know that would be horrible for me (i've been in kinda similar situations before, VERY long story). either way, i know keeping slight contact would suck for me, and it wouldn't do much to make my mother worry less. no matter which, she'll still worry and i don't think i should sacrifice my mental state to give her momentary relief (once again, even 30 minutes w/o contact and she goes crazy). i think that's all of it but i probably forgot a decent bit, the person that i am, so check if there's edits below

**tl;dr i'm 16, and growing up with undiagnosed mental illness and being LGBT caused me a lot of trauma that i want to escape ASAP, probably only once i turn 18. my mother freaks out if i don't talk to her every 30 minutes, so there's no way she could live talking to me even once a month, and i want to cut her off completely. there is no possible way she will ever understand why i want to do this, and will likely resent me for not being forward with it. what can i do, and is it worth taking constant reminders of trauma to momentarily satisfy her anxiety?**

The last days unfolded a situation where my husband told me he wasn't feeling the same way about our relationship and later I confronted him because I put two and two together and it turns out he has been seeing someone.
We have been talking, trying to work things out, see where everything goes. I have been dealing with heartbrake, sadness, distraught. I don't need advice about that at the moment. I'm going to go to therapy and seek for professional help as son as I can. I'm just looking for the right therapist.

274,"So my mother helped some relatives get citizenship in this country three years ago and have been living with us since. It was okay before, but it’s becoming very difficult now.

These people are emotionally abusing my mom in so many ways ever since the day my mom has asked them to go find another place to stay bc she feels she can’t support them anymore. 

They are very jealous and miserable people who are bitter when it comes to people do better than them and want others to take pity on them. These people love to come after me and my mother and throw mud on our names with other people and it’s so depressing that I wish that we had our old life back.

We have found and given them options for apartments to rent and they just ignore the offer, call people to say how horrible we are, and the cycle just continues.

I keep telling my mother she need to be heartless just one time and kick them out, but she keeps back out. I feel so bad for her bc I can see the looks on her face that she’s deteriorating. She 55 y.o. and when she’s stressed her legs swell and gets very anxious and irritated. It’s not good for her when she has to deal with this nonsense every day.

Is there a legal way to kick all of them out? We live in NY.

275,"Hello. Using a throwaway account because I'm not sure if the friend in question uses Reddit and I just want to be sure. To be clear, my intention is not to hurt their feelings or bash them, but rather to help both of us.

&amp;#x200B;

This is gonna be long, I'm sorry, but:

# tl;dr: An online friend seems to be an unhealthy pattern of overly depending on me for their mental health, not getting therapy, and upsetting/triggering me. However, I'm the only one they have, so I'd feel terrible to stop being friends, and I genuinely want to help. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

*(Note: bolding/italicizing important phrases for easier readability!)* 

&amp;#x200B;

So, to start, **I'm 16 and they're 17**. We both have had difficulties with making/keeping friends in the past, and this friendship is **exclusively online**, if it matters. We've never seen each other's faces, though voice chatted a couple times.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue... Well, I think they're a **good person**, and most of the time **they're very sweet** which I appreciate. That said, even quite early into our friendship, they started venting about **extremely serious topics**, typically **without warning/without asking**, often past midnight (both timezones) or other stressful times, and **not accepting any help**. I feel extremely stressed and worried about them, which I have tried to communicate and I feel they're not listening. I've asked about the subject of therapists and they tend to kind of wave it off, or say they'll try to find one yet they don't.

&amp;#x200B;

At one point a couple months ago, they DMed me at like 2:00AM if I'm remembering right, asking for mental health advice. I, myself, was on the verge of breakdown for unrelated reasons, so I took some time to steady myself, and then told them, as gently as I could, that although I would **try my best to help in the moment** (like linking to a page of grounding skills) unfortunately **I am not a therapist** and I feel worried they are depending too much on me when I **can't really fix long-term issues** as an untrained teen over the internet. I offered to *help them find a therapist* (well, like linking to locator tools and giving peer advice, since I can't give location-specific advice) They said sorry, went quiet, and then the next day they announced they were *taking a break* from Discord **""to be better""** \- I felt sympathetic *(and guilty...)* and wished them the best.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple days later they messaged me on another website just to chat. Then they returned to Discord. For a while things were looking better... Sadly, not so much recently.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate to say it, but even before the break, they've done things that **upset or even trigger me, repeatedly, without apologizing**:

* Related to **my eating disorder**, randomly saying *""I want to be (underweight) pounds""* despite I had previously informed them that I was recently-recovered anorexic so please don't do weight-related numbers. Then not too long later they randomly asked if they could talk about dieting and weight, and I appreciate they at least asked this time, yet I feel troubled at how they seemed to **forget such a crucial detail so quickly**.
* They frequently used **slurs** they can't reclaim, including as an **insult** and a mean-spirited joke. (""I call my brother \[uncensored homophobic slur\] all the time when I'm mad at him"") This heavily conflicts with **my moral values**, and they stopped when asked but **didn't apologize**.
* I'm not sure if I'm just too sensitive, but I feel like they **the majority of the time, seem to focus only on what** ***they*** **like** and want to discuss, **not what I or we both enjoy**, and *I feel unheard and lonely* as a result. (Also some of the things they like discussing are *also* upsetting/triggering to me, like violent shows/games, gore/horror art, etc) 
* And... I feel **afraid to bring up these** issues, outside of the immediate requests in the same moment, for fear of *offending or triggering them*. They're a very paranoid person and I don't want them to think I hate them.

&amp;#x200B;

Now they've **returned to the unexpected very-serious-details venting**, which again is really stressful because **I feel I can't help them even though I want to**. I've taken to outright asking how I can help them, and they often say *""Oh, a lot of ways but idk""* and just... *they don't tell me*, so I have no idea how to respond. Sometimes they specify after I try to make guesses (cute cat memes? gaming related stuff?) however I still feel nervous since their issues are so serious.

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight was kind of a breaking point since they said (paraphrasing) **""I'd ask if I could vent but it's serious, so nothing against you, but I should probably call someone.""** I apologized, asked if there's any way I can help, to which they replied ""it's best I talk to a therapist since it's so serious"" - which, I've been hoping they'd talk to a therapist for a while, so I hope they can get the real help they need... yet, something about the way they phrased all this made me **feel really uneasy** and worried. Especially since when I offered to link resources for finding therapists or hotlines, they just replied ""ok"" with no punctuation or anything, and didn't bring it up again. I don't want them to be hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this **isn't a healthy pattern** for either of us, and several other friends (and my mom) have suggested that I should end things, but I feel confused and sad since they are so sweet and generous most of the time, you know? They also tell me **they love me and talk about the generous gifts** they're gonna get me, so I feel so guilty for even *considering* that they'd be a ""bad friend"". They talk about how *they have* ***no other friends****, they are so* ***lonely****, I'm* ***the only one*** *who listens/understands*, etc, so surely **\*I\* would be the bad friend**?

&amp;#x200B;

And several times I have attempted to step back for a bit and not talk to them as much, and in response they tend to send things that I feel are kind of ""bait"" - like, after I took a break for a day, suddenly they sent *""I am bleeding heavily""* with no context, and when I panicked and asked if they're okay... *""Yeah I popped a zit.""* Uhh what? This sort of thing makes me feel uncomfortable but I can't put my finger on why.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I just feel incredibly confused, sad, worried, and hurt, and **I really don't know what else I can do**. I'm at a really low point in my own mental health (currently between treatments, since so few places are equipped to deal with my symptom severity) and I haven't been to regular school in 3-4 years, so I have nobody in real life apart from parents and doctors.

&amp;#x200B;

So... yeah, I'd just really appreciate any sort of advice. How can/should I support them? Is it a ""me problem""? Should I try to bring up the subject again so they'd hopefully try to change? If it *is* time to end things, how can I make sure I don't hurt or trigger them?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks. Stay safe everyone.",10Jun2019,1
276,"At work today I asked a manager what kind of music he enjoyed and he replied with ""anything but black music."" I was kind of taken aback with the comment and didn't really know how to react. Being half-black I was extremely uncomfortable for the rest of the day. I decided to approach him later when he wasn't busy and talk to him about the statement he made. He clarified that he meant black music as in rap music and ""didn't mean to say anything mean to me."" I thought of this as a learning moment and explained that generalizing all of black music (Which consists of a majority of genres) and stating you dislike it is a racist statement and he apologized for doing that. I thought I did pretty well until another co-worker said that I was being too sensitive and shouldn't have tried to lecture him after the initial apology. He also said that I shouldn't talk back to adults like that, especially a higher up. My dad told me that I'm in the wrong for not reporting him to a higher up and that he's a racist POS. He's also mad at me for not being angrier about it. I personally thought that the comment came from a place of ignorance and didn't see him as racist. However I'm not sure if I should take this higher or leave it and apologize. 


Tl;Dr: My manager makes an insensitive comment about black music and I feel uncomfortable. After a little questioning, I forgive him and take it as a teaching moment to talk about racial sensitivity.

IRL Friends- similar to family but will tell you how thier life is worse than yours and how your life is better (which pisses me off)

Internet friends - will make verbose reasons for you to get off social media just so they won't see your posts

279,"Hello there! I am 17 and am interested in drawing and animation.
I want to go to college to do animation in a couple years but I am not sure where to go.
The current options I'm considering would be going to one in Thessaloniki or in Scotland.
I am still a beginner and learning so whilst taking a couple gap years to save up I would like to develop my drawing skills on my own.

In my country the average salary is around ~350 euros but I am willing to goto some other country to work to save up.

Apparently rent in Greece is affordable, but the tuition in Scotland could be paid by the gov( I've heard that in Switzerland you can take a student loan that isn't too suffocating so that wouldn't be off the table either)

The problem is that I am gay, and would like to go to an country where I can be open about it, since it feels super suffocating in my current situation when someone make a good settup for a gay joke, but making the joke would expose me, and dealing with that would be annoying

So what I want to ask is: What college would be best for 2d animation? Where would be a good place to work for a couple years?",10Jun2019,0
280,"I'm a cashier and have been at a tourist destination in a national forrest for 7 years. 

So this kid comes in for like the third time that day with his sister after buying enough candy and energy drinks to kill a pack of wolves. 
He says, 

""Can I buy a lighter?"" The kid's maybe 12. There's absolutely no law saying he can't. But, just to make sure he's not gonna go burn down the forrest, I say,

""What are you gonna use it for?""
He says,

""To help my dad with the fire."" I don't really care, they're engraved souvenir lighters. Plus, it's not illegal so I sell it to him, so I was satisfied with the answer.

An hour or so later he comes back and says to the other cashier, ""Can I exchange this one for that one?"" He points to a 99¢ lighter when his was $5.99. There's a strict no refund policy and our boss will have our ass if we give a refund. The other cashier says,

""No sorry, you have to exchange it for one of the same price if you're going to exchange it."" So he's all upset and goes out.

A few hours later he comes back while I'm mopping and says, 

""Is it illegal to sell lighters to kids?"" He's clearly just mad about us not exchanging it, being reallllll bratty with his tone.

I'm mopping, he's just walked into the tiny patch of floor that was still wet tracking mud all over, I'm on the tenth hour of my eleven hour shift, and this is the fifth time I've seen this little shit. So I, a little snappily, respond,

""Nope."" And get back to work. He then says, 

""My dad says it is..."" At which point he whispers,

""He's gonna yell at you tomorrow.""

Suddenly I remember who this kid's dad is. He's come in a bunch of times over the last week and I saw him with the kid. He pretty much ignored everything I said every time and threw the money on the table. Like he ignored, ""Hello!"" And ""Is that it?"" And ""Would you like a bag?"" And ""Have a good one..."" Meanwhile he responds to his quiet wife as she whispers that she forgot sunscreen with ""We already checked out."" He was super rude and always flashed a ton of cash. One time he got to the line at the same time as this old lady (a local) buying ice cream (he had a whole cart of stuff) and just crossed in front of her to get in line first.

I Google it at home to savvy myself on the laws. I'm totally right. And what I really want to say to him tomorrow is,

""The only things I can't sell to minors at this store are tobacco, tobacco paraphernalia, alcohol, some cough medicines, and sharp objects. However, if you would like a say in what your kids buy at the grocery store, you're welcome to accompany them."" Of course at the end of that sentence I would imagine the words, ""you arrogant prick."" Is this too bitchy? Or just bitchy enough to leave me satisfied without leaving me fired?",10Jun2019,2
281,"I am not a school person. I’m 16 and fucking hate it although I can get pretty high marks. But everyone knows I’m not a school person; I’m more of a free spirit, I got 40% attendance in both years 9 &amp; 10 from ditching to the beach bc it somehow just made me happier. I’m bipolar and I’m DEFINITELY not keen on the idea of going to uni and getting a full degree with some sort of job that I won’t even be happy with. School just isn’t for me but I’m the last child in the family and everyone else in my family dropped out. So I have to make it... but I rather be doing something like tattooing or djing or anything fucking creative that DOESNT involve going to school. School drains me, nothing about it inspires me or shows a sign of a happy future for me. I have so much creativity and I know I can go places if I go do what I’m passionate about. I also love writing but just the idea of continuing school and staying in that environment; I know I’m not gonna be happy at all. You must be thinking so why don’t I go do what I love? I feel like I can’t. The whole family is breathing down my neck and they’re narrow minded thinking that going to fucking uni is the only success. I’ve been trying to get it through their fucking heads for years that there are other ways like tafe, apprenticeships (tattooing) but its culture, it’s engraved in their minds that you have to succeed academically. Everyone at school tells me I should do tattooing though, even the damn teachers tell me I should but my parents hate the idea of me leaving school or even getting a job... they’re so focused on me completing school. I wanna become a dj/producer but I don’t even know where to start. My family has financial issues so I think my parents feel like we don’t have the stability to take risks like leaving school and pursuing sth they don’t think is sustainable or guaranteed. I’m trying to find ways to enjoy school but there’s nothing in it. Bruh.. help. My dream career is djing but I don’t even know where to begin.",10Jun2019,0
282,"First of all, English is not my first language so I apologize beforehand for any mistake.

The last days unfolded a situation where my husband told me he wasn't feeling the same way about our relationship and later I confronted him because I put two and two together and it turns out he has been seeing someone.
We have been talking, trying to work things out, see where everything goes. I have been dealing with heartbrake, sadness, distraught. I don't need advice about that at the moment. I'm going to go to therapy and seek for professional help as son as I can. I'm just looking for the right therapist. 

The thing I would like to hear advice is, I've got till the 30th of June to submit the first draft of my thesis and I  haven't been able to get anything done. I'm asking a few days from work to advance on it, and I will be getting my tutors help. But I'm afraid I won't do much either in this days because it's really hard to focus on anything.

Has anyone dealt with something similar? What do you suggest I should do to focus on this Herculean task in this situation?

287,"(21F) I’m a caregiver, and I also own a (very) small business baking and selling cakes and cupcakes and the like. The baking business pulls in less than $200 a quarter and is mostly just a creative outlet, caregiving is how I survive. 

I’ve been caregiving for about two years, but last week was very traumatic for me. I had a patient who was dying, but her family refused to put her on comfort care. No pain meds of any kind. I sat by her side for three straight nights (~40 hours) as she screamed in agony. She had bed sores, multiple infections, a broken hip, and was a stroke victim. I took care of her for over a month prior to this, and watching her decline was heartbreaking. We had to roll her to change her, and float her with pillows, and every time we touched her she would scream and beg for help, and I couldn’t help her. I’m not trained or qualified to do anything except change her, bathe her, and sit with her during the night hours. 

She died last week. I wasn’t there. I don’t know if she was alone, or if she was in pain, or if they finally gave her some pain meds and just let her slip away. They didn’t tell me, so I’ll never know. 

I know I don’t want to do this anymore. If I’m going to continue in the healthcare field, I want to be able to actually help my patients, not sit there and wait for actual trained personnel to show up. At this point, I have two options. 

I could become a CNA. That wouldn’t do much, maybe a dollar or two more per hour. I could get a job at a different agency or facility but it would likely be more of the same. From there, I’d have to save up for awhile, then go to school to become an LPN. It’s a 1 year program and costs about 5K in my town. My parents have offered to help me out with the cost. I don’t live with them anymore and this is extremely generous of them, but I don’t know how much they are willing to contribute, plus id have to figure out how to pay bills while going to school and likely continuing to work part-time. Becoming an LPN is option 1, but it will likely take 3-4 years to complete, since I don’t have a lot in savings. In my state, LPNs make almost double minimum wage, which is a lot better than I’m making right now. And I could help people, like I’ve always wanted to do. 

Option two, I quit the healthcare field. I’ve always wanted to help people and I consider it my calling, but I could walk away and get a much less stressful job at a bakery or something. The pay would be back down to minimum wage and I’d have less schedule flexibility. I’d have to work far more to afford bills. However, I wouldn’t have to watch people die, or clean bedpans, or get bitten or scratched or slapped on a daily basis. I wouldn’t have to listen to the agony of the dying. 

I don’t know what the better option is. This thing with my patient last week has really screwed me up and I haven’t been sleeping, but I know I just can’t keep doing this forever. I need a plan for my future so I don’t break down again next time this happens.",10Jun2019,1

292,"So, last hear I went through a horrible breakup and was very stressed about my new job. I have terrible PMS and got very anxious and restless around the time of my period and then would be content and happy during the times I don’t have my period. I have always had trouble sleeping but it got worse when I broke up with my ex and I had a tendency to obsess about my ex and wasn’t able to sleep as well as I normally do (we dated for seven years and almost got married and he left me for another woman) and I needed sleeping meds. I also would have racing thoughts and I would get so exhausted I would sleep for 16 hours. 

So, I went to the psychiatrist and she said I had bipolar disorder and put me on lamictal. I really disliked the medication as I just was tired and after working on myself and ridding myself of my partner and building a better life for myself I have learned that I was anxious in general (which I deal with by exercising and breathing exercises) and probably get depressed at times because of life and my job (I work nights and sleep tons on my days off). 

I didn’t go back to the doctor after the first three times and literally I have never done anything reckless with my life or missed work or made mistakes because of this. 

So I’m renewing my license and it asks about being diagnosed with various psych disorders (bipolar disorder being one of them) “which impaired or does impair your behavior, judgement, or ability to function in school or work.”

296,"I'm a little upset, because this has been going on for a while. I know my style of working seems unusual and a little ""lazy"", if you go by what I have in my hands.

My workstation is a control room, and a lot is automated, requiring me to oversee what the automation is doing and correcting it every now and then. Hence there's a lot of downtime, and unofficially we are allowed to keep ourselves busy (three-shift work, 24/7/365) and alert during the shift with stuff we can technically drop immediately if need be. Because during a shift that is on a normal workday and office hours I usually use the downtime to sort some personal stuff, like insurance, organising some events, get-togethers, studying and yes, reading reddit. I can usually drop the stuff in a heartbeat.

However, sometimes I have to use office hours to sort some time-sensitive stuff, and I try my darndest to keep them to a minimum and not get in the way of my work. I'm the youngest of the bunch, but it seems also the easiest to get along with compared to others in the control room. At least I have heard (and being told to my face) that most non-ctrl-room personnel would want me to be here only on office hours.

My boss has a few times walked in the room only me to be on my phone, reading a course book or being engaged in a longer conversation with a coworker. Every freaking time he has to say ""office hours are for work, free time for personal stuff"". It's been a year, and it just doesn't matter how well I perform or how freaking on top of my game I am. Even if I am checking during downtime the time on phone or if there's any new messages (my phone is on silent, so it will not distract me during critical moments in the room. He has never worked in the ctrl room nor has he ever worked shifts. As far as I know, he has not told anyone else in ctrl room the same, even though they are watching TV on their downtime.

The place they were thinking were miles away from home and I'll be traveling alone, the place is extremely strict and has restrictions on everything. For example, I can't have a phone to contact anyone, I don't get to go outside without permission, I only get to eat the food that they serve, I have to share my room with like 10 other people etc.

I'm a shy girl and has a hard time adapting, my school years from start to finish were spent in the same school so my friends grew up with me.

309,"I met this boy named Tyler [20] a year ago at my [22] job. I had just started working there and he was one of my first friends. I worked in a different department than he did so we only talked sometimes but he began saying things we should do together such as working out or hot yoga. We became friends on Snapchat and I had posted something sad and sappy on my story and he responded to it saying he was always there for me and I could reach out to him whenever I needed to. This was strange because he didn’t really show any interest in my personal life until this point. Long story short, he had developed a crush on me and told me he couldn’t stop talking about me to his friend. 

He reached out to me multiple times on Snapchat and we began talking everyday all day until 2 am and he would send me good morning messages every day. We talked about hanging out, laying in bed together cuddling watching movies, he told me how much he trusted me and loved talking to me, and I even cried in the break room with him at work one time. He sat me down and listened to me cry and told me he wanted to help me in any way he could and that he really cared for me and hated to see me cry. He asked me for a hug and then he squeezed me really hard and let me know he would do anything to help me. He brought me food to work once and hugged me before he left, and had told me on multiple occasions that he thought I was very pretty.  We made plans to hang out 4 different times and this is where things went wrong. He kept canceling on me and making excuses. I was getting angry so I addressed him with anger and it turned him away. Basically we had a falling out and we stopped talking. He left my job 1 month later. 

I just recently made a new Snapchat and he came up on my quick add. I decided to try to add him just to see if he would add me back. He added me back and sent me a snap within 10 minutes. He was super excited I added him and we began to talk back and forth. I brought up everything that happened between us and apologized and he told me never to apologize to him because it was all his fault and he was extremely sorry for the things that went wrong between us. He told me he really missed talking to me and seeing me everyday at work. I addressed how he never followed through on our plans and he said he really really wanted to hang out but he was in a bad situation. We caught up on stuff we hadn’t talked about and then just spent some time conversing back and forth. I apologized if I was annoying him and he said “aha annoy me you could never annoy me”. So the problem is that he said all these nice things and complimented my appearance once again, but he randomly stops answering me and I found out he recently got out of a bad relationship (as did I) that he’s been in and out of multiple times in the past 2 years. She has cheated on him so many times and he keeps going back. 

My friends want me to keep talking to him because they think he has a crush on me still. I’m obviously very interested in him still but he randomly stops answering me and though he started our initial conversation, he barely reaches out to me. I asked him to hang out with me again and he said that would be dope but he didn’t follow through. He obviously liked me enough to even add me back and start a conversation but I’m confused by his actions.

 His ex will be going far away to school at the end of the summer while he will be staying local at our community college and I’ll still be living here too 

Should I make it obvious that I like him or keep it casual? Do you think he still likes me romantically or just as a friend? Is he still caught up on his ex for right now?

310,"Okay so at college, I spend pretty much most of the time alone. So there is this guy who sometimes stick with me and I don't like it. Because he brags a lot,  would keep me standing in the bus and he's still sitting he also let me pay for him many times and also he's big so he kinda creep people away from me. And he keeps walking with me around, people almost think we have something together and I'm already having troubles making friends, so any idea other than hiding in the bushes when I see him?",10Jun2019,1
311,"I’ve always had really bad speaking anxiety for as long as I can remember, even speaking on the phone to relatives and people I know makes me incredibly uncomfortable and nervous. With strangers it’s worse. I’ve never ordered food or anything off the phone, I always opted for the online option where I don’t have to talk to people. Phone call anxiety isn’t the only issue though, even talking to people I don’t know or needing to ask for help makes me incredibly scared so sometimes I won’t ask at all and I’ll let myself sit there and struggle until someone approaches me first. If I’m forced to interact with people, then I have to sit there and recite what I’m going to say a billion times in my head, and even when I say it I’m still terrified. I’m going off to college soon and I think it would be nice to get over my fear of speaking to people so that I’m able to ask for help when I need it, maybe make friends, and be able to finally order Chinese food or something by myself for once. I’m not shy, I quite like having people around to talk to, but my anxiety really just makes it hard to function. Any advice is appreciated!",10Jun2019,4
313,"I've started noticing that people stare at me for long periods of time, be it men or women. I was walking down the street and a guy looked at me intensely while staring my body up and down, another girl started biting her nails while looking at me. I was sitting and waiting for time to pass by, two women sneak glances at me and start gossiping, then when I look back one of them turned their head faster than light just to look back at me; another girl stares at me when I'm waiting for the bus, then runs INTO a friend I was with. These are just a few of the shitty encounters, and it's making me question whether I did something wrong, whether there's something on my face, or whatever man. It gets annoying because no one stares at the friends who are with me.",10Jun2019,0
314,"I'm a 16 year old in high school and I've liked this one girl (also 16) for a really long time. I'll call her Hollie so she can't be identified if one of my friends finds this. So Hollie is a very nice person, or at least that's what she acts like. Shes actually putting on a mask. I'm not sure but my friend called her a pathological liar and a potential psychopath because she feels underachieved compared to her sister. She's lied about having 19 y/o boyfriends, being raped, and other people being molested.

First off, on the surface, she is really nice. One of the nicest people I have ever met. I've recently started talking with her a lot these days. I'm quite sure she is starting to like me now. Just recently, one of my other friends, I'll call her Aly, told me about Hollie's true self. Aly and Hollie were friends during our first semester and there were many times that Hollie has betrayed her and lied to her. Hollie apparently constantly goes to parties and her 19 year old boyfriend gets her drunk and rapes her. Which is most likely untrue because he is presumed to not exist based on good evidence that's backed up. Hollie also stated that she has snuck in to her boyfriends (a 19 y/o waterpolo player) house and tied him down. Afterwards, she deleted her nudes then made up with him. A lot of her stories are very inconsistent as well.

She apparently gets physically abused by her boyfriend but shows no bruises. Sexually abused as well, she gets tied down and gets raped apparently. We presume this to be fake but what's worse is that she lies to her close friends. Her own best friend has NO idea of anything other than ""the proposal"". She was ""proposed to"" by her 19 y/o boyfriend and wore a ring (that looked like it was from walmart) for a bit. Then she dropped it for some reason. Aly, when she was still friends with her, wanted to meet him. Aly invited them to her workplace (a restaurant) then Hollie cancels last second. Aly asks for a picture of him and Hollie says she doesn't have any. Social media? None. She dodges every question.

Hollie spread rumours about my best friend molesting his cousins when they came over to visit. I know he would never do that and they arent even his cousins, they're his niece and nephews. When his ex (Aly) told him about this rumour, we traced it back all the way to Hollie. When we asked hollie, she said she heard it on the bus and that was it. No one really suspected her about this because she is really ""nice"". This was after Aly and Hollie had their fallout. For some reason, it got blamed on Aly and that's super unlikely. 

I genuinely like this girl. I'm afraid I've fallen in love with her mask instead of what's underneath. I've missed a lot in this story to make it a lot shorter. I'm sorry that it's so messy. All my friends tell me to run as far as I can but I dont want to. They say if she can make all these horrible lies such as physical and sexual abuse of strangers and people she doesn't know very well, then it will be much worse for me. I dont think I can take their advice though and I'll end up dating her over the summer because we already have some things planned. Apparently she broke up with her boyfriend around the time we started talking. 

What do you think I should do?
I genuinely want to date her and I don't think my current mental health will stand a chance if I end up taking my friend's advice.

317,"I was introduced to fragrances just a couple of days ago and since then I have spent 300 euros on perfumes.

The problem is that I am not an outgoing guy. 99 percent of the time I will wake up and go-to work and come back home and not go out. I am an introvert and like staying home. It's the odd time when I am meeting girl then I will be wearing a perfume. In that case I don't need to keep buying anymore perfumes. I will hardly run out of everything I have in the next 2 years.

318,"My brother is 13 and I'm 19, his sister. My mom pretty much despises the both of us, but I no longer live with her while he's still living with her. She recently re-married to a new man (we have two different fathers - both aren't around) and as far as I can tell, from the amount of boyfriends she's had as he's been growing up, he's basically very callous when it comes to violence, which I think he's been taught by them. He's really into the concept of gangs.

I feel like it may be because every man my mother's ever been into is an ex-convict, but I don't know. I have a good relationship with my brother, I think, but I don't get to see him very often. Usually whenever he is over he complains about how he's being treated; for one example, he told me about how his mom fought with his stepfather until 4 in the morning.

Recently it was his birthday and I wanted to get him something, and he really wanted an airsoft gun, so I bought one - but under the condition that I keep it with me and he'd only get to use it if I'm around. We still haven't been able to actually go out and do it yet, but I'm worried I'm doing the wrong thing.

My goal with it and the reason I agreed at first was because I was thinking it would be my opportunity to teach him to respect guns. His mom doesn't live in a great neighborhood and I'm terrified he's  going to be exposed to the wrong people, so I was hoping I could sort of get to him first and make him understand that even toy guns are dangerous and should be treated very carefully.

Anyway, I guess the advice I'm asking for is - is it a bad idea to do this? And if I do go through with it, how should I get across my point when teaching him, without making him feel like I'm being a dictator or something like that?

Any general advice on how I should help him survive living with my mom would also be appreciated, sorry this was so long",10Jun2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

Today I'm going to be graduating high school!! I walk for my graduation later on today and well, I just need ALL the advice you older people would advise on things I should know or do when getting out of highschool. I'm talking about from things that will benefit me career wise, emotionally, physically, socially, etc.

I'm doing pretty ok I guess, not top tier like starting college this fall and shit, but I do have some things lined out to prepare myself for school.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting UPS in 2 weeks, I'm planning to go to the gym since Planet Fitness is offering a free summer membership for 14-18 year olds, maybe looking into other hobbies as well. I'm now covering my car insurance and phone bill to help out my Mom to prepare myself for future bills and all.

Anyways that's pretty much it! Anything I should take a look into since I'm leaving high school and becoming an ""adult"" (I know 18 year olds aren't technically adults just because of age, but responsibility wise).",10Jun2019,1

329,"Hello, I'm a 17-year-old girl from the UK. My father is 87 and I live with him alone. Everything was okay-ish, difficult, but I could handle it, up until three months ago. He was hospitalized for a month, then again for 3 weeks last month. He was given a stoma bag (where you go to the bathroom out of a little opening in your stomach) and it's been impossible since then. He won't change it no matter how much you try to get him to until it explodes, and every day there will be poop all over the floors, chairs, bowls of liquid poop and dirty wipes in EVERY ROOM because he wanders around for some reason, and I try to clean it up as much as I can but it's impossible and I end up not being able to bring myself to clean all of it up as I feel like vomiting (I know it's babyish, I've always been terribly scared of bodily fluids and I can't seem to get over it).

I can't do all the laundry, so there's piles of soiled clothing and towels in the kitchen (unhygenic obviously but that's where the washing machine is). He can't walk properly anymore and therefore wets himself and gets it on all the chairs. He never communicates with me or tells me anything and he has now started falling over (yesterday I found him lying on the floor naked covered in poop at 3am) and he fell over getting out of the bath today. (I phoned 111 but they said if he's not showing any symptoms of damage we won't send anyone out). He is suddenly extremely confused and senile and often doesn't make any sense and talks nonsense, and starts shouting when I try to do things for him like insist he puts warm clothes on and let me get a heater for him when he was shivering, and he started saying nasty things about me which he has always done (he has always been a bit verbally abusive I think, which means I can't stand up to him much) but now I can't even leave the situation and go and be alone because then I wouldn't be there to look after him. I feel like a terrible daughter because I feel disgusted cleaning up after him and sometimes feel resentful as I can't go and visit my mother anymore or go out for more than a few hours. I've also stopped being able to shower often as I can't stand going into the bathroom anymore (he uses it daily and always has poop in it unless I spend a long time cleaning). He also gets angry whenever I seem upset by the poop (I try to hide it but it's hard) and tells me I'm treating him like a cow and that 'it's not poop, IT'S SUGAR, it's perfectly clean' and I still have no idea what that means.

When he was in hospital I told them not to discharge him as he isn't able to care for himself (he doesn't even take his medication which he's just told me today), and that I am scared that one day I will find him drowned in the bath, or he will fall over and crack his head or something like that, and then I will never be able to forgive myself. I told them he's not ready to come home but they didn't listen to me. I've phoned social services multiple times, they always say they are setting up a care system of nurses, it has been weeks and weeks and all they do is say they are still in the process of organizing it. We can't afford private care. One nurse comes in to do an injection and she does her best but it is nowhere near enough. None of the cleaning companies will clean up human waste like that and the NHS say they're sorting that out too but they clearly are not. My siblings don't like him due to his anger issues and clearly don't care enough to help (literally at all, even though they send me 'supporting messages' which doesn't exactly do a lot). My mother wants me to move out but I'm not going to leave my father to die. I feel as though the NHS are assuming I'm handling it and therefore aren't bothering to send help.

Also, he refuses to go to hospital again and says they are trying to kidnap him and keep him there. There's no way he would go into care or anything like that and I'm not going to force him against his will.

I don't know what to do and I just can't see a way out of this situation.",10Jun2019,1

A few of the other managers knew what happened. The thing is, I know I need to talk to him about it to clear the air, but I’m scared if I tell him I can’t remember a lot he will use that against me to say it was all me, when I don’t know if it was.

335,"I have been working on music and music-related ideas since 2011. That’s the year I started my first band. It is now 2019 and I’ve not a single piece of music released, recorded, mixed, mastered, whoever and whodunit. Here is a timeline of all the music project I’ve been involved with, and what ultimately dissolved them, just to add context:

2011-very early 2012 “Avenged Revenge”: Linkin Park cover band at first. Eventually started to write our own music. The band members, including me, had such unbelievably varying degrees of musical ideas that all it really did was cause arguments. Broke up. We had played a few shows, but nothing absolutely spectacular.

Mid 2012-Mid 2013 “Torque Bow”: I started rapping under this moniker, and even had gotten so far as to actually do some rap shows with some relatively famous local artists from my area. Self produced, but I never had a good enough mic to record vocals with, so I just made instrumentals, wrote lyrics, and rapped over them during the shows. I had been going through unbelievable amounts of personal turmoil because I was in foster care and bouncing around a lot, and never picked it back up after 2013 because at that point I didn’t feel the passion of rap music anymore.

End 2013-Mid 2014 “With A Vengeance”: Rap Rock band; we played a few shows and had 5 songs written only. The guitarist eventually just completely left for legitimately no reason, haven’t spoken to him since. Nothing ever came of this.

Mid 2014-End 2015 “NervBreak/Perceiver”: Probably my most successful bout with music. Played an uncountable number of shows. Had an EP and album written and planned to be recorded. Had an amazing timeline ready to go for our music lives. But guitarist eventually left because of creative difficulties/differences. We changed the name to Perceiver from NervBreak. We went a vastly more progressive metal route rather than nu-metal/rap rock. We got a new guitarist, but after we got the new guitarist, everything really fell apart. I won’t go too deep with this, but the entire band turned against me and posted numerous pieces of private and confidential information about me on the internet for seemingly no reason. I left the band and the entire situation. Still haven’t forgiven them, nor have the consequences of that particular time gone away. I’m still facing unwarranted backlash from that.

End 2016-End 2017 “The Hypnotist”: I took a break from music, and took some time to work on myself and took time to think. I came back to music with The Hypnotist. It was an amalgamation of rap, rock, ambient, and heavy industrial music, all produced by me. I had produced and written literally about 23 songs, going to be split over two albums, when a power surge hit where I was living, and somehow completely wiped both my laptop and my desktop computers memory. The files were irretrievable and unfixable. 

Mid 2017-Present “Nominalist”: At the time I was in the heat of writing music for The Hypnotist, I joined a progressive metal outfit once more as vocalist. We have a whole album written, and have had it written about 3 different times. Personally, and I have nearly had it with the indecisiveness of the other members. Whenever we are on the cusp of being able to go to a studio with our music, and get our sound to the next level, one of the other three back out, but I am always the go-getter in terms of motivation. 

Now, on this very early morning in Florida on Monday, June 10th, 2019, I have hit my absolute breaking point in terms of giving up on music for a while. My dreams of becoming at least a touring musician have done nothing but make me worry, send me into turmoil, or just have me sitting in unhealthy mindsets for basically the entire time I’ve tried.

I just need advice on what I should do, or if my feelings right now are just explosive or something. I am on the brink of giving up.

336,"About two years ago I made friends w a guy on tinder. We became really close friends, and this led to us developing feelings for one another while he was in a relationship (this is relevant, I promise).

We never explicitly talked about what we wanted to be in the future, which led to my imagination running wild with fantasies, and I was beginning to hope for a relationship in the future, once he had broken up with his then gf. Well he did end up breaking up with his gf, so I took the chance to ask what the future for us holds, and he said he wanted to be single for a while, which is understandable.

339,"So......

(Dear god I hope he doesn’t find this)

So I have a friend who we’ll call Marcus. Marcus and I met because of my best friend, who we’ll call Regina. They both go to a different school so I mainly talk to them over text. I used to not generaly like Marcus and we used to quarrel a bit over text. I have an ex who we’ll call George. He was the reason I’d get so mad at Marcus because Marcus would constantly insult George and we’ve gotten into fights because of George. 

I broke up with George after a week because of things Marcus said about him that I believed. During that time I started actually voice chatting with Marcus for playing video games and stuff and I started to think “Hey he’s not that bad (personality wise).” And I’m not sure but I think this is when I started to develop a bit of a crush on him. Our friend group went to the movies and I met them all for the first time in real life (except for Regina ofc I met her many many times) and I sat next to Marcus during the movie. I was blushing for a good part of it and was very flustered. 

Fast forward a week or two. George and I got back together. My ex and I had a good time to say the least but I think I always still liked Marcus without realizing it. I dated my ex for four months and also during those four months I became closer friends with Marcus. I went through a lot of emotional pain while dating George and Marcus was kind of there for me like a good friend. I realized I liked Marcus more than George and then eventually broke up with George. Also it’s important to mention that George and Marcus eventually became friends when we were dating. 

This is where the problems come in. Marcus met another girl. We’ll call her Winter. Marcus had met her once a few months ago on a trip and had made out with her (which is actually unlike him) and he had met her again recently. Now Marcus and Winter are actually a thing although she lives hours away and they knew each other for 2 days irl. 

And I’m jealous. I hate to admit it. But I’m fucking jealous. 

But jealousy wont help either of us. So here’s my question: what should I do? How do I get over someone who is a good friend of mine? Should I tell him how I feel? Or is there another solution rather than just cutting him off?",10Jun2019,46
340,"Preface: She dumped me. The breakup didn't involve any fights, but it wasn't amicable, I was sad as hell and didn't want her to leave. I stopped communicating with her over text, phone, or in person the day after the breakup, to heal, about two months ago. We're both 24. I would be willing to get back together if she wanted to.

So my ex-girlfriend, last Wednesday, reached out. She texted me out of nowhere saying ""We haven't spoken in so long, how have you been? I answered curtly and politely, because I had no idea what she was doing. She ended up complimenting me a ton,  encouraging me to get a side job at where she works, and being really strange.

Late Wednesday night, I told her that it was nice to text, but I felt like I still needed space.

So then I think about it over the next two days. Friday, she happens to show up at a social event, as we share a lot of friends. She's being unusual the whole time, coming over to where I am, etc.

That night I decide to text her, because I thought it wouldn't hurt. I tell her I made a mistake Wednesday, and that we can text if she wants to. So then she profusely apologized for mentioning something embarrassing to me at the social event, in a super long paragraph. It wasn't even that bad of a thing.

So then for two days we text all day. Non stop, from 7 am to 2 am. She began confiding in me, and just isn't letting the conversation die. It felt really weird, really similar to our texting while we were dating.

So then, last night, she says good night.

She says ""Goodnight! Have an amazing night, [pet name]!

So yeah. She used her pet name for me. I stared at my phone in shock at that.

341,"I'm envious of my youngest sister because she's opinionated, independent, quick thinking, rational, logical, objective and analytical. I'm emotional, subjective, highly sensitive and intuitive. I don't bother arguing with her because she can and will win any argument. It feels like I cannot keep up with her intellectually. I sometimes get annoyed by her playing devil's advocate and never opening up emotionally. She is comfortable giving her opinions but won't get close to people.

 It feels like I cannot disagree with her because she has stronger critical thinking skills. She can easily outthink me. Like if I have to prove myself to her. I generally concede to her arguments. I never tell her when I think she's in the wrong. I feel inferior to her because I'm more emotional and very sensitive. I wonder what she can learn from me. I'm always learning from her.

What is your advice",10Jun2019,1
343,"So currently I (21m)am enrolled in a cis program and have about 6 more classes before I get my associates.

 The further I get into the classes the more I think that this isn't for me. I'm tech savvy,I play PC games,custom build PC's,etc it made sense at the time to go to school for something similar. But I don't see myself enjoying this line of work on a larger scale with more in depth stuff such as user policies and just managing a server. I think that I messed up by trying to turn a hobby into a career.

 I've been tossing around the idea of switching majors and one that seems ideal is nursing. I've tried researching other majors at my community college and seeing if any peek my interest,can't really say for sure.

344,"I had a breakup in January with a guy I was seeing, and things went pretty bad pretty fast. We didn't break up for any bad reason, except he shouted at me quite a lot and had a habit of punching walls, destroying furniture, and so on. I ghosted him waiting for him to end the relationship because I was scared of what would happen if I broke it off - so I let him break up with me and went on with my life. He tried to get into my apartment one night after he broke up with me, which was honestly scary. I thought it would end there, but he's been making things hard for months since.

He flirted with all my friends, groped female classmates to try and make me jealous, then started spreading rumours about me. He wrote a diss track (yes, this guy is 21) calling me a bitch, a cunt, and the devil, and he played it to all my friends whilst telling them I'm a horrible person. I can no longer speak to the mutual friends we had because they avoid me, and I now feel super paranoid in class that people dislike me. Not to mention it's been 4 months and he still stares at me from across the room - it's creepy. 

I moved from another degree onto this one, so I don't know many people on the course, and the girls I am currently friends with aren't really the nicest. I had to ask some of them to help me file an official complaint about him harassing me but none of them came through to help, which was kinda sad lol

I'm on summer break right now but I can't help but worry about what third year will be like - is it going to be awkward? Is graduation going to be horrible to endure? I just need some advice on how to make the best of this situation and not let other people get to me. What can I do?",10Jun2019,1
345,"So I'm not really sure how to feel, every other day, she might have these moments with other guys where she says she loves them and can't live without them, and sometimes if they initiate a sexual convo, she continues it.. for example: 

Guy: Hey I'm about to go to bed, wanna join me?
My gf: hell yeah take your clothes off
Guy: they're already off ;)
My gf: *tongue emoji* it'll be tasty 
Guy: love you *wink emoji*
My gf: love you too *heart emojj*

 I know it doesn't mean anything more than friends, but it does bother me because it's hard hearing those words come from her towards another guy (like 3 other guys) it makes me feel like her ""I love you""s are a lot less special and when she says it to me, it just doesn't feel as genuine as it use to, because I realise she just says it to a lot of people..

Am I wrong for getting annoyed with this? I personally dropped all love/sexual comments with anyone else as soon as we realised we liked each other, I don't think I can ever say it to someone else..

351,"Hi there, posting this via a throwaway account, for reasons.

Sorry for the wall of text, TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I have manoeuvred myself into what is commonly called a quarter life crisis and could use a bit of advice and sober views on my situation. I am a 25 year old single male, currently employed at one of the top engineering companies world wide, with a pretty good career path laid out in front of me. I am at the same time finishing up my PhD (Engineering) which should be done by next year. During high school and university I was always (grade-wise) the best, had the looks, was pretty popular and everyone **always** projected huge successful careers for me - I always tried to respond in a humble way though. My father was very successful in a similar industry I am in now (CEO responsible for 5000+ people) and was in many ways my role model and was always telling me that I should strive only for the best and that I had every possible chance to be successful and get everything I'd want, but that I shouldn't surrender my life to money, because time was worth more than money and could by no means be bought. At the same time he regularly made fun of people who wouldn't want to work overtime and essentially painted them losers. (You can see a bit of dissonance here)

After high school I knew I was going to go to university, but I still wasn't sure what field of study I'd go into. The two main options I weighed were medicine and engineering. I was admitted to three different medical schools, but still chose engineering. I thought about it a few months, but still wasn't 100% sure why I made that decision. Engineering felt more natural, engineering felt like the world was open for me, with engineering I could decide after university what I concretely wanted to do and in the worst case switch to a completely different industry or even go into banking/consulting. I wasn't as restricted (also money-wise, medicine is kind of capped at one point) to a career path as I would've been in medicine. (Not completely true, but that was my impression back then) Add to that that I was always really interested in technical things, taught myself to code when I was 11, worked as a freelancer in programming in my teenage years (for fun) while still having a social life and straight A's, so engineering seemed like the naturally correct decision. Everyone still always assured me that I'd surely make enough money, would lead people, would have the ""perfect"" life. Most of the time I quietly acknowledged what they'd say to me. I didn't really want to set myself goals that were too far fetched and set myself up for failure, only because the goals were set too high. Still, I always told myself I wouldn't marry before the age of 40 (so not to be emotionally attached and thus slow the advancement of my career) and that I would do everything to do successful, I would be willing to go to any country in the world and work as hard as I could (80-100hrs) to achieve everything I could.

Almost half a year ago, I moved to a new city where I didn't know anyone. That was the third time I did this in my life, every single time turned out to be the best thing I could've done in my life at the time and I enjoyed the freshness and anonymousness of my new life to the fullest. This time it was a bit different, I moved from what I consider the most beautiful most liveable city in the whole world (I have seen most of the world's big cities so far) where I had a lot of friends that I genuinely valued and loved to a city of similar size, where I knew no one. I made a few new friends, and on went the praising of my person, after a few weeks those people would seriously tell me: ""It's so refreshing to talk to a person with an IQ of 140."" ""I can't understand why a person like you would still be single... you are witty, cute, intelligent and successful."" ""Women have to love you"". I didn't really feel connected my new friends and withdrew a bit, while missing my old friends - I would visit them every few weeks for a day, but still. At the same time I ""dated"" a few girls from Tinder and went to clubs only to get laid. (new city and everything). (Always quite successfully, never anything serious though) I did already do that back in the old city, but always had a notion that this didn't do anything for me. I felt no connection to those girls, we both knew we only wanted an orgasm, and even the sex was mediocre because we both were completely wasted most of the time.

A few weeks later my hairdresser told me I was starting to lose hair. He was right, I looked at old photos and it had been going on for a while, I just hadn't noticed. I suddenly realized my easy years were over, that my youth was not never-ending and I was getting old. That was the first time I genuinely thought I was getting old. I did realize how my whole life was focused on vanity. I realized that the only reason I was buying handmade shoes, expensive watches, designer clothes and huge bottles of vodka and champagne at the club was to try to impress other people, mostly people I didn't know because I at least knew I didn't have to impress my friends. I realized that one of the reasons my last relationship had to fail at one point (besides the reason that my ex cheated on me) was that I was constantly thinking about how I could get an even better girlfriend, one that other people would find even more unattainable, one that other people would attribute even more status to. (Even though my girlfriend was already very successful, loving, beautiful ...) I started to read up a bit on mindfulness, meditation and shamanic rituals and trance. Started to completely get my diet in order (I had already been reading scientific papers about endocrinological topics for a few years, so I knew a bit about optimization thereof), started to take only cold showers and stopped masturbating on a regular basis. I was thinking of all the things I had in my life that I really appreciated for a longer time than the short moment after I attained whatever that was. About 3 weeks after not having an orgasm, there were moments during the day when I suddenly felt overwhelmed by emotions. (Resensitization of dopamine receptors or lower prolactin, whatever it was) During some of those moments I even started to tear up, because the realization of how my whole life was focused and directed on vain things hit me even stronger - things that wouldn't have any value apart from potentially impressing superficial young girls at the club when I was 40, still alone, all my friends married, having children and having a life outside of their career.

I realized life was about people, not about things. I didn't need a bigger apartment in a better location, a bigger and faster car and even more expensive clothes, let alone an even more expensive watch. I realized my life was focused on loving things and using people, when it should have been the other way round: Love people, use things.

I am not *loving* my job and field anymore, but I still cannot complain in any way. The work I do is appreciated, I get paid well and I get every support I need/want. It seems as though engineering, business and industry lost most of its appeal when I turned away from vanity and from the plan of investing all of my time and life in my career. If I wouldn't do that and stay at a normal full time job, I wouldn't progress any further and would essentially do the same I am doing now for the rest of my life. I came back to thinking about medicine. I had been reading medical scientific journals for a few year, only out of curiosity and because I'm so interested in the human body. Even a few people I know who are at med school asked me things they didn't fully understand or their professor didn't touch during the lectures that I was able to answer without doubt. By now I know so much about the workings and anatomy of the human body that people constantly ask me why I didn't study medicine. ""You'd be such a great doctor"" (there we go again ...) I constantly entertain the thought of being a doctor, helping people and working with people. From a financial standpoint, it is not clear if that decision would be wise in any way. I would had an immense work load and I wouldn't make any money during the time in med school and not much money during residency. I would probably lose up to a million in lifetime income by switching. But at least I could attribute meaning to the things I'd do, I could to something people appreciate or at least something that helps them, which I'd love. The things I currently do feel a bit meaningless. I could even do all of that without a student loan, I don't have any debt right now.

I found a post here on reddit talking about factors that influence quality of life in one's 20s:

1. What you do all day: Loved it once, don't love it anymore, it's not bad though.
2. The people you are closest to: I see the people I was/am closest to every few months. Same goes for my family.
3. Where you live: Don't really like the city
4. Where you physically live (Apartment etc.): My apartment is nice, nothing special.

So I got 1/4 figured out, whereas I had 4/4 before moving here.

Now I am at the first real crossroad in my life. Let's see how those factors would play out for each one:

* I could finish my PhD continue my currently laid out career path in the city I'm currently in  
This is probably going to be 1/4 for the next year(s) and is going to tend to 3/4 if I find better friends or a SO here
* I could finish my PhD, quit my job next year and get into consulting, moving back to the city I moved away from (there is no real tech/industry there, unfortunately)  
I wouldn't love consulting, I already know that, but I could be in the city I fell in love with and (at least during weekends) be with people I love, I'd have by far enough money to live, so 3/4
* I could quit my job right now, throw away all the work that went into my PhD so far and go to med school this winter (not 100% sure if this is possible time-wise, but should be doable - but I'd be in a completely different city again)  
1/4, I'd have to deny myself the way I am currently living and would need to spend less, wouldn't be with people I am currently close to and wouldn't be in that lovely city
* I could finish my PhD, move back to the city I came from, go to med school next year (fall term) and work to be a doctor.

Again, sorry for the wall of text. I really don't know what I should do with my life. I feel constantly irritated, weak, kind of confused, disappointed with myself. I appreciate any input you guys can give, be it your own experiences, an advice, analyses - anything!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  25M, finishing PhD in engineering next year, great job in the engineering industry, I was always focused on making money and being successful, moved away from friends/city I fell in love with, reflected on my life, realized money/success doesn't trump people/personal connections/relationship, life and work now seem rather meaningless, I was always interested in medicine, I could go to med school and move back to friends/city.

352,"I found a dating site on my dad's (around 50 y/o) phone history,  visited about 8 times in the last few months. That's the extent of the digging through I've done. I hesitated to go any further because that's how I discovered my fiance was cheating.

There is a miniscule chance that this is true, but the website was very specific to our location and targeted to people his age. 

Dadtravels a lot for work and isn't home a few days of the week. 

Us kids are all in our 20s so it doesn't really concern us.

And I don't really care if my parents are in an open relationship or have an agreement, but only cares if it will hurt my mom.

So my options are:

1. do I have the right to dig deeper and determine if he is seeing other people?
2. Do I simply ask him?
3. Do I dig deeper and then confront him?
4. Do nothing

Personally, I'm inclined to find out if it is true and let him know that I know, and let him deal with it after. I won't force him one way or another, but I just feel like if that is the case, sometimes people need a wakeup call.  

If I do confront him, what's the best way to do it?",10Jun2019,5
354,"I got into an accident about 10 days ago. Was riding in the highway and a van behind me wanted to overtake me but after overtaking, while merging back she did not see me and she side-swiped me. I wobbled and ended up falling on my right side. We exchanged particulars and because i was wearing gear (thank god) my injuries were not too severe but i went to the clinic nonetheless. I did not suffer any broken bones just some abrasion on my right shoulder, and right knee. I was given 7 days medical leave. There is a law in my country where if there was an accident and the injured party received more than 3 days medical leave, a police report is to be made. So i made the police report and i informed my insurance company on the same day. I had a helmet camera that loop records every 15min and unfortunately, when i fell the camera hit the ground and the battery dislodged causing it to turn off and not record the accident itself. I have the footage till about 2min before the accident. Today i find out that the lady that hit me had told the insurance company that i tried to overtake her on the left side and i hit the left side of her van. On the day of the accident she had told me that she had a dashcam but in the report she had said that she did have any footage. So when i ask the insurance company about what happens now they say we will just have to wait for the traffic police report. Im fine with this but the thing is, now she is just putting the blame on me and i have a slight disadvantage as i have only been riding for 2 months.

I was buying it online (fb, OfferUp, letgo). The man’s account is verified, he responds fast, food items for pretty low prices, and almost 100 followers. 

The car is a 2003 Jeep that seeks for about 1100 for other people. He was selling for 950 because one wheel bearing needs to be replaced and the check engine light is on from a loose gas cap. 

Good phone convo and he offered a discount because my ride originally wanted me to meet him but he has work. He changed his schedule and said if we can drive the whole 40 mins, the car is only 800.

As far as what’s wrong, a wheel bearing needs replacement therefore it is noisy and the gas cap is loose and the check engine light is on. 
The description that he posted says the car runs and drives, new tires, strong motor, and new battery.

(Off topic:  Walking home at night, she brought it up again and I’m not sure how, but we got into an argument. It was soon after I asked her about lying when I ask her if she really wants to go places with me when I ask her. Her answer was no. That made me raise an eyebrow. )

During the argument she starts accusing me of all these things that she does/also does (I explain to her that were literally related so genetics doomed us to the similar mental problems) and she asked if my therapist ever says anything about me flipping the script on other people all the time (which is actually what she was doing by saying that, I was just telling her that she’s getting mad at me for something she also does such as buying a car on Facebook with issues (in which she accidentally admitted that her gas tank issue that she had when she moved in which she used to lie to get extra money to drive to her friends house out of town and then denied). 

Mind you we were walking home at almost midnight and she’s shouting  through my quiet neighborhood streets to prove her point. 

She also denied that her car had a few issues when she bought it even though her dad had to fix it  and accidentally turned the charging ports off so there’s another problem with her car. 

She went as far as to call her parents have me disincluded from parts of the conversation but I will admit that her parents told me that buying cars online is sketchy. 

Her parents also eventually said that your first car isn’t going to be perfect like how *literally all of their cars are one their dad fixed up after buying from someone else*

361,"So,I'm (M14) gonna refer to this girl as Maria/M (F14) just for anonymousness. 

Backstory (skip if it's too long)

I'm friends with a couple of girls from a neighbouring school and one of them became friends with Maria sometime around last year, before school ended. We talked a bit around the start of the last school year and talked a bit more (sometimes anonymously though) on a meme account (I use meme very loosely there because it was just basically them slagging eachother on instagram) she was one of the admins of. We only started properly talking about a month ago though.

Now, in my group I'm known as the ""el desperado"" because I've never been in a proper relationship before, despite being one horny mofo. This has led to me asking out countless girls, all to no avail, because I get feelings for them very very quickly. 

Anyway, we started Snapchatting and we discovered we had similar music tastes (Nirvana specifically). A friend of mine gave me some help with her (after I was out with her and my friends for a bit) as I had kinda got feelings but I didn't act upon them. 

The day after I got the help, it was one of my friend's (F15 but she's not important) birthday party, and M was there with a bunch of others.

However, cause I'm borderline retarded, it got out that I liked her (probably from someone else who was messing or maybe it was just obvious)

She obviously knew but didn't mention it and we kept talking as normal. 

We've been out with eachother a couple of times and she hasn't seemed to be creeped out or anything and she basically just treats me normally.

The part I want advice for is this part:

She's giving off mixed signals to me and my friends and it's confusing me.

Signs that she doesn't like me:
•She's told both her friends and my friends that if I asked her out, she'd say no.
•One of her friends said she doesn't like me or anybody in that way and hasn't before.

Signs that she does like me:
•She sent me a picture of her in the shower (neck up obviously) but it was obvious it was in the shower.
•She sent me a picture of her in a bikini with a tower covering her lower half (she also put that up on her spam story but it was a different picture)
•We've talked more than once till 1 or 2 in the morning and she usually responds fast enough to my snaps.
•Her friend who told me she doesn't like me keeps flip-flopping between saying I should tell her and that I shouldn't.

She's never really liked anyone before (according to her friend) and my idea is that maybe she doesn't want people to know because she's afraid she'd be made fun of.

I also have been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and can be quite an introvert. English isn't my native language btw. 
I don't really have any friends living in the city that my dad lives in, so most of the times when I'm there I'm chilling like a couch potato or I do stuff with my dad like going to the movies. I don't really mind the couch potato lifestyle; I like being by myself, and it's not like I never do stuff with friends at other times.
So, last week I was there from thursday afternoon until monday morning, due to a national holiday. Sunday evening my stepmom confronts me saying that she'd rather see me leave that evening instead of leaving the next morning. I felt quite attacked and asked her why she thought that, after which she responded that she needed time to cuddle with my dad, and that she can't do that with me around. I was like ""Hey, normally I'm only here 2 days every 2 weeks, is that too much to ask? Am I not welcome here?"".  She said that she can't handle anybody being there for multiple days, be it me, a friend or her own mother. She followed up saying that the reason she has trouble with me is that she sees me being a couch potato and is worrying about me, worrying that I end up lonely and depressed later in life. She would much rather see me go out and do stuff with friends when I'm there. I ended up saying I'll go join an acting club again, which I also did when I was younger, to get more of a social circle.
I can see her point, I don't want to end up lonely and depressed either, but it's not like I feel particularly lonely when I'm there. I feel like this is more of a 'her' problem than a 'me' problem. But I don't think she really meant harm either; she did say she thinks I'm a good kid and she wants the best for me.
Right now I just don't know what to do. Joining an acting club will be a few months away for me cause of other circumstances, and it won't necessarily mean I have more to do in the time when I am at their place. I'll be visiting them again next weekend, but I feel like I can't be comfortable being there anymore, when everytime I'm not really doing something meaningful I know I get judgemental thoughts from stepmom potentially leading to another discussion. But I want to keep seeing my dad as well.
Any advice on what to do? Also, any thoughts on the argument? I'm not sure whether I'm just a stubborn aspie and need change and should listen to her or whether she went out of line and I just need to stand my ground. Thanks.",10Jun2019,1
365,"I am an extreme introvert and for some reason lately one of my extroverted friends will call me out of the blue. While it feels good that someone would think of calling me, and that's my bitch and I love her, I hate talking on the phone. There's no anxiety, it just gets me a bit irritated/restless. Especially if someone calls me for something that could have been a text. I rarely answer the phone for anyone. I will ignore her call and give an excuse later, and the groupchat will go on like nothing. I don't want to be selfish though, and although I don't understand how her mind works I want to be considerate. She is also trans so I don't want her to think that it has anything to do with it as a former friend of hers would ignore her calls/texts for that reason. 

Should I just tell her I hate talking on the phone? Should I just suck it up and pick up when she calls? How do I go about this as a mature adult (we're both in mid-20s)? I'm an attractive, pretend-extrovert-in-public, normal (whatever that means) person so I don't want her to think I'm lying when I say I genuinely hate talking on the phone because I don't give off that introvert vibe face to face. What would make us both happy and not negatively impact the friendship?",10Jun2019,0
366,"Just got woken up by my grandma today to hear that I have ONE YEAR of probation because of me getting in trouble at school. 

Friday, a girl in school snitched on me and the school found me with a practically empty dab cart and a vape. 
I got 4 days suspensions 4 days in school suspension. 

And the famous grounding of my parents. 
Couldn’t that be enough?
No, now I have probation for a year. 

I don’t know the NJ laws for probation, can I drink?
Will they find out if I’m still vaping?

What do I do?

Now that I have a charge, I can’t get certified as a nurse. Won’t that kill my parents. 

So now there’s LITERALLY no reason for me to be going to the high school I go to anymore. 

I don’t know what to do. 

My boyfriend says it’s okay, it’s “practice” for whenever I get pregnant. That we can go do fun stuff instead of smoke. That I can drink? (I don’t know if I can)

370,"So I started playing guitar at age 18 and I'm 23 now. By 19 my mom bought me my first real guitar(after I bought my first cheap one) and over time, my guitar neck slightly bent - causing the 'action'(distance between the fretboard and strings to increase, which basically makes it way harder than it's supposed to be to press your fingers on the strings) and I would tire faster due to the increased effort I have to exert when pressing the strings every time I play. This frustrates me and I honestly don't know that to do. Honestly I don't even have that much mental energy to make sure I'm conveying my points properly. I don't plan on just whining and actually want to be solution-oriented as tempting as it is to just whine and be a victim.

For those not familiar with skiplagged, it's a online airline service that finds tickets through layovers. For example, you want to go to NY? You can take a flight to Boston with a layover in NY for cheaper that going straight there.

I was taking one of these flight and I had a small roller carry-on, and they could not gate check it, so they where going to check the bag to my final destination, I told them I wanted it to go to my ""layover"" and they said it was impossible and that there was absolutely no over head space for it to go, and they could not reissue my ticket (cancel the ""final"" desitation flight) and I had to buy a whole new ticket which I did because if I didn't in the next 5 min I'd have missed my flight and be late to work.

Yesterday Friend2 told me, that he has access to gf's WhatsApp account.  I won't explain why and how, but he has access and can read all of her messages. I normally would just message gf or Friend1 and explain them the problem, but Friend2 said I shouldn't tell anyone that he has access to the account. If I would, it would probably destroy the friendship with him, and I don't have many friends.

375,"I'm generally a pretty happy person, and people seem to like me a lot, which I really appreciate. I'm in a great place in life generally and I love my friends and family. However I had a tricky upbringing, and when I was a teenager I a creep. I pestered girls for nudes (sometimes relentlessly), and this probably happened with many girls over the years. It never got to the point of stalking them or following them home or anything like that, it was purely over messenger/text. On a couple of occasions I had a bit of a tantrum when I didn't get nudes, but most of the time I just slunk off and didn't ask again. It developed into a bit of an obsession with boobs. I never did anything illegal (like I never spied on them or anything like that), but a couple of times I did draw what I imagined some girl's boobs looked like, without including her face in it. I'm pretty sure the drawings got thrown away. 

The only nude I ever received in this was when I was 17, from a girl who was 18, so no illegalness there either (I'm in a country where the AOC is 16, but you can't take pictures until you're 18). Every girl I asked was at least a couple of months older than me, because I was the youngest in my class at HS. 

When I was 18 I went to therapy for this as I realised it wasn't normal or nice, and the requests for nudes were probably giving girls a bad experience with guys in general. I had 7 sessions, and it really helped. Even the therapist said he was surprised how well it was working (I think because I realised it was a problem, understood CBT a little bit and had tried to do it on myself). Since then (I'm 22 now), I've got the feelings occasionally but I've been through the plan the therapist gave me, and at this point it's almost automatic, I can process the feelings and they're gone.

I'm now starting to get a bit well-known in the music industry. I know it probably won't amount to anything, but I keep getting this nagging feeling someone's going to come out and say I asked them for nudes when we were both underage, and my life is going to be ruined. This is making me tear my hair out and stopping me sleeping, and it has been for about six months. I've considered s**cide and had to call an emergency helpline about three times. I know what I did was bad, but it wasn't that bad, and it could easily get blown out of proportion. This is hell and it's really affecting my ability to love people and be happy.",10Jun2019,1
376,"Tl;dr One of my best friends blocked me pretty out of nowhere and I'm kinda fucked up over it. Any advice?

I'm gonna keep the long version kinda vague but basically I had an online friend (we'll call them Jay) that I've known for a couple years. We used to chat every day and were both part of a group that shared the same kind of artistic hobby. One member of our friend group was pretty toxic (always had to be the center of attention and threw fits if they weren't, gaslighting, crossing boundaries, accusing me of copying for some VERY basic things that were not unique to them at all, and just generally being kind of awful to people). This went on for the better part of a year. The problems really arose when our friend group kind of split up and I blocked the toxic friend as I was just made super uncomfortable by them. 

Jay and I still chatted for a long time after this, even about the hobby that we shared. We had conversations in which we spoke about our childhoods and bonded and helped each other (both victims of abusive childhoods, etc.) and I really considered them one of my best friends. I had to take a health break from being online and, admittedly, haven't been as active as I once was. All the toxicity took a lot out of me mentally and I basically just needed a break. I have a lot of mental and physical health problems and I decided I was gonna just take a step back. I was probably gone? About a week before I stopped back online. Well, when I came back I found that Jay had blocked me on everything without a word as to why. The last conversation that we had was nothing out of the ordinary and we just were talking about our hobby and everything seemed totally fine to me. 

I'm honestly really hurt by this as I don't make friends easily because I've got trust issues bc of past abuse (which Jay knows about) and while I totally respect the fact that they can choose who they want to associate with Im just having a hard time dealing with the fact that someone that I genuinely loved as a friend just tossed me aside like trash that didn't matter. It wouldn't hurt nearly as badly if they'd just said that they didn't want to be involved with me/my work for the hobby we shared anymore. They were still really close with the toxic friend and I really think they got into Jay's head. They've proven themselves to be extremely manipulative in the past and I just.. yeah. I've turned it over and over in my head just wondering what I did to them but I seriously cannot think of anything or find anything in our past messages. It was really out of the blue and awful to come back to. I really don't know how to move on. It's been about two months now and I can't hardly bring myself to do the hobby as we've got other shared friends and it feels like I just see them online everywhere. I just don't want to be hurting like this anymore.",10Jun2019,1
377,"Recently a couple of my close friends have become fairly into gossiping and spreading stories about people (or spilling the tea as they like to call it to help themselves sleep at night) and I hate it. I don't like knowing other's business without their consent and don't like it when other people know about mine when it hasn't come from me. Life is kinda rough for myself and my family at the moment and I'd prefer it not discussed between my friends without my knowledge. I've only told two of my closest friends about it because I don't feel I can trust anyone else and know I should speak about it so I don't go insane but even sometimes I even regret doing that. 

One specific example that may explain my concerns is that a friend of mine recently got a boyfriend. None of us really know the guy as they only met a month ago, but she has been sending him screenshots of private messenger chats between herself and individual friends. Now I don't really talk much over messenger so it doesn't particularly effect me, but that's a fairly big warning she's untrustworthy, right? I don't mean that to sound like I'm judging the quality of their relationship and he seems like a lovely guy, but that doesn't mean the rest of us trust him with our messages and knowing that much about us.   

On top of all this, I am the person my friends will come to with problems or to complain/bitch about other friends because I refuse to spread rumors and would hate to have my secrets spread, so I don't do the same. Only I now don't trust any of them enough to admit feelings of discomfort towards certain people or situations in fear of those words being spoken to someone else without my knowledge or even possibly twisted through the grapevine. If they're happy to tell me how much they hate so and so, who knows what they've got to say about me? Sorry that this is probably super over-dramatic or paranoid, but I don't know whether or not I have legitimate reasons to not have trust in my friends. It's gotten to the point where I don't tell my friends about what's new in my life and I get nervous if the conversation is turns to me because I'm scared to say something wrong.

I don't think it's healthy to not trust anyone but I'm not yet sure how big this problem actually is (an outsider's perspective would be real useful right about now), and I seriously do not know how to go about this. Especially since talking to any of them about it could end fairly poorly given that the problem is with trusting them. Sorry for the long rant but it's all been weighing on my mind for a while now. Is there any way I can regain trust in my friends? Should I even be worried about this?",10Jun2019,1

379,"Hello!

Ok, so I will try my best to be concise.

I am coming up to 5 years working in this retail store. I am a graduate and going back to do my second degree in September. 

Our store has had a shakeup. No more official supervisors – us, the ‘normal’ staff supervise instead. So, it is: the store manager, department managers and then us. I get stressed, so I never take the supervisor role and get on with my job – those that do supervise, just take this as an opportunity to delegate and chat around. If there is something that needs doing, they will hand it to us instead, despite on the same pay, lol. For some reason, they get really happy with this role… 

I have had the pleasure of one particular woman’s wrath during my years there. I am 23 and she is def. nearing to 50 or mid 40s. 

Recently, she has been causing problems (again, nothing new) and has been caught by some friend-colleagues saying things along the lines of ‘she doesn’t want to do this, she doesn’t want to do that, she doesn’t want to do so and so - what are you at work for?’ and slagging me off to colleagues when I am not there. This will taint my image on the colleagues that never see me (as I am a weekender but did a one off last week) Of course, I do work hard but, on our shift, together, i.e. last week, I had badly hurt my neck/shoulder cleaning up and cracked up and thus, asked to go easy on heavy things. So, this includes scanning items, i.e. the till.  

Lily (the devil woman, aka the colleague) would CONSTANTLY put me on there despite there being no customers and 4 other tills opened. I did not refuse once but I did mention I would prefer to do something less hands on, i.e. stocking the bakery aisle. To be fair, she didn’t seem happy/friendly the entire shift and people were bitching about her the entire time, no one likes her… 

Also, she wasn’t supervising, it was someone else, and this person said to me do whatever you want i.e. to go on self-scan and then Lily came off till herself, took my spot when I went to help a customer on the aisles and demanded I sat on the tills.

Now, I am a confident person with no issues in confronting people.  I want to talk to her about this in a very stern, somewhat rude way to get the point across that I WILL NOT stand for her slagging me off. It is always when I am not there and I do a damn good job!  

Should I do this or speak my store manager? Thing is SO many people have complained about her, but nothing is done, hence taking her aside and using interesting and coercive verbatim to get the message across that I do NOT tolerate this sort of drama and bitchiness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also to note, when my grandmother was on her death bed. I volunteered to help out on a different department whilst Lilly did nothing - once  I started to get really upset and felt attacked my one particular manager for causing a 'mess' lol huh, it was two boxes on the floor that I was picking up after some water, I asked her if someone else could do it. She went straight to my manager and said I refused, which in turn I was taken aside and told why I couldn't with plenty of attitude. I said there are other people there too, same job, same wage... I don't get this - I VOLUNTEERED whilst everyone else didn't. My grandma died two days later. This was escalated into a situation for no reason at all.",10Jun2019,1

384,"TLDR; the mother of my child is sleeping with a married man behind my back. We both have genital herpes and I want to warn the man's wife so that she doesn't contract an incurable STD due to her husband's infidelity.

I recently made a post regarding the fact that I had found out that my girlfriend of 3 years was sleeping with a married man behind my back. That one was asking for different advice because of her history of keeping our daughter away from me when we've had issues or broken up in the past, so I havent ended the relationship officially yet. That's been somewhat resolved, I'm working with a custody lawyer to get a joint legal custody agreement in place, which I have managed to get her to voluntarily agree to. She really doesn't have any reason not to because I actually spend more time with our daughter and provide more financial support than she does. I'm still waiting to hear back from the lawyer today and get the paperwork started, but this puts me in another uncomfortable situation that I could really use some advice on.

This man has been married for five years and has a two-year-old daughter right at my daughter's age. His wife does not know what's going on, and he told the mother of my child last night that she can feel free to text him when he's at home because his wife would have no way to get into the phone app to see what was going on between them. After the custody agreement is in place and I have broken things off with her I feel like I should reach out to this woman and let her know what her husband is doing. I will admit that part of me enjoys the idea that she would leave him for his infidelity, but this is less about revenge and more about doing the right thing. I have had herpes for 8 years and pass it on to the mother of my child 2 years ago right after our daughter was born. She knew very well the risks involved, because I have always make sure to inform all sexual partners of the fact that I have an incurable STD. I feel terrible about the fact that this poor woman could contract herpes from her husband because he's stepping out on her with the mother of my child who has herpes.

He of course does not know that she has herpes, and quite frankly I don't care to tell him, because the way I see it if he will cheat on his wife he deserves no warning from me, but his wife on the other hand didn't do anything to deserve this.

Based upon the text messages that I've seen between them I can provide enough personal details, up to and including the hotel room he's staying in for the next two weeks out of town on business, and believe that would suffice to convince her.

That being said, should I warn her once I have a custody agreement in place and end things with my girlfriend?",10Jun2019,803

Neither of us are particularly popular and I couldn't find a way to start talking to her without it seeming forced. Anyway I found out from one of her friends that she likes me as well.

389,"Hey friends, I would love for some stranger’s insight and output into this because I just can’t stop thinking about it.

I started hooking up with this girl in college on March and it slowly developed into a more affectionate relationship (holding hands, spending time, cute pictures, exclusivity etc.) Yet since summer is here and there is a break (I live overseas and she’s from the US) we told each other that we don’t want a relationship. However, we would keep in contact from time to time during the break and keep interacting when we come back to college on the end of August. 

The problem is, I don’t feel good about the fact that she’s on my mind 24/7 and she never initiates contact aside from once in a while IG memes (even though she’s responsive to my texts). I truly do not want to lose her because I don’t catch feelings for people easily and I’ve had no problems being with people before. But I feel like the enthusiasm that she has is only apparent when we are together and I get it, she has her own life as well (business, family etc.) However, I feel like she is not trying at all, which kind of makes me anxious. 

I dedicated myself to growth so I can get rid of these haunting feelings (nofap, Cold showers, int fasting, meditation etc.) But I still have the pain. She loves her personal space,which I respect and she doesn’t share it with people easily so that in itself proved that she trusts me when we were physically together. 

Am I doing something wrong here? Being clingy or needy? Or the “oneitis” syndrome? I’m trying to figure out what should I do with this situation? Maybe I’m just really afraid to lose her if I confront her about this lack of communication.

TL;DR: Started w hookups, developed into something much more, We won’t see each other for 3 months so we didn’t want a relationship but promised to keep in contact and keep interacting when we’re back. Lack of communication, Self doubt, if she started to not like me or not. I really like her, and feel like I can learn things from a potential relationship so I don’t want to lose her. But she’s on my mind most of the time and it’s painful. What to do?

Also she’s an aquarius woman if that helps lmao.",10Jun2019,1
391,"Hi everyone, I'm writing this because I'm in the middle of a somewhat crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

In two days I will be attending my University convocation and graduating with an honours degree in Political Science  at a premier university in Canada. Yet, I feel empty. 

&amp;#x200B;

To give you some context, in High School I was enamoured with politics, history, and writing. My Grade 12 English Teacher, Ms. Schaffer, pushed me to write as much as possible, got me published in local newspapers writing things from fiction, literature review, and politics. She pushed me to go to this University and told me I would have a great career as a writer, if I stuck to my craft and continued pursuing it, and if I decided writing wasn't the route for me, my analytical skills and public speaking would draft me into a good law firm. My parent's have been nothing but supportive of any decision I make, my dad wanted me to go pursue sciences and technology, but my mom persuaded him to stand by my decision to go into Political Science and pursue writing and law.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I got into university, for the first two years I was extremely satisfied. I was getting good grades, I was writing almost every day and publishing articles in local school papers. The last two years of university did not go over so well. I became more and more disenfranchised with the political climate of the University and greater Canadian society, and fell out of writing. I slowly became depressed and lost interested in everything which I used to enjoy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, four years later, my GPA is garbage, I've completely stopped writing and I am so disenfranchised with politics and law that I'm stuck. This last year I have been bouncing back and forth between a career in finance, real estate, construction, and other things. These bouts only last for a few weeks until I realize that I can't do it, or it's not for me, and then I'm back at square one. Deep down inside I know I still want to pursue writing and law, but I'm afraid of the consequences of that path. On the one hand, there's not a lot of money in writing, no one's going to hire a twenty-something-year-old with zero life experience and a few published articles in school papers. On the other hand, I'm going to have to do another degree to get the marks required for law school, which will mean I will have to quit my job, be entirely dependant on my parents until I graduate at 31. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I've lost my passion for politics, writing, and law, but deep down there is some part of me which wants to pursue it again. What should I do? How does one find their passion again after losing and feeling stranded?",10Jun2019,1
392,"Hey everyone - 

I (24M) am currently 2 years out of college with an engineering degree. I hired into a great company out of school with great pay, benefits, etc. 

The one issue I’ve run into is that I am completely unhappy with where I live. Here are a few for example:

- I am far (3 hours minimum) from all my college friends as well as my high school friends. 
- my nearest family member lives 10+ hours via car 
- I live in a pretty rural area, I grew up in NYC and went to school in Columbus, both decently big cities 
- I just don’t fit the culture. Nothing that people do for fun out here fits my idea of fun
- I accepted this position to stay near my girlfriend of 4 years who has since then broken things off

I can’t seem to relate to people and that’s honestly due to the lack of insecurities that people have. Cities are very status-driven and superficial places and that’s just kind of who I am. At what point do I risk financial insecurity for personal happiness? 

I’d be lying if I said I don’t have good memories from where I currently live but I’d also be lying if i said I am happy. I just don’t know what to do with the pressure of student loans and the ever increasing feeling of loneliness. 

Any advice or just words of encouragement are so appreciated. Thanks for taking time out of your lives to help some random person. It truly means the world.",10Jun2019,1
393,"Hello everyone,


I'(m26) reaching out for advice that my little brother (18) could benefit from. He's an intelligent, caring, and loveable young man, but he's been failed. I've reached out about my mom before, and even my brother. But when I try to talk to him about how my mom operates, he's where I was when I still lived with them; manipulated and emotionally imprisoned with Stockholm Syndrome. 


My mom is often viewed as the most selfless person anyone has ever known. She will donate any amount of her time to other's causes, despite her need to focus on the time she needs to spend on herself. She insistently offers her aid to others, despite her need to help herself. There's an immense amount of self-sacrifice that she offers. But this is not all just for the sake of being helpful or caring. Everything she does she'll hold over whoever she does it for as a means of guilt. I truly do not blame her for this, she's not aware of it. But it's the covert-narcissist mindset that imprisons those closest to her.


There's a LOT we could get into about my mom, from trying to be the cool mom when we were younger and allowing us to drink and have girlfriends stay the night, to allowing access to the Vicodin and money management that could never be afforded for the sake of image. Primarily, I just want to get advice for my little brother to get out of the situation and start his life.


My mom allowed my little brother (we'll call him Tom) to drop out of middle school to be homeschooled. Tom, however, was never expected to open a book and study, do any assignments, do any school work at all. Who can blame him? Any 13-year-old approved to play video games all day instead of worry about school would gladly take up that offer. From then until now, he has not worked on furthering his education in the slightest. To say he's behind is an understatement. He's been completely given up on. Again, the boy is very smart, but he's not able to show even a high school diploma for it.


Fast story for my next point: My mom is an eBay hoarder. Their house is uninhabitable; she's admitted to sleeping on the porch some nights. She incurred an $1,800 fee on her eBay account so she asked if she could use mine to sell again and pay off the fee (I didn't know it was $1,800 at the time). I said it was fine and now there are fees coming out of my bank account, so far $600+. My wife and I are about to have our first baby in the next month. My mom doesn't seem to understand the gravity of the problem so I'm cutting her off this Friday. Now my mom is talking about Tom opening a bank account so he can start an eBay that she'll share with him, which WILL damage his financial start as an adult. Tom doesn't have a job, nor a drivers license to get one. She's going to hold him back even more than he already is and she sees nothing wrong with it.


Tom's first real girlfriend moved in with him, my mom, and my step-dad. The situation is extremely harmful to anyone involved. But now there's opportunity for Tom to move in with his girlfriend's family, which normally I would be totally against being that they're only 18 and he's got nothing to fall back on if the relationship fails, but I truly feel it may be the only way for him to get out and see with some clarity that the situation with our mom is extremely unhealthy.


This is just a scratch on the surface of our family's life, but I'm requesting advice that I intend to share with my brother to get him out of this situation.


TL;DR - My mom is manipulating my brother and intending to hold him back as he starts his life as an adult. Need advice from others to get him out of the situation.

394,"Okay so, I'll lay out all the important details here:

- Friend has depression, is very self critical
- Her dad is a piece of shit, constantly berates her about her weight, makes sure she's financially dependant on them, makes sure she can't hang out with almost anyone, makes up shit so she can't have anything nice, ect.
- Parents believe she can easily be raped and that's why she's not allowed to go to boys' houses ( she's 85 kg, has been going to taekwondo, Krav maga and shooting classes for 5 years, works out, can bench more than her own weight) 
- because of the mental torture from her parents, she's paranoid when they're around, they often sneak into her room while she's asleep to look through her stuff and try to find drugs and other shit
- her depression is clinical, the very thought of her parents sends her into a well of dark thoughts and suicidal thoughts
- she often attributes her failures to herself and not other factors, parents blame her for everything so thats probably the reason

This is the latest episode, and I don't know how to respond to this ( http://imgur.com/a/r8nvJ2T )

I myself am usually a very happy person, due to my own burdens and experiences, I've learned to deal with many bad situations, she says I'm the person she cares for most, I'm the one she turns to when her episodes and panic attacks begin, she's told me the most of her past and the shit her parents do and has openly stated that Im the thing that kept her from suicide one time



A little more info: - I'm 16, she's 17, 18 in 5 months

Her parents make her feel like shit, we can't call child services because she's too old and too close to 18, she can't move away because she can't get a good job yet and is financially dependant on her parents, other family is happy to help her but parents are against even visiting other family frequently


I seriously need help with this, I've handled more situations like this before but I'm stumped now

395,"I am a college student in Indonesia majoring in software engineering, currently owning an Android phone. I've been using it for almost 1 year now (11 months or so). it's maybe one of the low-ends, snapdragon 435, good battery, got a beta android pie update, and it's somewhat functional. Around 2 months ago, this phone's screen got cracked (I dropped it :' ) . The touchscreen is still functional, but somehow the LCD started getting yellow burn-in. It's not so visible, but it's kinda annoying when I'm testing my apps, and surely the burn-in will spread through the display.  when I asked for a screen replacement at the official service center, they said that the cost would be around 70 USD  or so (I can't go to an unofficial service center, as the screen resolution would not be the same), almost the same as the phone's price if sold second-handed. So I thought that maybe buying a new one would be a better choice after all.

The thing is, 5G's gonna come soon, and surely phones prices on market will drop. And at that time, I may have better choices. So, should I buy a new phone now, or should I wait for another year?",10Jun2019,1

I ask nothing in return I almost always say yes and it seems like they take advantage of it because they keep asking for more. I want this to stop but I don't know how. I may come off as an asshole if I say that I won't be able to do something for them and it drives me nuts that I can't just say ""fuck you"" in their faces. People asking me to do minor stuff then ask for more than that but also talk behind my back. I can't take this anymore. How do you guys cope with that kind of stuff? What would you advise someone with that kind of a problem?

399,"I turned 18 a little over a week ago. I am Finnish, and live in Finland with my mother and my sister.

I quit vocational school after 1 year because I lost interest in programming. I now need a job, and I have no fucking clue as to how to find one that suits me.

Good luck getting a job with no diploma in a country with free secondary education, where everyone and their fucking dog has a diploma.

I have Asperger's and can't even make eye contact with strangers let alone speak to them confidently.

I am somewhat overweight but distinctly out of shape and incapable of demanding or even not-so-demanding physical labor.

I have zero skills or abilities of any description, beyond speaking English exceptionally well, which is actually useless because literally everyone in Finland speaks English, not to mention that literally nobody on the face of the planet has a need to translate between the two languages.

I have no desire or motivation to work, except of course for jobs I want but cannot ever have.

I'm depressed and have little to no energy for anything.

I would rather commit suicide than work at McDonald's or some Amazon warehouse, or any other modern day equivalent for a cotton field, or western equivalent for a sweatshop.

Now, of course I COULD just live off of welfare, but what kind of life would that be? I would never have any money for myself, and I need that in order to experience things that I actually like.

Everything that I actually want to do can be described as a fucking pipe dream at this point. All the things I day dream of are undeniably impossible. I want to direct video games, and I have ideas for them that I think are fantastic, but everyone always shits on ""the idea guy"". I want to be a musician despite having no knowledge of music theory or instruments or literally anything even vaguely useful to a musician. Infuriatingly, despite knowing all this to be fucking ridiculous, I cannot shake my desire for them. It's all I have. This childish pipe dream is all I have.

My only hope is that if I can get a job, I could buy an instrument and start learning with the help of the internet (private lessons, while infinitely more useful, are too expensive). I figure that if I can put together a song that would set the tone for one of these projects that I day dream of making (accompanied by a draft of a script), some bored executive for some game studio might humor or pity me, and give me some kind of opportunity to make a proof of concept before any real project. 

Before anyone asks, yes, I'm well aware that's insane and never going to work, but I kind of have to pretend that it's even remotely viable, as otherwise I would have literally no reason not to just off myself.

Does anyone have any suggestions for jobs or schools (as if any school would accept someone like me) or anything else that would be useful to me?",10Jun2019,1

403,"I'm moving in November, I just took a $700 credit card bill I need to pay off in six months, and right now my current job is a little unsteady.

It's a small retail chain that isn't doing so great and things don't look promising long-term - not my problem tbh, I'm leaving in November and not transferring to another location.

Thing is, I'm only getting 30 hours a week, average, at around 9.85/hour. I need to pick up an extra 10-20 hours to pay off my credit cards (total about $1000) and land on my feet. 

Moving is set in stone, my transportation has been arranged and can't be changed. 

The problem I'm having isn't getting a second job, it's how do I work that second job around my first one?

My current jobs hours vary based on what they need me to do, and as of this week it's a lot more than before as two managers have left and one isn't being replaced, and who knows when the other will be. 

My schedule starts Monday but often isn't released until Sunday afternoon, which makes it a hassle to work around another manager at another service job (retail or food); in my experience with 3 other second jobs since I've worked this first one, it always ends badly as schedules collide or one gets spiteful and gives me lower hours. 

I don't have a car otherwise I'd work job apps like uber or grocery delivery. All I have are a few fast food and retail places nearby. 

How do I explain to a prospective employee that I have no idea what my availability will be until the last minute? Are there alternative ways to earn money for a few months without a car that I can just pick up on my days off? 

If I continue to work part time I won't have enough to pay off one of my credit cards before I move, or I pay both off but don't have the 3 months rent I need on arrival to secure residence.",10Jun2019,1

405,"Hi all! Im a 22 year old who's looking for their first move. Im in a smallish town outside Boston currently and have always lived with my parents. I did not go to college, and have had a few jobs over the years. Overall, I'm not sure what I want to do with my life. I believe if I can ultimately find a comfortable serving job (Severe anxiety and depression, yet I do work in customer service lol) Id be happy. At least for the next 5-10 years then I can see where life will take me. 

Mostly though, I'm stuck on WHERE to live. Granted, this can all change year to year, but that first step on where to go is difficult. I can't quite afford city life yet, only about 15k in savings, but ideally living near life would be great. I can't be on or near a farm, but in a small suburb is totally fine. Id like some restaurants, a movie theatre nearby, and highway access. If I have that, I'll likely be happy. 

So far, Ive looked in Providence RI, Portland Maine, some of southern NH, and haven't gotten to look around Massachusetts right now. Providence was nice, but not my favorite. Seemed a little too sketchy for me, as crime rate id prefer to be low as well. I liked Maine for the sense of ""getting away"" while Portland still has somewhat of a city life to it. However, its 2+ hours from Boston. Southern NH I think was nice, but ultimately doesn't have much there to it.

407,"Alright, so.. How do I start explaining this..    
He's 21. She's around the same age as he is. They don't *really* know each other. They went to the same school, but they weren't friends or anything. I also have to mention both of them aren't really.. the 'brightest crayons in the box', if you know what I'm getting at.  

He doesn't have a great relationship with his mother. He's been thrown out of the house a few times, and then he started living with our grandma. His girlfriend lives in a 'cheap' house, it's basically given to her because she's still in school, doesn't have a great relationship with her family, and she barely has to pay any rent. This is her living situation, which also means he can't legally live with her in her place.  

  

Okay, so a little backstory;

He recently started a hobby with an older guy, and she was babysitting his kids. They started talking about how they 'knew' each other from school etc. This happened somewhere around September, but they only started dating around January/February. He only told us about her around March.  

He immediately left my grandmother, and moved in with his girlfriend. He sometimes still goes to my grandmother because she still does his laundry etc, and it's also the address his mail gets delivered to.  

He's never really had a girlfriend, so everyone was pretty excited for him when he announced it to us. I've always known he never wants kids, because he's very vocal about it. He hates the crying, and he just can't deal with them. So naturally, the first thing I asked/told him was to talk to her about it. He's absolutely sure he doesn't want kids, so if she does, or she's a fencesitter, it won't work out. He told me not to worry because they already had the talk and he claims she also doesn't want kids. Alright, so far so good.  

Remember, this is all happening in about three months.  

First, they started talking about renting a place, so they can legally live together. Then, they started talking about buying a place. She doesn't have any savings, and he also barely has any money to his name.    
Now, they want to get married. They already made an appointment. It's happening in August.  

None of us know the girl, hell, even he doesn't really know her. They're still in the 'honeymoon phase' of their relationship where everything is amazing and great and they shouldn't be making decisions like this. Not now. Not yet.  

He used to visit us pretty often (on his own, of course), but now every time he visits, he brings her along with him. Which is completely fine, other than the fact we don't get the chance to talk to him alone. As far as we know, she's kind.. But it does feel like she's a bit controlling. He doesn't act the same way he used to.  

We're scared she might be using him. We also think she might be pregnant because all of a sudden they want to get married and she, I quote 'gained a bit of weight'.  

She doesn't have any savings or a real job because she's still in school, so we think she might be using him for his money. As I previously stated, he currently doesn't have a lot of savings, but he does have a pretty good job. We think that if they buy a house and they put in on both their names, she'll take off with half of his money. We already told him to put it on his name only, but of course he doesn't want to do that.  

What can we do, Reddit? Me and my mum are afraid he's gonna get played, taken advantage of, and get left heartbroken and alone. How on Earth do we bring this to his attention? Even my grandmother (who's very open minded and easy going) doesn't think this is a good idea. We really don't want him to make such a big mistake so early on.  

Please give me some advice.  

Thanks in advance.",10Jun2019,0
408,"I'll make this as brief as possible. 
I met a lad a few years ago, we became very close friends and over a two year period we spent the majority of nights together just chilling (We'll call him Jay). 
He very regularly comes to me for help because I can fix and secure phones and laptops etc and unfortunately he doesn't seem to know a lot about technology and almost nothing about protecting his details and he really does have the worst luck breaking his phones and losing them. 
I'm more than happy to help him because not long after we first met, he pretty much saved my life after I went through a very, very dark time with my family, I'd lost everything back then and was sleeping on my friends couch, Jay would show up almost every night to keep me company, consistently. He didn't know me well back then, but he kept showing up anyway. It had made a big difference to my mentality and helped me through a suicidal time, I honestly don't know where I'd be without him. 

I'd decided that, if there was anything I could do to help him, I would, without question. The issue is he regularly approaches me needing help speeding up his laptop, or fixing his phone which I'm more than happy to do. But he gets irritated when I offer advice about how to prevent issues in the future. The biggest faults are in his security, he puts no pins or passwords on his laptop or phone. Once I'd updated his laptop and added a pin in case it got stolen, he was annoyed but I stressed how important it was, a week later it got stolen and hacked because he didn't throw away the piece of paper with his pin on it, he then said the pin did nothing to help him -_-

It started to feel like I wasn't a friend offering advice, but a parent telling his kid off because of the way he responds when I talk to him about protecting himself, which made me uncomfortable. 
After he lost his last phone I gave him one of mine on the condition that he had a pin on it, I'm not sure whether he did choose to protect it though. 

The issue today is that he's messaged me on messenger with a link to a survey site, saying it's actually a decent site etc. 
Fairly sure he's hacked I asked him what my dogs name was, he sent back a couple of joke responses like ""twat features"", but I asked him to answer and he said ""Nah I'm not playing your games, bore off"". 
I told him I'd have to assume he's hacked and report it and he just put "" alright see ya"". 

The thing is those messages DO sound like the sort of thing he'd say, but also what a hacker might say too so I reported it. 
I can't call him or text him either, nothing is going through and I live in another city now. So I'm sat here worrying about whether his (my) phone has been stolen and/or if his accounts been hacked. 
If that was really him then he's selfish as hell for playing with me and assuming I'm playing games by asking a simple question, then leaving me worrying, but me kicking off because he wouldn't answer a simple question would make me seem crazy right? 

I've spoken to my brother and he said I need to stop helping him out because he doesn't respect the advice I give or my efforts to make sure he's safe, but it doesn't change the fact that he helped me so much when I was going through the worst years of my life.
He could well be hacked and I've helped by reporting it, but if that's not the case and he's put me through this stress for nothing, should I just stop helping him? I feel so angry at his response saying I was ""playing games"" when all he had to do was say my dogs name. 
I checked the link he sent on review sites and it seems legit, exploitive but legit. 

If I stop helping I'll keep worrying, if I keep helping we'll keep going around this same circle I feel.

410,"So in October I had a bad case of depersonalization/de realization. (Dissociation) I was stressed to the max about certain things going on in my life, I’m not going into detail but it was serious things. 

While I was having this episode I was just telling myself the whole time how awful of a person I was and it really messed me up. 

I’m better now after being on anti depressants but I still don’t feel myself. Sometimes I’ll have moments of dissociation and I just don’t know who I freakin am anymore.

411,"I know context can be important in things like this so I'm going to give some backstory, I'll leave a TLDR at the bottom.

So I (18, M) have a few friends who like to go drinking in the pub. They do this most weekends, but I do not drink, I don't enjoy it. I say this because I know that everything actually happened for this reason. Anyway, a friend from school is invited who brings his friends and one is this girl (18) and I knew her well enough, more of an acquaintance then a friend. And I found out on this night that when she drinks she gets very horny.

Throughout the night she would keep touching me - my face, my chest and wrapped herself around my waist for 10 minutes as I drank my water. She would tell me how badly she wanted to fuck me, even when I told her I wasnt interested. At one point when I went to the bathroom, she told me to wait outside the wheelchair bathroom for her and she winked at me all sexual like - I didnt wait. She continued this through the night and the following day she messaged me saying how much she regretted it. I mentioned this because I dont know if what she did is sexual harassment. I feel like it is, I denied her requests and did not ask for anything she did. 

It didnt end here. When we graduated about a month ago, the school organises a night in a pub for all those of age (this is a different place) and pretty much my entire year is here, so of course this girl was here again. She continued flirting with me and doing what she did last time, even after telling me she would never let herself do it again. I was also sober this time. As the night went on she tried get me to dance with her. After her fourth failed attempt to get me to dance, she saw my earphones hanging from my pocket and tried tucking them back in, only to shove her hand in my pocket and grab my cock - it may have been a pocket but she had small hands and manages to get a good grip on my boy. 

I rip her hand out of my back and hold it up to her. My expression is both embarrassment and anger, and she looks at me as if she did nothing wrong, almost finding my reaction hilarious. Needless to say I stayed away from her for the rest of the night.

I texted her the following day, making sure she was aware of what she did and she acted like it wasnt a big deal. She didn't apologise and began to talk about what else she did when I wasn't there, which gave me the impression she really didnt care about doing it. Her reaction is why I've come to this subreddit, I've contemplated what happend for the last month and I want to know of this would be sexual assault/harassment because if for what ever reason I see her in a bar again and she attempts this I want to use those words to describe her actions and if need be embarrass her to make her stop - but if this isnt worth naming so, then I would just look like a bad guy wanting attention. 

TLDR; an aquatence or mine felt me up in a bar and told me how much she wanted to have sex with me as I denied her requests, and grabbed my cock on another occasion in a different bar - does this count as sexual assault / harassment?",10Jun2019,1

414,"I’m honestly not enjoying the coworkers I work with. It’s so chaotic and the communication is terrible. They’re also very disorganized, 


People here are always looking for others to blame for simple mistakes instead of just taking it in, people here don’t ask questions as well in which they’d rather make a mistake because upper management here cannot communicate well here with their employees. There’s always yelling, passive aggressiveness, pettiness in this workspace. I’ve done pretty well so far, my position and work is not very in demand and it’s not hard. But I’d rather just stay home and work.


I’ve been working here for about 2 months now and it honestly sucks coming to work. Everything is done in the computer and there’s no need to be in the office, I may want to do twice a week here and stay home for the most part. But would it be too early to ask for something like this?",10Jun2019,1
415,"I know this is going to sound very stupid but bear with me please.

So I live in a studio building where there is a shared vaccum cleaner on every floor. I have social anxiety so to avoid people I dont get the shared vaccum cleaner from the floor. Another thing is that whenever I want to use the vaccum cleaner its almost never available. 

Also the people on my floor have broke the old vaccum cleaner. So sometime there is a vaccum from the first floor and sometimes there is a vaccum from the third floor. But never on our own floor.

**Problem**

I want to buy my own vaccum cleaner but am a little bit afraid.

If people hear that I have my own vaccum cleaner(due to the noise it makes) they may start asking me to lend them the vaccum cleaner. Because there is no floor vaccum cleaner anymore my cleaner will sort of become the new floor vaccum cleaner. 

I can refuse but then I become the floor asshole and everyone will hate me. Or I can give it to someone if they request me enough and then I have to chase my vaccum all around the floor.

What is your advice?",10Jun2019,1
416,"I have a really good friendship with this girl who is dating someone. I want to be around her extremely bad and some days I feel it’s the only thing that makes me happy. I don’t know what to do, I hang out with her so much of my day in school so I can’t just not talk to her. What causes the most problem is that I’m progressively getting more and more convinced that she likes me because she’ll do things like rest her head on my shoulder or some of the other signs that I know I shouldn’t listen to but they give me hope for some reason. Like she talks to me a lot more than anyone else or does any of the other signs that someone is attracted to me but I know deep down inside she isn’t and that I shouldn’t listen to any of these signs. I obviously can’t make a move because she has a boyfriend and I don’t want to be a jerk. I’m so confused at what to do. I try and will try to better myself on the outside by doing things to improve my life/appearance but I feel deep down inside it won’t matter because no one else gives me the feelings that she gives me, no matter how hard I try.

418,"I’ve had this sweet black cat named Buddy ever since he was a kitten. His sister and him were dumped out where we live (out in the country) when they were not even two months old. We took them in and raised them, and they’re the absolute best cats anyone could ever ask for. 

Fast forward about three years, we noticed Buddy was getting in fights with some sort of animal. We let the cats go outside at night and they come back in whenever they please, and considering we live in the country with coyotes and other wildlife, we were getting nervous. He had cuts, ripped padding in his paws, but mostly a horrible walk where he was constantly tripping, so we took him to the vet. Apparently, and I have no clue if I’m explaining this right, but the muscle that goes over his knee joint wasn’t stable so the joint was sliding all over the place causing him to walk weird. We put him on steroids for the pain and kept him inside for awhile. The surgery to fix it is extremely expensive and there’s not a guaranteed chance it would work. My mom did promise that we would save money to get the surgery at some point in time though.

About three months later, Buddy was walking comfortably again and we were giving him less medication. It was clear the pain wasn’t bothering him much or even at all, and he was going outside again. Sadly, the fights started up again. Recently he got into a bad one where his ear was ripped, had patches of fur missing, and was scratched up pretty bad on the face. What bothered me was how little my mom and her girlfriend seemed to care about this. They’d have him stay inside and maybe give him some medicine, but put in no effort to keep him inside and prevent the fighting. My parents are divorced so half the week I’m at my dads, and I can’t control what happens to Buddy when I’m gone. If I could, I’d permanently make him a indoors cat.

I’ve started to notice too that recently he’s having extreme trouble jumping and always falls, and seems to be in pain when scratching himself with his back leg (he wasn’t even like that a month after we learned about his joint). Buddy’s sleeping so much more than he used too and isn’t as playful. I also noticed today that his nose seemed a bit bigger than usual and I asked my mom what it was about. Apparently in one of his recent fights he broke his nose. I was genuinely shocked, and asked my mom if we were gonna take him to the vet. She said he was fine and there was nothing the vet could do anyways, and when I asked about the joint surgery, she flat out did not want to do it. Money is currently tight with our family right now, but my mom is getting a job in a few weeks where we’ll make a lot more money. I’m surprised she’s refuse to help him, or at least take him to the vet for a checkup. My mom was always the one helping animals too, especially her girlfriend.

Buddy is probably on his last life at this point, and I’m worried since he can’t run well, that if he goes outside at night a coyote will get him. Maybe even worse is that something is currently wrong with him now, and not taking him to the vet to get him diagnosed will hurt him in the long run. We had a previous black cat before also named Buddy who went missing, and he was a huge part of the family. I don’t want this to happen again, especially if we could control the outcome. I don’t know if what my mom is saying is right or if Buddy needs profession help. I’m genuinely worried at this point.",10Jun2019,2

422,"This is my first time posting anything. 

I (31m) recently separated from my wife (31f). We separated semi-amicably because she thought I would cheat on her and started becoming paranoid, I never did and it just became a sore point in the relationship.

Recently my parents who I have a strained relationship with have comeback into my life. I quickly realized that my parents would only speak with me when they needed something from me. They are dealing with stuff themselves as there retirement money had been swindled away from a family friend . I know a few people that can help in criminal situations like these. Now the only time they want to talk to me is  to tell what that friend is doing so I can relay information. I have now stopped talking to my parents.

My sister also wanted to use me for her benefit as she is the opposite of my parents and decided to swindle money from a charity and has now since been arrest and going through court proceedings. She wanted to have me use my connections to bail her out of this situation. I have cut ties with her too.

My close friends have forgotten about me basically, they took a trip to Vegas for one of the guys bachelor parties and I was the only one not invited. Honestly, that really hurt.

I can't even gain any momentum at work. Everytime it starts to look up I hurt myself. Everyone is starting to think I'm made out of glass. 

The one person who's been helping me through alot just by talking with me has now pretty much said fuck off and deal with it yourself.

Honestly, I know I'm it a bit of a depression right now. I had the mindset of if life hits you get back up and start running and with each little setback Im finding it harder to get up. I am on the hunt for a therapist.

Tldr: Wife left. Family only wants to use me. Friends aren't  so friendly, I feel useless at work and started to feel depressed. 

Just wondering would it be smarter to pack things up and just leave it all behind or does it make sense to just tough it out and hope it gets better?

425,"Hellooo people of Reddit. As you may have gathered, I have a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, I am on a VERY prestigious, VERY hard to get onto vet degree at a great uni which I spent a lot of time, effort and angst trying to get into. I have found my absolute soulmates here and the social side has been everything I could have dreamed of. Next year I'm planning to live in a house with 3 of the best people I've ever met.

&amp;#x200B;

However.

&amp;#x200B;

Although my course is very interesting and cool (really sick guaranteed job at the end with lots of accolade, parents would be super proud etc.) I really just can't seem to do it.. Which is weird, because I've always been the high-achieving type. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't know if it's just the stress talking, but I have had some major lows in my most recent revision period and am really not sure anymore whether this is the course for me. I am pretty sure I want to be a medic of some sort and definitely considered straight medicine/ midwifery for a while (the latter being stamped upon by my parents because 'I would not be able to stand not being the one in charge', apparently. They suggested that I'd only really be happy as the doctor or vet.). I'm pretty scared to talk to my parents about that because I worked damn hard to get in here and they are very smart and driven people themselves who tend to give the advice of 'just do a bit more revision'. Not so helpful. No matter how hard I work, I always seem to be behind my peers and although I am very aware of how easy and stupid it is to compare yourself to everyone else, even the people who give off more of a 'don't worry, I'm only aiming to pass, I barely know anything' vibe know a helluva lot more than me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I've got a whole load of  exams coming up (7 in a week Lord save me) and I'm going to wait and see how they go but my question is, people of Reddit, what would you do? Drop everything and start a nursing degree instead? Suck it up and just try and power through (dependant on how the exams go but not an impossible notion)? Do something completely different that I've never thought of?

426,"Hi! Thank you for taking the time to help me. This is a little long. Sorry. In a nutshell, I feel resentment towards my mother who lives with me and it's weighing heavily on me. We were very close when I was younger. I was born and raised in Hawaii. When I graduated high school, I moved to Cali for college (Oakland). Being from SoCal, she moved there to be close. It was all cool and we had a good relationship because we had our distance, I think. She even took out a huge loan to help me continue school. Now, she needs a place to stay. She only wants to live with me. I have been telling her that I lived with a roommate because I wanted my space for the first time ever. The truth would cause her to guilt me. I have an older brother and sister. My sister is ideal since she has a big space in Hawaii. My mother doesn't want to move back to Hawaii. She was going to go with my brother in Washington, but I felt too guilty because his situation is not the safest there. So, she moved in with me. In my tiny studio. With her 2 stinky dogs. I thought it was temporary but I'm sure she wants to live here for good. She said she didn't want to impose. I sleep on the floor now and she has my bed. I HATE coming home. I used to love being there and studying. Now, I stall and do whatever I can to come home super late. I would honestly rather sleep in my car outside sometimes. I don't even like to talk to her. I feel bad for that but it seems I can't help it. I don't want her following me around. The thing is, she can't support herself. This is impacting my studying and health. I want to talk to her about moving but she will feel bad and me guilty. What do I do? I'm so stressed that I'm always on the brink of crying. I want my space. My brother and sister help support her financially. I just feel it's unfair.

428,"  

This is my (25F) first time posting to reddit… I guess I’m just desperate at this point and at a loss for what to do. Also, I’ve changed all the names for this post.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem 1 : I applied for an accounting assistant position.. in the interview I was told for the first 3 months I’d help with coordinating and kind of managing/organizing a division of the company. After those 3 months I’d completely move away from this and would start learning Tom’s role (He plans on retiring at the end of this year, he does most of the accounting work). Additionally, I would receive a pay raise after those 3 months. I agreed to this and was hired at the beginning of the year. Things went alright for those first 3 months and for the most part everything was going smoothly in the division I helped. I never ended up moving away from this and now it’s June. Yes, I do some accounting work – but not what I want. I’ve expressed this to numerous people within the company and nobody seems to care, as I think everyone likes the work I’ve done for the division. Additionally, I think Tom has a hard time giving up his role, as he’s worked here for over 20 years and I think refuses to give up any responsibility.

Problem 2 : I’m tired of the disgusting comments that are made to me. I feel uncomfortable every day I go to work. Example, I was wearing a new work polo that has a logo on the top left corner, which my hair was moved to the side covering the logo. Keith comes up to me and says “Move your hair unless you want me to do it”. I felt very violated and just continued doing my work, so he walked away. Keith has also said things in the past about how I have the most beautiful eyes, am gorgeous, etc. He makes comments to 2 other girls I work with, but they always laugh and joke with him.. I refuse to ever laugh at any comments he makes.

Problem 3 : Most of the people here are either related or know each other/were friends before starting a job here. I am one of the few people who started not knowing anyone. It’s hard to explain as I don’t want to give too much information away, but the big one is partially my boss, which is his son-in-law. It’s kind of a smaller company as well. I feel like I have nobody to talk to within the company about how uncomfortable I feel or how unhappy I am.

I used to live with my fiancé, but ended up leaving the relationship and moving into my father’s house about 2 years ago (which hasn’t been great for me, I have lived on my own/taken care of myself basically since I was 17). I pay my father monthly for rent, all other expenses are paid for by myself as if I was a roommate. I live in a smallish town and want to move away… there are not many job opportunities here. Closest city, which isn’t even that big, is about an hour away. I don’t have much of a savings, but I’d like to move out and find a new job in a larger city. I’m desperate to leave my current job, but again there’s few options within my area… eventually I’d like to even go back to college, but again I’d need to move for that to happen unless I want to drive 2 hours each way every day.

&amp;#x200B;

431,"Warning: this post is going to be extremely shallow. Sorry if I come across as a bad person, but I feel like I’ve truly suffered from this. When I say “my looks” I don’t mean that I’m a beautiful-looking person. However, I do think I’m at least above average. I may even be just average. But I don’t think I am ugly. I’ve taken a long and hard look at my appearance and compared it with others. I honestly believe I am maybe a 7/10. 

The reason, however, I believe my appearance affects my life negatively is because of this: 

I’m attractive (I guess. I would say I’m above average. So I can see when some people feel less than me in the looks department. For example, my best friend at age 15 would cry to me saying all of the guys wanted me and not her. People have told me I am better looking than her (without me asking). However, my friend wasn’t unattractive. She wasn’t the most beautiful girl, but she wasn’t the most ugly. She was maybe even a little bit above average herself as she put a lot of effort into her hair and makeup. However, it was clear that I often “stole” the spotlight from her because people simply thought I was more attractive. It’s really crazy how both of our appearances had such an effect on how people treated us when together?
Also, I don’t think I am out of my boyfriend’s league but he says I am. It has caused a lot of distance between us as he says he feels very insecure and not good enough for me. Because I am apparently too attractive for him. 

On the other hand, I am not perfect. I am not a 10/10 and it has affected me. 

My other best friend at age 15 was a 10/10. Perfect long blonde hair, blue eyes, pretty face, tan skin, long legs, toned stomach, big boobs. She was a 10/10 and guys always wanted her more than me. She stole the spotlight from me. Guys wanted her and were more obsessed with her. It really hurt my feelings. 

Also when I was 15, a really really attractive and popular football player told me he thought I was really pretty. He was considered the most attractive guy in his grade (he wasn’t older). Before even knowing me, he said he wanted to date me. This makes me believe I am clearly pretty enough to attract one of the most attractive guys in my school. However, people started to attack me saying he’s out of my league. I don’t know if he meant he is out of my league socially (I wasn’t as popular as him) or just looks-wise. Either way, really pretty girls were also competing for this guy’s attention. Girls who were prettier than me. It really affected me negatively. It’s so hard being told you are not good enough simply because one girl is better looking than you are. 

So why have I been on both sides of the scale? I have both been called “the pretty one” along with the “not as pretty” one. I’m sure I’m attractive, but not attractive enough to avoid being called inferior by others. I’m 19 now and obviously have changed since I was 15. But the negative effects on my self esteem have affected me to this day. 

I know how hard it is to be actually ugly (I don’t actually know from experience but I understand after hearing the perspective of others). I know ugly people are rejected constantly and are told horrible things. I also know there are downsides to being beautiful such as people only valuing them for their looks. And people start objectifying them. I understand. 

But nobody talks about what it is like to be average.... or maybe even slightly above average. Because when you are average, some people feel inferior to you on the scale and others feel superior. You feel the consequences of being both ugly AND beautiful. Some people treat me the same way beautiful people are treated and others treat me the same way ugly people are treated. It kinda sucks. I’m not trying to sound stupid or shallow. I just hope to hear others’ opinions on my situation.",10Jun2019,1
432,"So, to cut a very long story short I’ve known this girl since we were 17 from school, got close to her around 18 when we left and became pretty much inseparable. Things changed and I started making new friends and wasn’t always able to give that undivided attention to her. But she had other friends too. Anyway last summer she text me a very long message explaining she didn’t feel like she was treated well as a friend etc and she wanted to draw a line under the friendship, for me this was very out of the blue because she NEVER explained how she felt at any point to figure out how things were. 
I explained my reasoning in the past months for not being a “good friend” were because my dad was involved in a fatal accident and I had depression pretty badly as I’ve had for a long time, she then agreed to talk about stuff after I told her this which saddened me 

Then we spoke and it seemed to be agreed that we could bury the hatchet and move on. Well recently in my mind I’ve had a few thoughts that actually that was really insensitive and I think I’d like to talk about how it made me feel and recently she only messaged me a month ago on my birthday and we spoke for a week or so and since I haven’t heard from her and even before that it was a long while since I heard from her. I’m wondering what I should do, what would be the best way of dealing with this. Should I text her ask her about how she is etc and ask to meet sometime or do I just let it go and not bother bringing it up?

433,"For context; I'm 24, couldn't make it in college, got kicked out by the military, have a plethora of problems.

&amp;#x200B;

I was supporting my disabled mom and working 40+ hours a week doing customer service, obviously no overtime pay. We were barely making ends meet because she was wasting the money I was making on impulse purchases. What kept me sane day to day was my cat. I loved this cat, we did everything together, she'd wait by the doors or windows for me to come home and greet me every day, always by my side. I would've died for that cat, no questions asked, I was dependent on her. Making sure she was fed and happy was my reason for living and not killing myself on several occasions. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my logic was, customer service isn't working out to pay the bills, let's try the military and after three months they kicked me out. I was so dependent on the cat that every night I was gone, I was plagued with nightmares. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I got back home I learned that she died one week after I left. This hurt me greatly and I blame myself for leaving her behind, I don't think she could handle not being around me. Granted she was 17 and was technically old enough to pass, it didn't feel right. I've been devastated ever since and it's been almost a year now. I've lost the drive to work, I've lost to drive to do anything. Often I have more nightmares of her and wake up sobbing. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you suggest I do now that my reason for living and trying my best is gone? Just telling me to grieve or see a therapist or take anti-depressants aren't going to work. I've tried all of them. My body only reacts negatively to anti-depressants and when I talk to a therapist I can only think of it cynically.",10Jun2019,1

435,"So, I've been talking to a guy I met recently. We hit it off well, and we talk on the phone sometimes, and text daily. His texts have never been inappropriate. However, I am bipolar, and this guy is bipolar, sometimes with psychosis. He has some weird beliefs about how the world works. I totally get that, cool. He's a cool guy. Recently he told me that he was told a long time ago about a woman he was supposed to meet, and it's apparent that this foretelling was about me. He did not say it outright, but from what I gathered, he believes he should have married me, but found me too late, as I am VERY happily married 10+ years. I am fairly certain he would never push that on me, but now I'm worried that even a platonic relationship with him is inappropriate. I've been very open with my husband about it, and my husband is okay with it. He's not the jealous type, and completely believes I would never do anything inappropriate against him (which I wouldn't). If this guy became an issue for me, however, my husband would not hesitate to intervene. Again, I don't think that will happen though. Any thoughts on this? I really like this guy as a friend, especially since he's the first person I've met IN person who shares the same issues I have. He knows I'm taken, and I don't think he'd act on his feelings, but now that I know he has them, I'm worried it's inappropriate.

Also, yes, I know my name was poorly chosen. It was supposed to be a throwaway account that I ended up keeping in order to ask stuff I don't want anyone I know to see.",10Jun2019,1
436,"21F, in a conservative country where gay marriage is not a thing. 

My parents are conservative. My father has repeatedly stated his disdain for gay people, asserted that women should take on house chores (even said my aunt should leave planning the funeral of my grandmother to the men because women can't do things right), and says stuff like girls who stay out late are asking to be assaulted. My mother echoes his views when he talks mostly to avoid conflict, but she has told me about her trans coworker who she adores and stated that people deserve love no matter how they're born. She does think that gay people, when dating, should not be public about it though. 

I have to come out. I'm not happy. I went to a religious school and dated a girl when I was fifteen, and she left me because she didn't want to betray God. I tried really hard for the past five years to date men but it always ended it failure, because I just wasn't as into it as they were. I thought I was bisexual because I still had crushes on guys, but in the past five years and three boyfriends I've never had sexual contact with any of them. No, not even kissing.

I can't come out now. I'm taking a gap year because of medical issues and am unable to work to support myself until the issue is resolved. I'm living rent free with my parents, scheduled for surgery on my parents' insurance. So yes, not now. 

But my last year at university will be overseas, and I'm not sure if I should come out before or after I go. I have enough money saved to pay school fees, rent and food for the school year so I wouldn't have to worry about them cutting me off, and I get to run off to a country that's gay friendly. But I have to come back in a year because my visa will expire and there's no guarantee I'll get a job to stay there.

TLDR should I come out before or after going to another country for school?",10Jun2019,1
438,"So I have a friend I've known for just under 4 years and I've always been attracted to her but it's never been like all the way romantic, I've just always thought she was really funny, really smart, really pretty, etc but we were always exclusively friends. She's had a string of relationships since I've known her but the guys have all ended up being zeroes (cheated on her, alcoholics, etc). In that time, I've only had one relationship and it ended badly after she attempted to manipulate me into changing my entire personality and stop talking to all my friends, etc. Not the point.

Anyways, recently I've been thinking about her a lot more. So, I went to lunch with her yesterday and while we were sitting there just talking about her life and work and what-not, I realized that I actually had stronger feelings for her than first anticipated. The best way to honestly describe how it feels to me is Jake Peralta and Amy Santiago from Brooklyn 99 lol (Incidentally, she is actually a LOT like Amy, already. She got excited about a laminating machine when we were wandering around Staples). The problem is now I don't know what to do about all this; Should I ask her out and risk destroying the friendship if she says ""no"" because then my asking her will always be looming over her thoughts, or just keep my mouth shut?",10Jun2019,2

441,"I started talking to this girl and we’ve gone on a couple dates, nothing too serious. One of my friends recently told me that he invited her out for drinks on tinder and she accepted. He reached out to me because he told one of our friends about the situation who informed him we were going out sometimes. For some reason I know feel very anxious about the situation and don’t know how to approach it. I met this girl right after she got out of a relationship and I feel as though I don’t really have a play here other than to see how it goes from here but the fact that she is going on dates, or willing to, with other people makes me think I am being led on and somewhat taken advantage of since I pay for her stuff when we go to dinner and what not. I’m not sure how i should approach this conversation because I’m not really sure what I’m looking for, nor do I feel like I have the right to ask her to not go on casual dates with others. I think I just want her to be transparent about everything so I’m not left in the dark looking like a fool. How should I approach this situation?

TL/DR: started going out with girl. Friend asked her out on tinder not knowing her. She agreed. Don’t know if/how to approach her.",10Jun2019,2
442,"I try to make it as short as possible.

Situation: I applied for an internship in Asia and signed a contract. Will work there for 4 Months. All the administrative tasks were delegated from the CEO to his assistant. I asked the CEO several times for a starting date, he didn't give me an answer and suggested to ask his assistant. His assistant wasn't acting aswell, so I suggested the 15th of this Month as day to start. The thing is: It is a Saturday, where I normally would work for 4 hours. Another thing is there is a big celebration of my girlfriend's family which I wanted to attend. 

So I asked my boss if we could move the start of the internship to the 17th. A Monday. Thought it was a harmless question, especially considering that he currently already has an intern. Earlier he told me that he just wanted me to start a bit earlier before the current intern leaves, so he could introduce me to everything. 

Again I thought asking this would do no harm. In the worst case, he would say no. That's it, right?

Well, he said no and I accepted and told him I understand. But he started a big drama. Telling me that my girlfriend is influencing me too much and got really personal. I told him no need to worry. But he insisted that I don't take this job seriously and that he will see me fail? WTF? 

The thing is I am a bit dependent on this guy now. I took a long flight and spent money on it. And went to the trouble to apply for a visa. 

Normally, I would move on and run away from him as far as possible, seeing that he has some issues and doesn't know how to treat employees (I already despise working from him although I didn't start yet).

But my GF is here and I want to see here, since that is the only chance for us. 

&amp;#x200B;

447,"I've got a friend who maintains a non sexual relationship with someone who molested her as an adolescent. Recently she told me she was discussing some personal things about me with a friend and had some advice. I found the advice a bit condescending but I took it to heart, she is usually a bit condescending in those situations. It didn't really bother me that she talked about my life with a friend, as long as it wasn't someone mutual, whatever.

Later I found out she actually was discussing me with her former abuser. I felt really creeped out by that. I haven't said something about it, but I don't trust her anymore where before we were very close. How can I best deal with this?

PS: I've already told her I was worried about her talking with him when she first told me they were communicating.",10Jun2019,2
448,"I got my current job back in November. I never really meshed with it, but I was desperate to escape fast food and here I get paid more than minimum wage and get good benefits so I stuck it out. But small things have been piling up for a while that have started to wear on me. Breakdowns in communication, poor handling of critique toward my performance, the fact that I get blamed for not doing things I was never told were part of my job...

So, basically, I want to quit.

I had 2 jobs before I went away to college. One at Subway for 8 months, one at a call centre for 10. I got wrongfully dismissed from the first job and got laid off from the second, then went to school 6 months after the layoff. After my first year of school, I got a temporary, 2-month position over the summer. I worked the full 2-months, but had some personal issues with my supervisor so I don't list it on my resume. During my second year of school, I ran out of money and got a part-time job in fast food again. I ended up dropping out of school at the end of that year partly because the financial stress was too much but mostly because I decided to change majors and wanted to save up again before I went back for something else. So I kept my job and increased my hours and got an apartment nearby and lived on my own. I was there for about 14 months before the stress of competing for hours and living paycheque to paycheque got to be too much (Also, I wasn't saving any money, which had been the whole point) so I decided to quit and move back in with my parents. After about 6 months of searching, I got hired here.

I feel like I've been all over the place, in and out of jobs a lot in the last 5 years or so. And I have a reason for all of them (getting wrongfully dismissed wasn't my fault. Getting laid off wasn't my fault and I usually tell people I left that job so I could go to school, which is true since I'd been accepted by then. And I quit my last job so I could ease my financial burden, pay back student loans, save up, buy a car, get my feet under me again...)

So if I left my job now, less than a year after starting it, would employers look at me and see someone unwilling to commit? Would they even bother asking me why I left so many places without having worked at them for very long? Or will I be labeled a job-hopper and not worth the investment since I might jump ship? Should I just stick it out until I have a good tenure here? And if so, for how long? I'm so unhappy here.",10Jun2019,1
449,"So my friend and I have been friends for a long time- about 8 years. A year ago I would have said we were best friends. Since then a lot has changed in our dynamic.  Were in our late twenties and she started dating this guy 6 months ago. This is her FIRST bf ever. Before him all she had were friends with benefit who never wanted to commit- which I think is what makes this guy so appealing to her, the fact that he actually wants her. Anyway, this guy is kinda shitty. At first I wasn’t sure if I was looking too deep into it but I mean this guy is way neurotic. He’s super OCD and even in casual conversations with people if someone doesn’t agree with him he goes into “system overload” mode and snaps. Because imagine disagreeing with his views?! A few months we had a game night at our place where he shared with everyone he didn’t understand why women got to keep 50% of funds after divorce when statistically men make more money.. yeah, he said this. Rubbed a few ppl the wrong way, but my friend always makes excuses for him: “he’s just used to being right” and “growing up he was in a very traditional family”. 

I finally had it when I saw that after she had surgery on her ankle this dude flew to stay with us and was having HER wash dishes while hopping on one foot while he sat and talked to people. He is not only super inconsiderate in my opinion, but also manipulative. She has decided not to wear a bikini to a family gathering because she’s afraid it might catch the attention of one of her bfs BROTHERS and possibly trigger him into anger. Unless I’m reading his wrong.. that is control. He strikes me as the kind of person that slowly drives everyone that’s influential out of her life until she’s only got him left. Am I crazy here?! So I DID openly share my feelings with my friend and tell her all this- how I felt about this guy, why I thought he wouldn’t be good for her long term- and while she acknowledged where I was coming from she also felt he was “the one” and continued to date him.

This has really changed our friendship because I feel like she’s not the person I used to know. Recently we had a massive fight because I got her a job interview through a connection and she bailed (the day of) twice! Two days in a row she postponed her interview after I worked to set it up for her. I confronted her about this explaining it made me look terrible and she straight up told me she thought I was selfish and that she felt she did nothing wrong. Since then we sorta made up but our relationship is so awkward and distant it’s like two strangers living together. To be clear- I’m not jealous of her. I have a great job and an even better partner who I value tremendously. 

But what I don’t want is to promote this rivalry between us because In my mind this isn’t a competition, but I feel it’s become one. We rarely talk, rarely hang out. She can’t even give me a compliment to save her life when she used to be very expressive and encouraging. We are just weird. So, what should I do? I don’t want to blame her for this situation because I know I’ve played a role. But is this worth fixing? Because it feels like this is who she is now and this guy is who she will marry. And I can’t really deal with that energy around me for the rest of my life.  Oh and also- she’s been talking about me to her friends, one of whom told me she shared with him the whole job interview story and she and her bf both called me “toxic”. So that doesn’t really help the situation either.",10Jun2019,1
450,"I'm an only child (15) with no friends (and hardly even _any_ friends at that) that want to do the things I do. It's not asking for anything big, I just don't like to text or be on phones 24/7. I wanna go out to the park and play or go bike riding or something. Like actually interact and what not, more than just a few texts.

I know I don't _have_ to be with friends to go out and enjoy myself, but my parents are a _teensy_ bit protective, and don't like me leaving the house without their supervision (often times even if I am with friends and/or my friends parents). It sucks to be forced to go with your parents everywhere at my age, especially to places as insignificant as the park (only like two blocks away from our house), but I'd go with them just so I can actually do something. But they hardly want to do anything either. I mean, they're sort of old and whatnot. Always complaining about how tired they are, and a new body part is hurting every day. So I don't want to push it. 

I'm stuck in the house because of that. I've exhausted every book, video game, recipe, and activity that I own/have done. Learning new skills too. You'd be amazed how many random skills I know now. All of it is boring now. I wish I could buy some new things to find something to do again, but I don't have the money to. 

I try to look up how to not be bored or lonely, but all the websites talk about things to do when you're an adult and can travel, or when you're a kid and actually allowed out of the house. Rarely do they apply to me.

My mum said my hair has been growing for too long without a haircut and it looks like a woman’s hair who is homeless. She said it looked unhealthy, disgusting etc. I let her cut it and she said it’s an improvement. 
It did go a little too long since the last cut, I admit. 

We were going to go out to the movies and my hair was a little messy to be honest I hadn’t brushed it, I didn’t wear makeup just a clean outfit and she looked at me in disgust and said “you’re going to leave the house looking like that?!” 

And she said, “I’m not even asking you to get dolled up and look like a doll everyday, I’m just saying you should wear some simple basic everyday makeup.” 

I’ve never thought of myself as ugly, Idk I get catcalled a lot and I have just thought of myself as pretty normal looking, maybe even pretty/cute sometimes.

I don’t understand why she would say this, I thought your mother was supposed to love you no matter how ugly you are lol.

453,"I am 30 years old. I spent most of my life single. I had one relationship when I was 21 that lasted two months. I tried everything. Online dating, meetups, and even moving across country to a major city, and still couldn't even find a GF. Every time I find my ""crowd"", or group of people who share my interests, they're always either 55+ years old or dorky, nerdy guys who I wouldn't want to have a beer with.

I lost my virginity at age 29. At age 30, I manage to get a relationship with the girl of my dreams. She's an adult model and everything I could have ever wanted in a woman. I got the one thing I felt like I was always missing in life, in the best way possible.

I ended up leaving her twice. The first because I felt like I couldn't handle her unfounded trust issues, but I learned to tolerate them after coming back. The second time I left because she didn't support how much time I was dedicating towards being a musician and because she couldn't accept I needed to take ADHD meds regularly.

I left her for all the right reasons. I had to be fair to myself, but being fair to myself hasn't made me happy. I'm the only one who cares about my music. I feel like I'm giving up control of my life to my meds. I realize in hindsight, neither of the things I left her for are making me happy. I tried moving on, but just can't find anyone I'm attracted to. I begged her to take me back. She told me she's moved on and to never contact her again.

I'm sitting here alone, single, and deeply depressed instead taking glamour photos and videos of an instagram star. I'm looking for a place to sob uncontrollably instead of having the most amazing sex ever with the woman I always fantasized about, and I'm left with things I'm not even sure why I'm pursuing anymore.

456,"Ever since I was a kid all I wanted to do regarding my future career was write and direct movies. I remember sitting in my room watching Jaws or The Big Lebowski and just thinking “I could do this!” or at least “I wanna be apart of this!” In fifth grade my writing teacher asked us as a class what we wanna be when we grow up and told us to respond as honest as possible. When I said in front of the class “movie director” the teacher looked me right in the eyes and said “Sam you’re gonna do that. One day we’ll watch a movie that’s directed by you.” As I went through the years I kept watching more and more film and I remember going to the theater with my brothers and just being starstruck. Modern pictures like Moonlight, Hereditary, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, Lady Bird, and even Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade all stuck in my head for about a week after I saw them. 
The number of movies I’ve seen and appreciated is uncountable and there have been many directing techniques and writing skills I have either picked up on or learned through examining film. In high school I didn’t take any video or media classes simply because of the unseriousness and boring assignments those students had to complete. I tried accouting and hated it, but I’ve kept the career title screenwriter in the back of my head all these years and only have expressed interest in filmmaking to a very few number of people (which I regret). I also took advanced English courses throughout high school that furthured my knowledge with writing. However my junior year of high school I took a class called AP Environmental Science and found passion in it. I enjoyed the physical labor of caring for a water system and also found extreme interest in how applied the field of environmental science is to the real world especially in economics. 
So right now I’m at a crossroads when it comes to college. The univeristy I’m attending has both respectable Film Production and Environmental/Geology programs. I feel like I have the mentality to collaborate with others and really do something with film in college but the cost of a degree is almost not enough worth it. I know jobs don’t present themselves right in front of a person who holds a film degree and a big part of finding work with making movies is moving to either Los Angeles, New York City, or Atlanta. Finding a job would be quite easy with an environmental degree since it’s part of STEM and revolves around the growing green energy industry.

In my country that's not socially acceptable. And even if gay marriage and adoption will eventually get legalized, the stigma of being gay and the hatred towards it will not fade in my lifetime.

467,"So about 6 months ago, my friend “Sarah” and her boyfriend “Ryan” broke up. A week later another friend of ours “Hannah” slept with Ryan. 

Little back story, Hannah was crazy. She just became friends with us and had already slept with everyone’s friends and was caused lots of drama. 

So no one tells Sarah, because she’s already distraught over Ryan breaking up with her and she is kind of friends with Hannah. Life goes on for a year, and Sarah begins to move on... cue the fuck up I need advice on. 

Sarah had gotten very close with Hannah after all this. I distanced myself from the friend group and moved out of state. I come back for the first time in 6 months and find out that Hannah and Sarah have gotten very close, and Hannah still hasn’t told Sarah about what she did. I hang out with Sarah  and we start drinking. Drunk me tells Sarah that Hannah slept with Ryan and we all knew and didn’t know how to tell her because we didn’t know how to. Over the next 24 hours Sarah  begins to realize how shitty it is we all lied to her face about it and let them become friends and now feels like a fool. 

There is a lot more back story to this, but I didn’t want to make this too long, and I’m already kind of a crappy writer/story teller. 

I feel horrible that I told Sarah because now she feels so betrayed and humiliated. I also feel horrible that none of us told her sooner (literally a group of about 8 of us knew and were really close and no one told her). Sarah is now mad at me and all of us, which I totally understand and don’t blame her, but should I have told her? Should I not have told her, should we have all told her in the very beginning? 

I know the right thing would have been to tell her immediately after, but we all wanted to protect her from the harsh situation. It’s kind of a shitty situation with no good solution....",10Jun2019,1

470,"Back story: He's been working for this company for almost as long as we've been together as a couple (8 years together as a couple, 7 years working for this company), so it's not as if I haven't given the company and himself a chance. He gives so much of himself to this company and practically works himself into the ground to produce the results that he wants, but it's not enough. There are more negative months then there are positive. I do not expect him to be the sole bread winner, as I work full time too (and plan to go back to school shortly to help even more), but we both have dreams of creating a life together (buying a house, having kids, etc) and with his income being so unstable I worry that we won't get there. For 7 years I've listened to him tell me that that is how business works, especially sales, and that he just needs more time to get to where he wants to be. I understand that some up and down is natural for sales, but this just seems like a dead end. I want him to be happy and I in no way want to take away his passion, but we need to be realistic too. I love him so much and he has such a strong work ethic that I know that he could easily excel in another company. It shouldn't be this hard to get ahead in a company you've worked in for 7 years already.

So, how do I approach this? 

Every time I have brought it up in the past, he becomes defensive and it ends up turning into a fight when I just want to have a rational discussion. He's stubborn and his number one worst critic, so I know it bothers him too that he isn't doing well financially, so I don't want to burden him more with my own concerns. BUT I feel as though I have every right to be concerned, with our wedding 5 months away, and our finances being no where near where it should be.

471,"Hi,

I hope all I say doesn't come across bratty I just need some advice for what to do in my relationship 

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 10 months now and I feel as though he doesn't hold our relationship to the standard of his ex.

Me and him got together quite raw at the end of last relationship and he didn't want a girlfriend but after spending time together for 2 or 3 months we realised we got a long so well we should be together but before this I was the one comforting him through the breakup, him always saying that he missed her family and her so much all the time.  Which I understood because I had gone through a breakup about 5 months earlier . 

But the problem starts about 4 months after we started dating and he did nothing for my birthday, not even a card and a few weeks later did nothing for Christmas when I went out  and bought him gifts. 


Then months later for valentines day the same, and I bought him presents which I returned because  i was beyond  upset  and  hurt  

The issue here is he always talked about his ex which they were together for about 2 years, and all the things he did for her like the gifts he got her and the places he took her and I know you shouldn't compare relationships but I just feel so forgotten and a bit thrown to the side and not  cared about. 

To me not doing these things and forgetting about them just I don't know, makes me feel like he doesnt think  of me or want to do things for me.. 

I've spoken to him about it and I don't expect to be taken out and princessed every week all I ask is those 3 days of the year to do things for eachother and go out for dinner every month or so, I don't think that's much to ask for ? :(  but he just doesn't think about these things or seem to want to go out of his way to do anything for me? When everyday all I think about is what I can do to make him happy

474,"Hey everyone!

I'm a 25 y/o male who's recently (~4 months) re-entered the dating scene. My last relationship was about 4.5 years with us living together for 4 of those years and being engaged for 2 of them. I'm not sure if it's the dating scene that's changed while I was out or if it's moreso me, but I'm evaluating now when is it right to enter a formal relationship?

By this I mean, in all my other relationships I have been almost head-over-heels with a person before entering a relationship. Butterflies in the stomach and all. After our breakup, I immediately hit the scene again. Not looking for relationships, just affectionate times to make up for the near year absence of them I'd experienced. I've went on dates with numerous girls since but have been consistently seeing one for the past 2 months. I've gotten quite close to the one I've been seeing and have put down the dating apps, not feeling like they warrant the time and energy given I'm seeing someone. We see each other often and are only interested in each other, so for all intents and purposes we're dating in my eyes. To me, we're kind of limited in how much we can grow together here because she won't have sex until she's ""in a relationship"" but that's a somewhat related but different matter here.

I think of this girl quite a bit and love spending time with her, but I don't feel the head-over-heels, I don't feel the butterflies. I'm not really interested in a relationship (meeting family &amp; friends, mushy stuff, etc.) with anyone at this point but do feel like I'm kind of in one, right? 

**TL:DR**This all leads to my main point - do you all only formalize things when you want the traditional, outward bf/gf stuff (I feel childish even asking) or just slide into that sort with time spent together? Is the ""love at first sight, head-over-heels, butterflies"" a pre-requisite for you in relationships or does that stuff also come with time? Am I just being a fuckboy?

Thank you!",10Jun2019,1

And ironically, there were couples in the store. And he was perfectly comfortable asking me to grab his size and choose more styles so he can try them on and asking for my opinion.

477,"I’m not going to do a tell all of why or how my dad and i’s relationship is. We’d be here a long time but one of his favorite things to do is guilt tripping me ESPECIALLY with my siblings. See I’m 20 and my brother and sister are 8 and 10 years younger than me. All of my life my dad has done a great job at controlling me and now that I’m out of his house and can actually see what he’s doing from a distance I started to realize that hey this isn’t right... 

If there was ever an event that they wanted me to come to and I didn’t want to because my family picks on me every time I go to one, telling me how much of a failure I am and how I should be starting a career I don’t even like. And then I tell them my dream job and they shoot me down by saying it involves math and they give me a pouted face asking if I’m good at math to which I say no and then they’re like well....guess you can’t do that career. A lot of stuff honestly and they hate my boyfriend because he smokes weed and they think he’s going to end up doing like meth or something. SO ya that’s my family. 

But if I don’t go to one of these events my dad will be like “but your brother and sister are going to be there, you don’t want them to be upset that you didn’t come or not care about them. So I go, it ends up depleting my self esteem. I go home depressed for the week and go back into my routine until it all happens again. Or there’s the famous “I need you to pick your brother and sister up from school”. If I don’t do that then he throws a fit pulling the “your brother and sister are gonna think their sissy doesn’t love them”. 

I’ve started to stick up for myself and started saying no when I can’t because I’ve always dropped what I’m doing to get them because I get guilt tripped. This brings me to today, last week I got called at 8am to pick up my sister from her babysitters house because the babysitter started taking new depression meds and wasn’t answering my parents texts. I have no idea what happened so I just went over there and picked up my sister, but there seemed to be nothing wrong with the situation. The babysitter was asking to hang out because we know eachother and I had to make up an excuse to why I couldn’t stay. It was horrible and I didn’t want to be put in that position. So today I’ve been sick like don’t want to leave the couch and watch movies all day sick. My dad calls....and honestly I jump everytime he calls me or any of my family so I pick up and he’s asking me again to go check on my sister to which I say “no I’m sorry I can’t, I just told my uncle I’m sick and can’t work today” (I work for my uncle and my dad does part time) to which he says “I woke up at 3am, go get her” and I said “dad, I’m sick I can’t get out of bed I’m not doing it” and this is where he starts getting really upset trying to control me even though I don’t live with him. “Being sick is the same thing as waking up at 3am to work, go get your sister” so I stick up for myself again and say it’s not the same thing, all he says after that is bye and hangs up immediately. 

Now I know I shouldn’t feel guilty but honestly I’m tired of this, I don’t know how to not be beaten down by my dad. My parents use me for everything with my siblings and I get it I’m the easiest to go to but I have to start having my own life too. I can’t drop everything I’m doing to get them. And I care immensely about them like they’re my brother and sister. I’ve raised them while my mom was out cheating and my dad was traveling for work. I just can’t do these things they’re wanting me to. How do I get over this guilt and honestly stick up for myself more? Because I feel like saying no just isn’t enough.",10Jun2019,1

First things first, we were all taking menatl tests as jokes. It was fun and games until we realized in every test, she got autism/Asperger's, and not her just ADHD talking

She also has some symptoms
-sometimes she barks when her dog barks
-cant wash her hair by herself
-has trouble using the bathroom
- the over thinks and over explains
-she dances and humms more than that of someone with ADHD would
-she flails alot
-she get really interested in her hobbies and ignores other things she doesn't like, like school subjects
-its hard for her to talk and make friends
-sometimes she's very loud and spastic, but other times quiet
-when she doesn't wanna do something (including talking), she doesn't
-she requires specific attention, but doesn't get it because nobody knows
-sometimes she speaks so little it's like she doesn't know how to talk
-she does awful in social situations, and frets easily

Some clarification:
She does have some emotional trauma and several mantal disorders. She has anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I did do some research and her symptoms may no be caused by adhd/anxiety. If you need more clarification, just ask and I will comment. 

P.S. her grandmother is very narcissistic and won't even believe she had depression, even though her therapist legit told her.

485,"I’ve known this kid for about 5 years. We’ve been great friends up until a few years ago where we would be playing PS4 together and he would randomly start leaving without saying a word. This wasn’t just with me either, he did this when we were playing in groups of 4+ as well.

I found out (because he would tell me afterwards as if it were normal behaviour) that he was actually just leaving to play with someone else, no warning, nothing, he just left.

After continuous months of ditching me I got annoyed and decided to stop talking to him, being the socially weak person that I am, I continued the friendship soon after.

It continued though and since we have been on-and-off friends for about 3 years. Sometime early this year or late last year I started playing with him again and he once again leaves without warning. I’ve had enough and have spoken to him once since.

What he keeps doing really hurts as it’s hard to not take personally, and I’ve tried to explain that it hurts, but he continues to do it anyway. He is shy, introverted and kind, but once we start playing it’s like he changes into someone who doesn’t worry about consequences. The worst part is he doesn’t seem to care that our friendship has ended so many times, and it seems like there is no change for him when it restarts.

I enjoy his company and I want to be friends with him, but I don’t want to go back to him as I’m afraid to be hurt again. What should I do? Thanks for reading.

Hi All, thanks for reading. 

So I've decided (at 26) to further my education with something I'd have a huge interest in. I've been offered a place for an online course for Wildlife management with Learning Cloud(?). An online course is the only option for me as I can't actually afford to quit work to go back officially to college. Their 100 hour course offers an IARC recognition (which they informed me is the same as a level 5 award). 


As an Irish citizen who would like to travel with this I'm just wondering if it's widely recognised or is it any good? Would sanctuaries and wildlife rehabilitation centres accept this? Or even would anyone accept this? 


Any and all information you have would be hugely appreciated. If you've studied with Learning Cloud before of if you have an IARC recognition you will be my saviour. I'm just afraid of finally trying to better myself for it all to turn out to be a big scam.

It was a really good conversation - it led to him telling me about a women at work he found attractive.

this whole time from high school i havent been sure what i want because my parents have only told me what id be good for which is med school. they pushed me towards a program which i did not care about until they started advertising it towards me saying it will make it easier to get into med school. i looked into the curriculum and its interesting but not as intriguing as psychology. but i applied anyways and got rejected. its a very well known premed program in my country and it has a 70% acceptance rate into med school but only about 100-150 students in each year.  so obviously lots of people apply. 

my parents just kept telling me id love the program blah blah making me put it as my first choice for my 2nd year transfer instead of my passion which is psychology. 


so i missed the deadline for their supplementary because i lost all my confidence after getting rejected from every job and research position i applied to for the summer. i was scared of being rejected again from this premed program and getting the message again that im not as smart as those people and not as good as them and they are special. 

i put a very selective psych program as second priority and i got in. i cant be happy about it or celebrate it because i feel like shit for missing my opportunity. i would have had much more time for extracurriculars and less stress on those courses if i had gotten in possibly by applying but now ill never know if i was rejected. 


did i make the right choice? i love psych and i dont know if its a waste if i want to go to med school or if i even want to go? or if im just thinking ill enjoy psychology because i want the ""easy way"". thats what my parents say a lot so i never know how i really feel",10Jun2019,1

Im currently unemployed, as i recently quit my job, however I should have income flowing in within the next 7days, and im also looking potentially for another one. I contemplated my living situation for awhile, and think $50 a month FOR BOTH me and and my girlfriend is more then fair. I literally need to live here for 1-2 more months. I will however play the devils advocate and say I lived here for about 4 months rent free. The rent was paid the first and second month, and after that, we stopped. So we gave them a total of like $600. I think about paying the rent sometimes bug literally their such pieces of shit that I wanna just move out and say fuck them and not pay them shit. I like to see myself as a positive, vibrant person. People tell me all the time how im smart, a gentle man, this and that. And then when im around these people, they make me feel like im not those things. But i think to myself, fully functional people are giving me these compliments while people who are struggling to survive are popping shit. Wtf is going on? 6 months at $600 is $100 a month so im thinking that'll be enough. I dont want to give them anything. Were barely home, and i dont even eat their food. The son eats our shit sometimes too. Am i tripping?",10Jun2019,1

503,"My now ex-boyfriend and I are expecting a baby in 3 weeks, if not sooner. I broke up with him about 3 weeks ago. He totally lacked commitment. He did not try to make our relationship work, he didn’t do anything to help with the pregnancy (ask me how I was or if I needed anything), he has not shown any interest in the baby until probably the last 2 months and more so after I broke up with him. I am totally in love with him and wanted it to work but he didn’t try and I couldn’t ignore the signs that he just didn’t want to be with me. So I manned up and did what he couldn’t and ended the relationship. He didn’t fight me on it at all.

So before I even decided to break up with him, I wanted to hyphenate baby’s last name. There was no real commitment, we didn’t even live together and there was no interest to do so on his part. My son is half of me and I want him to have my name too. I was too nervous to bring up the topic while we were together because I was worried he would see it as ultimatum to get married or else... When I finally brought up hyphenating baby’s last name, he got very upset. He took it as me punishing him for not wanting to be with me and that I was just being petty. He said “as a guy... I wouldn’t like having a hyphenated last name. It’s just weird.” And “my last name is already really long, that’ll just make it longer.” He also said “what happens if you get married and your last name isn’t xxxxx anymore?” I thought about that but.... I really don’t want to change my last name anyways haha I’d probably hyphenate my last name too. He didn’t talk to me for a few days and I haven’t brought it up since. It’s been about a week. Baby is coming.... soon.... and I want to address this again.

Most importantly I want to ask, if your name is hyphenated because your parents aren’t together, how do you feel about it? 

Parents that have hyphenated their kids’ names in a similar situation, how did you go about asking and dealing with negative fall out?",10Jun2019,1
504,"This is tough because I like this girl more than in just a romantic/sexual way, she seems to genuinely like and care about me, and we have similar interests and always make each other laugh. This girl I've kinda liked really bad for the past 3 years hit me up a  few days ago and I basically told her everything about how she'd hurt  me and even all my deep seated insecurities and stuff (probably a  mistake). I liked her from the first time I met her and we had a lot of  common interests and could make each other laugh a lot. We hung out and I  made out with her a lot but never had sex or took it further than that.  After that she stopped even kissing me and I basically became her orbiter while she banged other guys and this really hurt. She's  been banging a guy that is abusive to her and condescending to me pretty  much the whole time and also banged my friend who banged girls I liked  in high school too. I told her she'd hurt me and I can't be her friend.  She also told me she's pretty much totally infatuated with abusive guy  and no guy made her feel like he did. This made me feel disgusted and  insulted especially knowing that she was probably doing everything under  the sun with this guy while stringing me along and I basically went off  on her, told her we're not friends and revealed a lot of my  insecurities and the roots of why this upsets me so much from when I was  young (in my experience it's usually not a good idea to expose these things to girls). The thing is a lot of things have gotten better in my life in  the past two years, including girl stuff. There's just a side of my  brain that tells me I'm an ugly awkward loser due to experiences from when I was much younger and the whole ordeal with  her makes me question my worth and attractiveness. Should I just never  talk to her again? There's a part of me that thinks I may have still had  a chance if I kept this to myself and just asked her to hang out or  something when she hit me up as I hadn't seen her in a long time when  she hit me up.

511,"background: I'm 20years old. She convinced me to go to school in the state where her job relocated her to. For lack of a better term its a bumfuck southern state, and it's extremely boring. She showed me the handful of fun things to do and led me on that there was ""so much more"". I really wanted to go to Purdue for Engineering or Loyola for Medicine but she kept telling me I would never get into either school (even though Loyola offered me a damn near full ride scholarship). I digress.

Anyway, she told me on that I could move down here and live with her to fulfill the residency requirement so I could go to school cheaper. However, she found out she was pregnant two months before I was supposed to move down and just told me I couldn't move in. I didn't think much of it but it definitely tacked about $20,000 onto my tuition because I had to come here as an out-of-state resident and it was too late to apply for any benefits or discounts.

Fast forward a little bit (my late Freshman/early Sophomore year as a BS Physics major with a concentration in Optics): She is still at the same job and CONSTANTLY talks about how she hates it. She hates the people, she hates the work, etc. She constantly talks about promotions and opportunities she applies for but never gets. She tells me that it doesn't matter what I major in and jobs don't care what my GPA is (a solid 4.0 at the time) and that I'll just end up where she is. I get really discouraged and confused because everyone else was telling me the exact opposite but she kept saying ""trust me"". (background: she failing out of her first semester as a STEM major, and ended up being a 5 or 6 year English Lit major) I ended up switching my major my second semester of sophomore year because I was not enjoying my interactions with the Physics department and I found a better career path suited to what I want to pursue.

Fast forward to March 2019: my mom files for divorce with her dad. Her dad was extremely abusive to me from the time my mom met him until I left the house (I would frequently run away from home from the age of 16-18, until I was able to legally move out on my own). So, I don't know if he only abused me because I was his stepchild or she's in denial of the abuse, but he has beaten me so bad that Child Protective Services was called to our house multiple times and I was hospitalized several times because the gaslighting would send me into psychotic fits.

Anyway, when my mom told her dad about the divorce she sent me a long message hoping it wouldn't affect our relationship or whatever. I told her I wanted absolutely nothing to do with her dad anymore (I hadn't talked to him in months at the time) and she told me that was fine but I needed to be respectful of that fact that was her father. Which is really whatever to me I just figured we wouldn't talk about him because I have no relationship with him and I figured she would respect that boundary that I wanted him out of my life. A don't ask, don't tell situation.

NOPE! I went home at the end of this past spring semester and bought a car (not to suck my own dick, but a pretty nice 2016 Mazda that I am incredibly proud of) I did it completely on my own after not having a car for two years and being reliant on public transportation and becoming extremely depressed from my lack of freedom. I mentioned the car to her while visiting a few weeks before I went home and she started babbling about how I didn't need a car and I should just get an old Honda blah blah blah. I just passively agreed with her. The day I went home she started blowing up my phone about the car. I ignored her, I posted the car on facebook (I have my privacy set to where she and her husband cannot see what I post) because I did NOT want my stepdad/mom's ex husband to know that I was home. I sent her a picture the day I left to return back to my apartment in the state where I go to school. A few days after that, my mom's ex-husband called my mom threatening her to take out equity on my car. He can't believe she bought me a brand new car and all that. HUH? There's no way he could have found out, unless my sister told him. Then, he called my mom again and said ""oh yeah so Kayla has a Mazda huh?"" and I am just absolutely livid.

Which brings me to my final grievance... right now I am studying BS Public Health with a minor in Statistics and I love going to school and doing my homework everyday. Like I am absurdly passionate about what I am doing. I have a 3.9 GPA (damn you Precalc!) I'm working in a research lab on my campus that pays me to travel and present research and I have found great mentors in my department. My life feels like a dream. But, my sister always downs me and tells me just to switch for an easier major (don't get me wrong I still get overwhelmed and occasionally complain about my workload because my school assigns projects every semester to Honors students) she always says my job won't match my degree, I'm wasting my money, and I won't be able to get into a good graduate school and it's all just a waste of money.

514,"Hi! I was hoping someone could help me understand a situation better or maybe provide some advice. I’m a 29yr female and my boyfriend is a 30yr old male. We have been together for about six months now, most of which has been wonderful. 

Lately he’s been dealing with some stress but nothing crazy and nothing the ordinary person doesn’t also experience. However, due to that stress he tends to pull away and not be as communicative when we’re together. On top of that, I’m currently pulling more of the load so to speak, since he recently lost his license for a few months. I’m driving an hour each way to see him and take him to work several times a week- which I don’t mind, but it does get frustrating when I feel like I’m the only one doing work to keep us together. 

Now that you know the backstory.... last night he invited me over because his roommate was gone and we would actually get to be alone - something that doesn’t happen often. I walked in the door and sat down to find him watching a movie. I asked what movie it was and when he answered he kind of mumbled so I asked him to repeat it. He then snapped at me and loudly told me the title. He went back to not speaking, not really acknowledging me &amp; laying on the couch facing away from me. I asked him if he was in a bad mood and if he wanted me to go home, which honestly was a warranted question given his behavior. This caused him to annoyedly ask “why do you always think that?!” - im not proud of this, but all the anger and frustration I’ve felt recently over always having to be the one making plans, always having to pull all the weight, always feeling like I have to beg for his attention, etc. finally bubbles over and I raised my voice and yelled “BECAUSE YOU NEVER FUCKING TALK TO ME!” Immediately he yelled at me to “get the fuck out” and I tried to apologize and calmly explain why I was upset and try to work through it- but he just kept yelling at me to “get the fuck out now....” I told him it was almost midnight at that point and pouring and I really didn’t want to drive an hour home but I would sleep on the couch away from him and not speak to him. Nope, he kicked me out and made me leave. Today I tried talking to him and asked if I could bring him lunch to work to aplogize- he said no. 


I truly think he is taking this overboard with his refusal to speak to me or even understand where I’m coming from. I know I shouldn’t have yelled, and I acknowledged that and apologized but he is taking this too far and I wondered if anyone had any advice.",10Jun2019,1

It's important to say that I am an alcoholic in recovery ( been sober 5+ years ) - we drank a lot together and my drinking got incredibly messy and he was more than a witness to that. He once blamed me for ruining his life when we lived together. I would often be brought home by the police or go missing for days 

We are both in our 40s and been best pals since our early 20s, so we are not kids.

Since he left the band he deleted me from social media while continuing to be friends with all our mutual friends. The band carried on and I know that would of wounded him.
 
I got married a few months ago and reached out to him inviting him to the wedding, he never replied. This was the 4th time I have reached out to him and each time there was no reply

My family and friends have told me that I have moved on with my life and got my shit together ( with a lot of help ) and he is just jealous as his life was a bit of a mess. Others have suggested that he feels replaced by my wife. Others have said that "" you don't need him""

But it's not that easy...I love the guy and I miss him. I want to see if he is ok and how he is doing.

522,"I think the title speaks for itself, but here's a little detail:

I (27, M) live in an apartment complex with a demographic that's ~95% consistent with my age and lifestyle (no children, very social, significant amount of partying, etc.).  I'd say maybe 3-4 units in the building out of ~300 are home to tenants with children.  About a month ago, a new couple moved in next door, and now my bedroom shares a wall with their newborn baby's bedroom.  It cries FREQUENTLY.  The apartment is reasonably well built, so the sound is dampened, but I can definitely hear it, even with my TV on.  My gf &amp; I's favorite thing to do on the weekends when nursing a hangover is just lay in bed and watch Netflix, but yesterday, we heard the crying the entire day.  In addition, my gf already has trouble sleeping, so this is definitely costing her some resting hours.

525,"tl;dr I just want to enjoy my senior year of high school my removing club swimming from my schedule, but my parents claim that I need the exercise since other things activities aren't as intense as swimming.

&amp;#x200B;

First things first, I just want to emphasize how much I dislike club swimming. I am supposed to have practice six times a week and I usually go to four of them. Even with this reduction, I still feel as if club swimming just makes each week impossible to get through. On the days that I don't have swimming, I am energetic and happy about the fact that I can spend the remainder of the day doing my own thing. And on the days that I do, every happy thought is trampled by the constant reminder that I have swim practice after school. However, there is one good thing to come out of it — the fact that I am in decent physical shape as a direct result from swimming. In other words, I have always hated , but I have managed to endure for the past seven years. 

&amp;#x200B;

My high school team, on the other hand, is more enjoyable, partly because I have much more friends there, and also because it's more casual.

&amp;#x200B;

So now that it's the end of my junior year, I had decided that I wanted to quit club swimming in order to enjoy my final year before college. This decision was met with heavy resistance. My father got very angry as soon as I mentioned it, arguing that I need the exercise and that swimming was independent of the weather, meaning that it was more reliable. In addition to that, my father was also angered at the fact that he had raised me on swimming and was disappointed by the fact that I hated it. My mother also argued the fact that I needed the exercise because besides swimming, I am relatively sedentary. 

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to them a bit later, and I agreed to swim in the fall, and on my high school team for the winter, but they still wouldn't budge, even after I told them that I would be outside playing basketball with my friends during the spring. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, my parents seem to think that swimming is the only way I can get sufficient exercise. While that is not completely unreasonable, since I don't have the best history with non-aquatic sports, I believe that I get enough exercise from playing basketball with my friends and through other non-swimming activities.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it unreasonable that I want to stop swimming for my final year? Is my father right to be disappointed by my hatred for swimming? And lastly, what can I do to compromise with them? It seems as if the only option they're giving me is to participate in swimming just as I am doing right now.",10Jun2019,1

527,"I need help. Throwaway because I don’t want this on my regular account. Also on mobile so sorry for formatting and whatnot.

So for the past 8 months I’ve been doing my dream job for a large, well-known company. Our project was contracted through a 3rd party. 3 months ago I interviewed for my position through the actual company so that I could continue to do the job after the 3rd party’s contract ended. I interviewed, passed the background check and drug test, and all was well. However, they extended our contract until last month, so I had to redo the background check and drug test a month ago because my original ones had expired or something. Two days before my mouth swab drug test, a recurring cyst on my shoulder came back and ruptured so I had to go to an urgent care to get it looked at. The doctor drained the infection and prescribed me two days worth of Tylenol 3 (the kind with codeine). I took the meds because I was in pain. I knew I’d fail the drug test for codeine, but I figured since I had a prescription I would be fine. Long story short, the lab called and told me I failed the drug test for codeine and oxycodone. I told them I had prescription information I could give them. I submitted my prescription and they said that wasn’t good enough. So, I went and got a personalized note from my doctor that stated he had prescribed medication that would cause me to fail a drug test and he would be available if the lab had questions for him. It’s been 2 weeks since I submitted this information (4 since I took the test), and now the lab is telling me that’s not good enough either and there’s nothing I can do because I failed the test for oxycodone. Thing is, I’ve not taken oxycodone since I was prescribed Percocet after a surgery in January 2018. I have NOT taken ANY OXYCODONE since. I said it must be a false positive, and they said that’s not possible because their tests are accurate. I have told them I was on a lot of other medications at the time, prescription and non-prescription (such as an antibiotic, anti-fungal pill, NyQuil, nasal decongestant, etc), but they refuse to take any of this information. I’ve done extensive googling and I can’t figure out what would have caused me to fail for oxycodone. I can’t even find anything that could trigger a false positive for oxycodone specifically. I need advice on what I should do. I have been working with one HR woman throughout this process, but there’s not much she can do. She said the lab told her I’m on a hold for codeine (can they tell her what I failed for? I already told her but still). I’ve emailed her to request to re-take the test, explaining the situation in detail. She is out today so she has not gotten back to me. Does anyone know of anything that could cause me to fail a drug test for a drug I didn’t take? Or what to do if the lab refuses to believe me? This was a 10 panel saliva test through Alere, if it makes any difference. My girlfriend posted this question for me on the drug testing sub a couple weeks ago, but it went nowhere. Thank you all in advance, this is my dream job and I really don’t want to lose it over something I didn’t even do.",10Jun2019,1
528," Hi peeps, I am 25 year old female. My husband is 30 with 8 years active duty army, now working as a contractor deploying 4 months per year. In high school I was in Civil Air Patrol and was very dedicated and excited about joining the military. Then I became excited about boys instead, made stupid decisions and lost sight of things. I had given up on this ever being an option but after having what started as a random conversation, my hubs said it sounded like it was something that I still badly wanted and that I could absolutely still do it. Honestly, this has never occurred to me as my family is very much a the wife supports the husband homemaker type so I gave up on doing something for myself like this when I got married. I am terrified but also very excited at the idea but am just not sure how to wrap my head around it. Thoughts? advice?

531,"Sorry in advance for how awful this post is going to be, I've never been on this sub until now and I'm sorry if I do something wrong. Anyways, hi. My name is Madeline, I'm 17 years old, and I'm transgender (MtF). I have very bad depression, anxiety, insomnia, ADHD, PTSD, a bad home environment, and there's a chance I'm about to fail my senior year of high school. I'm not like a dumb person, I just missed a month and a half of school because I got hospitalized after a suicide attempt. I need to have a finished research paper about PTSD, a poetry analysis paper, and an Article of the Week assignment all turned in by tomorrow the latest and I'm running out of time but I've had so much going on in my life recently that I can't bring myself to focus on it. I have a friend that has been contemplating suicide for the past two or three days, my mom has been slowly killing herself (she's smoking for the sole reason of shortening her life span, and she's also sick with something but refuses to tell me what's wrong) because of me, my brother (19 years old) won't stop verbally abusing me, this entire year I've slowly been losing more and more friends, and because of all of this I can't bring myself to do anything. I've been sitting in bed crying for three days, not working on any of those assignments I need, and scared of what's going to happen to me. If I fail my senior year, then I can't do summer school because my mom won't pay for it, and another full year of high school might kill me. However, even if I pass the year and I graduate, I'm still going to have to deal with all of this and I don't think I'd be able to handle it. I turn eighteen in a little over a month, which means I'd be able to leave and go live on my own, but I'm so scared. I don't know what I'd do or where I'd go (I live in New Jersey, like 15 minutes from New York City), but if I stay I'd have to live with this torture even longer. I just can't see a future for me where I can live safely, with enough money to pay for all my meds, and a way for me to be happy. I'm stuck and I can't see the way out. Someone please, help me. I don't know what to do.",10Jun2019,1
532,"Heavy topic, but on February 24th I was sexually assaulted by an acquaintance that I thought I could trust. I'm 21 (F) and he's somewhere in his 50s. It took me 5 days to decide to report it to the police because I thought somehow I'd provoked it and was scared to come forward. Eventually I did, only for the future possible victims.

Obviously by the time I went forward there was no longer physical evidence on or in me, but I had saved my clothes and I took them in with me to make my report. I had written up my statement of facts the previous night to make sure that I had all the facts down, and I took that in too, along with the address of where it happened, and the phone numbers of him and a few people that were at the house and the owner of the house.

I was assigned a female investigator at the sheriff's office and she seemed sympathetic and professional at first. She told me to email her because she's not usually available to talk over the phone, so that's what I did. Over the last 3+ months she's gotten less and less responsive, and more condescending saying a ""lay person"" wouldn't understand the investigation process (I have a BA in Criminal Justice and work in a law office). At one point I went 6 weeks without getting any word back from her, so I contacted the DA's office and the Texas rangers to reach out to her office for a response. It was only after they contacted her that I got a very snarky/bitter response from her saying that she's working on my case and she's unable to get the witnesses or the accused on the phone. She says she'd ""rather have a long and thorough investigation than one that's rushed and poorly put together"". It's been 3 months and she's claiming that she can't move forward because the witnesses aren't calling her back. When I communicated my frustration with the lack of communication and expressed that I feel like my case isn't being worked on, she replied ""lack of contact does not mean your case has not been followed up on"". (I should note that I sent her 3 emails asking for updates over 6 weeks. I'm not blowing up her email).

 I understand that these things take time, but shouldn't something else be happening? Lab results? A house call to talk to the home-owner where it happened? I mean what does she do on other cases when people just don't answer their phones? 

I feel like I'm stuck. This guy has wrecked my world and who knows what he's done since then. I'm afraid that he'll keep doing it. I'm worried that the witnesses will have fuzzy memories after 3+ months going by. 

What should I do? Is this normal for other types of cases?",10Jun2019,7

538,"Me, my girlfriend, and my mom just went camping this past weekend and here's some backstory:

Me and this girl were set up on a blind date by this girl's own mother and our first date was simply a movie. On said date, my mom had dropped me off and also met my girlfriend for the first time. She got a picture of us together, introduced herself, etc and after I asked her about being an exclusive couple on our second date, me and my mom set up a camping trip for the three of us, since my mom wanted to spend more time with her and she's also an EMT who's very into the great outdoors, so it seemed like the ideal situation. My girlfriend had never been camping or fishing before and I also thought it to be a good way to get her into it and try something new.

And on the camping trip itself, she didn't seem very into it. There were times when I'd be trying to set up camp or prepare fishing lines and she would just be awkwardly standing around and staring into space. She wouldn't be offering to help me or interacting with my mom or anything. And I got my hopes up about the two of us snuggling by the campfire, but she just awkwardly sat on her own little rock and just stared in the flames. I put my arm around her, but she didn't reciprocate in anyway.

And when I told my friend about what I did, he just simply stared at me and said ""You're fucking weird."" I asked him what he was talking about, but he just simply said ""No, I'm not talking to you. You're a strange man."" And not only is he pissed off at me for some reason, but my girlfriend also seemed to be a bit distant because of the trip.",10Jun2019,3
540,"The best way I can attribute this to is that straight men will never know what it’s like to live in a world with a shortage of women. They would go insane and depressed without women. Luckily they don’t know what that’s like and lack the ability to understand that kind of situation. Same deal here. Straight men don’t ever experience homophobia and lack the understanding of what it does to gay men. They don’t understand that homophobia causes gay men live in frustration, constant rejection from their closest surroundings, fear, and mental health issues. Some men may be perceived as gay, but that doesn’t count as homophobia because they’re not actually homosexual. It’s not like racism that affects an entire group and they can come to your defense. Homosexuals do t have that luxury. We fight it alone. And besides, most of the time it’s straight men who are the most common perpetrators of hate crimes against gay men, so they can’t understand.

In addition, the phone she has given me is not as good as my current phone. I happen to be a bit more attached to the phone I have now.

Am I just being silly and i should just accept it?? But then what do i do with my old phone? I don't want to just not use this new phone because im afraid it's gonna insult my friend.

So I have an interview tomorrow and I'm not sure what I should do! I'm going to give a brief summary of events, but really it all comes down to the question of... 

Do I shake hands when introducing myself to my interviewers, if I am starting to feel sick?

Normally, I tell people,""hey! I'm sick. Sorry, idk if you still want to shake hahah..."" Awkward silence ensues... Tomorrow, however, I have a job interview, and am unsure how awkward it really is to tell someone that I am getting sick instead of just going for the handshake.

I'm in the Northeastern United States, if this makes any difference in your evaluation! And it is for a job working in a public school.

548,"My partner(B) and his ex(J) dated on and off a long time, then had a weird breakup where they stayed best friends and slept together a while after the breakup. We are all a big bucket of MH issues, so I'm not trying to villianize J or anything. J has BPD, diagnosed a few years before they broke up, to give her actions context. B has been trained into co-dependency by, first his mom then a really awful first girlfriend of 8 years (not J, although she certainly took advantage of it, and he fed into her helplessness).

When we started dating, J thought they were going to get back together at some point (B had not expressed this, and they weren't physical at the time, hadn't been for most of a year, but in every other way they were basically still dating- Texting everyday, sleepovers, B coming over at the drop of a hat for J.)

B and I wanted to start really slow, not intending anything to really happen, just dating for fun. J lost her shit and it was really hard on me. B was trying to appease J to keep the peace, J was devastated that they weren't getting back together, and I got the brunt of it. Lets just say, having plans cancelled on me, not being able to go out in public (not just with him, also by myself), having to hide and pretend I wasn't there if she showed up at his house uninvited, being left for hours in the middle of a date, getting  threats of violence, spending my first christmas without friends or family near by all alone, repeated attempts to break us up, threats of suicide if I didn't leave B, the whole nine yards. Despite all of this I tried to encourage B to set boundaries and seek mental help so things could be okay AND they could keep their friendship. 

I want to make it clear that at first I was just accepting of this. No one forced me into it. It made me sad, but it made me sad for everyone involved, too. My mom and sister have bpd and I empathized, and figured I was new and there would be some acclimation, even tried to invite J along to events etc. But it didn't get better, even after the point where we got serious, even after we were exclusive and had expressed feelings for one another. It went on for a year and a half overall until I told my boyfriend I wouldn't stay in a long term relationship where I was less important than another woman and he could choose how he wanted but I'd leave if things stayed this way.

So he set some boundaries and it took almost another year but eventually things evened out and J and I even got together to talk. So now it's been four years since we started dating, and J isn't causing any more issues for at least a year, and she even thinks we are friends. I wouldn't go that far, but I'm kind to her. I always have been.

The issue is that now, I'm experiencing ptsd style triggers from it. Her presence, certain actions, can give me these emotional flashbacks. I feel like I never got reparations or acknowledgement for all the stress I went through, all the patience and kindness I offered, and all the abuse I took. No-one, not her or my boyfriend, ever tried to make it up to me. I got a woe is me apology from J at our meeting, but no one ever did anything to show thanks or appreciation to me or anything. I got hurt and disrespected for years and I guess I was okay with it because I thought there would be some reward when it all blew over, but there wasn't. And now I'm hurt and bitter and have emotional sequences any time I feel threatened, or she comes up, or I feel I'm not being appreciated or given equal treatment.

I don't want to feel this way. I feel torn between feeling justified and just wanting to leave, and feeling like an asshole because I chose to stick around and nobody forced me to. I guess I just don't know what to do at this point, now that my gamble only half paid off, and I'm left having trauma and really only myself to blame for it. I just expected my sacrifice to be valuable, it wasn't and now I'm sad and bitter. What on earth do I do (besides therapy, which is on my list and in motion)? I can talk to my partner about it, but it mostly just hurts and upsets him. He sees it as ""Her needs were bigger and more severe than yours, and you were stronger, so I did the best thing I could by giving her more.""",10Jun2019,4

552,"Throwaway account in case I accidentally give myself away here. 

My family and I moved into a new and upcoming area three years ago . I love the place, but I absolutely hate how it's being operated. They're these plazas that were built a good while back that should have stores in them by now but they're still almost entirely empty, most likely due to their owners jacking-up the rent too high. This not only means I still have have to drive 15 minutes to go anywhere beyond Walmart, but also my job doesn't have to pay me that much since there's simply no competition. 

Also, the infrastructure here is absolutely terrible. The population here has exploded, and yet there's been little progress on these roads made for the occasional car. A couple months back they started completely tearing up some of the road, and have done little with it. There's a crane in one of the left lane that's been sitting there for two months. I've been having to dodge through construction cones and torn up roads, and it's getting a real hassle to drive around. 

Speaking of roads, how road situations have been handles by the city has been entirely dissatisfying. There's a intersection down the street that was a complete mess and was only made for the occasional car, and now it has to handle constant traffic. Those turning left would have to wait for THREE different ways to be clear before they could go, resulting in a horrendous back-up. They were supposed to get a traffic light there that would have entirely fixed the problem, but instead the city said it has been on the ""back-end"" for a whole two damn years. Only recently have they even added something there, and it's not even a stop light. It's a stop sign, and just causes another portion of the intersection to be extremely back-uped. It's so bad my mom has to drive another way to get home.

555,"Hi reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago, I went through a lot of life adjustments (moving, new job, new school, etc) that ended up impacting my social circle. I havent had any real, good friends for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend has a wonderful group of friends who I've sort of started to connect with, although I can't seem to really get past that initial stage of friendship, where we say hi and chit chat but don't ever connect beyond that. Most people my age also seem to be a lot less busy than I am (I work full time and am in school full time as a 21 year old) so I can't really ""get out"" as often as I probably should to make friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a bad candidate for a friend, in fact I usually don't have trouble clicking with people right away when I do get the chance. But I feel like I've lost the ability to be someone who others want to be around enough to get invited out, or included in things, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

It's gotten so bad, that I worry I might actually be coming across as desperate. I probably care WAY too much about my lack of friends and how I come across to people, and I'm starting to think others might be picking up on this. I find myself being jealous of others over such stupid stuff like being part of group chats, getting asked to go out, even jealous of people who get texts from more than just one person a day... because I don't get any of that anymore! These things aren't things that I cared about ever before in my life, but lately I feel like some lonely kid wishing to be popular.

On the days they are there, we tell them all of our complaints. Do you know what one of them told me once, “hey if you want to save time instead of driving all the way here, just call us” 
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?????",10Jun2019,1
564,"This is a long one, so thanks for reading. 

My first relationship (15-16 years old) was extremely toxic. He was addicted to marijuana (Would constantly tell me he ""needed it to be creative"" which confused my young, innocent mind that was creative and artistic without it), never ever had any money and wouldn't try to get a job while I would constantly pay for dates (He had the means, his parents let him do whatever he wanted whenever), was ungrateful (When his household received Toys for Tots he just became angry about it to the point he wouldn't talk to me), an anarchist that believed anyone that ever did anything besides lay around, smoke pot and make art was just a fake person that sold their soul, and whenever he was angry or encountered hardship, would shut me out entirely and make me feel like it was my fault for trying to make him feel better (I got him a birthday gift that I actually put a lot of work into, and he just grunted ""thanks"" and then proceeded to ignore me all day because of some conflict at home). I stayed with him because he had a rough home life and he did ""try"" to be better for me at the beginning, so I figured it'd somehow go back, even though it kept getting worse. He also seemed ""different"" than the farmboys and I thought he was really something special. What's more, I was not very popular in school and didn't want everyone to be like ""Lol, snailm0ther couldn't make a relationship last, surprise surprise""

 It only lasted 11 months, but he kept me around and used me for another \~4 months or so before leaving me for the girl who was ""not a threat"". Right before that, he would rub it in my face that they were together since I ""couldn't be mad because he and I were no longer together"" and saying stuff like ""at least she isn't a giant c \^&amp;# like you"". He would constantly lie to everyone, especially me, and he cheated on me at least once. He cheated on his other partners after that, too; we were ""best friends"" for the years even after because I live in a small town and no one else really wanted to hang out with me and he told me.  His friends were absolutely horrible to me and constantly made sure I felt like a burden or like I was dumb, and they openly talked shit on social media about me or made horrible racist drawings towards me, called me Hitler, etc. and everyone would lie about it even though i had pictures of proof. One of the things that really stuck with me is the fact that he told everyone before our breakup that he was only with me because he was afraid I'd cut myself. It was HUMILIATING that he let people see that side of me.

When we became friends again, he said that he ""was testing me"" to make sure I wasn't a psycho anymore. I...ate it up, and tried to act perfect and like I didn't care about anything so he would keep me around. I threw myself at other men just so I could say I found someone else so he didn't think of me as pathetic or so he didn't pity me. I remember when he was on a break with his girlfriend, we hooked up and he would always, ALWAYS refuse to kiss me because ""he couldn't with the feelings"" or something.

College made me stronger. I started calling him out for his crappy behavior, and he would get cold and shut down when I did. I'd never stood up to him in four years. I remember he had (allegedly) attempted suicide and messaged me trying to get pity (This wouldn't be the first time he's lied to me about such a thing, as someone who has also attempted I wouldn't just discredit someone unless I had hard proof). This time though, I wasn't sure, so I told him I was very sorry, but suggested that the reason he is miserable is himself. He had gone to college 1000 miles away from our ""hick town"" that ""didn't understand"" and thought that it would fix everything, but he was the same miserable sod he's always been. He took it surprisingly well, but still refused my advice to get help. 

Over time, he kept reaching out to me over smaller instances of sadness and I would basically hit him with the same suggestions to improve himself, rather than feeding his negativity like I used to. I had just started getting counseling for my own problems and, eventually, was diagnosed with Bipolar II. Meaning, he couldn't use his multiple diagnoses to say ""You don't understand how it feels"" because to a degree, I do, especially if you factor in the years of emotional abuse I suffered as a child (That's a story for another day). 

Inevitably, he unfriended/cut off contact with me, after I hadn't spoken to him in a long time. This was around the time I was 19, probably. It took me a long time to notice so I can't be sure. But he's definitely still alive; I come from a very small, tight-knit community and I know I would've seen *something* if there was any indication he wasn't okay. 

18 was when I met my current partner. We have been dating for \~2 years and he is a complete 180 to my ex. Kind, older, (I'm 20 and he is 23 rn; ex was a year younger than me), considerate, truthful, grateful, positive, always ready to lend a helping hand, faithful...the whole shebang. He's not perfect (Neither of us are) but I know he's trying, and I know his heart is in a much better place than my ex.

Problem is, I'm still damaged from the relationship that was, technically 4-ish years ago now, but I guess I still dealt with his toxicity up until two years ago. I have never been able to really trust that my boyfriend isn't cheating, even though he thinks it's the most disgusting thing a person could ever do and he doesn't do much to realistically make me think he's cheating. Honestly, with how toxic I've become I don't think he *could* get away with it if he tried. I often think he's lying when he isn't, and, if he does lie about something, I shove it down his throat every time we have an argument and I have an absolute meltdown because I'm afraid he's showing himself to be just like my ex. Especially when he lies about weed; he doesn't smoke a lot (Probably has six times in our relationship), but he lied to me about it because he hates that I would refuse to talk to him while he's high and would show clear disdain towards the friends that gave him weed. I feel bad. I want him to do what he wants, and in the past half of the relationship I've learned to bite it and deal with him doing his thing, but he knows it still makes me so uncomfortable and sad so he generally doesn't like to do it as a result, though he'll never say it. I get so insecure around one specific woman that ""wasn't a threat"" but they had hooked up years before we even met; I tried to be mature and meet her in person for dinner with him and his friends, but she was...purposely making conversations I couldn't jump in on. Giving me these glares all the time, not letting me chime in at all even if I tried while she and my boyfriend got on so well. It's been 8 months. I haven't ever let that go and we *still* have fights about it because I get worked up thinking he's going to leave me for her because she's a partier unlike mild, quiet me, and that he's getting bored of me and that he wouldn't tire of a girl like her. Currently, he's working at a summer camp an hour away from where I live and I'm sick with worry that he'll meet someone better than me there because I worked there last summer and hated it and hated Scouting so much as a result, things he's passionate about.  Mostly, I'm afraid he's going to leave because I do things that are downright toxic because I can't let go of the past. Honestly, I never intended for us to become serious because I hated myself so much I thought he would never want me for anything than a hookup. I never thought I COULD function in a relationship, but here I am, slowly fixing myself and getting better but it still doesn't feel fast enough.

On that same vein, lately I get more and more wound up about the things he did to me. The lies he told I couldn't see until years down the line. I fantasize about messaging him and telling him how horrible he is. I want to show him how successful and happy I am even though he said my personality would never be accepted by normal people. It's not that I want him back, at all. It's that he humiliated me for years, made me look like a stupid joke to a significant chunk of my small community. I was one of the ""gifted kids"". It's embarrassing to be run through the mud by someone who was known as a druggie and supposedly had ""no future"". I deserved so much more than that. HE KNEW I was vulnerable and used me, and yet, I never got a chance to truly stand up for myself. It kills me because he only ever knew me as a fragile, spineless shell and I hate that that's probably the last thing he ever knew me as. Worst of all, he'll never see where I am now. Happy, and more confident in myself than ever. 

And yet, clearly as I described above I'm extremely insecure. He honestly should have left me over it, and I know most people think I just don't deserve a relationship/am not ready for one. But somehow the weeks turned into months turned into years and it almost feels like a waste to abandon it at this point. We're both happy and growing in our own ways every day. We don't fight a lot, and I don't breathe down his neck asking for screenshots or turning up wherever he is to try to catch him doing something. I just...don't want to be worried about this stupid bullcrap from years ago anymore *at all* because he doesn't deserve that disrespect. I don't want him to notice my discomfort through texts and calls that I try so hard to bury because he's trying his best and when I still get sad, he feels like it isn't enough.  

But it's so hard, once someone hurts you like that for so long and you trusted them with everything. 

What are some ways to constructively ""get the fuck over it""?

tl;dr: I was in a toxic, lie filled relationship in high school and its effects still carry into my new healthy college relationship and causes intrusive thoughts",10Jun2019,1
565,"Hello,

As the title says I have been wanting to join the Air Force or the Navy as an intel officer. I have a bachelor's degree in linguistics with a focus in anthropology, and I studied Arabic for a a year. I want to be able to join fairly quickly (say within a few months or so) and was wondering if anyone had experience with that? It seems like as far as the process goes the Navy may be a faster option but also looking for pros and cons so I can make an informed decision. 

The recruiters I have visited (only for Air Force so far) have given me mixed information and were pushing for enlisted while admitting that Intel is a field with a lot of need, so I've been a little confused.

* Man you sound batshit crazy
* Oh you parent committed suicide... please give me the juicy details
* Wow you sound like a horrible piece of shit.


The helper flair if anything at this point is a marker of how long you've been part of the community and can easily be abused by inside circles. 

And I know it used to be stickied but no longer is... Please stop attacking people asking for advice. You have to recognize these people might be emotionally compromised or not of their right mind or in a state of perception that makes them believe things that might not be true. People might have...

* Wild assumptions that make no sense to you.
* They might be needlessly aggressive toward you.
* They might have beliefs that frustrate you to no end.
* They might be so fringe that you don't actually believe their post to be serious or real.

I’m a 14 y/o female who has always believed that she was straight. My mom has always try to talk to me about my sexuality and imply that I’m lesbian when I feel that I’m not. She had been doing this since I was about 12. After years of having to deal with her questioning and implying I’m starting to question my sexuality. I know for a fact that I am attracted to males but females I don’t know. All this is confusing me and making me feel more  insecure about self as I am trying to coming back from having depression and severe anxiety (still have have really bad anxiety and I feel I have recovered for my depression but again my mom thinks otherwise).  It’s not that my mom is a bad mom because she’s not, she is the best but she questions me about my sexuality. I haven’t done anything to make her question anything. My dad hears it too and agrees with me, and she also denies that the I view  is the not way she meant it. I’m not homophobic in any way, it’s not like if I were to be bisexual (because I know I like males) it wouldn’t be okay for me. It just that feel I am straight her constant implying and questioning is starting to confuse and make me question myself. And to be honest I don’t know why she would be doing this besides me not being as girly (I am still pretty girly expect I wear oversized clothes and she sees that as boyish) but I feel like I’m still pretty girly. It hurts even more to have all this coming from my mom and especially because I’m picked on by my “friends”. They said the reason is that because I’m not everything that they are.  I have decided now that school is over for summer that I’m high school I will be getting new friends and forgetting them because they were also a big part of my depression. They don’t pick on me in the beginning of our friendship I was probably the time I started to have a boyfriend, I don’t know if they were jealous or because I wasn’t with them constantly.  And when I stood up for myself then they would say they did what they did because of me.

572,"My friend and I are roommates, so we see each other a lot during the week but we don't really hang out considering we're both working during the day, and then at nights we have schoolwork to do.

I've asked her if she wants to hang out a few times, but like I said she's busy. We have a few mutual friends who also want to hang out on weekends, but since she's always with her boyfriend they usually just delay plans until she's free. Sometimes I'll hang out with them without her, but we all miss having her around and I miss hanging out with her individually as well. I told her I'd like it if we could go out sometime on the weekend, and she said she doesn't feel a need to spend time with me (or our other friends) on weekends because ""we see each other all the time during the week."" How do I explain to her that being around someone is not the same as actually spending time together? I understand where she's coming from- she rarely sees her boyfriend during the week- but it would be nice to actually do things together sometimes. Since she doesn't seem to think it's necessary, or even see a difference between randomly seeing each other throughout the week and spending time together doing an enjoyable activity, should I even bother?

575,"So, here's the base story.. a couple of years ago I left an abusive relationship/environment, that even after he left me for his ex, was still gaslighting me.  I have PCOs, depression and anxiety (associated to trauma) and have been sober off of illicit drugs for two years. 
 I'm in a new city, new friends and an old friend still in my life, and still have family in my life. I'm seeking therapy and trying to get back to loving myself. It's been tough but I'm trying and sometimes succeeding. 

But the thing is though, recently there was a potentially great relationship (great guy, has a job, place of his own, head on his shoulders, etc) almost in my hands. However, because of my fear of going back to the old, I tend to distance myself from the conversation.

580,"First time poster on this sub, sorry for formatting as I’m on mobile. Normally a lurker. I’m sorry if this is too long.   

My roommate (22/male/black) and I (23/male/white) have been friends for years. He’s a musician and rapper and I’m an artist and aspiring rapper and last year we moved in together as roommates with the goal of building a group of like minded artists to perform and collaborate together. This is important.
  
Fast forward to now. My roommate and I have had some tension for a while due to some lacking on my part. As a roommate I could be better. I’m not always the tidiest and I’ve been dealing with some pretty bad depression. It’s caused me to begin really not enjoying art and become a reclusive and lazy. This is also important.
  
Today our rent was paid and my account was overdrawn. The way we pay our rent, is he gives me cash for his half since he doesn’t really use cards, and I pay for the rent through my checking account. Problem is the past month or two, he has been going through some rough racist stuff at work and quit his job and got a job closer to where we live, only to start going through the same shit. So he quit again but they rehires him after meeting and talking with him. Don’t really know the details. So I have been fronting our bills in the meantime because I could kind of afford to. But so today, I asked him if he has any money to contribute towards rent because now I’m in the negative (make okay money but still live paycheck to paycheck) and he said no. Then the conversation went full on sideways and this is where I need help from strangers because I have no one I know who can help me with this.  
  
Me:me. 
R: roommate   

Me: (I had just asked what he could pay if anything, he said he has $4) fuck, well nothing we can do about it.
R: You should try to start pushing yourself to do more art because you can easily be making money and if I had your laptop I’d be making shit all days and selling 
  
The fact My girlfriend made $80 in 4 weeks from some basic ass paintings shows me that you can making hundreds of dollars a day making graphic designs but that’s on you because you have the equipment. 

But in my opinion you have well over enough recourses to be making money every day compared to me.And I have to travel by foot or bus just to get somewhere and that takes up so much time compared to driving. 

Me: Wait hold up, let’s address this quick.

Why am I being the one lectured about money? You just got a new job? You said yourself you were goin to be making good money at this job and getting paid weekly. Have you not had that many shifts? I am saying this in a genuinely curious tone, not anger or frustration. I’m just confused. I don’t fully know your work situation and what you went through.  

I know you have been going through it hard with the various jobs due to racism. And I will never try to belittle that experience and how hard that can be. I’ll never understand it or fully experience that so I won’t try to make excuses. And I know you already didn’t make much money at the depot and you had to go through a rough transition to get out and get the new job. I get that. But at the end of the day you still have a responsibility. We signed this lease together. 

Because man, You owe me 2 months of rent bills. If it weren’t for our how close we are and our friendship and the fact that if I weren’t fronting the ENTIRE rent bill because I care about us living together, we would be possibly getting evicted. I HATE trying to use money over people because it’s petty. It’s why I have put it off for 2 months. You can’t pin this all on me. 

Yes. I make a good amount of money with my one job. Yes, this job currently is fucked because I don’t do anything. But I’m trying to get out of this department and get back to real work. 
 If this job wasn’t easy, I would still be working 40 hours a week dude. I was working the exact same schedule when I was in sales and that was EXHAUSTING because it’s talking to a new person every 2 minutes man. So the second I switch to ANY other department, that changes entirely. I still only get 2 days off and I work 8.5 hours every day. On an hourly basis, I work a lot more than you do. I shouldn’t need a second job. If you think about it, I budgeted myself so well, I was able to front ALL of our bills for 2 months dude. And I didn’t have any money in a savings account! That’s rent, electricity, Internet, and gas! That’s pretty good! So In all honesty, I shouldn’t NEED second job or a side hustle.  
  
R: We’re going to have to talk when you get home because you don’t work harder than me in any facet and that shit really offends me and pisses me off
  
Hours don’t equal effort in any way and you shouldn’t even be thinking about rap because you’re white and this isn’t your art or your culture so if you think I’m going to allow you be a rapper you are mistaken heavily so when you get home we’re going to talk about all of this


Me: I did not say i work harder. I apologize if that’s what it sounded like I said. 

It was a bad comparison I admit. I was using hours to show that i work a lot and if it wasn’t for this current position, that doesn’t give me any work, I would be working my ass off like I was previously. You never saw me in sales. I worked my ass off day in and day out. 

But I never said I worked harder than you and I apologize if that’s what it came across like I was saying . I acknowledge how hard you work compared to most every human. 
As for the rap, that’s really hurtful. I thought we were in this as brothers and creatives but if you don’t see me as equal or qualified due to my skin color, I don’t know what to say. I’m just kinda shocked. My whiteness has never been an issue before and I didn’t think that had anything to do with it. All I was saying was I currently enjoy rap over drawing, and now you say that? That makes it sound like the only reason I’m in this group at all is because I draw.  
  
R: You’re at work more than I, you don’t put forth any efforts outside of your job to do anything other than to take care of yourself and you don’t even do that
  
You feed yourself, get yourself high and entertain yourself and pass out

Fuck what youre on right now, you’ve crossed the line so many times in so many ways and the worst I’ve ever done was not have money because I won’t be TREATED LIKE A NIGGER
  
You’re fucking filthy, you’re selfish, you don’t respect SHARED SPACES, you make excuses, you complain about shit and do nothing, you waste away, you beat yourself up and I will NEVER work with someone with those standards
  
I’m a Fucking KING and I treat myself like one because I put the fucking work in, you put in some and waste the rest of your time being a lazy white kid and there’s nothing you can say to dispute that because I can hear you in the living room every day after 7:40
  
You talk about hurt when I have to live with someone who really thinks they can do whatever the fuck they want because they have a job and buy toilet paper
  
You’ve done NOTHING to earn a spot as a rapper
  
I ALLOW YOU TO.
  
I could be doing so much shit to you to make you feel like a black person, I can oppress you every single day, I can threaten you, I can HURT YOU
  
BUT I DON’T BECAUSE I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT PAIN IS
  
I AM OPPRESSED 
  
I AM HATED
  
AND I MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE AROUND ME FEEL EMPOWERED BECAUSE I HAVE NONE IN THIS WORLD AS A 20 YEAR OLD BLACK MALE.

But everything else came so far out of left field, I just don’t know what to do or say or think. I know I’m lazy a lot but I at least thought I was a good ally towards folks of any minority. So I’m just hurt and lost.

581,"Ok, let me explain... I'm not just wanting to skip class. I got a chance to go to the Cannes Film Festival next week, with work.  It's a nice holiday, but a nice professional opportunity too, since all the key players of my future ""business-environment"" will be there. Chance to get to know the business better, hopefully get some connections too. 

I told my boss I'd go, but I have only one class overlapping with the trip. Now, if I don't attend that class, I will be in trouble, since I can only miss one of those and it will be my third missed class (i've been ill two times). Resulting in either losing my chance of reparation or me needing to plan a meeting with the study-advisor before re-entering the course. 

You got any ideas of how to get away with the missed class? Thanks so much in advance! :-)",10Jun2019,2

584,"    Long story short an old friend of mine and I rekindled our friendship this past February. We used to be so close until we had a falling out 8 years ago.
    Twice a year she travels to Puerto Rico for a Spayathon as a volunteer and she brought me back two puppies. She told me I just had to pay for the flight fee. When my husband and I met her she told us it was $200 per puppy which was completely fine with us. She told us they they had the 2 puppies in one carrier as a carry on.
    I went over her house for Memorial Day and was talking with her and her husband about traveling to Puerto Rico with them as a volunteer and would also consider bringing back more dogs to the States for people to adopt. Her husband said to me, “You should do it you will make a lot of money”, with a huge grin on his face. My friend immediately yelled at him that I wouldn’t make money and he looked very confused. 
     The past couple of weeks I pushed it off because I didn’t want to even consider thinking they would rip me off, lie and steal from me. They do have a lot of money issues, but I always saw them as good people and they wouldn’t take advantage of others. I went on American Airlines website to see how much it really is to carry on dogs. Per their website it says it is $125 per Kennel as a carry on. So essentially I paid $275 more then I should. 
  I feel very conflicted and I’m not very good with confrontation. I don’t know how to approach her on the topic with out sounding like I am accusing her of something. I am very afraid that I would lose her friendship again if she actually did nothing wrong and I am overthinking it.

I work in the medical field.  Typically I see people in emergent situations, so this is the first time they meet me and the last all in the same visit. I live in the Deep South and “in these parts” I still see and hear things said about trans people/gay people that are just flat out rude and dumb.  I do my best to correct people with what I know but.... let’s be dead honest here.... I don’t know a lot.    I don’t have any people in my life who can offer personal help with this either.   

The training I received meant well but I think it might be lacking.   If this is you, someone you love, or someone you know how would you want this situation to be handled to not only be compassionate but also professional? If you are a trans man who still has ovaries then those ovaries can still be little jerks and wreck your day.  If you are a trans woman who still has testicles then that can be an issue that occasionally (testicular torsion) requires emergency surgery.   If you are a female that doesn’t engage in penetrative sex how do we make the experience of getting you a transvaginal ultrasound the least worst situation possible?  I do ask what your pronouns are, any related surgeries or hormone treatments. How do I explain that some tests, while uncomfortable might be the difference between appropriate treatment and missing something big without seeming like I am trying to force the issue?  

Any other situations that I wouldn’t think of being in because I will never be in them personally, tell me where you have been and what would have helped.

592,"Hi all,

TLDR; My coworker, who isn't my boss, treats me horribly, by belittling me in front of all my coworkers, and I am beginning to think it's because I am a young female. I've been working here much longer than him, and don't want to quit my job.

So the longer story of it all is, I have one coworker who treats me with no respect, and constantly lectures and belittles me in front of others.  I don't know if it matters, but he's a mid-30ish Indian man.

I'm not allowed to contact him directly, his rules, but we work in IT. He has a higher position than me, but he isn't my boss. He is always preaching communication and kindness, but he tends to belittle me in front of everyone. He also copies my boss, his friends, and our vice president whenever he writes a nasty email about me. He forwards my personal emails to him to those same people as well, and copies me with a sarcastic and rude response.

Sometimes I hear him lash out and throw things when people don't understand what he's saying. This happened once during a meeting where someone said ""purchasing and factory aren't the same thing"" and he said ""I'm done here"" and threw a marker as hard as he could on the ground.

I've begun writing it down on a spreadsheet so I can keep track of his behavior

Here's an example:

*I emailed all US locations that Sysaid was down, because I was unsure if tickets would go through, and I couldn't respond to users or read any tickets. I got yelled at about how I should ""ask someone before sending random emails"" (I asked our mutual coworker and he said it was fine...) then I heard him say ""Jesus Christ, bullshit"" under his breath about me...*

Anytime I send this guy an email, he writes 5 paragraphs long about how unprofessional I am, and how it's a waste of time to keep me informed. He never says this to anyone but me. When our helpdesk employees from all the other countries came, he didn't invite me, despite me being the only US helpdesk. He left me out.  When the meeting was over, it turned out it was a project for me, and I had to hear all the directions secondhand.

He's sent emails saying ""this will affect your job performance"" or ""there's not enough time to keep coaching you on what to do"" (I asked him if he'd update me when a server is back online...)

He always asks the other people to go out to lunch/get coffee with him, says good morning/goodnight to them, but he ignores my existence. I used to get along with him really well, but now he doesn't acknowledge me at all.

I partially think it's because I went to HR about his plans for redoing our entire dept. I am bipolar/borderline with anxiety. I get really nervous whenever I'm too close to people, and when he starts shouting, and I have anxiety attacks. Sometimes he sits on conference calls (on speaker phone) maxed out, so it can be hard to focus on my work. I asked HR if I could have a spot in IT where it's quieter, in case I get overwhelmed by all the noise. I wrote him 2 emails about how I felt about the situation, and that I felt like it would affect my job if we were all to sit at one table, which is what he originally wanted. He never talked to me about it, and recently, he's been getting worse. 

I asked him if I could rename his computer for him, as part of his project, and he told me he'd do it himself. I told him USXX-X-XXXX. He agreed to do it, and said he was doing it then. I walked out the door to get lunch. A few days later I asked a group email (to like 6 people) to restart their computers so that they would show up in the AD. He then said ""I reboot this every day. What do you want to name it?"" I said ""Oh, you said you were going to do it for me. USXX-X-XXXX, thanks!"" He then sent out this email directly after. \*please note this is the format he sent it\*:

*Dear All,*

*Thank to those who follow the Email Etiquettes. Still re-iterate the Importance of a effective communication to ensure we succeed as a IT.*

*Your Communication is one of the factors for Performance review on a Annual basis.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*Please ensure you follow a professional lifestyle while at companynamehere.  Here are some of the hints for a effective E-mail etiquettes.*

&amp;#x200B;

*	Use Greetings – with Hi, Hello etc.,* 

*o	Use professional salutations – ( Avoid hey , yo , folks  etc.,)*

*	Keep a tab on your Tone*

*o	Be Polite* 

*	Include clear subject line*

*	Proofread*

*	If you receive Rude/Angry reply – step away from the computer few minutes , think it through before firing out a fiery email.*

*	Finally , Use Professional Fonts like Time new roman, Calibri etc.,*

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I don't want to quit my job because this is family to me, I've felt comfortable for many years. People see him as the golden child, while I am the relaxed one who just helps out. I don't know if HR would take me seriously, and I fear I would get lashback from him even further.

593,"I'm 16 years old, and as the title suggests, 2 weeks away from graduation. I live in the Middle East with a financially struggling father, who wants me to study in Europe, preferably Germany or Romania and the likes. However, I've already given a lot of thought regarding this, and I still have no idea of what to do, and also starting to panic a little. Ever since I was a sophomore, I've had lofty ambitions wanted to study in the USA or Canada, but as of recent events, it'd be very difficult if not impossible for that to happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I've been really thinking about studying in Baguio City, Philippines. I've got a friend who lives there and suggested me to study in SLU, and having done research about the city and SLU, I thought that I would like it there. I've been mentally preparing myself for living in the Philippines - expecting the culture shock, language barriers, etc. And I've managed to build up much excitement towards it. But then comes the bombshell. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad doesn't want me to go to the Philippines, his reason being that I'd never be able to live there, apparently. He's been telling me that I should really consider studying in Germany, because according to him, having a German background and passport would be a major and significant stepping stone in my life. He's even told me that he won't support me or help pay my college tuition if I do decide to go to SLU. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what to do, and I feel like I'm running out of time. Thinking about this more and more, it's been depressing me a lot lately, and my motivation is slowly slipping away. I wouldn't mind taking a year off - I could sharpen or learn a skill during that time, like learn a language or another musical instrument  - but my dad will be severely disappointed in me if I do so. I really do want to study in the Philippines, but the barriers I'm facing are really starting to get to me. And if I don't decide and act soon, I'll have no choice but to take a year off. My life is currently a jumbled up mess right now and I don't know how to straighten it out. What do I do?",10Jun2019,0
594,"school has always been terrible for me, ever since i started i've had issues with my teachers, my classmates and my school work. i've never been a badly behaved student or anything, if anything i'm pretty quiet. i often find myself in trouble with teachers or drama with classmates which due to the social hierarchy of school, it effects me pretty badly.  horrible, nasty girls make my life pretty miserable, and it doesn't help that the most popular (and most evil) girl's mum is best friends with my mum and we also live right next to each other. i'm basically forced to see her every day and she never fails to hurt me in some way. she used to physically bully me, now it's more psychological, recently she's managed to turn all my classmates against me   and so far i've had countless abuse messages, one of which called me ""disgusting"".  all of this on top of dealing with diagnosed mental illness has really taken it's toll on me. 

last night i broke down to my mother about what was happening in school and how i felt, and we both came to the conclusion that it would be best for me to leave. i suffer with anxiety (often can't leave the house, can't order food, can't buy things for myself) so the idea of going to a new school kills me. and to be honest i don't really want to go back into education. i don't want to go to college or university because i don't even know what i want to do in life. i don't have many qualifications because over the past year i've been skipping and missing school as i absolutely despise being there, which obviously means i miss classes. at the start of the school year i began with studying and preparing for exams in 5 subjects, and when it came to the final exams i only ended up taking 2 of the exams. and judging by how i felt coming out of those exams, i probably wont even get the qualification (i wont have passed them basically). i'm a smart girl, consistently i've gotten A's without even studying much, but this past year has completely fucked me up. i know i have lots of potential. i just don't know where to go from here. i have no desire to do anything in particular, i just feel so lost. i don't even have a job or anything,  any advice?",10Jun2019,1

This choice was really hard to make because i was worried that i wasn't capable to deal with other works ( i left a stable work for this, it's big company, very nice and organized). I thought it was one time occasion in life so i decided to accept and since i'm 21 yo i thought that i could do that since i'm still young.

Now the work is going pretty well, sometimes i make mistakes but i'm learning and growing in work field, the problem is that i don't fell myself enought for the work, even if i did things alone multiple times i'm always worried to be not enought and i'm afraid to be left home.

Every day i repeat to myself to be chill because i know how to deal at work and it works most of the time but there are somedays where i just can't.

I think it's because i just started to work in this new company and i have to get confidence with the work.

601,"Hello

I’m not asking for anything by this post other than for someone to listen. I know what I did was fucked up...but I’m working through the shame and such. 

When I was younger (12-13), I remember having sexual feelings towards the male members of my family (I’m gay). This was like a three month phase of my life, and I haven’t had any since. I don’t know why that phase existed, maybe it was hormones, maybe it was my OCD, but I know that I didn’t at the time actually want to have sex with family members. But I think I convinced myself I did. And one night I touched my dad while he was sleeping. And I regretted it immensely, because I realized that that’s not what I ever wanted to do, I just thought I needed to act on the thoughts. I was very impressionable and gullible as a kid, I’d seen people do it in porn, I thought it was a thing.

I’ve revealed this secret before, and received support and empathy (which was fantastic). But I feel like a piece of me refuses to accept the empathy. I’ve convinced myself that what I’ve done was unforgivable, and that no amount of understanding (from both the people involved and strangers) will rid me of the shame. I’m also talking to a therapist about this, but does anyone have any advice on how to process deep shame?",10Jun2019,1

606,"I found out about my friend’s passing early on this year and it really deeply shook me. I called my friend’s mom- a number I got off the internet the evening I found out and told her how much her son- let’s call him Frank- meant to me. I have since become good friends with his mom, but I digress.

I had come home from attending a 4 year university to community college for some health issues. So I was starting anew. My friend’s mom on the phone had mentioned some of her son’s friends who were attending the same CC as me. 

Then in one of my classes sometime later, I had overheard someone call a familiar distinct name- let’s call him Lionel.

Frank’s mom had mentioned that Lionel went to the same college- so I called his name and asked him if he had been friend’s with Frank, to which he replied he had.

I informed him I just found out (he had passed 6 months before) and I ask for his phone number. We got coffee and discussed our relationships with Frank and it felt nice having someone to share my grief with.

Moving along...we started hanging out more before and after class and texting about assignments and things and began to become good friends. There was a point when I asked myself if I liked him as more than a friend and the answer was no.

However, as of recently, something about the nature of our relationship changed. I started to develop a crush on him and I cannot point when that started to develop. He also deeply reminds me of Frank in a lot of ways. 

I know I really like Lionel for his personal attributes but I worry that perhaps my residual feelings for Frank have rubbed off onto Lionel. I honestly don’t think this is case but I have my guard up just in case.

In general, though, I also don’t want to disrespect Frank’s memory by becoming involved with Lionel. I know that we both have crushes on each other but we are both pussies and don’t want to jeopardize our friendship or make the relationship weird.

I also really look up to Lionel. He is so well-spoken and knowledgeable and sometimes I feel inferior.

It is also a concern of mine that he is extremely religious and I am pretty agnostic or what some would call “spiritual.”

Do you guys think this has potential to work out? Am I disrespecting Frank’s memory? Does anyone have experience with an interfaith or secular/religious relationship?

611,"A relative (relative 1) told me that another relative (relative 2) can’t take care of their cat until they get married in August. R1 asked me if I wouldn’t mind taking care of the cat until R2 got married in August, I said sure as it was only 3 months and as long as they provided me with almost all tools for the job, which they agreed to do. Fast forward a couple of weeks later and I get a message from the owner of the cat saying that R1 misunderstood what the deal was, the deal was that I would adopt the cat indefinitely. I didn’t mind at first but then I got to live with the cat and had a long think about it, the cat needs a lot of attention and playtime, 2 things I cannot always provide especially with me being a university student. I enjoy having a cat, especially in certain moments where I do have some free time. If I do decide to keep it, I would need to buy him one of those tower things so he can jump and scratch, as well as having to clean the house regularly due to him shedding so much hair. Should I make this commitment and keep the cat and be happy, or should I put him for up for adoption and be bored because I won’t have anything to do? I really need some advice. Please and thank you 😊",10Jun2019,1

613,"Hello users of this subbreddit. :) I’ve gotten myself into a bit of a pickle and could use some assistance: 

So I, Pam(19f) have been friends with my one friend Jim(19m) for 6 years now and have liked him on and off throughout. We have never dated, but in the past year, he and i have become very close both physically and as friends. We would probably be dating at this point, if not for his girlfriend, Karen(17f), that he has been dating for a year and a half.

Karen and Jim have a knowingly open relationship, hence why Jim and I have physically gotten close and Karen is stop aware of it. We haven’t had sex, but we’ve been doing pretty much everything else for several months now and he definitely wants to, but i just feel like that would be overstepping too much.

Additionally, I was struggling socially in college, so I would often find myself going to his place multiple times a week (he would drive to get me 20 mins there and 20 mins back) and turning into a bit of a stoner lol. We were practically living together by Spring and were very comfortable with each other. That’s kind of when I started uncovering my suppressed feelings for Jim. 

Sadly, Jim was sick and we later realized it was cancer. Since then, I visited many times a week, made sure he was eating at least some kind of food and having the medicine that would help ease his pain for a bit. I am always worried about him and hoping he isn’t passed out on the floor alone. I feel like I’ve done more for him then his gf to help him through this, but that’s not fair to say since she is still in high school, her parents are strict about her visiting his place and also general assholes, and he refuses to tell her he even has cancer!

Additionally, he wants to join the military, so he’s gonna leave sometime in the next year for training so I have to cope with the person I’ve been closest with for the past year just dipping for a while. And the plan is when he leaves, Karen is going with him.

He’s asked me recently to not tell him about anyone i talk to because it makes him jealous, which he immediately regretted saying and took it back and has started saying things like “I just don’t wanna leave you when i go” and we frequently say “i love you” to each other. Even if he and Karen stop being open, I know we would still hang all the time, because that’s what we mostly do anyway.

Oh also he and Karen kind of want to have a threesome with me but that sounds like the most awkward thing on the planet rn.

So it boils down to:

*I love Jim.
Jim loves Karen and she loves him.
Jim might(?) have feelings for me.
Jim has cancer.
I am there for Jim and he is there for me.
Jim is leaving soon and Karen is going with him...but I’m not.*

And most importantly:

*Jim is one of my best friends in the whole world and I don’t want to do anything that would result in me losing him.*

So, that’s the situation and I’m at a loss as to what I do now. My feelings wont go away, but I don’t want to lose my best friend. Please tell me what I’m supposed to do now?",10Jun2019,0
614,"I'm a lawyer and my boss continuously screws things up that every lawyer should know or do. He's old, stubborn, and extremely resistant to criticism, even if presented in the most professional way. His failure to listen to anyone, young or old, has directly lead to many losses in recent cases. He's been blasted by judges recently over these mistakes, and every time he just blames the judge as getting it wrong.

Some people here just don't care anymore and will just agree with him because they know he will just shoot down their advice anyways. It makes it very hard for me when I speak out on routine and large mistakes that he makes. He also micromanages everything. I'm starting to reach that point of not caring anymore either. I really feel as if I have done everything I can to bring his mistakes to his attention. In one instance, a judge coincidentally quoted word for word something I had previously said should have been done. 

For many reasons, we cannot go above his head to his boss and bring these mistakes to light. Yet, I feel trapped being associated with such poor work product and poor advocacy.  For many reasons, I need to stay with my employer but just want to go to a different division. So, I've applied and interviewed for another division. I think I have a pretty good chance of getting into that division. If I don't get it, what should I do in terms of handling this frustrating situation on a day to day basis?",10Jun2019,1

617,"Hello,

My name is Josef (15M). I have had a really hard time this year and I’m not sure how to deal with my problems.

Some information before I begin: I am a recently diagnosed high functioning autistic meaning I don’t have severe issues like some do but I have a really hard time connecting and maintaining conversations with people, I also have pretty severe PTSD and Anxiety from something I’ll talk about in a little bit, lastly (and this truly isn’t a brag and I’m only saying this because it’s what I think could be the stem of some of my problems) I am very intelligent (178 IQ and near perfect SAT scores, some of this is the autism)

I went into my freshman year of high school in August as a relatively happy person. I had always had trouble socially but that didn’t get to me because I simply never felt lonely because I could make myself busy with other activities in middle school.

I decided to join my school FTC robotics team at the beginning of the year, and I found a group that I finally could fit in. I loved it so much that I spent almost 45 hours a week at our coaches (a parent of a student on the team)  house working on robots. I made tons of close friends that made me happy. Just as the year started to pick up with robotics, I found out that the coach of the team was part of a money laundering scheme so I reported it to the school. Just afterwards, the coach kicked me off the team and told all of my close friends to never speak to me again. That left me with no friends and nothing to keep me busy. For a while, the coach sent threats that if I shut his program down, he would hurt me. This has given me a lot of anxiety and PTSD because I feel like I’m never safe.

Meanwhile, I had a very close girlfriend that I had dated throughout my freshman year. We shared a lot with each other and I ended up being really happy with her. The day after I had just lost everything but her, she broke up with me saying that she wasn’t attracted to me anymore. I found that next day that she had been cheating on me for four months and having almost weekly sex with her best friend. She then made up a lie and told everyone at my school that I had tried to rape her. That immediately made everyone else, especially girls, avoid me. She’s the most popular girl in my grade so there’s no one to say that she’s lying. I’ve had to eat lunch alone for the past 4 months because people walk away if I try to talk to them. It doesn’t help that I’m a lot smarter and more mature than other people in my grade because people are intimidated by me. I’ve started to get bullied a lot as well by everyone. I get almost daily hate mail over Instagram or texts.

My home life isn’t great either. My mom hates me because she doesn’t want to acknowledge my mental handicaps. My dads an alcoholic, not abusive, just perpetually drunk. There’s constant fighting in our house so I work with wood and power tools to drown out the noise.

All this combined has given me a lot of loneliness and depression. I just want a friend or girlfriend to talk to, but it seems like everything is working against me. I’ve had multiple suicide attempts and the school has done nothing to help, and my mom or the school refuses to take me to a therapist. I’m just out of options.

I understand that many more people have worse problems than me, but I have no one else to ask for help. Thank you.",10Jun2019,0

620,"So we have these neighbour's... I wish neighbour's from hell could describe them but I think it's a bit tame. 

So basically we stay in a block of flats not many about 6 different ones in the building we also have a shared back garden. 
So they're on benefits and dont work meaning they're there 99% of the time unless they're on holiday (which somehow they're on 6 times a year). 

We've had issues with these guys before wedging the back door open and putting a gate up (to block access to the back garden for other neighbours as well as being a fire hazard) so they can let their dogs run free from their flat to the back garden. Our landlord noticed this when he was doing work on our flat and spent weeks trying to get in contact with their landlord to have it removed. Eventually it was deemed unsafe and they removed for a whole two weeks before cutting it in half and fitting it on to the door. 

Now I would just like to let you guys know what these people are like.

They traumise our cats despite saying they are ""animal lovers"". Now even the sound of their voices are enough to make our cats run and hide. 

They dont clean up the dog shit in the back garden so we no longer use the garden. The one time we did leave washing out, it was dragged down and shit on by their dogs. Which they just laughed about. 

They've now torn down our washing line for some reason.
 
Despite being on benefits for back injury he can somehow build a deck in the garden and stay up past 10pm in the garden (right outside our bedroom window) hammering and sawing wood. 

They also let their dogs run free in the close and jump on people. Which they also find funny. Our other neighbours have a newborn and they have no consideration for that. 

I could go on and on about them but theres too much to say. 
I really hope no one else has had neighbour's like this in the past. If you have what did you do? Or do you have any advice that could help us out? Because I am just so fed up.",10Jun2019,1

How do I cope with a guy rejecting my sexual advances? I feel like shit and wanna die.

To actually throw myself at a guy and still not get anything makes me feel like I'm a failure as a woman. Ladies, how often are you sexually rejected? What are the circumstances and how does it make you feel? Guys, have you sexually rejected women? How did you perceive them? Do you think I should hate myself?

622,"So I am a freelance photographer and have scheduled my first couple of weddings this summer. I am excited for them, but the first one is looking kind of strange.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks ago, a man contacted me through my website asking if I could do a wedding and I agreed. I told him the total cost for my services would be $330. (I'm new to wedding so I do charge considerable less than most). He agreed to this and told me he would pay a $300 deposit despite my only asking for $50. Okay, sure, whatever you want. 

Flash forward to this morning, I get an email for him saying he sent the deposit. Direct quote: "". . .my boss had finally sent the payment to you today as promised (he sent the payment as his contribution for the wedding) and he included the money for the dj."" . . . ? He also notified me that the wedding was ""pushed back"" to June 28 despite his telling me earlier that the date was June 29. He could have meant July but still hasn't clarified the date. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I asked him to call me but he said he is busy at work and asked what I was confused about. I confirmed with him that he wants me to pay the DJ out of the check he gives me. I just sent him another email saying that that is a little unconventional and I'm not sure how it would work.

625,"My girlfriend [23] lives in a single parent home with her mom and two younger brothers [22 and 19].

The problem is that her siblings don't help with any of the household chores and leave them ALL up to her. The only thing they will do is wash their clothes while gf has to do everything else except cook (mom takes care of that). They will not help to wash dishes or even take out the trash. They won't help with any cleaning. Won't help with groceries or bills either. On top of it, if they are asked nicely to help they will simply ignore and not do it. If they are asked roughly, they will throw tantrums.

I know her mom has to provide for them and cook so I think it's fair to exclude her from some of the chores. But at the same time, she lets the younger brothers take advantage of gf. She will not enforce that they have to help her out. 

On top of it they are all very critical of gf, rude and inconsiderate in general. She is very frustrated and at her wits end having to look after everyone's needs while they just live freely. Gf works as an economist which means she has her own work to do too. 

The difficulty is that she cannot get the leader of the household (mom) to help make the division of chores fair, nor can she herself enforce to her brothers that they need to help. Additionally, as her bf, I'm not sure if it's my place to make a suggestion to her family about the way they live. They respect me and love me but I don't wanna overstep. 

I'm looking for a way to let them know that they have to be a little more considerate of her, or she will burn out. Thank you guys!",10Jun2019,1

633,"I'm shaken to even be writing this, but it's been on my mind every day for months now.  This is really long so I BOLDED important parts

&amp;#x200B;

 Here's the background:

**I'm studying abroad in a different country in Asia**. I arrived in January, and at orientation I immediately clicked with a boy in my group. Important: **He's from this country; I'm going home at the end of this month.  It was like we were instantly friends; we spent all day together and didn't run out of things to talk about.** That night, after a party, I ended up alone in his room until 3am. I assumed something would happen, because that's what happens when you go back to his room, usually. But it didn't. **We flirted a little, but no kiss,** and I eventually went to bed. **The next night, we ended up hanging out again for a few hours. Still nothing. Throughout the week, we spent almost every possible minute together, and I caught feelings very quickly. But when we never kissed, even when we were alone at night for many hours**, I figured he wasn't interested and tried to let it go. Yet every time we hung out, he made me feel attractive, funny, and smart. I loved how I felt with him. I remember a day we went to breakfast, and later I was supposed to go on a dinner date with someone else. Our breakfast turned into a 3 hour meal, and the whole time I didn't want it to end. Later, on my actual date, I couldn't stop thinking about this boy. He was who I wanted to be with. **There were some other little moments where I had a feeling he was into me too. He'd come do my laundry with me, compliment me, find any excuse to hang out with me. But he'd never kiss me!  I kept trying to stop liking him.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't. But it's a little messier than just that. Since then, our friendship has ebbed and flowed. **We grew apart when a friend of mine told him that I liked him (early March), and that was the same time I found out he was on a break with his girlfriend (of 4 years).** Oh. After a day not talking to each other after the awkward night, I eventually decided that I would be an adult and go talk to him. I **told him, point blank, that the friend had reported old information, that I was only interested in being his friend not hooking up with him and that I really really care about him and value him as a friend. I didn't want to ruin the friendship, so even though I really liked him, I decided to stick with being just friends. When I told him this, he told me that he also didnt want to ""be in a relationship with me"" and also that he had officially broken up with his girlfriend, for good.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the semester, **he had become quite close with another girl and they started spending all of their time together, like he and I did at the beginning**. It made me sad, but it also helped me get over him, mostly. Of course, I still liked him, but since we were spending less time together it was easy to try and ignore it. I was and am incredibly jealous of her; I felt replaced. **Seeing them talking and laughing like we used to made me sad and it made me feel like I missed my shot. It made me wish I had gone for it.**

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, though, **he and I have become a lot closer. He's been dealing with some family issues and I've been there for him. We spend a few nights a week talking until pretty late. I've had to help take care of him with an injury.** **Last week, he got a little drunk, and I ordered us some snacks. As we ate, we began talking about another guy I'm attempting/pretending to be into, and then he started telling me how gorgeous I am. How beautiful I looked at our formal. How he showed me to his mom. How his mom loves me and thinks I'm beautiful too. Talking about how much he's going to miss me when I leave and thanking me for taking care of him and helping him. We were making that kind of eye contact that really only happens right before you kiss someone: direct, long pauses, lots of subtext. But I wasn't sitting near him, and I'm scared to go for it in case he's not into me.** 

&amp;#x200B;

He walked me to my room and we stood outside it for a moment, then we hugged. Am I crazy? I feel like boys don't say those kinds of things unless there's something there. **We've always talked about how we were trying to avoid getting with people in our dormitory, because there's a lot of drama and we're a little too old to worry about gossip. But he's kissed two people here (both of them have kissed him), though he's not interested in either, according to him, as both were just drunk at clubs. In the past 2 weeks, that conversation has disappeared.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm truly at a loss. I care about him so much, and losing him as a friend would be devastating. If I tell him and he doesn't like me back, I worry it will feel like last time, when he was awkward and not really my friend for a day. **I'd rather have friendship than nothing. But I also can't stop thinking about him. I know we will never date because I'm going home, 25 hours away. We're not going to be in a relationship, and I'm leaving. But I wonder if I should just kiss him and see. Or tell him that I do like him. Or do nothing? I don't know what best case scenario is.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice appreciated. I haven't felt this way about someone since my ex boyfriend 3 years ago. This boy is amazing. Not only is he adorable, but also he is caring, compassionate, knowledgeable about the entire world, fun, supportive, and exciting to talk to. The idea of going home and leaving him and our friendship here makes me so sad. At this point, I feel like I should go for it. **The other night he came to my room ""to say hi"" around midnight  and stayed for a few hours. That feels more than friendly. But I also feel like if he wanted me, he would've gone for it.** 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do?! I worry I'll regret saying nothing, but since we won't end up together, is there a point in even trying anything for just a month? 

&amp;#x200B;

637,"My sisters and I never had the best dynamic. In fact, my sisters always hated me and said nasty things behind my back. Now, they are moving forward in life and I'm not. They both have jobs, can drive and in general, have a life that I don't.

I am socially anxious, like really afraid of people. I am 20 and don't have a job. I stay in my room all day to get away from my sister. My sisters are actually toxic towards me. When they both lived here, they constantly back stabbed me and made me feel really insecure about myself. Before the backstabbing started, I was extremely confident in myself and not afraid of people. 

It sucks to know that my sisters and even my high school bully have better lives than me. It's like they hurt me and got good things in return. It sucks! I don't know I find myself constantly comparing myself to them. I know it sounds just awful, but when my sister (the one that still lives here) achieves something I feel really jealous. Even the one that isn't in our state. 

I just want to stop listening in to conversations about my sister's plans for the future and focus on my own life.

639,"So back in January I was assaulted. I'm okay but for a little bit I wasnt. This is where this story comes along.

About two days after I was walking on the treadmill of my gym and looked obviously depressed. My friend comes over to me and I dont know why but I just told her what happened. I guess I do know why, because I have known her for years and you tell your friends if something is wrong. I told her that i was assaulted, had taken Plan B even though it wasnt pentrative (I know its a little much but I felt so gross and for some reason thought that would make me feel better), and I had gotten a UTI from it (a mixture of touching from him and stress). She made a joke and didnt comment on what happened. 

Now that pissed me off. I was too upset to really say anything. A couple months go by and I'm very busy (also very annoyed) so I'm barely talking to her. She makes this big thing about how she needs to go out because she took this test and passed. Now I'm in a bunch of classes and working and i'm depressed so I dont have a lot of time but I dont want to make time for something like this. She flips out saying how horrible it was that I didnt want to go to a club for her (I always hated clubs).  Then eventually she asks me whats going on and I told her, ""remember what I told you about being assaulted,"" and in text she completely disregards what I said and goes on about her party. So I said it again something along the lines of the first time I said something you made a joke and the second time I said something you completely disregarded it and its downright disrespectful and is incredibly insulting. She then says, ""do you think we'd let you get raped or something at a club... you know your not really being a good friend.""

&amp;#x200B;

I called her out saying how calling me a bad friend and making a comment about possible rape is one of the worst things anyone has ever said to me. She apologized but its still lingering in the back of my head everytime she messages me. Now I have one friend who wants me to be friendly with the girl.

645,"I (17F) have recently started an apprenticeship at a local gastropub as a chef. So far everything is going great and everyone’s being very friendly and supportive. I’ve been there for about a week and a half.

So far, every single one of my coworkers has introduced themselves, except one. Even during very busy hours new employees I hadn’t met yet have found the time to introduce themselves. Several people who I went to high school with, who disliked me, also say hello and ask how I am when they see me.

One of the bartenders (20sF) completely ignores me however. If we were busy and seldom saw each other I’d understand more, but I see her on most of my shifts before we open, when things are generally very calm, and on breaks. On one of these breaks she spoke to everyone except me. It feels a bit like she doesn’t acknowledge me being there.

I’m prone to overthinking, so maybe it’s nothing, or she’s just shy around new people and would rather me introduce myself first. On the other hand, part of me feels that she’s intentionally ignoring me. I’m quite shy and awkward myself and I’m not really sure what the best way to deal with this situation is. Things feel very awkward at the moment and I don’t want that to continue, but I’m not sure how to properly introduce myself and approaching her seems a little scary, if I’m honest.

I’m not sure if it’s worth mentioning as I think this is incredibly unlikely, but I suppose there’s a very slim chance that this is the case. When I mentioned this situation to my mum, she suggested that the bartender might not like that I spend a lot of time with another chef (27M) and therefore feel threatened by me. I’m not sure if these two are together or if she has feelings for him, but they’re friends at the very least. Obviously I don’t want to get in the way of their relationship if they do have one, but I can’t help having to spend time with the chef as we need to work together. Like I said earlier I doubt this is the case but it might be worth mentioning.

TLDR; One of my female coworkers is either shy, dislikes me, or even feels threatened by me working with a male coworker. Is she being rude or is it me overthinking, and how would I go about breaking the ice?",10Jun2019,1
646,"Small amount of back story to assist with your decision on the matter. We dated for two years, lived together for about 8 months. We loved each other super hard while we were together. Just like most relationships, things eventually deteriorated, and we had a pretty rough breakup. I abruptly left my life with her as soon as things ended between us (I believe in starting the process of moving on from a past relationship as quickly as possible). We fought pretty badly at the end (objectively because of her, I’m a super non confrontational person), and she said some absolutely horrible things to me. I never thought I’d see her or hear from her again. We spoke for the first time since we broke up about 13 months ago (which was about a year after the relationship ended). She wanted to meet to catch up, I wasn’t ready to do that. As I’ve gotten older and more mature, I feel like I’m ready for that meeting. I absolutely don’t have feelings for her, and am not attempting to get back with her. I’m thinking that maybe meeting with her will close the book on portion of my life, but I’m not really sure.

A day or so ago she said she learned how to faint on command, basically by hyperventilating and then holding her breath until her brain shuts down. The first time she did it, she was out for 8 minutes.

I told her to stop, obviously the lack of oxygen is harmful for her brain, she responded with ""lol it's fun tho"" like I said, she's tryna be edgy. I gave her medical sources of the brain damage it could cause, told her time and again to stop. Yet she persisted. And here's the disturbing part; the videos. She's encouraging her personal friends to do this and she's sending me the videos. 

I have received video after video of teenagers having seizures that can be quite violent at times due to the oxygen restriction. I'm tryna seem calm about it but it's actually kinda fucking me up. 

I eventually made her promise to stop, she said she'd do it ""one more time"" well, this morning I woke up to a video of a one of her friends having a seizure that she sent on ""accident"".

My bf can not understand why I can’t just ‘not think about stressful things’ and thinks I’m overreacting when I get too upset over small issues. He’ll get frustrated when I cry because something in my life feels odd/uneven and I feel like I’m about to have a panic attack because of it. He just sees it as something offbalance, and doesn’t know why it affects me so much. 

I know that he is right about most things, but he does not understand how hard things can be when you have mental health problems. It is very difficult to control and fix. When I can’t make him understand what I’m going through I feel hopeless and everything gets worse. Or he will get mad at me for my emotions being kind of whack.

661,"I am a 21 y/o recent “college grad,” meaning I walked in the spring ceremony, but I have 2 more classes to finish up this summer before I actually receive my degree. I knew about needing these classes for a while, but I always put off telling my dad, who pays for the part of my tuition that isn’t covered by scholarship money. I was afraid to say anything because he was so proud of me for graduating in 3 years instead of 4, and I didn’t want him to know I had to withdraw from a couple of them (I’ve ALWAYS been a straight-A student—my parents are shocked and disappointed when I get even a B). I avoided the conversation for so long that I ended up graduating without anyone knowing I still had summer classes. I planned to tell him several more times in person, but I always pussied out for some reason or another, never feeling like it was the “right time” to break it to him. At this point, he has received the email with the bill from my school and has been trying to talk to me for weeks, calling and texting multiple times a day asking me to call him back. At first I pretended to be busy or would tell him I would call him at a certain time and not follow through, but for the past few weeks I’ve just completely ignored everything. This prompted a couple of angry texts which made me even more scared to talk to him. I spoke to my mother who told me he’s not mad about the classes and wants to help pay for them, but I still feel like I’m in way too deep ignoring him and I don’t know how to stop. The thought of answering a random call from him with no warning and no preparation makes me extremely anxious, but I also haven’t been able to get over my fear and just call him myself.

664,"I need some help on deciding if a job is worth it or not. It would be my first real job in my field, so it would be good experience, but there’s a few things I’m thinking about that are making me reconsider the job. 

I don’t have a car, so I would have to either Uber or take the bus every day. An Uber is roughly $18 each way, and I’m guessing that could go up depending on surge prices. I’m thinking I will have to Uber in the mornings, because it takes anywhere from 1 hour to 1 hour and 45 minutes, and I don’t think it would be a good idea to risk missing any busses along the way(2-3 bus transfers in the route) and also spending close to 4 hours on the bus every day sounds awful. So my plan would be to Uber in the morning, and take the bus back after work. 

Here are my monthly expenses:
Rent: 480 

Utilities: 100-150

$200 in credit card bills 

420-550 in student loan Payments(not sure on exact amount yet)

Groceries(not sure how much I can get away with spending, for just 1 person)

Bus pass-76.50 a month

Uber: roughly 360-450 if I only take it in the mornings( figured 20 rides a month) 

And I’m not sure if there are other expenses I’m not considering. My parents currently pay for health insurance and phone payments and will be for the foreseeable future. 

The pay for the Job is 19/hr full time, which I calculated to be 2422 net pay. Not sure if that’s right, but I got it from an online calculator.


Would this job be worth it in your opinion or should I try to find something a little closer?

I'm 20 years old right now trying to pay for university myself and living with my mother to save myself from a bit of debt. We're on housing benefits but aren't bad tenants or what most people assume (i.e. trashy) when they think of Section 8. When I was younger I knew that we didn't have a lot but more recently I have been privy to how bad it actually is. Our income level is substantially below the FPL, about $9,000 a year generously. My mother is still claiming me as a dependent so I have yet to/don't know how to file taxes or if I'm entitled to a return. She works in media on commission, so I am always the one with a steady job. The system has worked in my favor in some aspects though because my tuition is deeply discounted with grants/scholarships.

I usually work a lot of manual labor/minimum wage jobs (farms, landscaping) so I feel like my savings are hard earned but in four months putting away 15-20% of my pay I only managed to keep $250 in my savings because I had to front bills. 

I desperately want to work full time and build my resume so I can have financial independence and a good career, but I feel permanently tethered to my mother and being poor. Whenever I earn a decent wage our rent bumps up, and because my mother doesn't have any form of steady income, the bills fall on my shoulders. I can't earn enough to be comfortable without giving my entire paycheck to our household. I want to save and have money to pay for my textbooks and lab fees/tuition, and even for myself to enjoy (heaven forbid I thrive instead of survive).

I have been hearing the same thing for years, and I'm trying my best not to be bitter about it because she did the best she could while I was growing up.

667,"Although I feel it should be fine, my apologizes if this is not the correct sub to post this to. Also this post is on a throwaway since the person in question knows my Reddit username. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a rising senior in high school (17M) who is currently experiencing the struggle of trying to help a friend with rather serious mental health issues. My friend (also 17M), we will call him Mark for anonymity, has been experiencing worrying symptoms of depression recently. He will often send long winded texts to my friends and me and then apologize for interfering in our lives despite us assuring him that we are more than willing to talk to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

About two years ago, Mark downloaded Doki Doki Literature Club, a video game in which a character cuts herself, supposedly giving him the idea to begin practicing self-harm. When his parents found out about his self harm and the role the game played in it, they began to place heavy restrictions on his life. These include preventing him from downloading video games, blocking YouTube and similar sites, and shutting off the WiFi at certain times. In our opinion, these regulations have recently spiraled out of control to the point where they now prevent him from taking his phone into any room with a shut door in order to prevent any possible sexting (despite the fact that he has never done so before and is not the type of kid to do that). This has led to a great deal of anger on behalf of Mark prompting the aforementioned conversations with us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, with next year being the year that we apply to colleges, his parents have been extremely pressuring him to improve his resume and the like in hopes of him getting into a better college. However, he has kept strong grades throughout high school, but they do not seem to think that to be enough.

&amp;#x200B;

When he reaches out to us, Mark seems to not really want to continue the conversations because we are not depressed along with him. Instead, he chooses to confide in his girlfriend (17F), we will call her Lucy, who we believe to likewise be depressed (their relationship is for the most part secretive and therefore we don't know her very well hence the lack of certainty). He seems to be very dependent on her and will grow very anxious if she does not respond to his texts in a short period of time. For instance, last evening, he vented to her and when she did not respond, he became very nervous that he may have caused her to self harm herself due to the ranting nature of his messages. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all of this, his parents believe that Lucy is the problem that is leading to his depression, instead of their restrictions and general behavior. This has led to his parents placing pressure on him to break up with his girlfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friends and I are understandably worried about Mark's health (as well as Lucy's) and are extremely nervous about what he might do in the future. He has cut himself in the past, although the school did little to help him in that situation (and their help is further reduced by the fact that school let out last week for summer break). He has a therapist, but he seems unable to get through to Mark's parents and influence their train of thought. We have requested that our parents reach out to his, but based on previous evidence, we are afraid that such actions will be ineffective.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically we have no clue what to do and would very much appreciate your help.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.",10Jun2019,3
668,"I am 30-something professional woman (attorney). I have battled depression and anxiety my whole life. It's always been there; it's always been awful and sometimes I wonder if I've been misdiagnosed because even medicated life is too hard for me. My husband has no concept of mental illness. He was raised to walk it off, former military. I don't blame his ignorance but he seriously has no clue that what is happening to me is real. How do you convey to a very lay, simple person the struggles of mental illness?

I've also addiction struggles. I drink alcohol everyday, pretty much all day. Work, home, everywhere. I drink and cry at my job, overwhelmed by the stress, but buried in debt so I see no escape and my husband just doesn't have it in him to understand.

669,"Last week my manager didn't schedule me, so I messaged her about it and she said ""That may have been an error on my part, let me look into it."" and proceeded to not fix it and not text me back about why or anything. So I've been ""not scheduled"" for jobs before, so here I am getting paranoid that I'm just not going to get scheduled anymore, so I freak out and start applying for other jobs (because who wants to deal with someone ""forgetting"" to schedule you anyway.) I get a few interviews, but I am still hopeful that I still have my job, because for the past few months it was a good job with good people and really, I swear to the heavens above, I did my best to be a model employee. I have made a lot of mistakes in the past and I've learned from them, if I did something wrong I would have known.

So fast forward to midweek last week and I am starting to get very worried. I am friends with an ex coworker on facebook so I vented with him a little bit. I didn't really think anything of it until I get the ""we need to talk"" text from my boss, where she tells me that ""I was told that you were very unhappy with me to the point of 'trash talking' to former employees."" So haha wow. Totally sidetracked on that one. Gets worried about being fired&gt;talks to a coworker about it&gt;spins way out of proportion down the telephone chain&gt;Get fired. Talk about some kind of weird self fulfilling prophecy.

One of the major reasons I think I got fired is that my boss just hates this former employee. Like I didn't even know how much she hated him until it got me fired. Also if I could have talked to any other employee I would have? He just happens to be the only one I have contact information for.

Point is, I in no shape or form got fired because of my performance, and some of the interviews I have lined up have a resume with this job on it. I would go so far and say this job is the only reason I got some of these interviews. I have no idea what to tell them??? I know I should have just kept my mouth shut (head&gt;desk. repeat) but I was so worried and I never expected someone to freaking tell my boss how I was (rightfully) venting about how she forgot to schedule me, nevermind being fired for it!!

My sister asks for my iphone 6s plus for a while and she asked a week after Christmas. She has cracked it and still hasn't fixed the screen 2 months later. I just gotten a new iphone 6s but it's not a plus so its smaller. I tried to give it to her many times but she seems to not like the size difference. She won't be getting a phone for a long time and that phone was my only Christmas gift from my mom as well. What should I do about this?,10Jun2019,1
671,"I'm an 18 year old guy.
One year ago a good friend (I'm gonna call him F1) of mine broke up with his long term girlfriend (since he has a new girlfriend he should be over it). Since then my best friend (F2) made out with her and another friend (F3) cheated on his long term gf with said girl. About three weeks ago we (me and this girl) started texting and seeing each other from time to time (nothing sexual so far). Every time we see us we're heavily flirting and she's showing she wants to do the thing. Me and F1 aren't really the closest friends. We talk in school and that's already it. Another good friend of mine (F4) is really encouraging towards me.

I don't know what to do since F1 wants us to stop talking to her but I kinda like her.",10Jun2019,1

675,"(Throwaway account)

To start, my best friend and I just graduated high school couple weeks ago, and we've known each other for a really long time.  We used to date two years ago for a couple of months, and it didn't work out because of our different beliefs in a relationship and other issues. However, in those months, we really bonded together and hung out a lot outside of school. After we broke up, we never really talked unless it was necessary until late last year.  We've started talking on and off and even more at the end of school. At Prom, she held my hand and snuggled up to my arm when we were coming back from the venue. She's only every touchy with her girlfriends, but I don't want to misinterpret her signals (I also think she forgot about it, too). 

I really want to pursue a relationship again, but I don't want to ruin our friendship; I understand the risk of asking her out, but I love her a lot. We've been getting more involved with other things like college and other friends, but she and I always talk at the end of a night because it is the beginning of summer. There are a couple other things  that I can see getting in the way of us. For example, she wasn't really on board with commitment because of a more a fear of being held down and restricted. Another one is about trust. She doesn't really like to trust while I'm a little too trusting at times. It' could also a very short relationship over the span of 2+ months; then, we'll part ways for college.  We've definitely matured the last time we dated each other, and there's a part of me that says it's better to bury my feelings. I'm split between what I should do.

I don't really know what she thinks about me, and I feel that I am overthinking this so much.",10Jun2019,1
676,"So today I had nothing to do and was bored. I came across some video about 4chan, I always saw 4chan mentioned but I never payed attention to it. So I watched the video and after that video I found out about the mentally fucked up people. I found out about the people taking hormone replacement therapy to become “traps” and more. Eventually I watched some video of some dude killing himself. After watching this video I’m just mentally fucked. I feel anxious and scared.

My mind is racing and my head is filling with intrusive thoughts and I don’t feel good.

677,"I'll try to keep it as brief as possible and factual. 
I've been infatuated by sex since I was a kid, would study and look up how to stimulate women (I'm male btw) like really get into it.
I've been lucky enough to be born attractive and had a lot of opportunities to have sex since I was quite young, 12ish onwards, despite this I waited until I was 22 and in love. While I was with my partner I had eyes for her and only her, chances came about to pursue girls that would remain secret and not once was I even tempted. I was in love.
My partner ended up leaving/betraying/abandoning me, and before that the last year of our relationship was very sexless. So I know I have some sexual repression from that whole experience, it was difficult holding it all back when the person I wanted to experience that most with would rarely engage. 
Fast forward almost a year being single, I've fucked almost 50 girls and gotten into some really kinky shit. Some have been one time things, others a reoccurring things. I'm doing it multiple times a day on weekends, sometimes including more than one partner.

Normally, I can quit anything I want. Dropped drugs, unhealthy habits, whatever, easy. However, I can NOT quit sex. I understand it's a pleasure, but it's a pleasure I'm abusing and I don't know why. I have reasoned with myself that it's unhealthy and I'm addicted but I keep going back. 

I'm worried because I'm starting to lead a double life. My friends are aware I'm currently promiscuous, but not to the degree I am. I don't feel I have anyone I can talk with this about. It's leading me to lie about what I'm doing with my time, effecting my health, sleep, work, mental health, though it is doing wondering for my cardio. 

I know I'm still young and can/should enjoy sex for all of its pleasures but I don't know how to control myself? I'm getting called at 2-3am for booty calls and getting up for work at 6. Cancelling leisure with friends, family, to get some. It's constantly on my mind when I wake up until I sleep.

If anyone has any experience with this, addiction in general, or advice on the topic I'd appreciate it. I'm up to trying anything at this point. 

Thank you!",10Jun2019,1

682,"It's been a hot second since I last posted on reddit, so apologies if my formatting is weird, also if I sound a little overwhelmed and all over the place! Here goes nothing.

A little background on myself- I'm a recent college graduate (I've been out of school for only and exactly one month today), majored in art, specifically Illustration. I found art to be my way to express myself while growing up, so it was only logical for me to go through and study it in school. Currently, I'm working a management/supervisor job in a certain retail company that I quite frankly don't get paid enough for when taking the people I deal with into account, but my department does all of the printing for people and local businesses which is at least somewhat related to my study and I love my coworkers. I had been planning to live at home and work said job for about a year post grad and saving up to get on my feet (currently have about 6k stored away), that is, until today.

I've been on-and-off applying for illustration jobs on websites like Indeed, Glassdoor, etc. but have been having absolutely abysmal luck since most companies seem to believe that ""entry level"" is not only a degree but also like 3 years of field experience on top of it, which honestly makes no sense to me. However, a few weeks back, a professor emailed my graduating class an opportunity that another previous alum sent to him for a position as a marketing illustrator at a company that designs products that end up at bigger companies and stores in the US. Like any other job, I applied, but this time I somehow got an interview, which was cool! So I made the couple of hours drive out, met the supervisor, who gave me a vague task to draw a sample design for them. took a few days on that, sent a piece back to her, and the next day got an email back from HR asking to come in again for another interview, this time with the owner. Which brings me to today!

I just got back from that couple-hour drive again, and they seem to really, really like my stuff. Owner told me I have a talent and would probably be a good fit for the company, which was super flattering to hear after working my ass off in school for 4 years!! Only issue seems to be the location- I was told to look into housing more around the area, let them know what I find, and go from there, which pretty much translates to an offer. Basically, I'd have to immediately move out, throw myself out into the working world and as silly as it is, I'm really just confused and a bit scared about everything and especially what I should do now.

It's an incredible opportunity, and I'm aware I'm unbelievably lucky to have gotten a full time, in house offer for a reputable company a month out of school, especially in the cutthroat art industry. My only other relative who's involved in the industry said I should go for it- it'd be perfect on my resume and would absolutely get my feet in the water while I build up a career!! I'm just super plan oriented and get really stressed and anxious if my initial plans (aka, living at home rent free for a year) are messed with- I truly didn't expect to get this far based on my previous luck with applications, and I'd have to give up my current job (I only got promoted to supervisor a few weeks back and am afraid of disappointing my higher up managers as I'm basically carrying my understaffed department), move out, and really risk it all, especially when housing is super expensive in that part of the state (average seems to be $900/month to rent just a room- I'm in MA, for reference). 

I know it's basically what ""adulting"" is all about and it's what I worked for, but I don't know if I'm rushing things here! But at the same time, I really don't know when I'll get this kind of chance again- the position and what it entails otherwise checks out so well in an industry where actual jobs are hard to come by, and some of my friends who have been out of art school for years are still looking for work. ...so now I'm here, currently looking at housing listings! 

tl;dr, do I stay at home and save, get a good head on my shoulders and take my time at home, or jump right into moving out for a job in my field that'd be perfect for starting my career that I might not even have another chance for, while risking stability? Sorry if this post is all over the place- I don't know how long I even have to decide as I was told that there was another candidate, so why not ask strangers for advice on a whim?

Thank you all so much for any help or guidance! :-)",10Jun2019,1
683,"Sorry for mobile formatting. TL;DR at the bottom. I'm anxious over lots of dumb things, but this is what I wanna deal with first. I have a habit of procrastinating my practice for my piano lessons, so this may have to do with it. Basically, I'm a beginner in piano, and I go once a week. I know I have no reason to be anxious... I do practice before I go to lessons, and I even go over it in the car. And even then, my teacher is very patient, and it's a private lesson. I still get anxious, though. I don't know why!! How it works is I get a little, like, 30 second piece of music, and he has me do 3 different exercises as I play - I first say the notes I'm playing. I then count the beats per measure as I play (ex. ""1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4."" if it's a 4/4 bpm). Finally, he has me sing the words to the piece. I'm a horrible singer. Thankfully, my quiet voice is often overshadowed by the sound of the keyboard. He has me do each exercise 4 times, and allowing me one mistake each exercise. If I make more than one mistake, he has me restart the exercise, which I don't mind. The sessions are only 30 minutes, and I do enjoy it, so time goes by rather quickly sometimes. I think what makes me nervous when making mistakes is that I still don't have the sheet notes memorized; it'll take me a second to see, for example, F on a sheet and associate that with the note F. I usually look at other, more familiar noted (mainly C) for reference. I'm nervous about tonight's session because I told him I wouldn't be there for two weeks (was on vacation with family). However, I'm at fault, because I didn't practice at all for those two weeks. As I said before, the pieces aren't long or complicated. I'm only doing 2/3/4 beats per 4 measures. So it's not difficult to memorize and get it down, but I procrastinate a lot. When I go, I take my lesson book, so in the car, I'll have my book open and air-practicing (moving my fingers with the respective notes). If I'm traveling, I'll take a picture of my piece that I'm gonna play the following week and practice with that. And yet, after all this simplicity, I still get anxiety when going to my lessons, and if I recall, the anxiety stays until after the lesson. How can I cope and deal with this? TL;DR I take piano lessons once a week. The lessons are pretty simple and straightforward, and I have a good teacher... But I still get anxious when I go. Why is this happening and how can I fix it?",10Jun2019,2

Unfortunately he lived far and had plans for the next month that meant we couldn’t see each other until after his excursion. He would rarely initiate conversation but he did continue conversations that I started. When I let him know I was a little confused about the situation he stayed up to talk to me about it and let me know of his intentions. He would message me sporadically but it seemed like a game. So I messaged him in a rude passive aggressive way and basically told him I did not want to do this. I got ahead of myself and feel like I may have rushed my decision. I also was a complete bitch. So I did apologize but he did not respond to the apology. So I reached out again to give him a call later tonight just to apologize for the way I addressed him. I have no intention to rekindle but was trying to not make an enemy. He has not responded and was wondering if I should just drop it or send him a message about why I wanted to give him a call and just apologize for being rude and not expressing how I felt in a more grown up way.,10Jun2019,0

693," I ended up receiving my degree from the University of Tennessee in Chemical Engineering. I also minored in Reliability and Maintainability Engineering. I attained a solid 3.09, which I'm very proud about. However, I've hit a wall in my career and am looking for some advice, if you have the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently was employed with X  as a manager apart of the reliability division. This was from October 2018 through January 2019. I ended up getting injured in December of 2018, then promptly terminated in January of 2019. The situation as a whole was rather complicated, but the reason for termination was a lock-out-tag-out violation. I can say that the policy violation was not the reason I was injured, though I do hold myself accountable for the repercussions of the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, my experience is quite limited. X was my first professional experience. Again, unfortunate as the duration is not substantial. I took a period of time to search for another opportunity that could help me take that next step, and it has been proven rather difficult. So, I'm currently in the process of finding temporary work in the meantime while I continue looking. I have a couple of opportunities with Y, Z, W, B, and a few more (all temporary). Though, I'm rather worried about my career stagnating. 

&amp;#x200B;

Advice from the unemployment office has led to the idea of internships and co-ops. I've been looking for these and have applied to many, but these seem to focus only on those who are still in university.

&amp;#x200B;

Advice from Z is that I should keep doing what I'm doing with finding another professional experience to distance myself from X. I was advised to stay away from positions that don't promote my career, essentially at all costs

&amp;#x200B;

Advice from my family is to find a job, and work my way up. My worry with stagnating resonates with this advice, not to mention a  $20/hr pay cut is pretty harsh.

696,"This is going to be very hard to explain, so bare with me if it gets confusing.

&amp;#x200B;

I was never diagnosed with a clinical depression, but more and more recently i've been falling more and more into a pit of despair.  My old friends have ditched me, I sometimes contemplate in the mornings if it's even worth getting up anymore, if it's worth doing anything anymore.  

The one thing, the one person keeping me from a true despair is this one girl.  She means everything to me, she is the sweetest and most caring girl I have ever met...But the problem is...I don't think she likes me as much as I think she does.

She tells me how I am her most best friend ever right now...But her actions just don't show it.  When I am talking to her and I obviously start to feel a wave of despair, I try to make it apparent in the conversation because my anxiety raises straight through the roof if I ask her for help on the spot.  I have no courage to, I try to hint at it so much, my tone completely changes and it becomes very very apparent that there is something wrong.  And I know she knows, but she never says anything, she acts as if nothing is wrong.  It's almost like she doesn't want to talk about it.

If I ask her to hangout, she'll say yes, but the second one of her other friends asks her way after me, and after we've made our plans, she will not even tell me she is going to hangout with another friend, and I get ditched.  

Or she will tell me she is cancelling plans to hang out with another friend.

Don't get the wrong idea, she is a very very nice girl, and I believe she cares for me a lot, but these things just happen, and every time I try to talk to her about it she says she doesn't want to deal with it and ignores me for a while.

I seriously try to talk to her about it but she never wants to.

It doesn't help when she talks about her other friends too, like there is some events I want to go with her to, and I would be very willing to pay her fees to go, but she always says she is going with another friend.  

Why am I stuck being the 2nd pick?  I try so hard in the friendship, I don't understand what I am doing wrong!  

Matters get much worse when I get extremely jealous of her other friends, I wish she would just pick me over them sometimes.  Can't I be selfish once in a while?  I feel so worthless when these things happen, and I don't know what to do.

She's been in and out of two relationships in our whole time of us being close, and during both times she would almost cease all of our connections and sometimes even avoid me!  I tried talking to her about it, and it only stabbed the friendship more.  I told her about both boyfriends that they would be bad because of what I saw and how they were so controlling...She denied it every time.  When she broke up with the first, she came back to me saying I was right and to forgive her.  The second time, the whole fiasco happened again, we lost contact, i predicted he was bad, and he cheated on her.  She came back to me apologizing and to forgive her, and I did.

I want to get into a relationship with her one day, but I have almost no courage to ask, as I've heard her say that (via my eavesdropping) it will never happen because ""we are too close"".  The hell kind of excuse is that?  Isn't it good to be close friends first?  She has told me she thinks if we would break up that it would be the end of our friendship, but i've told her that wouldn't happen!  I'm not like that! 

I've never been in a relationship before, so I could never tell her for sure I wouldn't, but I really believe I wouldn't, unless she cheated on me or something.  If it was a mutual breakup, or for some reason that I could clearly see, I think everything would still work out fine.  In fact one of her previous boyfriends she broke up with is one of her closest friends, so that is proof it could work out.

We spend a lot of days together and we all live within 10 minutes of each other. There is no bad blood or weird drama between anyone in my immediate family. My brother just moved out of our family home and I am still here while I finish college. I have this weird thing, and I have always had it, where I literally cannot be nice to my dad. And my mom a lot of times as well, but mostly I have always been a witch to him. He does so much for me, and I’m legit tearing up writing this, but I just physically and mentally can’t unless I have had like three drinks in me. My mom and I have always had an off and on relationship, usually have major blow out fights once every few months. 

For example, yesterday, I was exhausted, hungover, and had 6 hours of accounting and economics homework to due before 11 pm. My niece had a three hour dance recital that I went to. Before I got there my mom asked me to stop and get her a specific gift and to call her once I get there so she could bring me out my ticket to get in. I had to go to two stores to find the gift (which was annoying) and when I got there I called her four times and she didn’t answer which really annoyed me, because it’s like, she told me to call her and now she isn’t answering. It gave me a little anxiety for some reason and I just got extremely stressed out. I finally got ahold of my dad and got in there and then my mom told my dad that I bought my niece a gift and to pay me back and he started annoyingly tapping my arm saying “good job for using your own money” which I thought he was saying sarcastically so that also annoyed me. I said “can you please stop hitting my arm” I was seriously just in a bad mood and I felt like everything they were doing was bothering me. My mom got mad at me for being mean to my dad and said I have “some type of disease” and she basically hasn’t spoken to me since. (Side note my dad was never mad at me and never even said anything about it because it was the *smallest* deal in the world) This morning she said nothing to me, and I went to my classes and I stopped at the grocery store on the way home. I called her and asked if she wanted anything and she was very short with me. about thirty minutes ago, I said “are you mad at me or something?” And then she finally was like “I’m just done trying to have a relationship with you, your dad and I think you hate us and nothing we ever do is enough for you” and she went on and on, and I argued back because I genuinely think she is so sensitive and ridiculous. Eventually I just walked away because it’s so frustrating. Now it’s awkward because her birthday is tomorrow. How am I supposed to even act now, do I act like we didn’t just have that stupid argument? It makes me want to leave, I don’t want to celebrate her tomorrow because it’s going to be weird and I already can feel the tension between us. How am I supposed to write her a card knowing that she thinks I hate her, and I literally cannot do anything to change that by tomorrow. I know I can be mean, but I legit can think of a million places I would rather be than home when they are there, and I can’t move out until I finish school and have a career which will hopefully be January. Every time they ask me things I give them a major attitude and act like they just asked me to do something ridiculous... idk I can’t explain it. 

I feel like when I’m with my family I can’t be myself. I feel constantly judged and more and more like I don’t fit in. I’ve always felt like that. I literally feel as if I live two separate lives- one with my family and one with the rest of the world. Idk if it’s because I’m the youngest, but I just never felt fully comfortable. Nothing traumatizing ever happened in my life. My dad is an alcoholic but doesn’t drink and hasn’t in YEARS. I feel like I have so much resentment towards my brother, and I don’t have a clue why. I’ve never been able to keep a relationship with a guy. I don’t know fucking even know where I’m going with this but I feel like there is something deeper going on and I genuinely can’t figure it out. I have a close group of friends and I would do anything for them and I’m so kind to others. My one guy friend even said to me last summer “if there is anyone I know that is always happy it’s you” and i think about that all the time because I’m not happy at home. I don’t live in a toxic environment, I’m fucking so blessed and live in a beautiful house in a beautiful neighborhood and everyone in my family is healthy and happy but I genuinely just can’t change my personality around them. They try to be nice and ask me about work and my school and my friends and my upcoming trips, but I completely shut them down every time. 

I feel as if I have some mental block that I can’t open up and be myself with them. If anyone has any opinions please shed some light, I’m really struggling with this and I mentally have no  idea how to fix it.",10Jun2019,0

My parents treat me like shit, they always have, I tried to open up to them about the possibly of having anxiety and/or depression 2 years ago after speaking to a school councillor after having a panic attack in the playground and they told me to get over it because depression doesn’t exist and life gets more stressful so I just have to deal with it, they treat my younger brother like a god and I’m their slave

707,"My old laptop recently died so I’m now looking into a new laptop. I’ve pinned down two that interest me: the 2018 MacBook Pro with no touchbar, and the Dell G5 with an i5-8300H and GTX 1060 Max-Q.

I’m starting college soon, and I’ll be majoring in nursing so a MacBook Pro would be useful for the portability, and Apples build quality is top notch, which could equate to longevity.

However I would like to game a little bit, things like CSGO, PUBG, and Overwatch, which is why the Dell G5 caught my interest.

711,"I just got a new job and the way our boss runs the scheduling is through the T Sheets app. She she gives us shifts on there and we clock in through it and everything. I checked my schedule on there Saturday evening at 4pm. (Our place of work is only open Monday - Friday) At that point in time my first shift for this week was on Wednesday. They had me working Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Last week I worked Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. I assumed that this meant 3 days a week was the norm for this job and went on with my life. Then this morning (Monday) at 8:30 I am woken up by a call from my boss saying “where are you, you were supposed to come in at 8 this morning” I was confused and responded “when I checked the schedule it said I didn’t come in until Wednesday.” She told me “you have to check the schedule often, it will change”. 

So my advice from you Reddit, is it okay for bosses to just add shifts like this randomly without telling anyone? Or is it usually better to have a set day the schedule comes out and then not make changes unless you ask the employees involved? I had made plans with my mom today because as far as I was aware I had the day off. Is this something a lot of employers do? Should I just suck it up and expect that my life will be impossible to plan and entirely on a day by day basis, or is it time to start looking for a different job?",10Jun2019,1

I accepted but it is four months in and I regret it.

I don’t know if I am being dramatic for feeling uncomfortable but after dealing with it daily for four months I can’t take being treated this way. The one girl refuses to make eye contact with me if she speaks to me. But she will look at everyone else. She talks to me so monotone and rude but is normal towards everyone. We have to walk to places in groups of two to pick stuff up and when it’s the day for us to go together she will leave before me so she doesn’t have to walk with me. I know I sound like a child being annoyed about this but I’ve never worked in such an uncomfortable environment.

*Is there any other clothing item that I could match to my prom date's dress?*

720,"Hello, first post on Reddit and using a throwAway because some people may recognize my main as I use the same nickname. 

Fyi : I'm from an European country, I tried to translate the ""school"" terms but keep in mind that high school in France is 3 years and Bachelor's degrees are 3 years long aswell. And sorry for the syntax and speech I'm not used to writing anything this long (it's really really long and I don't expect anyone to read it completely i'm also writing to vent)


So, I was in this long distance relationship with a girl I met on twitter. 
We were the same age but she skipped a class. 
She was in her senior year and I was in junior, we talked a lot, met IRL then decided to start our ""relationship"". It was both our first relationship so we were kinda idealising it but we were not disappointed love was awesome and the distance wasn't bothering us. 

We lasted together for almost 3 years, yet we met like only 12 times over these years . Because I live in a Muslim family and my parents are really strict about going out, sleeping at friends house and female friends in general. So, to compensate we'd only meet during a day like I would take a train ticket to her city/region and we would spend the day together and I would come back the same day at night. 

We did this for almost 3 years.Later,  I think I developed an issue with my smartphone and started ghosting people. I had those phases were I'd ignore everyone without any particular reason. Even my GF, I lost a lot of friends because of it but my gf bore it and supported me even though we'd have arguments over my attitude. Which is more than comprehensible because we're a long distance couple. I tried to force myself to answer to people but it'd only lasts for weeks before I'd become a serial ghoster again. 
Fast forward to the end of her bachelor's degree she got rejected in every master she had applied to. She got really sad, and I was in the end of my associate degree so I was buried in exams and my ghosting issue didn't help at all. 
She felt abandoned and decided to take a ""break"". She had her points and I had no arguments to contest her choice I was the main source of her pain and she was totally right to dump me. 
First relationship means first break up and it was not easy at all. You know the usual speech about this. And, she told me she'd reconsider our relationship at the end of summer when we'd meet again. 
We met again, I spent the day with her and nothing came out of it. I built a large amount of hope over the summer and it got detroyed. 

September 2018 I decided to get my shit together and stopped talking to her, I was admitted in my engineering school and had other issues to think about. I kinda moved on but not exactly. 
Now, in November she was in my city and wanted to meet, we met and spent the day together, still nothing except a hug at the end of the day where she whispered in my ear : ""I love you""

It messed up with all the "" moving on"" stuff I had in mind and built. It brought me right back into that summer sadness. I blocked her and decided to not contact her again because she was now causing me more pain than ever. 
Fast forward to march 2019, she sent me a message again but she only shared memes and funny tweets with me. I kinda did the same because it was fun and I was expecting nothing from her now. 
But then she came to me with that : ""I miss you"" and ""I've been looking for the right moment to tell you that I still love you"" 

Thing is, it didn't make my heart budge by a centimeter. 
I told her that love was dead and if anything was bound to happen it would take a lot of time and may not yield any results in the end. She was okay with that. But now she's clearly hitting on me sending me pictures of her in sports bra asking for my advice, complimenting me everytime I post a picture etc.... And it's not like it's bothering me but I feel like I'm playing with their by giving her ""hope"" that the flame of love shall ignite again. 
While I'm not sure of it and I don't know if I really wan't it. 

What should I do : keep talking with her at the risk of disappointing her in the end or tell her the harsh truth and stop talking with her ? 



TL;DR : Long Distance gf broke up with me then came back, love is dead in my heart and she thinks she can fix this by hitting on me and trying to seduce me again. I don't want to get her hopes high and deceive her later what should I do ?

723,"Hello.. so this is really difficult for me to write so please bare with me. 

Two weeks ago my girlfriend and I plus 8 others went on a school trip to Utah. We volunteered at an animal sanctuary and visited some of the national parks there. It was very beautiful. While we were there, she seemed a bit off, not so talkative and not so happy, and when I asked her she told me it was her “best friend” (who she’s been having issues with) that was bothering her. I thought not too much of it and knew of this ongoing issue between them, but still tried to have fun with her and make her happy. 

We get back from the trip and the whole group met to discus making a slideshow to show off our trip. During this my girlfriend came to me asking how to fix something on her slide. I didn’t quite understand and as soon as I questioned what she was doing she left angrily saying never mind. 

She was supposed to come over that night. But she texts me saying she’s very upset. After hours of texting back and forth she explains that I have been rude to her and sassy with her. And that the way I’ve been talking to her hasn’t been the nicest and she feels attacked by my sarcasm a lot more now... 

She is at this point so upset about the way I’m talking to her that she wants to take a break. Which, as I will explain is completely counter intuitive to what she initially wanted a few weeks ago. 

A few weeks ago she was saying how she hasn’t felt as much love between us and wanted more flirty talk and compliments. I agreed and we moved on. I was thinking that was going well. And now we’re here and she’s saying she wants a break. Meaning no flirty stuff or any of what she was wanting more of!

After saying she needs a break she said she needs time to think about our relationship, and if she still wants to be with me. She doesn’t think I can change the way I’m acting towards her even though I’ve been telling her profusely I can and will. And to be fair, this matter has only come up once or twice before, she let this anger build up over the trip and she let it go when we got back.

Sorry guys, but a huge braindump here...

&amp;#x200B;

I met this amazing woman at work, she's 30(F) and I'm 20(M), however, our lives are pretty similar and we get along very well together. (Similar as in, we both moved from a different country, we both have high paying jobs, both own apartments)

Since I joined the company, we always clicked but it all started about a month ago.

We were always talking over text and about 2 months ago, she said 'we should hang out together'. So we picked some date but ended up rescheduling it.

We picked another date yet again, and on that day, she said that she couldn't go. I told her, just let me know when you are free and we will make something happen.

Unfortunately, we never ended up going on that date.

However 2 weeks ago, things really started happening.

We had a karaoke party and sang a love song together (we sang it before and it had always been 'our' song). Before she left that party, she told me 'kiss me'. So I started making out with her, she stopped me and told me 'Not like that, just a peck on the lips'.

Then she left, but 5 minutes later I got a message saying 'Text me now' when I checked my text messages, she'd sent me 'You're amazing' and not much later she wrote 'let's hang out with my friends tomorrow'.

Fast forward to the next day, we hung out together with her friends. I asked her 'You wanna hang out sometime, together?', but she wasn't into it.

I spent some time with her in her apartment (and funnily enough doing some art project). Afterward, we had a party with her friends, that night we basically spent the whole night hugging and holding each other.

On that night I just straight up asked her what that kiss meant to her. She said it was just as friends, however, 15 minutes later, she told me that the way I was holding her was hot and she liked it.

The same night she also said that she had a crush on some girl, which made me even more confused.

Since then we've been talking almost every day, every time we are together (at a party) we dance and hold each other.

Last weekend we had another party, she started sending me heart and kiss emojis and renamed me on her phone to '\[My name\] Love'.

That night we kissed again, not making out, just a kiss on the lips. I also realized that when she wanted to kiss, we kissed. but when I leaned in, she wasn't interested...

At this party, she also just straight up said 'I love you'.

Anyway, before we left the party we ended up hugging for a long time and kissed on the cheek as always. I tried to hint at her that we could still stay together longer, but again no luck.

Since this last weekend, we've been texting heart emojis back and forward, we have a lot of inside jokes and share music together.

For example, sending jokes back and forward, I sent her something and she responds with 'I love you for sending this'.

Also, we both have a different mother tongue but speak English together at a native level. She recently started writing small things in my native language.

Over the last weeks she keeps telling me, 'You're my knight, you are amazing, you are awesome, you are so friendly, you're a real man'.

The thing is, I realized that throughout this whole thing, I've tried to set up a date, -or even just small things- like getting coffee in the office at the same time, and she is never really that interested.

For example, we wanted to meet at some central point in our office building and she told me, 'yeah, but only if we hold hands'. And then later she had some excuses why she couldn't go.

It's only when she wants to do something... I don't know if I'm being used, or if she's just playing hard to get...

This is the first time in a really long time that I actually feel something this strong for someone.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Met this woman at work, been flirting back and forth of a month. But she's never interested when I suggest doing something. She's giving mixed signals and I don't know if I'm being used or if she is just playing hard to get.",10Jun2019,1
727,"Alright, so I found a post on /r/AmItheAsshole the other day with a person who was in a very similar situation as mine and I just really need some advice before I do anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

   Long story short I stumbled upon my friend's reddit-account where she regularly posts NSFW-content of herself and she does a really shitty job at hiding her identity, it's very easy to realise who she is even though she doesn't post her whole face. Now I'm just conflicted with what to do. I'm concerned for her, not only because it could be embarrassing if someone finds out (I don't know, maybe the thrill is the fun part of it for her), but that she includes landmarks and stuff in the background of some photos - which makes it \*very\* easy for some random person to pinpoint her apartment. However, I don't want to ""shame"" her in any way to make her refrain from living out her kinks or whatever, and from a self-centred view it could really backfire on me since she'll know that I've seen the pics and hurt our relationship. She's also already quite insecure, so this could be really hard on her. But at the same time I'm really worried about her security.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a 50 on my English exam. All we had to do was write an OUTLINE for an essay. 1 intro paragraph, 3 body paragraphs, that's all. Not even a conclusion paragraph. We had to use some format (this is important) with 3 claims per body paragraph and a bunch of different shit backing up and sprinkled in between said claims.  We had done this in an essay before, about two months prior. I did not remember above format. I write the following in the margin of my exam (stay with me here) - for each body paragraph: **1** position statement, **1** claim, **1** supporting data, **1** warrant statement, **1** closing statement. I ask her if this is the correct format, she says yes. Ok cool. Skrt skrt finished the exam. I thought I had done fine on it. Get the report card in the mail, 50%, the lowest grade even possible. I was pretty shocked. Email my teacher, thinking there's some sort of mistake or she's trying to get back at me with grades (I was a bit of a class clown that she didn't always appreciate). Nope. She says I had only done 1 claim per body paragraph. Yeah, I did do that. She says I'm supposed to have 3 and basically that I only did a third of what I was supposed to. Wtf bro. She had confirmed the stuff on my paper. At the same time I do not have a way of proving that she confirmed the stuff on my paper. I also feel like I should've remembered the format since we had used it before. However, I feel that I cannot even blame myself for this because she told me the wrong thing. Yet I also can't blame her for it because we had literally done the same thing before. I'm a straight A student, never gotten a B. I don't even want to brag, the only reason I'm saying so is for context. This exam grade brought me down to a B in the semester. If I was just a dumb ass and had failed because I had just straight up done it wrong I wouldn't even care. But because of these murky circumstances I don't know if I should fight for a better grade or something. Or should I just suck it up and take it like a man. Pls offer some of your golden nuggets of wisdom for your boi. Also be straight up ab it because these comments will not make me cry at night I promise.

731,"I was thinking about the idea of having a place for people to go to just to hang out and have activities available to people to use. Of course it'd be set up like sort of a free community building but in order to make sure rules are set so nobody looking to cause trouble comes along it would be sort of private or a member fee. Am I thinking of more of a club or something else?

My idea was to have a fairly opened sized building. One huge area with different sections that would have video games, pool tables etc. The kicker is lets say people who upgrade to lets say like a high membership can set up in a small area like an office or square area of the floor and bring in their set up. They bring in their computer desk and other equipment and just hang out and play with friends or by themselves. This would be cool for streamers to have people hang out with them while they play games. For better security the high members would have locked rooms.

and of course for insurance obviously some kind of waiver would be signed and some security of course like security cameras for assets that could possibly be stolen. Or 24/7 security with revolving shifts.

It'd be hard to make it fair to have it both free to public but also at the same time include the benefits of being a member. There would have to be reasons to want to be pay to come. Maybe like discounts of upcoming games or something or prizes.

It's kind of like what Braille skateboarding does with their skate-warehouse but more casual and just a place to hangout.

732,"HI all!   


New to the sub! Just need some advice as to how I can better handle our living situation. My Fiance (35M) and Me (30F) each have a kid from a separate relationship, we rent a house that his mom who is physically disabled and his younger sister share a room in. That is 6 people living in one 4 bedroom house. We also have a dog, a cat, a snake and a fish. The pets are not anything to worry about even though they are an extra expense. He has been living with them since before I met him and that was four years ago. They are an instrumental help with our kids and do help keep the house tidy and things of that nature, but the problem we're running into is that we're supporting 4 adults and two kids (one of which is about to turn 13 and is a boy) on two salaries and combined we only make approximately $50,000 annually. We are constantly having to ask for extensions on bills and I have several payday loans that we're paying back just to make ends meet. We also utilize the food pantry's around us as well as any additional help from friends and family as they can help us. I am really tired of having to ask for help. I'm tired of not being able to breathe financially. I just want to be able to be able to know that without a doubt we'll be okay until pay day rolls around. My question is, how do I get us out of this situation? I knew that this was the situation when we moved in together originally, but truthfully neither one of us thought it would last this long. His sister that lives with us just turned 21 in May and doesn't have a full education, has never had a job (other than baby sitting her nieces and nephews) and has a strong desire to do all of that, but is being suppressed by her disabled mom. My fiance and I both have spoken out about this and we always get the same ""line:"" ""She's working on studying for her GED"" It's mildly infuriating to not be able to do anything about this. I am very careful about not hurting anyone's feelings otherwise I would tell them they needed to find somewhere else to go. The only problem with that is, realistically talking, they have nowhere else to go other than a shelter and I can't do that to family. Right now we are two months behind with our water bill and are trying to get caught back up on that, but are having a substantially hard time because of other bills that we have piled up.

(Please note this is my first post in reddit ever, so if I put this in the wrong place please tell me! Thank you!)

Alright straight to the point, I HATE my job. As a college student, I thought I'd lucked out getting a retail job for this company (a world wide and pretty expensive cosmetics company). The job was nothing special, just your basic helping people find their stuff, cashiering, stocking, and the likes. Or at least I thought it was.

So everything was going really well, I even got a ""promotion"" and was able to take on more responsibility, which I enjoyed. I was constantly asking what I could do to improve, what I needed to work on, or if my manager needed any help with anything. Everything was fine until I had to request time off in order to complete my last semester at college before I could move onto a University. Trying to finish off classes is normally hard enough, but during this time my parents were always fighting and seriously considering getting a divorce. Add on top of that the fact I can only go to college if I keep my grades up, as I rely only on scholarships. You could say I was just a *little* stressed out at the time. Scheduling for this place has always been bad. The manager would make it one week in advance, your never allowed to switch shifts with someone else, and in order to get time off you have to request it a month in advance. So anyways, I told my acting manager (he's actually the assistant, but because the stores real manager broke her leg and couldn't work for a long time, we as the staff filled out a survey which got him temporarily promoted) about everything that was going on with school. It should be noted that while I didn't love the manager (I actually thought he was and still is super child-ish. He refuses to take any criticism, is rude, and is super 'car sales man' like to the costumers), the two of us had a pretty good relationship. At this point, we'd only really only had a one on one when I expressed how much I hated the new sales tactic we were using (basically continuously bothering costumers in every section of the store, even if they asked us to go away).

So I tell him the issues with needing more time for school and he assures me he will do everything he can. Next schedule comes out and guess what? I'm scheduled for MORE hours! I was pissed, we had another meeting where he tried to tell me ""I did do everything I could, this is less hours, I don't know what you want me to do. Besides, you only go to school four days a week, you should have plenty of time to work here."" I had to explain to this man how even though I go to school four days a week, the work load required for my classes was that of a full time job. So even though it seemed like I had all the time in the world, in reality I was spending hours upon hours a day trying to figure out homework and getting tutored. Eventually, my manager said he understood and agreed to let me give up one of my shifts. I was still pissed, but I eventually was able to graduate so my availability became free again.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago. So, our real manager finally got cleared to come back to the store, and within about two weeks of being back she pulls me into a meeting with the supervisor I'd been working with thanks to my promotion. They tell me I'm basically de-promoted because of my availability and because the old manager (now the assistant manager or AM) and my supervisor thought it was taking away my commitment on the sales floor. She also told me the amount of time I had taken off because I was sick or for family emergencies was unacceptable and if I missed another shift I'd be fired. I was in shock. That promotion was everything to me, and to make matters worse my supervisor in that position told me they were still ""so thankful for all the work I did and the new organizational systems I had created. In fact, there so great will still be using them."" I'm sure they meant well by saying this, but all I could here was ""thanks for fixing everything, but you're useless now so bye!"" On top of that, I even checked with both my supervisor and AM if my availability would affect my promotion, and they both assured me as soon as my hours became open again I could go right back too it. I ended up having to be sent home that day because I had a break down.

At this point I just don't know what to do. I am so upset about the fact they took away my position (I was able to work behind the scenes more and was insured longer hours). Honestly, what makes everything so much worse was that I never heard anything but positivity in that position. They never told me I was doing anything wrong, and never gave me things to improve on. At this point, I know I worst case scenario I will need this job until the summer ends. Its only a couple of month but with how much I hate this place it might as well be a century. Does anyone have any advice? Should I just try to keep my head down and push through it or should I try to find another job?",10Jun2019,1
734,"Okay so I am 18 years old, I have just finished exams and waiting for the results. After that I plan on going to university which is pretty good. Now for awhile I have been arguing with my mom about getting a job (part-time) and wanting to earn money, I said I would pay rent and be responsible with the money etc. 

However my mom says that any extra money coming into the house will come out of her pocket cause she is on benefits and that it will affect them badly. My mom is on universal credit and a few benefits relating to disability (I won’t go into detail) and I think some child care benefits however I don’t know if that applies anymore. 

The thing is I am an understandable person however she doesn’t go into context exactly how she will be losing out on money and says not to talk about it. I make arguments about how I can pay rent and surely cover the benefit money lost however she says I won’t and will not explain why. I keep asking her for specifics but all she keeps saying is any money coming into the house affects her benefits and money will be lost.

I’ve talked to my older brother to help me out and he says this is the reason he moved out of the house cause he couldn’t get a job. He tried convincing her however it went down the same road as my argument did. She is fed up now and I can’t even negotiate at all now. I tried to research the whole benefits and universal credit thing and I don’t see much about losing money unless you work a certain amount of hours. I was wondering if it had to be anything to do with council tax.

I could really use advice on what to do cause not only does the whole benefit thing confuse me but my mom won’t properly explain why I can’t. All I want is a proper answer and if it is true that I can’t cover the benefit money then fair enough, I won’t get a job.

736,"TLDR- I just started a new job as an office manager.  Saturday was my first day completely alone in the office.  I promised a client I would send out his order that day but I didn't get a chance to actually do this, and I'm not allowed to stay late.  Tomorrow I go back into the office and I'm not sure if I should just be honest with my client or make up something flowery to look professional.  

&amp;#x200B;

Full story:

I'm really stressed out about my new job.  A week ago I was hired to be an office manager.  It's my first time being a manager, and I'm finally making enough money to start saving!  So I'm giving this my 110% because I really like my job.  But I'm falling behind in my work and it's starting to break my confidence.  The office is a locally owned business, so it's only got 2 workers plus the owner.   Basically I was trained to take over for the previous manager, and the owner is hiring an assistant for me.  So three days into my training and both workers leave.  It's just me and the owner.  He's been very understanding and nice about my long list of questions because there's no manual and barely any protocols for this job.  So I'm always asking questions (even if it seems like an obvious answer just because I hate assuming).  And of course, I'm new so I'm working slowly to make sure I don't miss anything important.  I'm beginning to realize I can't do the work of two experienced office workers.  But as someone who really wants to excel here, I feel bad that my work load is piling up.  At the beginning of the day I read all correspondence and set a ""To-do"" list for the day but I'm finding it's getting harder and harder to actually complete my daily lists.  Because of this, I can't tell when projects will be done or set expectations with the clients when their orders will be complete/sent out.  I'd be happy to stay late but since I'm hourly the owner is telling me to leave on time.  Saturday was my first day completely alone in the office.  I was corresponding with a client who asked if I could just mail them their order instead of having to pick it up in person.  There's no protocol on this, but it seemed easy enough so I accepted and said I'd send it out that day.  Except my workload just got ahead of me, and my boss told me to go home (it was an hour past my clock-out time).  Once I got home I realized I never sent out his order, and the office didn't open again until Tuesday.  I have the key to the office, but sneaking in made me feel anxious so I decided against it.  Tomorrow I have to update the client.  I plan on going in early to actually finish/mail out the order.  I just don't know whether to tell him the truth about the delay or make up something flowery to maintain professionalism.

Problem 1: I so far have found about every single reason that I could come up with to blame myself for why I ended up being a victim to emotional and verbal abuse despite this being online. Still all hurt like a motherf*cker.
1) could've stepped out of the friendship as soon as I noticed that she treated me worse than before
2) could've confronted her about it and left once she didn't change it, or when I noticed she didn't change it at all
3) left when my mom and sister told me to years ago
And so on.

Problem 2: during this friendship, I lost about every other online contact that I had, and considering that I have aspergers/autism, reconnecting with people is difficult, that beside the next problem. I have no idea of how to get back in touch with others on the new platform I'm on despite feeling so incredibly miserable and lonely all the time which is making me even more unhappy.

Problem 3: I'm super insecure with about everything I could think of. Due to the mental health decline I've suffered, I noticed that I was having even more trouble with some kind of eating problem I have(cravings for things, difficult to control and often don't stop if I give in to them, so I'd be binging food until I would either be nauseous from the weird food combinations or I could get my anxiety to kick in and make me stop because I'd be afraid of having people notice food being gone), meaning that my self esteem, regarding both my personality and body, have dropped below zero. I can't even maintain a normal conversation with some new people without being super anxious about whether or not they like me, find me boring, find that I'm weird or acting abnormally(as I've been alienated quite a bit due to my autism and have had numerous accusations of doing things because of it), etc.

I simply don't know how to deal with anything anymore. The loneliness is driving me insane. I have no way of coping with this, causing my stimming to get worse which has already caused tendon inflammation in my shoulder. I have cried plenty of times, just because I hate how crippled I've become, how stupid I was for being the way I am because that lead to my abusive friend abandoning me because I was 'toxic and manipulative' even though I know it's better that she's gone now. I've been trying to not relapse on self mutilation for the past couple of days now. But life seems to become more and more unbearable by the day. I have no clue how I'll survive the summer break. I have no clue how I'll stay sane at all whenever I'm physically alone because that's when I feel even more alone.

Any advice on how to deal with any of this?",10Jun2019,2
760,"I’m 17 and I’ve never had a job. I’ve recently been considering getting a part time job, but I’m really not sure that I can handle it.

761,"This sounds crazy but here me out, I don’t know what to do.

Some background: my parents are from Pakistan, we moved to Canada and we’ve been here for 16 years.

Three years ago a man his wife and two daughters moved to my city, they go to our mosque, as soon as we met them we got bad vibes, and we try to avoid them, recently we went to a community dinner and we saw him there.


He was talking about how much money he has, how he gets expensive clothes and how he’s rich. Here’s where it gets weird.

He was talking about how he wants Pakistan and Karachi, (a place in Pakistan) to separate.

He was saying stuff against Pakistan and saying how he wants to divide it, after he showed my dad emails saying he “helped” with sending boats from the us army to Iran.

It was very strange.

He says he works in “business” but no one knows what his real job is.

Here is where it gets really weird.

My freinds did research and we found he travels to Pakistan every two months.

Also found that he uses different names on his Facebook account.

On his Facebook account we found out he works for a company that is for the India government.

I find it strange that he has two names.

Can anyone please help, this is freaking my family out and I need awnsers, anyone know what’s up with this guy??",10Jun2019,0

Regretfully, I had a little too much fun and I didn’t really apply myself during school and ended up with an HR job (not a bad thing, just not necessarily my thing) that I strongly dislike after 2 years. I haven’t left yet because I’ve got pretty bad anxiety and the whole looking for a job thing is difficult to keep up. I’m still living at home and the situation is very unfavorable, and I really don’t get along with my mom. It’s taken quite a toll on me but I can’t move out yet because my loans are just too much and I wouldn’t be able to balance that and rent.

763,"I started working with this agency last August. It's seasonal work, so I only work 6 months of the year. I was only a casual last season so I hardly worked. When I did work, I worked hard to try to make a good impression, and it worked because I've been offered a full time (seasonal) position this year.

I've also got an application in process with a similar agency, doing the same job but it's not seasonal, I'd be employed all year round. It's taken 5 months for them to do anything with my application and I still don't know if I'm being offered the job.

Having full time employment would be great, but I feel like I'd be letting my current employer down. They gave me a job when no one else would, a co-worker was in the bosses ear about me convincing him to hire me, I've already been offered full time with them, and the seasonal nature ties in well with what I want to be doing, but it's going to be very difficult to get where I want to be.

By taking the full time job, I'd be accepting that I'll never get to where I want to be, but it's also difficult to get this job, they rarely have openings.

764,"I’m 16 years old, sophomore in high school and I’m at the point in my life where I’m trying to find out what I want to do for the rest of my life. I have two main roads I wanna go down. Option 1 is for me to take over my fathers roofing company. My family comes from 5 generations of roofers and I would be the 6th. I’ve been roofing since I was 10 and I’ve always enjoyed it. It pays good and it keeps you in shape. Option 2 is for me to go into the military, most likely the marines. Most likely for 4 years or such and then take over my fathers roofing company. I’ve always been fascinated by soldiers and I’ve always wanted to serve my country. I’ve felt like if I’m an old man and I look back in my life and I hadn’t served in the military, I would regret it. 
Now the reason I don’t just pick option 2 is because if I took over my fathers company right out of high school, I’d be able to have a stable life and a house by the time I’m 22. Also I don’t know what could happen when I’m in the military. I’m not really afraid of dying just more so afraid of becoming really injured and not being able to work or take over my fathers roofing business. I wouldn’t want to have to leach off of my family for the rest of my life, I think if that were to happen I would honestly commit suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

I need some advice from all you people. Here is my situation. Back in early December of last year my older brother has moved in because of his current mental state. He suffers from depression. While he was moved out, he was also with his twin brother. My older smoked pot and basically trashed his room and smoked a lot of pot. My parents moved him back in \], I knew this was a bad idea from the beginning. The number one rule for him is that he can't smoke pot at all. I was not surprised that he still smokes pot. Now this is where it gets difficult, my mother currently knows that he does smoke pot but she never tells my dad. If my dad ever did find out this, he would be kicked out of the house immediately. My problem is if I should tell my dad. I feel like like I would cause a lot of chaos in my house and I don't know what to do. Thanks for the help Reddit!",10Jun2019,1

775,"Hi Reddit. I'm worried that my brother has depression and doesn't know how to talk about it. He is in his 30s and is a very private person so I never really know what is going on his head. My mom has dealt with anxiety and depression, altought I didn't know this until I started having anxiety attacks a few years ago and talked to her about it, so it definitely runs in the family.  He lives alone and doesn't date that I know of (though he wouldn't tell us if he did). He has a couple friends from high school that he'll hang out with occasionally, but it sounds like his whole life is just going to work and sitting at home by himself. I'm very introverted and socially anxious, and believe this is also the case for him. He's also lost a lot of weight recently, and though he says he's been on a diet I worry he's just not eating alot. We try to have family gatherings often as we and my parents live close, but he usually seems just generally down and quiet. But he does usually accept most invitations when we hang out as a family. Im just not really sure how to even go about finding out if he has depression/anxiety or if I'm just projecting that (he has never said anything about it, other than he was unhappy and stressed at his previous job, which he recently left). We don't have a lot in common and generally just stick to small talk, but maybe he needs to know it's okay to reach out if he needs help. Or maybe he is happy with his life and is just a more private person than me, in which case I don't want to assume he needs help and make him self concious or offended. My parents also worry about him but he won't open up much to them either. Thanks for any advice!",10Jun2019,2

779,"I need some advice, badly. 

My brother (23) lives with our great-grandparents (mid-80s). We live in California. He treats them terribly but I think it's gotten to the point of abuse. He's been with them for three years and refuses to leave. 

He got a dog over a year and a half ago. The dog is a lab-pitbull mix and is huge. Great-grandma is forced to walk and feed him, along with pay for food. She has to keep the dog entertained throughout the day and pay for dog's medicine. Brother refuses to take care of dog at all at this point. Grandma broke her leg months ago so has stopped walking dog on leash as he pulls and has caused grandma to hurt herself from falling before. The dog is untrained and doesn't listen, runs off, and is creating a risk of eviction from the apartment complex. 

Brother works about 8 hours a week at most. He does not pay rent, does not buy groceries, doesn't even pay for his car's gas. All this is paid for by grandmother who has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to but feels obligated because he ""can't take care of himself."" He buys crap online and fills the guest room where he's staying with junk. He quits jobs a month in, then goes months unemployed. If he needs food, gas, or clothes (which he has dressers, plural, full of), he finds grandmother and makes her fork out the money for it. He does not pay her back. 

My mom does not want to take him in. He is incredibly aggressive and has, on multiple occasions, threatened family members with violence. He has threatened me with weapons (at knife-point) because I ""took too long of a shower"". I have called the police on him. They have not done anything. 

Grandpa has dementia and cancer, and grandparents are struggling financially because of him. He leaves lights and game consoles on while he leaves for the weekend. He makes grandma clean up his room, wash his dishes, clean/fold/put away his clothes. She has had to scrub the bathroom after mold grows. If someone stays over, they have to keep their things with them or he will throw them away/take them. 

He has moved a friend of his into the house with him. The friend does not clean up, contribute, or pay rent. 

He has anger issues and yells/cusses at everyone if things aren't done his way. Threats of violence are constant. He plays music loudly and stays up late playing games and yelling. Grandpa is very stressed about it and paces in a panic. 

Multiple family members have told him to move out, including great-grandmother. He has stated ""I don't need to, no thanks."" He refuses to take up offers for people to help pay for a studio apartment for him. Family members have found places for him. He yells at anyone who mentions this. 

He was kicked out of the military because of his dangerous demeanor. 

He smokes in the no-smoke apartment. He brings people in and out at crazy hours. He drinks tons of alcohol. He has mental issues and is ""special ed"" as they called him in school. He has ADHD, but there are undiagnosed issues for sure. He refuses to see a doctor. 

Family members are getting together later this month to try and convince him to move. Great-grandparents are going to have to move to a nursing home due to mental and physical health, and obviously he can't do with them. He is adamant about living with them until they die. 

I ended up homeless and lived with them for a time, forced to stay in a closet because he has the guest room and back room attached to it. He took my things and threw them away. I cleaned up after myself, did my dishes, bought my own food. I ended up living on the streets due to safety concerns. 

My family believes he is holding my grandparents hostage. He is sucking their finances and scares them. He will NOT listen to anyone. 

I'm so scared for my grandparents. He is dangerous and abusive and no one in our family knows what to do...any advice is so welcome, we're at the end of our rope.",10Jun2019,78

Anyway, we started snapchatting back and forth, and I started flirting with him and trying to turn the conversation sexual. It's not like we are ever going to meet in real life. Just have a little fun. I asked if he was ok with it, and he kept saying his family was around and such. 

Still I'm a little devious. So I sent him some pictures. He didn't say much -- just ""wow"" and ""thanks for giving me an awkward boner in front of my family"" but that was it!

787,I am so fucking sick of my life and I wish it would end. I have trouble forgiving myself for a decision I made in the summer before my senior year. I had a girl that liked me and I honestly kind of wanted to date her but I decided not to because she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't want to get my heart broken. I was also to focused on my business and making money. Instead that month she decided to date my best friend and break his heart a month later. She then dated another guy in August and broke his heart but in September she found the person she was going to date the whole school year. Honestly I have been extremely down on myself for not making a move at some point. After realizing 2 months ago high school is ending huge regret has set in for not dating her. Every time I see would see them in the halls or at any school event I just think that could have been us. I just think I ruined my senior year which I had high expectation for. There were some good moments but I run a business and started working out and that ate up almost all of my time. I never sat down and thought about what I did. I will now always remember high school as a bad night watching her dance with the guy she is dating instead of me. I just feel like a complete failure. I have never had a girlfriend before and I am just afraid I will never find another girl like her or even worse never get the chance to ever date her. Everyone says there will be another girl but honestly I am to ugly and to weird to find someone as beautiful and sweet as her. I wake up everyday with a headache wishing I could turn back time and can barely look at myself in the mirror for destroying an opportunity that could have made me so happy. I really am just sick of life and wish somehow it would be over. I feel like I made the stupidest decision and no one else in my shoes would do something that dumb. I don’t think there is a girl like her who will ever have the connection I feel when I am with her. My life up to this point has just been painful.

He then says that he won't be able to talk to her because of her heavy accent, but its clear he is only attracted to their looks.

Not sure if this is related but he is very interested in learning about Japanese culture, he's even interested in learning speaking Japanese. I don't think thats wrong, since he is just appreciating the culture but when he constantly talks about attractive asian girls he meets it makes me wonder if he has an Asian fetish.",10Jun2019,3
798,Basically everything in the title. I’m pretty...fragile at the moment. I’m just wondering what the best job is for a 21 year old introvert who’s still figuring stuff out and really just needs to be independent.,10Jun2019,1
799,"I'm not drooling over someone and I'm not being a problematic member of society, to clear things up but, I've encountered people that I've found extremely mesmerising, to the point where I concentrate hardly on anything else when near them and it's highly distracting and disrespectful when we have a conversation. Are there some easy ways to remember that we're humans and not a more primitive species and that I should keep it cool? Thanks!",10Jun2019,1
800,"I've searched everywhere I could think of to find it and I think it's time to consider it gone. I don't know where to begin on getting the things I lost. I lost my drivers' license my cards, around 20 dollars, my EBT card, various gift cards, and (I know I shouldn't have been keeping it in there, but) my Social Security Card. I have next to no money rn, but I get paid in a few days so I'll be fine. I have no mailbox at my house and no P.O Box. How do I go about getting my Drivers' license replaced and my ssc replaced without all that information.",10Jun2019,1
